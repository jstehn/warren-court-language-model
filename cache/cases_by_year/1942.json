States Supreme Court\nADAMS v. U. S. EX REL. MCCANN(1942)\nNo. 79\nArgued: Decided: December 21, 1942\n\n\n\n As Amended on Denial of Rehearing Jan. 18, 1943\n\n\n Mr. Chas. Fahy, Sol. Gen., for petitioners.\n Mr. Robert G. Page, of New York City, for respondent. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 269, 270]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a review of an order by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit discharging the relator McCann from custody. We accept as facts, as did the court below, those set forth in the untraversed return to the writ of habeas corpus in that court.\n McCann was indicted on six counts for using the mails to defraud, in violation of Section 215 of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.  338, 18 U.S.C.A .  338. From the time of his arraignment on February 18, 1941, to the prosecution of his appeal in the court below, McCann insisted on conducting his case without the assistance of a lawyer. When called upon to plead to the indictment, he refused to do so; a plea of not guilty was entered on his behalf. The district court at that time advised McCann to retain counsel. He refused, however, 'stating in substance that he desired to represent himself, that the case was very complicated, and that he was so familiar with its details that no attorney would be able to give him as competent representation as he would be able to give himself'.\n When the case came on for trial on July 7, 1941, McCann repeated, in reply to the judge's inquiry whether he had counsel, that he wished to represent himself. In response to the court's further inquiry whether he was admitted to the bar, McCann 'replied that he was not, but that he had studied law, and was sufficiently familiar therewith adequately to defend himself, and was more familiar with the complicated facts of his case than any attorney could ever be.' \n1\n McCann 'then moved to have \n\n[317 \nU.S. 269, 271]\n\u00a0\n the case tried without a jury by the judge alone. There was a brief discussion between the Court, the petitioner, and the Assistant United States Attorney', after which McCann submitted the following over his signature: 'I, Gene McCann, the defendant herein, appearing personally, do hereby waive a trial by jury in the above entitled case, having been advised by the Court of my constitutional rights.' The Assistant United States Attorney consented, and the judge (one of long trial experience and tested solicitude for the civilized administration of criminal justice) entered an order approving this 'waiver'.\n The trial then got under way. It lasted for two weeks and a half, and throughout the entire proceedings McCann represented himself. He was convicted on July 22, 1941, and was sentenced to imprisonment for six years and to pay a fine of $600. He took an appeal, and the trial judge fixed bail at $10,000. Being unable to procure this sum, he remained in custody. Then followed applications to the Circuit Court of Appeals, likewise pressed by McCann himself, for extending the time for filing a bill of exceptions. In these proceedings both the trial and appellate courts again suggested to McCann the advisability of being represented by counsel. After having personally made these numerous applications, McCann finally secured the assistance of an attorney. The latter applied to the Circuit Court of Appeals for reduction of bail. It was so reduced. But at the same time the court suggested that McCann take out a writ of habeas corpus, returnable to the court, to raise the question whether, in the circumstances of the case, 'the judge had jurisdiction to try him'.\n As is pointed out in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals (126 F.2d 774, 775), 'At no time did he (McCann) indicate that \n\n[317 \nU.S. 269, 272]\n\u00a0\n he wished a jury or that he repented of his consent-either while the cause was in the district court or in this court-until the attorney, who now represents him, in March, 1942, raised the point' at the court's invitation. The 'point' thus projected into the case by the Circuit Court of Appeals was presented, in its own words, 'in the barest possible form; Has an accused, who is without counsel, the power at his own instance to surrender his right of trial by jury when indicted for felony?'2 The Circuit Court of Appeals, with one judge dissenting, answered this question in the negative. It held that no person accused of a felony-who is himself not a lawyer-can waive trial by a jury, no matter how capable he is of making an intelligent, informed choice and how strenuously he insists upon such a choice, unless he does so upon the advice of an attorney. 2 Cir., 126 F.2d 774. The obvious importance of this question to the administration of criminal justice in the federal courts led us to bring the case here. \n316 \nU.S. 655\n, 62 S.Ct. 1048.\n A jurisdictional obstacle to a consideration of this issue is pressed before us. It is urged that the Circuit Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to issue the writ of habeas corpus in this case. The discussion of this question took an extended range in the arguments at the bar, but in the circumstances of this case the matter lies within a narrow compass. Uninterruptedly from the first Judiciary Act (Section 14 of the Act of September 24, 1789, 1 Stat. 73, 81), to the present day (Section 262 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  377, 28 U.S.C.A.  377), the courts of the United States have had powers of an auxiliary nature 'to issue all writs not specifically provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the \n\n[317 \nU.S. 269, 273]\n\u00a0\n exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the usages and principles of law'. In Whitney v. Dick, \n202 \nU.S. 132\n, 26 S.Ct. 584, this Court held that where no proceeding of an appellate character is pending in a circuit court of appeals, the authority to issue auxiliary writs does not come into operation. A circuit court of appeals cannot issue the writ of habeas corpus as 'an independent and original proceeding challenging in toto the validity of a judgment rendered in another court'. But the Court also recognized that there was power to issue the writ 'where it may be necessary for the exercise of a jurisdiction already existing'. 202 U.S. at pages 136, 137, 26 S.Ct. at page 586. In the case at bar a proceeding of an appellate character was pending in the Circuit Court of Appeals, for McCann had already filed an appeal from the judgment of conviction. There was, therefore, 'a jurisdiction already existing' in the Circuit Court of Appeals. But could the issuance of the writ be deemed 'necessary for the exercise' of that jurisdiction?\n Procedural instruments are means for achieving the rational ends of law. A circuit court of appeals is not limited to issuing a writ of habeas corpus only when it finds that it is 'necessary' in the sense that the court could not otherwise physically discharge its appellate duties. Unless appropriately confined by Congress, a federal court may avail itself of all auxiliary writs as aids in the performance of its duties, when the use of such historic aids is calculated in its sound judgment to achieve the ends of justice entrusted to it. Undoubtedly therefore, the Circuit Court of Appeals had 'jurisdiction', in the sense that it had the power, to issue the writ as an incident to the appeal then pending before it. The real question is whether the Circuit Court of Appeals abused its power in exercising that jurisdiction in the situation that confronted it. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 269, 274]\n\u00a0\n Of course the writ of habeas corpus should not do service for an appeal. Glasgow v. Moyer, \n225 \nU.S. 420, 428\n, 32 S.Ct. 753, 755; Matter of Gregory, \n219 \nU.S. 210, 213\n, 31 S.Ct. 143. This rule must be strictly observed if orderly appellate procedure is to be maintained. Mere convenience cannot justify use of the writ as a substitute for an appeal. But dry formalism should not sterilize procedural resources which Congress has made available to the federal courts. In exceptional cases where, because of special circumstances, its use as an aid to an appeal over which the court has jurisdiction may fairly be said to be reasonably necessary in the interest of justice, the writ of habeas corpus is available to a circuit court of appeals.\n The circumstances that moved the court below to the exercise of its jurisdiction were the peculiar difficulties involved in preparing a bill of exceptions. The stenographic minutes had never been typed. The relator claimed that he was without funds. Since he was unable to raise the bail fixed by the trial judge, he had been in custody since sentence and therefore had no opportunity to prepare a bill of exceptions. The court doubted 'whether any (bill) can ever be made up on which the appeal can be heard. ... In the particular circumstances of the case at bar, it seems to us that the writ is 'necessary to the complete exercise' of our appellate jurisdiction because ... there is a danger that it cannot be otherwise exercised at all and a certainty that it must in any event be a good deal hampered'.\n The court below recognized, however, that a bill of exceptions might be prepared which would be confined to the single point raised by the writ of habeas corpus. This is the basis for the contention that the writ of habeas corpus in this case performs the function of an appeal. But inasmuch as McCann was urging a number of grounds for the reversal of his conviction, including the sufficiency of the evidence, the Circuit Court of Appeals was justified \n\n[317 \nU.S. 269, 275]\n\u00a0\n in concluding that it would not be fair to make him stake his whole appeal on the single point raised by this writ. We cannot say that the court was unreasonable in the view it took of the situation with which it was presented and with which it was more familiar than the printed record alone can reveal. The writ of habeas corpus was not a substitute for the pending appeal, and was therefore not improvidently entertained by the court below.\n This brings us to the merits. They are controlled in principle by Patton v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 276\n, 50 S.Ct. 253, 70 A.L. R. 263, and Johnson v. Zerbst, \n304 \nU.S. 458\n, 58 S.Ct. 1019. The short of the matter is that an accused, in the exercise of a free and intelligent choice, and with the considered approval of the court, may waive trial by jury, and so likewise may he competently and intelligently waive his Constitutional right to assistance of counsel. There is nothing in the Constitution to prevent an accused from choosing to have his fate tried before a judge without a jury even though, in deciding what is best for himself, he follows the guidance of his own wisdom and not that of a lawyer. In taking a contrary view, the court below appears to have been largely influenced by the radiations of this Court's opinion in Glasser v. United States, \n315 \nU.S. 60\n, 62 S.Ct. 457. But Patton v. United States, supra, and Johnson v. Zerbst, supra, were left wholly unimpaired by the ruling in the Glasser case.\n Certain safeguards are essential to criminal justice. The court must be uncoerced, Moore v. Dempsey, \n261 \nU.S. 86\n, 43 S.Ct. 265, and it must have no interest other than the pursuit of justice, Tumey v. Ohio, \n273 \nU.S. 510\n, 47 S.Ct. 437, 50 A.L.R. 1243. The accused must have ample opportunity to meet the case of the prosecution. To that end, the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution abolished the rigors of the common law by affording one charged with crime the assistance of counsel for his defense, Johnson v. Zerbst, \n304 \nU.S. 458\n, 58 S.Ct. 1019. Such assistance 'in the particular situation' of 'ignorant de- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 269, 276]\n\u00a0\n fendants in a capital case' led to recognition that 'the benefit of counsel was essential to the substance of a hearing', as guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, in criminal prosecutions in the state courts. Palko v. Connecticut, \n302 \nU.S. 319, 327\n, 58 S.Ct. 149, 152, 153. Compare Powell v. Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45\n, 53 S.Ct. 55, 84 A.L.R. 527, and Betts v. Brady, \n316 \nU.S. 455\n, 62 S.Ct. 1252. The relation of trial by jury to civil rights- especially in criminal cases-is fully revealed by the history which gave rise to the provisions of the Constitution which guarantee that right. Article III, Section 2, Clause 3; Sixth Amendment; Seventh Amendment. That history is succinctly summarized in the Declaration of Independence in which complaint was made that the Colonies were deprived 'in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury'. But procedural devices rooted in experience were written into the Bill of Rights not as abstract rubrics in an elegant code but in order to assure fairness and justice before any person could be deprived of 'life, liberty, or property'.\n It hardly occurred to the framers of the original Constitution and of the Bill of Rights that an accused, acting in obedience to the dictates of self-interest or the promptings of conscience, should be prevented from surrendering his liberty by admitting his guilt. The Constitution does not compel an accused who admits his guilt to stand trial against his own wishes. Legislation apart, no social policy calls for the adoption by the courts of an inexorable rule that guilt must be determined only by trial and not by admission. A plea of guilt expresses the defendant's belief that his acts were proscribed by law and that he cannot successfully be defended. It is true, of course, that guilt under Section 215 of the Criminal Code, which makes it a crime to use the mails to defraud, depends upon answers to questions of law raised by application of the \n\n[317 \nU.S. 269, 277]\n\u00a0\n statute to particular facts. It is equally true that prosecutions under other provisions of the Criminal Code may raise even more difficult and complex questions of law. But such questions are no less absent when a man pleads guilty than when he resists an accusation of crime. And not even now is it suggested that a layman cannot plead guilty unless he has the opinion of a lawyer on the questions of law that might arise if he did not admit his guilt. Plainly, the engrafting of such a requirement upon the Constitution would be a gratuitous dislocation of the processes of justice. The task of judging the competence of a particular accused cannot be escaped by announcing delusively simple rules of trial procedure which judges must mechanically follow. The question in each case is whether the accused was competent to exercise an intelligent, informed judgment-and for determination of this question it is of course relevant whether he had the advice of counsel. But it is quite another matter to suggest that the Constitution unqualifiedly deems an accused incompetent unless he does have the advice of counsel. If a layman is to be precluded from defending himself because the Constitution is said to make him helpless without a lawyer's assistance on questions of law which abstractly underlie all federal criminal prosecutions, it ought not to matter whether the decision he is called upon to make is that of pleading guilty or of waiving a particular mode of trial. Every conviction, including the considerable number based upon pleas of guilty, presupposes at least a tacit disposition of the legal questions involved.\n We have already held that one charged with a serious federal crime may dispense with his Constitutional right to jury trial, where this action is taken with his express, intelligent consent, where the Government also consents, and where such action is approved by the responsible judg- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 269, 278]\n\u00a0\n ment of the trial court. Patton v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 276\n, 50 S.Ct. 253, 70 A.L.R. 263.3 And whether or not there is an intelligent, competent, self-protecting waiver of jury trial by an accused must depend upon the unique circumstances of each case. The less rigorous enforcement of the rules of evidence, the greater informality in trial procedure-these are not the only advantages that the absence of a jury may afford to a layman who prefers to make his own defense. In a variety of subtle ways trial by jury may be restrictive of a layman's opportunities to present his case as freely as he wishes. And since trial by jury confers burdens as well as benefits, an accused should be permitted to forego its privileges when his competent judgment counsels him that his interests are safer in the keeping of the judge than of the jury.\n But we are asked here to hold that an accused person cannot waive trial by jury, no matter how freely and understandingly he surrenders that right, unless he acts on a lawyer's advice. In other words, although a shrewd and experienced layman may, for his own sufficient reasons, conduct his own defense if he prefers to do so, nevertheless if he does do so the Constitution requires that he must defend himself before a jury and not before a judge. But we find nothing in the Constitution, or in the great historic events which gave rise to it, or the history to which it has given rise, to justify such interpolation into the Consti- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 269, 279]\n\u00a0\n tution and such restriction upon the rational administration of criminal justice.\n The right to assistance of counsel and the correlative right to dispense with a lawyer's help are not legal formalisms. They rest on considerations that go to the substance of an accused's position before the law. The public conscience must be satisfied that fairness dominates the administration of justice. An accused must have the means of presenting his best defense. He must have time and facilities for investigation and for the production of evidence. But evidence and truth are of no avail unless they can be adequately presented. Essential fairness is lacking if an accused cannot put his case effectively in court. But the Constitution does not force a lawyer upon a defendant. He may waive his Constitutional right to assistance of counsel if he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open. Johnson v. Zerbst, \n304 \nU.S. 458, 468\n, 469 S., 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1024, 1025.\n Referring to jury trials, Mr. Justice Cardozo, speaking for the Court, had occasion to say, 'Few would be so narrow or provincial as to maintain that a fair and enlightened system of justice would be impossible without them.' Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. at page 325, 58 S.Ct. at page 152. Putting this thought in more generalized form, the procedural safeguards of the Bill of Rights are not to be treated as mechanical rigidities. What were contrived as protections for the accused should not be turned into fetters. To assert as an absolute that a layman, no matter how wise or experienced he may be, is incompetent to choose between judge and jury as the tribunal for determining his guilt or innocence, simply because a lawyer has not advised him on the choice, is to dogmatize beyond the bounds of learning or experience. Were we so to hold, we would impliedly condemn the administration of criminal justice in states deemed otherwise enlightened merely \n\n[317 \nU.S. 269, 280]\n\u00a0\n because in their courts the vast majority of criminal cases are tried before a judge without a jury. To deny an accused a choice of procedure in circumstances in which he, though a layman, is as capable as any lawyer of making an intelligent choice, is to impair the worth of great Constitutional safeguards by treating them as empty verbalisms.\n Underlying such dogmatism is distrust of the ability of courts to accommodate judgment to the varying circumstances of individual cases. But this is to express want of faith in the very tribunals which are charged with enforcement of the Constitution. 'Universal distrust', Mr. Justice Holmes admonished us, 'creates universal incompetence.' Graham v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 474, 480\n, 34 S.Ct. 148, 151. When the administration of the criminal law in the federal courts is hedged about as it is by the Constitutional safeguards for the protection of an accused, to deny him in the exercise of his free choice the right to dispense with some of these safeguards (when such surrenders are as jealously guarded as they are by our rulings in Patton v. United States, supra, and Johnson v. Zerbst, supra), and to base such denial on an arbitrary rule that a man cannot choose to conduct his defense before a judge rather than a jury unless, against his will, he has a lawyer to advise him, although he reasonably deems himself the best advisor for his own needs, is to imprison a man in his privileges and call it the Constitution. For it is neither obnoxious to humane standards for the administration of justice as these have been written into the Constitution, nor violative of the rights of any person accused of crime who is capable of weighing his own best interest, to permit him to conduct his own defense in a trial before a judge without a jury, subject as such trial is to public scrutiny and amenable as it is to the corrective oversight of an appellate tribunal and ultimately of the Supreme Court of the Nation. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 269, 281]\n\u00a0\n Once we reject such a doctrinaire view of criminal justice and of the Constitution, there is an end to this case. The Patton decision left no room for doubt that a determination of guilt by a court after waiver of jury trial could not be set aside and a new trial ordered except upon a plain showing that such waiver was not freely and intelligently made. If the result of the adjudicatory process is not to be set at naught, it is not asking too much that the burden of showing essential unfairness be sustained by him who claims such injustice and seeks to have the result set aside, and that it be sustained not as a matter of speculation but as a demonstrable reality. Simply because a result that was insistently invited, namely, a verdict by a court without a jury, disappointed the hopes of the accused, ought not to be sufficient for rejecting it. And if the record before us does not show an intelligent and competent waiver of the right to the assistance of counsel by a defendant who demanded again and again that the judge try him, and who in his persistence of such a choice knew what he was about, it would be difficult to conceive of a set of circumstances in which there was such a free choice by a self- determining individual.\n The order of the Circuit Court of Appeals must therefore be set aside and the cause remanded to that court for such further proceedings, not inconsistent with this opinion, as may be appropriate.\n So ordered.\n Order set aside.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n The Patton case, \n281 \nU.S. 276\n, 50 S.Ct. 253, 70 A.L.R. 263, held that a defendant represented by counsel might waive under certain circumstances trial by a jury of twelve and submit to trial by a jury of only eleven. In view of the strictness of the constitutional mandates I am by no means convinced that it follows that an entire jury may be waived. But assuming \n\n[317 \nU.S. 269, 282]\n\u00a0\n arguendo that it may be, I think the respondent should have had the benefit of legal advice before his waiver of a jury trial was accepted by the District Court. For I do not believe that we can safely assume that in absence of legal advice a waiver by a layman of his constitutional right to a jury trial was intelligent and competent in such a case as this.\n Respondent was indicted under the mail fraud statute. 35 Stat. 1130, 18 U.S.C.  338, 18 U.S.C.A.  338. It subjects to fine or imprisonment one who 'having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud ... shall, for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, place, or cause to be placed, any letter, postal card, package, writing, circular, pamphlet, or advertisement ... in any post office ... or other letter box of the United States'. It would be unlikely that a layman without the benefit of legal advice would understand the limited nature of the defenses available under that statute or the scope of the ultimate issues on which the question of guilt usually turns. Without that understanding I do not see how an intelligent choice between trial by judge or trial by jury could be made.\n The broad sweep of the statute has not been restricted by judicial construction. What might appear to a layman as a complete defense has commonly been denied by the courts in keeping with the policy of Congress to draw tight the net around those who tax ingenuity in devising fraudulent schemes. Thus an indictment will be upheld or a conviction sustained though the defendant did not intend to use the mails at the time the scheme was designed,1 though no one was defrauded or suffered any loss, 2 though \n\n[317 \nU.S. 269, 283]\n\u00a0\n the defendant did not intend to receive3 or did not receive4 any benefit from the scheme, though the defendant actually believed that his plan would in the end benefit the persons solicited,5 though the means were ineffective for carrying out the scheme,6 and perhaps, even though the mails were used not for solicitation but only in collection of checks received pursuant to the plan. 7 In other words, the defenses in law are few and far between. As a practical matter, if the mails were employed at any stage, the question of guilt turns on whether the defendant had a fraudulent intent. That is the significant fact. Durland v. United States, \n161 \nU.S. 306, 313\n, 16 S.Ct. 508, 511.\n I think a layman normally would need legal advice to know that much. And it seems to me unlikely that he would be capable of appraising his chances as between judge and jury without such advice. Without it he might well conclude that he had adequate defenses on which a judge could better pass than a jury. With such advice he might well pause to entrust the question of his intent to a particular judge, rather than to a jury of his peers drawn from the community where most of the transactions took place and instructed to acquit if they had a reasonable doubt. On the other hand if he had a full understanding of the issues, he might conceivably deem it a matter of large importance that he be tried by the judge rather than a jury. The point is that we should not leave to sheer speculation the question whether his waiver of a jury trial \n\n[317 \nU.S. 269, 284]\n\u00a0\n was intelligent and competent. Yet on this record we can only speculate, since all we know is that respondent professed to have 'studied law' and that he lost a civil suit which he had prosecuted pro se. McCann v. New York Stock Exchange, 2 Cir., 107 F.2d 908. Furthermore, the right to trial by jury, like the right to have the assistance of counsel, is 'too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to indulge in nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice arising from its denial.' Glasser v. United States, \n315 \nU.S. 60, 76\n, 62 S.Ct. 457, 467. Moreover, as Judge Learned Hand stated in the court below, (126 F.2d 774, 776), the answer to the question whether the waiver was intelligent should hardly be made to depend on 'the outcome of a preliminary inquiry as to the competency' of the particular layman. If this constitutional right is to be jealously protected, there should be a reliable objective standard by which the trial court satisfies itself that the layman who waives trial by jury in a case like this has a full understanding of the consequences. Dillingham v. United States, 5 Cir., 76 F.2d 36, 39. At least where the trial judge fails to inform him the only safe and practical alternative in a case like the present one is to require the appointment of counsel. Only then should we say that the trial judge has exercised that 'sound and advised discretion' which the Patton case required even before a waiver of one juror was accepted. 281 U.S. page 312, 50 S.Ct. page 263, 70 A.L.R. 263.\n The question for us is not whether a judge should be trusted as much as a jury to determine the question of guilt. We are dealing here with one of the great historic civil liberties-the right to trial by jury. Article III, Sec. 2 and the Sixth Amendment which grant that right contain no exception, though a few have been implied. See Ex parte Quirin, \n317 \nU.S. 1\n, 63 S.Ct. 2, 87 L.Ed. --. We should not permit the exceptions to be enlarged by waiver unless it is plain and beyond doubt that the waiver was freely and intelli- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 269, 285]\n\u00a0\n gently made. The Patton case surrounds such a waiver with numerous safeguards even where, as in that case, the waiver was made by one who was represented by counsel. We should be even more strict and exacting in case the waiver is made by a layman acting on his own. Then the reasons for indulging every reasonable presumption against a waiver of 'fundamental constitutional rights' (Johnson v. Zerbst, \n304 \nU.S. 458, 464\n, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023) become even more compelling.\n The fact that a defendant ordinarily may dispense with a trial by admitting his guilt is no reason for accepting this layman's waiver of a jury trial. What the Constitution requires is that the 'trial' of a crime 'shall be by jury'. Art. III, Sec. 2. And it specifies the machinery which shall be employed if a plea of not guilty is entered and the prosecution is put to its proof. Moreover, we are not dealing here with absolutes. Normally admission of guilt could properly be accepted without more since ordinarily a defendant would know whether or not he was guilty of the crime charged. But there might conceivably be an exception, where, for example, the issue of guilt turned not only on the admitted facts but upon the construction of a statute. Each case of necessity turns on its own facts. Nor is it a sufficient answer to say that if legal advice is required for a waiver of trial by jury, then by the same token a layman representing himself could not exercise his own judgment concerning any matter during the trial with respect to which a lawyer might have superior knowledge. Whether the waiver of counsel for purposes of the trial meets the exacting standards of Johnson v. Zerbst is one thing. Whether that dilution of constitutional rights may be compounded by a waiver of trial by jury is quite another. It is the cumulative effect of the several waivers of constitutional rights in a given case which must be gauged. Nor can I accede to the suggestion of \n\n[317 \nU.S. 269, 286]\n\u00a0\n the prosecution that a layman's right to waive trial by jury is such an important part of his high privilege to manage his own case that its exercise should be freely accorded. That argument is faintly reminiscent of those notions of freedom of choice and liberty of contract which long denied protection to the individual in other fields.\n Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice MURPHY join in this dissent.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY.\n I join my brother DOUGLAS, but desire to add the following views in dissent.\n The Constitution provides: 'The Trial of all Crimes, ... shall be by Jury; ....' (Article III,  2), and: 'In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, ...' (Amendment VI). Because of these provisions, the fundamental nature of jury trial,1 and its beneficial effects as a means of leavening justice with the spirit of the times,2 I do not concede that the right to a jury trial can be waived in criminal proceedings in the federal courts. Whatever may be the logic of the matter, there is a considerable practical difference between trial by eleven jurors, the situation in Patton v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 276\n, 50 S.Ct. 253, 70 A.L.R. 263, and trial to the court, and practicality is a sturdy guide to the preservation of Constitutional guaranties.\n But if it is assumed that jury trial, the prized product of the travail of the past, can be waived by an accused, \n\n[317 \nU.S. 269, 287]\n\u00a0\n there should be compliance with rigorous standards, adequately designed to insure that an accused fully understands his rights and intelligently appreciates the effects of his step, before a court should accept such a waiver. Among those requirements in the case of a layman defendant in a criminal proceeding where the punishment may be substantial, as in the instant case, should be the right to have the benefit of the advice of counsel on the desirability of waiver. Of course the capacity of individuals to appraise their interests varies, but such a uniform general rule will protect the rights of all much better than a rule depending upon the fluctuating factual variables of the individual case which are often difficult to evaluate on the basis of the cold record. In my opinion the Constitution requires this general rule as an absolute right if a jury is to be waived at all. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] McCann had brought suit in 1933 against the New York Stock Exchange, its officers and members, the Better Business Bureau of New York, and a large number of other persons, seeking thirty million dollars damages for conspiracy in restraint of trade.

Thereafter on petition of respondent and after notice to all parties and a hearing the bankruptcy court vacated the restraining order. This likewise was, so far as appears, prior to an adjudication. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 211, 212]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner appealed. The Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal 'for lack of jurisdiction.'

WISCONSIN EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD(1942)\nNo. 252\nArgued: March 2, 1942Decided: March 30, 1942\n\n\n\n Messrs. Max E. Geline, of Milwaukee, Wis., Eugene Cotton, of New York City, and Lee Pressman, of Washington, D.C., for appellants.\n Messrs. N. S. Boardman, of Madison, Wis., and Leo Mann, of Milwaukee, Wis., for appellees. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 740, 741]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The sole question presented by this case is whether an order of the Wisconsin Employment Relations Board entered under the Wisconsin Employment Peace Act, L.1939, ch. 57, Wis.Stat.1939, ch. 111, pp. 1610- 1618, is unconstitutional and void as being repugnant to the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act. 49 Stat. 449, 29 U.S.C.  151 et seq.\n Sec. 111.06(2) of the state Act provides in part:\n'It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employe individually or in concert with others:\n\n'(a) To coerce or intimidate an employe in the enjoyment of his legal rights, including those guaranteed in section 111.04,1 or to intimidate his family, picket his \n\n[315 \nU.S. 740, 742]\n\u00a0\n domicile, or injure the person or property of such employe or his family.\n\n'(f) To hinder or prevent, by mass picketing, threats, intimidation, force or coercion of any kind the pursuit of any lawful work or employment, or to obstruct or interfere with entrance to or egress from any place of employment, or to obstruct or interfere with free and uninterrupted use of public roads, streets, highways, railways, airports, or other ways of travel or conveyance.'\n\n The state Board is given authority on the filing of a complaint to conduct hearings, to make findings of fact, and to issue orders. \n2\n  111.07. Orders of the state Board are enforceable by the circuit courts. Id. Appellee, Allen-Bradley Co., is engaged in the manufacturing business in Wisconsin. Appellant union is a labor organization composed of the employees of that company. The union had a contract with the company governing terms and conditions of employment. The contract was cancelled by the union. Thereafter the union by secret ballot ordered a strike, which was called on May 11, 1939. The strike lasted about three months during which time the company continued to operate its plant. Differences arose between the employees who were on strike and the company and those employees who continued to work. The company thereupon filed a petition with the state Board charging the union and certain of its officers and members \n\n[315 \nU.S. 740, 743]\n\u00a0\n with unfair labor practices. The union answered and objected, inter alia, to the jurisdiction of the state Board on the ground that as respects the matters in controversy the company was subject exclusively to the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act and to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal Board. The state Board made findings of fact and entered an order against the union and its officers and members. On a petition for review, the circuit court sustained and enforced the Board's order. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin affirmed that judgment. 237 Wis. 164, 295 N.W. 791. The case is here on appeal. Judicial Code,  237(a), 28 U.S. C.  344(a), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(a).\n The findings and order of the state Board as summarized by the Supreme Court (237 Wis. pages 168-170, 295 N.W. page 793) are as follows:\n'Briefly, from the findings the following facts appear:\n\n'(a) Appellants engaged in mass picketing at all entrances to the premises of the company for the purpose of hindering and preventing the pursuit of lawful work and employment by employees who desired to work.\n\n'(b) They obstructed and interfered with the entrance to and egress from the factory and obstructed and interfered with the free and uninterrupted use of the streets and sidewalks surrounding the factory.\n\n'(c) They threatened bodily injury and property damage to many of the employees who desired to continue their employment.\n\n'(d) They required of persons desiring to enter the factory, to first obtain passes from the union. Persons holding such passes were admitted without interference.\n\n'(e) They picketed the homes of employees who continued in the employment of the company.\n\n'(f) That the union by its officers and many of its members injured the persons and property of employees who desired to continue their employment.\n\n'(g) That the fourteen individual appellants, who were striking employees, had engaged in various acts of mis- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 740, 744]\n\u00a0\n conduct. The facts relating to those were found specifically. The acts consisted of intimidating and preventing employees from pursuing their work by threats, coercion, and assault; by damaging property of employees who continued to work; and as to one of them by carrying concrete rocks which he intended to use to intimidate employees who desired to work.\n\n'Based upon these findings the Board found as conclusions of law, that the union was guilty of unfair labor practices in the following respects:\n\n'(a) Mass picketing for the purpose of hindering and preventing the pursuit of lawful work.\n\n'(b) Threatening employees desiring to work with bodily injury and injury to their property.\n\n'(c) Obstructing and interfering with entrance to and egress from the factory.\n\n'(d) Obstructing and interfering with the free and uninterrupted use of the streets and public roads surrounding the factory.\n\n'(e) Picketing the homes of employees.\n\n'As to the fourteen individual appellants, the Board concluded that each of them was guilty of unfair labor practices by reason of threats, assaults and other misdemeanors committed by them as set out in the findings of fact.\n\n'Based upon its findings of fact and conclusions of law the Board ordered that the union, its officers, agents, and members\n\n'(1) Cease and desist from:\n\n'(a) Mass picketing.\n\n'(b) Threatening employees.\n\n'(c) Obstructing or interfering with the factory entrances.\n\n'(d) Obstructing or interfering with the free use of public streets, roads and sidewalks.\n\n'(e) Picketing the domiciles of employees.\n\n'The order required the union to post notices at its headquarters that it had ceased and desisted in the manner aforesaid and to notify the Board in writing of steps taken to comply with the order. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 740, 745]\n\u00a0\n 'As to the fourteen individual appellants, the order made no determination based upon the finding that they were individually guilty of unfair labor practices.'\n\n It was admitted that the company was subject to the National Labor Relations Act. The federal Board, however, had not undertaken in this case to exercise the jurisdiction which that Act conferred on it. Accordingly, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin upheld the order of the state Board stating that 'there can be no conflict between the acts until they are applied to the same labor dispute.' It was urged before that court, as it has been here, that there was nevertheless a conflict between that part of the findings of the state Board which deals with the individual appellants and the National Labor Relations Act. The contention is that the individual appellants who were found guilty of unfair labor practices, as defined in the state Act, are under the terms of the federal Act still employees of the company,3 while under the state Act that relationship is severed. \n4\n As to that alleged conflict the Wisconsin Supreme Court made two answers: First, the federal Act had not been applied to this labor dispute. Second, it is the order, not the findings, of the state Board which affects the employer and employee relationship. Since there was no provision in the order which suspended the status as employees of the fourteen individual appel- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 740, 746]\n\u00a0\n lants who were found guilty of unfair labor practices, there was no conflict as to their employee status under the state and federal Acts.\n Various views have been advanced here. On the one hand, it is urged that in this situation, as in the case of federal control over intrastate transportation rates (Shreveport Case (Houston, E. & W.T.R. Co. v. United States), \n234 \nU.S. 342, 357\n, 34 S.Ct. 833, 838; Board v. Great Northern Ry. Co., \n281 \nU.S. 412, 424\n, 426 S.-428, 50 S.Ct. 391, 394, 395, 396), state action should not be foreclosed in absence of a finding by the federal Board under  10(a), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(a), that an employer's labor practice so affects interstate commerce (National Labor Relations Board v. Fainblatt, \n306 \nU.S. 601\n, 59 S.Ct. 668) that it should be prevented. On the other hand, it is earnestly contended that the state Act viewed as a whole so undermines rights protected and granted by the federal Act and is so hostile to the policy of the federal Act that it should not be allowed to survive. Acceptance of the latter theory would necessitate a reversal of the judgment below. Acceptance of the former would mean that in all cases orders of the state Board would be upheld if the federal Board had not assumed jurisdiction.\n We deal, however, not with the theoretical disputes but with concrete and specific issues raised by actual cases. Associated Press v. National Labor Relations Board, \n301 \nU.S. 103, 132\n, 57 S.Ct. 650, 655; United States v. Appalachian Power Co., \n311 \nU.S. 377, 423\n, 61 S.Ct. 291, 306, and cases cited. 'Constitutional questions are not to be dealt with abstractly.' Bandini Petroleum Co. v. Superior Court, \n284 \nU.S. 8, 22\n, 52 S.Ct. 103, 108, 78 A.L.R. 826; Arizona v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 423, 464\n, 51 S.Ct. 522, 529. They will not be anticipated but will be dealt with only as they are appropriately raised upon a record before us. Tennessee Publishing Co., v. American National Bank, \n299 \nU.S. 18, 22\n, 57 S.Ct. 85, 87. Nor will we assume in advance that a State will so construe its law as to bring it into conflict with the federal Constitution or an act of Congress. Mountain Timber Co. v. Washing- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 740, 747]\n\u00a0\n ton, \n243 \nU.S. 219, 246\n, 37 S.Ct. 260, 268, Ann.Cas.1917D, 642; Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Grosjean, \n301 \nU.S. 412, 429\n, 430 S., 57 S.Ct. 772, 779, 112 A.L.R. 293; Watson v. Buck, \n313 \nU.S. 387\n, 61 S.Ct. 962, 136 A.L.R. 1426. Hence we confine our discussion to the precise facts of this case and intimate no opinion as to the validity of other types of orders in cases where the federal Board has not assumed jurisdiction.\n We are not under the necessity of treating the state Act as an inseparable whole. Cf. Watson v. Buck, supra. Rather, we must read the state Act for purposes of the present case as though it contained only those provisions which authorize the state Board to enter orders of the specific type here involved. That Act contains a broad severability clause. 5 The Wisconsin Supreme Court seems to have been liberal in interpreting such clauses so as to separate valid from void provisions of statutes. \n6\n Aside from that, Wisconsin in this case has in fact applied only a few of the many provisions of its Act to appellants. And we have the word of the Wisconsin Supreme Court that 'the act affects the rights of parties to a controversy pending before the Board only in the manner and to the extent prescribed by the order.' 237 Wis. page 183, 295 N.W. page 799. That construction is conclusive here. Senn v. Tile Layers Union, \n301 \nU.S. 468, 477\n, 57 S.Ct. 857, 861; Minnesota v. Probate Court, \n309 \nU.S. 270, 273\n, 60 S.Ct. 523, 525, 126 A.L.R. 530, and cases cited. Hence we need not speculate as to whether the portions of the statute on which the order rests are so intertwined \n\n[315 \nU.S. 740, 748]\n\u00a0\n with the others that the various provisions of the state Act must be considered as inseparable. Since Wisconsin has enforced an order based only on one part of the Act, we must consider that portion exactly as Wisconsin has treated it-'complete in itself and capable of standing alone'. Watson v. Buck, supra, 313 U.S. page 397, 61 S.Ct. page 965, 136 A.L.R. 1426. Viewed in that light, no conflict with the National Labor Relations Act exists.\n The only employee or union conduct and activity forbidden by the state Board in this case was mass picketing, threatening employees desiring to work with physical injury or property damage, obstructing entrance to and egress from the company's factory, obstructing the streets and public roads surrounding the factory, and picketing the homes of employees. So far as the fourteen individuals are concerned, their status as employees of the company was not affected.\n We agree with the statement of the United States as amicus curiae that the federal Act was not designed to preclude a State from enacting legislation limited to the prohibition or regulation of this type of employee or union activity. The Committee Reports7 on the federal Act plainly indicate that it is not 'a mere police court meas- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 740, 749]\n\u00a0\n ure' and that authority of the several States may be exerted to control such conduct. Furthermore, this Court has long insisted that an 'intention of Congress to exclude states from exerting their police power must be clearly manifested'. Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., \n272 \nU.S. 605, 611\n, 47 S.Ct. 207, 209, and cases cited; Kelly v. Washington, \n302 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, 58 S.Ct. 87, 92; South Carolina State Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros., Inc., \n303 \nU.S. 177, 625\n, 58 S.Ct. 510; H. P. Welch Co. v. New Hampshire, \n306 \nU.S. 79, 85\n, 59 S.Ct. 438, 441; Maurer v. Hamilton, \n309 \nU.S. 598, 614\n, 60 S.Ct. 726, 734, 135 A.L.R. 1347; Watson v. Buck, supra. Congress has not made such employee and union conduct as is involved in this case subject to regulation by the federal Board. Nor are we faced here with the precise problem with which we were confronted in Hines v. Davidowitz, \n312 \nU.S. 52\n, 61 S.Ct. 399. In the Hines case a federal system of alien registration was held to supersede a state system of registration. But there we were dealing with a problem which had an impact on the general field of foreign relations. The delicacy of the issues which were posed alone raised grave questions as to the propriety of allowing a state system of regulation to function alongside of a federal system. In that field any 'concurrent state power that may exist is restricted to the narrowest of limits'. 312 U.S. page 68, 61 S.Ct. page 404. Therefore we were more ready to conclude that a federal act in a field that touched international relations superseded state regulation than we were in those cases where a State was exercising its historic powers over such traditionally local matters as public safety and order and the use of streets and highways. Maurer v. Hamilton, supra, and cases cited. Here we are dealing with the latter type of problem. We will not lightly infer that Congress by the mere passage of a federal Act has impaired the traditional sovereignty of the several States in that regard.\n Furthermore, in the Hines case the federal system of alien registration was a 'single integrated and all- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 740, 750]\n\u00a0\n embracing' one. 312 U.S. page 74, 61 S.Ct. page 408. Here, as we have seen, Congress designedly left open an area for state control. Nor can we say that the control which Congress has asserted over the subject matter of labor disputes is so pervasive (Cf. Cloverleaf Butter Co. v. Patterson, \n315 \nU.S. 148\n, 62 S.Ct. 491, 86 L.Ed. --) as to prevent Wisconsin under the familiar rule of Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n250 \nU.S. 566, 569\n, 40 S.Ct. 36, 37, from supplementing federal regulation in the manner of this order. Sec. 7 of the federal Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  157, guarantees labor its 'fundamental right' (National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., \n301 \nU.S. 1, 33\n, 57 S.Ct. 615, 622, 108 A.L.R. 1352) to self- organization and collective bargaining. Sec. 8 affords employees protection against unfair labor practices of employers including employer interference with the rights secured by  7. Sec. 9 affords machinery for providing appropriate collective bargaining units. And  10 grants the federal Board 'exclusive' power of enforcement. It is not sufficient, however, to show that the state Act might be so construed and applied as to dilute, impair, or defeat those rights. Watson v. Buck, supra. Nor is the unconstitutionality of the provisions of the state Act which underlie the present order established by a showing that other parts of the statue are incompatible with and hostile to the policy expressed in the federal Act. Since Wisconsin has applied to appellants only parts of the state Act, the conflict with the policy or mandate of the federal Act must be found in those parts. But, as we have said, the federal Act does not govern employee or union activity of the type here enjoined. And we fail to see how the inability to utilize mass picketing, threats, violence, and the other devices which were here employed impairs, dilutes, qualifies or in any respect subtracts from any of the rights guaranteed and protected by the federal Act. Nor is the freedom to engage in such conduct shown to be so essential or intimately related to a realization of the guarantees of the federal Act that its denial is an impairment of the federal \n\n[315 \nU.S. 740, 751]\n\u00a0\n policy. If the order of the state Board affected the status of the employees or if it caused a forfeiture of collective bargaining rights, a distinctly different question would arise. But since no such right is affected, we conclude that this case is not basically different from the common situation where a State takes steps to prevent breaches of the peace in connection with labor disputes. Since the state system of regulation, as construed and applied here, can be reconciled with the federal Act and since the two as focused in this case can consistently stand together, the order of the state Board must be sustained under the rule which has long obtained in this Court. See Sinnot v. Davenport, 22 How. 227, 243.\n In sum, we cannot say that the mere enactment of the National Labor Relations Act without more excluded state regulation of the type which Wisconsin has exercised in this case. It has not been shown that any employee was deprived of rights protected or granted by the federal Act or that the status of any of them under the federal Act was impaired. Indeed if the portions of the state Act here invoked are invalid because they conflict with the federal Act, then so long as the federal Act is on the books it is difficult to see how any State could under any circumstances regulate picketing or disorder growing out of labor disputes of companies whose business affects interstate commerce.\n We rest our decision on the narrow grounds indicated. We have here no question as to constitutional limitations on state control of picketing under the rule of Thornhill's case (Thornhill v. State of Alabama), \n310 \nU.S. 88\n, 60 S.Ct. 736. Nor are any other constitutional questions concerning the Wisconsin Act properly presented. And in view of our disposition of the case we find it unnecessary to pass on other questions raised by the appellees.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 111.04 provides: 'Employees shall have the right of self- organization and the right to form, join or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in lawful, concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection; and such employes shall also have the right to refrain from any or all of such activities.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Sec. 111.07(4) provides in part: 'Final orders may dismiss the charges or require the person complained of to cease and desist from the unfair labor practices found to have been committed, suspend his rights, immunities, privileges or remedies granted or afforded by this chapter for not more than one year, and require him to take such affirmative action, including reinstatement of employes with or without pay, as the board may deem proper.

This driveaway or caravaning method of transportation is performed by individual driving of the vehicle under its own power, by driving one vehicle under its own power and towing a second vehicle attached to the first, or by driving under its own power a vehicle upon which another vehicle is partially or wholly mounted. Shipments by Fleming originated from the factories of automobile manufacturers in Detroit, Michigan, and were made to dealers and distributors in various states. Certain new cars were returned to Detroit in the same manner. Fleming commenced operations in 1933 and between January 1, 1934 and June 1, 1935 transported shipments to one point each in Arkansas and Alabama; to two points each in California, New York, Pennsylvania and Tennessee; to three points each in Washington, Oregon, Kentucky and North Carolina; to four points in Texas; to five points in South Carolina; and to seven points in Georgia. About 1200 vehicles were transported in this period and more than 2100 from 1933 to July, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 15, 18]\n\u00a0\n 1936, the time of the hearing. Shipments consisted of from one to sixteen vehicles, shipments of two and four being the most common. Fleming's service was confined to deliveries at very few points in several states due to the fact that he was furnishing a highly specialized transportation service from manufacturers to dealers and distributors. Shipments to most of the states named were numerous. Shipments to other states were fewer in number. Thus the three shipments to Arkansas aggregated twenty-five vehicles, the four shipments each to Texas and Oregon aggregated fourteen vehicles and twenty-four vehicles respectively, and the five shipments to Washington aggregated twenty-eight vehicles. Operations in those four states started just prior to June 1, 1935; but they were sufficient in scope to establish that Fleming was in bona fide operation in them on the statutory date. Fleming held his services out to the public generally as a common carrier and operated as such; and he held himself out to transport by the driveaway method between any points in the states for which application was made.\n Though his transportation of shipments was restricted to a few points in each of the enumerated states, the Commission held that he was entitled to transport to all points in all of the states served, with the exception of New York and Pennsylvania as respects which the application was denied. The District Court sustained the order of the Commission in all respects except the operation in Arkansas. As to that it held that his service had been abandoned.\n We are met at the outset with the question of the standing of the appellant railroad companies (seventy-one in number) to bring and maintain the suit in the District Court. All but a few intervened in the hearing before the Commission. Each is a common carrier and a competitor of Fleming in some portion of the territory which \n\n[315 \nU.S. 15, 19]\n\u00a0\n Fleming is authorized to serve. They rest their right to sue on  205(h) of the Motor Carrier Act,2 49 U.S.C.Supp.  305(h), 49 U.S.C.A.  305(h), which provides that 'Any final order made under this part (chapter) shall be subject to the same right of relief in court by any party in interest as is now provided in respect to orders of the Commission made under part I (chapter 1) ....' Sec. 1(20) of Part I, 49 U.S.C.  1(20), 49 U.S.C.A .  1(20), authorizes 'any party in interest' to sue to enjoin any construction, operation or abandonment of a railroad made contrary to  1( 18) or (19). Such suits may be maintained not only where the railroad proceeds without authorization of the Commission but also where it proceeds under a certificate of the Commission whose validity is challenged. Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry Co. v. United States, \n285 \nU.S. 382\n, 52 S.Ct. 440. Hence we conclude that  205(h) has incorporated by reference the 'party in interest' provision of  1(20). We do not stop to inquire what effect, if any, the status of appellant railroad companies as intervenors before the Commission had on their right to bring and maintain this suit. Cf. Chicago Junction Case, \n264 \nU.S. 258\n, 44 S.Ct. 317, with Pittsburgh & West Virginia Ry. Co. v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 479\n, 50 S.Ct. 378. They clearly have a stake as carriers in the transportation situation which the order of the Commission affected. They are competitors of Fleming for automobile traffic in territory served by him. They are transportation agencies directly affected by competition with the motor transport industry- competition which prior to the Motor Carrier Act of 1935 had proved destructive. S.Doc. No. 152, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 13-27. They are members of the national transportation system which that Act was designed to coordinate. S.Rep. No. 482, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.; H.Rep.No. 1645, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. Hence they are parties in interest within \n\n[315 \nU.S. 15, 20]\n\u00a0\n the meaning of  205(h) under the tests announced in Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266\n, 46 S.Ct. 263; Western Pacific California R. Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., \n284 \nU.S. 47\n, 52 S.Ct. 56, and Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry Co. v. United States, supra.\n The appellant railroad companies earnestly contend that the Commission was without authority to authorize Fleming to serve a whole state where, as here, his services had been in fact limited to only a few points in the state. The argument is that any rights obtained under the 'grandfather clause' should be delimited to the actual area in which the applicant was in bona fide operation during the period in question. Sec. 206(a) provides for the issuance of a certificate of public convenience and necessity without proof beyond the fact that the applicant or his predecessor in interest 'was in bona fide operation as a common carrier by motor vehicle on June 1, 1935, over the route or routes or within the territory for which application is made and has so operated since that time.' Sec. 208(a) provides that such certificate 'shall specify the service to be rendered and the routes over which, the fixed termini, if any, between which, and the intermediate and off-route points, if any, at which, and in case of operations not over specified routes or between fixed termini, the territory within which, the motor carrier is authorized to operate.' The authority granted Fleming was to operate in the designated territory 'over irregular routes' through specified states. It is plain from the statute that operations need not be restricted to specified routes or between fixed termini. But the question remains as to the power of the Commission to authorize operation in an entire state where only a few points in that state had been served.\n'Territory' is not a word of art. The characteristics of the transportation service involved as well as the geographical area serviced are relevant to the territorial \n\n[315 \nU.S. 15, 21]\n\u00a0\n scope of the operations which may be authorized under the 'grandfather clause'. While the test of 'bona fide operation' within a specified 'territory' includes 'actual rather than potential or simulated service' ( McDonald v. Thompson, \n305 \nU.S. 263, 266\n, 59 S.Ct. 176, 178), it does not necessarily restrict future operations to the precise points or areas already served. The characteristics of the transportation service rendered may of necessity have made trips to any specified locality irregular or sporadic. And they may likewise have restricted prior operations to but a few points in a wide area which the carrier held itself out as being willing and able to serve. The Commission has taken the characteristics of various transportation services into consideration in determining the scope of the territory covered by certificates under the 'grandfather clause'. Thus operations on irregular routes within a wide territory have been authorized in case of common carriers of household goods. Bruce Transfer & Storage Co., 2 M.C.C. 150; William J. Wruck, 12 M.C.C. 150. Similar broad authority has been granted common carriers of oil-field equipment and supplies. Charles B. Greer, Jr., 3 M.C. C. 483; Union City Transfer, 7 M.C.C. 717; L. C. Jones Trucking Co., 9 M.C. C. 740. And a like result has been reached in case of automobile transporters such as the applicant in the instant case. George Cassens & Sons, 1 M.C.C. 771. And see Charles E. Danbury, 17 M.C.C. 243. The general theory underlying the household goods cases was expressed in W. J. Wruck, supra, pp. 151, 152, as follows:\n\n'Calls for service between the same points are seldom repeated. Traffic is not regular in any given direction. What may be infrequent but fairly regular business to or from a certain State for a small carrier may be only sporadic business for a large carrier; consequently, a frequency of service that might amount to 'grandfather' clause rights in the case of the former could conceivably \n\n[315 \nU.S. 15, 22]\n\u00a0\n be inadequate in the case of the latter. It would be an impractical solution to carve out oddly shaped areas for service based solely on the frequency of service; consideration must also be given to the general territory served under the holding-out, even if the business in some States may not equal that in other States in the territory.'\n\n The Commission took a somewhat similar approach to the problem presented in the instant case. It noted that Fleming was restricted to shipments at points where the manufacturers had established distribution facilities; that those facilities were limited in any given area; that Fleming's opportunity for service was therefore confined to a very few distribution points and his operations were irregular; that less than an estimated seven per cent of all new automobiles sold during 1935 in twenty- four western states were transported by the driveaway method; that distribution points in the automobile industry are constantly shifted; that allowance must be made for frequent changes in points served by a carrier who depends for his traffic entirely upon this one industry; and that Fleming's future opportunity for obtaining traffic will doubtless be as limited as in the past. In view of the scope of his holding out and the nature and characteristics of the highly specialized transportation service rendered, the Commission authorized continuance of his service to all points in the enumerated states. That is a judgment which we should respect. Certainly we cannot say that it was a wholly inappropriate method for creating that substantial parity between future operations and prior bona fide operations which the statute contemplates. The special characteristics of this roving transportation service make tenable the conclusion that Fleming's prior limited opportunity for service could not be preserved unless state wide areas, within the scope of his holding out and partially covered by his previous operations, were kept open \n\n[315 \nU.S. 15, 23]\n\u00a0\n for him. That judgment is for the administrative experts not the courts.\n Appellant railroad companies also urge that Fleming should not have been awarded any rights under the 'grandfather clause' in Washington, Oregon, and California. Before June 1, 1935, Fleming had made five deliveries to three different points in Washington, four deliveries to three different points in Oregon, and at least two deliveries to two different points in California. After June 1, 1935, and prior to the hearing in July 1936, two deliveries were made in Washington, two in Oregon, and apparently several in California. These shipments did not appear to be merely nominal. \n3\n Thus there was evidence that on and since June 1, 1935, Fleming had been in bona fide operation in those states. The weighing of such evidence involves in part a judgment based on the characteristics of the highly specialized transportation service involved. Thus, as we have said, that function is peculiarly one for the Commission not the courts.\n Appellant railroad companies also insist that Fleming was not in 'bona fide operation' in Oregon because in January, 1936 he obtained in that state a contract carrier permit. The argument is that he could not obtain under the 'grandfather clause' common carrier rights in Oregon in the face of his contract carrier status there. Cf. United States v. Maher, \n307 \nU.S. 148\n, 59 S.Ct. 768. They further urge that Fleming's operations in Nebraska (one of the states through which his irregular routes were authorized) were conducted in violation of state law. In that connection reliance is placed on his testimony that in \n\n[315 \nU.S. 15, 24]\n\u00a0\n Nebraska he claimed to be the owner of the vehicles in order to reduce license fees. The expression 'in bona fide operation' plainly 'does not extend to one operating as a common carrier on public highways of a State in defiance of its laws'. McDonald v. Thompson, supra, 305 U.S. at page 266, 59 S.Ct. at page 178. Congress has not, however, conditioned rights under the 'grandfather clause' on compliance with state laws. Their violation is material only insofar as it may be relevant to establishing an absence of 'bona fide operation'. Infractions of state law, however, may be innocent or wilful, minor or considerable. They may or may not concern the right to operate in the state. Furthermore, the status of a carrier under state law may or may not be identical with his status as a common or contract carrier under the Motor Carrier Act. The question whether his operation in a particular state was 'bona fide' is a question of fact for the Commission to determine. Such operation might well be in good faith though state laws were infracted. And the fact that an applicant may have to make his peace with state authorities does not necessarily mean that his rights under the 'grandfather clause' should be denied or withheld. See Earl W. Slagle, 2 M.C.C. 127. Occasional noncompliance with state laws does not per se establish a course of conduct which is preponderantly one of evasion. Certainly no such course of conduct can be fairly implied in this case. Our task is ended if there is evidence to support the Commission's finding of bona fides. There is such evidence here.\n It is urged on the cross appeal that the court below should not have set aside the Commission's inclusion of Arkansas in the certificate. The evidence was that Fleming had served only one locality in Arkansas-the city of Texarkana. He had made three shipments there aggregating twenty- five vehicles. All of those shipments had been made prior to June 1, 1935, the latest being May 12, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 15, 25]\n\u00a0\n 1935. Though fourteen months expired between that date and the date of the hearing there was no evidence that any shipments were made to any locality in Arkansas since June 1, 1935. No explanation of that long hiatus was proffered. But  206(a) requires a finding of 'bona fide operation ... within the territory' not only 'on June 1, 1935' but also 'since that time'. We cannot say that an unexplained failure to make any shipments to Arkansas for over a year 'since that time' satisfies the statutory command even though the nature of the highly specialized transportation service involved be given the greatest weight. Cf. United States v. Maher, supra. A mere holding out will not alone suffice to bridge the long gap extending through and beyond one entire automobile production year, since applicant carries the burden of establishing his right to the statutory grant.\n We have considered the other points raised by appellant railroad companies and find them without substance.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Motor Carrier Act of 1935 is now designated as Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act, 54 Stat. 919, 49 U.S.C.A.  301 et seq. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Now  205(g) of Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act, 54 Stat. 922, 49 U.S.C.  305(g), 49 U.S.C.A.  305(g). \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] As to California the evidence was less specific than in the other states.

UNITED STATES(1942)\nNo. 913\nArgued: April 29, 1942Decided: June 1, 1942\n\n\n\n Mr. Erwin N. Griswold, of Cambridge, Mass., for petitioner.\n Mr. J. Louis Monarch, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the application of Section 131(f) of the Revenue Acts of 1936 and 19381 which allows a tax credit to domestic corporations in respect of income received from foreign subsidiaries.\n During the taxable years 1936, 1937, and 1938, the petitioner, a domestic corporation, received dividends from foreign subsidiaries of which it was sole stockholder. The \n\n[316 \nU.S. 450, 451]\n\u00a0\n subsidiaries paid taxes upon their earnings to the countries of their domicile. In its income tax returns the petitioner claimed the credit allowed by  131 for the foreign taxes so paid. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue computed the credit at a less sum than that the petitioner claimed. The petitioner paid the resultant taxes and presented claims for refund, which were rejected. This action was brought in the Court of Claims for asserted overpayments.\n The sole matter in controversy is the proper method of arriving at the credit granted by  131. That section permits a domestic corporation to credit against its tax the amount of income, war-profits, and excess- profits taxes paid or accrued during the taxable year to any foreign country, with certain limits set by subsections (b)(1) and (2). The purpose of the provision, like that of its predecessor,  238 of the Revenue Act of 1921,2 is to obviate double taxation. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Section 131(f), dealing with taxes of a foreign subsidiary,4 provides that, for the purpose of the section, a domestic corporation receiving dividends from such a subsidiary 'in any taxable year shall be deemed to have paid the same proportion of any income, war-profits, or excess- profits taxes paid' by the subsidiary to a foreign country, 'upon or with respect to the accumulated profits' of the subsidiary 'from which such dividends were paid, which the amount of such dividends bears to the amount of such accumulated profits.' 'Accumulated profits' of the subsidiary are defined as 'the amount of its gains, profits, or income in excess of the income, war-profits, and excess-profits taxes imposed upon or with respect to such profits or income.' \n\n[316 \nU.S. 450, 452]\n\u00a0\n The parties are in agreement as to the fraction to be used in calculating the proportion. The numerator is the dividends received by the parent. The denominator is the 'accumulated profits' of the subsidiary. The dispute relates to the multiplicand to which the fraction is to be applied. The petitioner says it is the total foreign taxes paid by the subsidiary. The respondent says it is the taxes paid upon or with respect to the accumulated profits of the subsidiary; i.e., so much of the taxes as is properly attributed to the accumulated profits, or the same proportion of the total taxes which the accumulated profits bear to the total profits. The Court of Claims so held. 5 Since several decisions have gone the other way,6 we granted certiorari. \n315 \nU.S. 793\n, 62 S.Ct. 805, 86 L.Ed. --.\n If the language of the Revenue Act is to be given effect, the Government's view seems correct. The statute does not purport to allow a credit for a stated proportion of the total foreign taxes paid or the foreign taxes paid 'upon or with respect to' total foreign profits, but for taxes paid 'upon or with respect to' the subsidiary's 'accumulated profits', which, by definition, are its total taxable profits less taxes paid.\n If, as is admitted, the purpose is to avoid double taxation, the statute, as written, accomplishes that result. The parent receives dividends. Such dividends, not its subsidiary's profits, constitute its income to be returned for taxation. The subsidiary pays tax on, or in respect of, its entire profits; but, since the parent receives distributions out of what is left after payment of the foreign tax,-that is, out of what the statute calls 'accumulated profits', it should receive a credit only for so much of the foreign \n\n[316 \nU.S. 450, 453]\n\u00a0\n tax paid as relates to or, as the Act says, is paid upon, or with respect to, the accumulated profits.\n Hence we think that, under the plain terms of the Act, the Commissioner and the court below were right in limiting the credit by the use as multiplicand of a proportion of the tax paid abroad appropriately reflecting the relation of accumulated profits to total profits of the subsidiary. But the petitioner insists that the legislative history and a long indulged administrative construction require us, in effect, to elide the phrase 'upon or with respect to the accumulated profits' of the foreign subsidiary.\n Section 240(c) of the Revenue Act of 19187 allowed the domestic parent receiving dividends from a foreign subsidiary a credit for the same proportion of the taxes paid by the foreign corporation during the taxable year to any foreign country which the amount of the dividends received by the parent during the taxable year bore to the total taxable income of the subsidiary upon or with respect to which such taxes were paid.\n This provision had the same object as  131 of the Revenue Acts of 1936 and 1938; that is, to avoid double taxation. The difficulty with it was that it did not relate the credit to the accumulated profits or surplus of the subsidiary out of which the dividends were paid. Thus, if dividends were paid out of surplus earned in prior years, and it happened that the subsidiary paid no tax to the foreign country in the taxable year in question, the parent could claim no credit whatever. There were other eccentric results flowing from the provision of the Act of 1918\n\n\n In the Revenue Act of 1921  238(e)8 was the analogous section. The draftsman of the section stated to the Senate Committee in charge of the measure: 'I rewrote the old provision, safeguarding it from some abuses which \n\n[316 \nU.S. 450, 454]\n\u00a0\n it was open to and closing up some of the gaps that were in the old provision.' Section 238(e) is substantially the same as  131(f). The alterations of  240(c) of the Act of 1918 were made to permit identification of the accumulated profits of each taxable year out of which the dividends might have been paid and to give credit for a proportion of the subsidiary's taxes attributable to such accumulated profits.\n The Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee indicated that the calculation of the proportion of foreign tax paid would be exactly the same as it had been under the 1918 Act. But this would be true only if the dividends were paid in a given year out of the prior year's earnings and taxes were paid in the same year in respect of the same prior year's earnings. The petitioner seeks in this case to apply the proportion provided by the 1918 Act; but this is to ignore the alterations made in that Act in 1921 which have ever since been retained. In Committee hearings and in Congressional Reports with respect to the purpose and effect of the changes wrought by the 1921 Act there were statements indicating an understanding that the credit was to be proportioned to the dividends made available to the parent in this country.\n The Treasury made no regulation applicable to  238(e) of the Revenue Act of 1921. It provided a form for reporting the tax, which sanctioned the petitioner's method of computing the credit; and, from 1921 to 1930, the Commissioner calculated credits for foreign subsidiaries' taxes by that method. In 1930, however, the Treasury promulgated a new form which required the credit to be computed in the way the Commissioner did in the present case; and promulgated Regulations 77 under the Revenue Act of 1932, which, in Article 698, required the computation of the credit in the same manner. The regulations have since remained unchanged: See Regulations 103  19.131-3 and 19.131-8. Although \n\n[316 \nU.S. 450, 455]\n\u00a0\n the regulations definitely govern this case, and were made prior to the years in controversy, the petitioner insists that the antecedent administrative interpretation long in force renders it impossible for the Commissioner to promulgate a regulation changing for the future the earlier practice, even though the new regulation comports with the plain meaning of the statute. We think the contention cannot be sustained9.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 49 Stat. 1648, 1696, 52 Stat. 447, 506; 26 U.S.C.  131, 26 U.S.C.A.

G. S. Suppiger Company, \n314 \nU.S. 488\n, 62 S.Ct. 402, 86 L.Ed. --, decided this day, and involves the question whether the owner of a method patent who authorizes manufacturers to use it only with materials furnished by him may enjoin infringement by one who supplies \n\n[314 \nU.S. 495, 496]\n\u00a0\n the manufacturer with materials for use by the patented method and aids in such use.\n Petitioner brought the present suit for an injunction and an accounting for infringement of the Ellis Patent, No. 1,830,428, of November 3, 1931, for a method of reinforcing insoles in shoe manufacture. Respondents denied infringement and set up as a further defense petitioner's misuse of the patent by permitting its use only with the unpatented materials sold by petitioner. The District Court, 32 F.Supp. 690, sustained this defense and the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed. 117 F.2d 829. We granted certiorari, \n313 \nU.S. 558\n, 61 S.Ct. 1117, because of the importance of the question presented and because we wished to consider this with the Mortion Salt Company case.\n Claim 4 of the patent is for a method 'of reinforcing insoles which comprises applying, at room temperature, to a strip of reinforcing material provided with a dry coating of a cement having a substantial rubber content, a coating of adhesive containing a relatively large amount of rubber and of such a character that it will be effective even when freshly applied to cause quick adhesion of the reinforcing material and the material of the insole, and applying to each other, still at room temperature, a portion of the coated strip and the insole to be reinforced.' Both courts below sustained the validity of claim 4 and held it was infringed by respondents' selling to purchasers of petitioner's materials like material for use with the patented process. But both held that petitioner was debarred from enjoining the infringement because of the manner of conducting its business, which is to supply shoe manufacturers, for use in reinforcing insoles, pre-coated fabric which it has slit into strips of suitable width for use by the patented method. If the manufacturer desires he provides the fabric and petitioner pre-coats and slits it. Petitioner \n\n[314 \nU.S. 495, 497]\n\u00a0\n supplies adhesive of high rubber content to be applied to the pre-coated fabric at the factory, just before the application of the reinforcing material to the insole. It also furnishes patented machines suitable for applying the adhesive to the strips, the machines remaining petitioner's property.\n As compensation petitioner makes a single charge to the shoe manufacturer at a rate per web yard of fabric used, and if the manufacturer does not furnish the fabric the price of that is added to the charge. Petitioner has not granted to shoe manufacturers, or asked them to take, written licenses. The courts below held that petitioner's sale to manufacturers of the unpatented materials for use by the patented method operated as a license to use the patent with that material alone and thus restrained competition with petitioner in the sale of the unpatented material, as in Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Corp., \n283 \nU.S. 27\n, 51 S. Ct. 334, and Leitch Mfg. Co. v. Barber Co., \n302 \nU.S. 458\n, 58 S.Ct. 288.\n Petitioner insists that the respondents' acts of infringement, as found by the district court, were not limited to the sale of material for use by the patented method as in the Carbice and Leitch cases, but amounted to active inducement of infringement by the shoe manufacturers and to cooperation with their infringing acts. Petitioner argues that even though under the Carbice and Leitch cases it has 'no right to be free from competition in the sale' of the materials, it has the right under the patent law to restrain infringement in any manner other than by the competitive sale of the unpatented materials.\n We may assume, for purposes of decision, that respondents' infringement did extend beyond the mere sale of the materials to the manufacturers. But in view of petitioner's use of the patent as the means of establshing a limited monopoly in its unpatented materials, and for the reasons given in our opinion in the Morton Salt Company case, \n\n[314 \nU.S. 495, 498]\n\u00a0\n we hold that the maintenance of this suit to restrain any form of infringement is contrary to public policy, and that the district court rightly dismissed it.\n It is without significance that, as petitioner contends, it is not practicable to exploit the patent rights by granting licenses because of the preferences of manufacturers and of the methods by which petitioner has found it convenient to conduct its business. The patent monopoly is not enlarged by reason of the fact that it would be more convenient to the patentee to have it so, or because he cannot avail himself of its benefits within the limits of the grant.\n Despite this contention, petitioner suggests that it is entitled to relief because it is now willing to give unconditional licenses to manufacturers on a royalty basis, which it offers to do. It will be appropriate to consider petitioner's right to relief when it is able to show that it has fully abandoned its present method of restraining competition in the sale of unpatented articles and that the consequences of that practice have been fully dissipated.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","6":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBAKERY DRIVERS LOCAL v. WOHL(1942)\nNo. 901\nArgued: January 13, 1942Decided: March 30, 1942\n\n\n\n Messrs. Edward C. Maguire and Samuel J. Cohen, both of New York City, for petitioners.\n Messrs. Arthur Steinberg and Joseph Apfel, both of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioners are a labor union and certain of its officers. The union membership consists of truck drivers occupied in the distribution of baked goods. The respondents Wohl and Platzman are, and for some years have \n\n[315 \nU.S. 769, 770]\n\u00a0\n been peddlers of baked goods. They buy from bakeries and sell and deliver to small retailers, and keep the difference between cost and selling price, which in the case of Wohl is approximately thirty-two dollars a week, and in the case of Platzman, about thirty-five dollars a week. Out of this each must absorb credit losses and maintain a delivery truck which he owns- but has registered in the name of his wife. Both are men of family. Neither has any employee or assistant. Both work seven days a week, Wohl putting in something over thirty-three hours a week, and Platzman about sixty-five hours a week. It was found that neither has any contract with the bakeries from whom he buys, and it does not appear that either had a contract with any customer.\n The conflict between the union and these peddlers grows out of certain background facts found by the trial court and summarized here. The union has for some years been engaged in obtaining collective bargaining agreements prescribing the wages, hours, and working conditions of bakery drivers. Five years before the trial there were in New York City comparatively few peddlers or so-called independent jobbers-fifty at most, consisting largely of men who had a long-established retail trade. About four years before the trial the social security and unemployment compensation laws, both of which imposed taxes on payrolls, became effective in the State of New York. Thereafter the number of peddlers of bakery products increased from year to year until at the time of hearing they numbered more than five hundred. In the eighteen months preceding the hearings, baking companies which operated routes through employed drivers had notified the union that at the expiration of their contracts they would no longer employ drivers but would permit the drivers to purchase trucks for nominal amounts, in some instances fifty dollars, and thereupon to continue to distribute their baked goods as peddlers. Within such period a hundred \n\n[315 \nU.S. 769, 771]\n\u00a0\n and fifty drivers who were members of the union and had previously worked under union contracts and conditions were discharged and required to leave the industry unless they undertook to act as peddlers.\n The peddler system has serious disadvantages to the peddler himself. The court has found that he is not covered by workmen's compensation insurance, unemployment insurance, or by the social security system of the State and Nation. His truck is usually uninsured against public liability and property damage, and hence commonly carried in the name of his wife or other nominee. If injured while working, he usually becomes a public charge, and his family must be supported by charity or public relief.\n The union became alarmed at the aggressive inroads of this kind of competition upon the employment and living standards of its members. The trial court found that if employers with union contracts are forced to adopt the 'peddler' system, 'the wages, hours, working conditions, six-day week, etc., attained by the union after long years of struggle will be destroyed and lost.' In the spring of 1938 the union made an effort in good faith to persuade the peddlers to become members, and those who desired were admitted to membership and were only required to abide by the same constitution, by-laws, rules and regulations as were all other members. That, however, included a requirement that no union member should work more than six days per week.\n These particular peddlers were asked to join the union, and each signed an application, but neither joined. The union then determined to seek an understanding with peddlers who failed to join the union that they work only six days a week and employ an unemployed union member one day in a week. The union did not insist that the relief man be paid beyond the time that he actually worked, but \n\n[315 \nU.S. 769, 772]\n\u00a0\n asked that he be paid on the basis of the union's daily wage, which fixed a scale for part of a day if but part of a day was required for the service of the route. For some ten weeks Wohl employed a relief driver, who was paid $6.00 per day, the normal day's wage for a full day being.$9. 00.\n When Wohl and Platzman finally refused either to join the union or to employ a union relief man, and continued to work seven days each week, the union took the measures which led to this litigation. On the twenty-third of January, 1939, the union caused two pickets to walk in the vicinity of the bakery which sold products to Wohl and Platzman, each picket carrying a placard, one bearing the name of Wohl and the other that of Platzman, and under each name appeared the following statement: 'A bakery route driver works seven days a week. We ask employment for a union relief man for one day. Help us spread employment and maintain a union wage, hours and conditions. Bakery and Pastry Drivers and Helpers Local 802, I.B. of T. Affiliated with A.F.L.' The picketing on that day lasted less than two hours. Again, on the twenty-fifth of January, the union caused two pickets to display the same placards in the same vicinity for less than an hour; and on the same day a picket with a placard bearing the name of Wohl over the same statement, picketed for a very short time in the vicinity of another bakery from which Wohl had purchased baked products. It was also found that a member of the union followed Platzman as he was distributing his products and called on two or three of his customers, advising them that the union was seeking to persuade Platzman to work but six days per week and employ a union driver as a relief man, and stating to one that in the event he continued to purchase from Platzman a picket would be placed in the vicinity on the following day with a placard reading as set forth above. It does not appear that this threat was carried out. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 769, 773]\n\u00a0\n The trial court found that the placards were truthful and accurate in all respects; that the picketing consisted of no more than two pickets at any one time and was done in a peaceful and orderly manner, without violence or threat thereof; that it created no disorder; that it was not proved that any customers turned away from such bakeries by reason of the picketing; and it was not established that the respondents sustained any monetary loss by reason thereof.\n The trial court issued injunctions which restrained the union and its officers and agents from picketing either the places of business of manufacturing bakers who sell to the respondents or the places of business of their customers. Sup., 14 N.Y.S.2d 198. The judgment was affirmed without opinion by the Appellate Division of the First Department, two Justices thereof dissenting with opinion, 259 App.Div. 868, 19 N.Y.S.2d 811; and was affirmed without opinion by the Court of Appeals, 284 N.Y. 788, 31 N.E.2d 765. This Court denied a petition for a writ of certiorari because it did not appear that the federal question presented by the petition had necessarily been decided by the Court of Appeals. \n313 \nU.S. 572\n, 61 S.Ct. 960. The Court of Appeals later certified that such question had been passed upon, a petition for rehearing was granted, the writ of certiorari granted, and the judgment summarily reversed. \n313 \nU.S. 548\n, 61 S.Ct. 1108. We later granted another petition for rehearing, and have since heard argument. \n314 \nU.S. 704\n, 62 S.Ct. 118, 86 L.Ed. --.\n The controversy in the trial court centered about the issue as to whether a labor dispute was involved within the meaning of New York statutes. The trial court found itself constrained to hold that no labor dispute was involved and seemed to be of the impression that therefore no Constitutional rights were involved. It concluded as a matter of law that the respondents 'are the sole persons required to run their business and therefore they are not \n\n[315 \nU.S. 769, 774]\n\u00a0\n subject to picketing by a union or by the defendants who seek to compel them to employ union labor.' The trial court refused the petitioners' request for a finding that 'it was lawful for the defendants to truthfully advise the public of its cause, whether in the vicinity of the places of business of bakers who sold to the plaintiffs, or otherwise.' Likewise, it refused a request to find 'that it was a constitutional right of the defendants to advise the public accurately and truthfully and without violence or breach of the peace, that defendants worked seven days a week and that the defendants were seeking to secure employment from the plaintiffs for unemployed members of the union one day a week.'\n So far as we can ascertain from the opinions delivered by the state courts in this case, those courts were concerned only with the question whether there was involved a labor dispute within the meaning of the New York statutes and assumed that the legality of the injunction followed from a determination that such a dispute was not involved. Of course that does not follow: one need not be in a 'labor dispute' as defined by state law to have a right under the Fourteenth Amendment to express a grievance in a labor matter by publication unattended by violence, coercion, or conduct otherwise unlawful or oppressive.\n The respondents say that the basis of the decision below was revealed in a subsequent opinion of the Court of Appeals, where it was said with regard to the present case that 'we held that it was an unlawful labor objective to attempt to coerce a peddler employing no employees in his business and making approximately thirty-two dollars a week, to hire an employee at nine dollars a day for one day a week.' Opera on Tour v. Weber, 285 N.Y. 348, 357, 34 N.E.2d 349, 353, 136 A.L.R. 267, certiorari denied \n314 \nU.S. 615\n, 62 S.Ct. 96, 86 L.Ed. --. But this lacks the deliberateness and formality of a certification,1 \n\n[315 \nU.S. 769, 775]\n\u00a0\n and was uttered in a case where the question of the existence of a right to free speech under the Fourteenth Amendment was neither raised nor considered.\n We ourselves can perceive no substantive evil of such magnitude as to mark a limit to the right of free speech which the petitioners sought to exercise. The record in this case does not contain the slightest suggestion of embarrassment in the task of governance; there are no findings and no circumstances from which we can draw the inference that the publication was attended or likely to be attended by violence, force or coercion, or conduct otherwise unlawful or oppressive; and it is not indicated that there was an actual or threatened abuse of the right to free speech through the use of excessive picketing. A state is not required to tolerate in all places and all circumstances even peaceful picketing by an individual. But so far as we can tell, respondents' mobility and their insulation from the public as middlemen made it practically impossible for petitioners to make known their legitimate grievances to the public whose patronage was sustaining the peddler system except by the means here employed and contemplated; and those means are such as to have slight, if any, repercussions upon the interests of strangers to the issue.\n The decision of the Court of Appeals must accordingly be reversed.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, concurring.\n If the opinion in this case means that a State can prohibit picketing when it is effective but may not prohibit it when it is ineffective, then I think we have made a basic departure from Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88\n, 60 S.Ct. 736. We \n\n[315 \nU.S. 769, 776]\n\u00a0\n held in that case that 'the dissemination of information concerning the facts of a labor dispute must be regarded as within that area of free discussion that is guaranteed by the Constitution.' 310 U.S. page 102, 60 S.Ct. page 744. While we recognized that picketing could be regulated, we stated at pages 104, 105 of 310 U.S., at page 745 of 60 S.Ct .: 'Abridgment of the liberty of such discussion can be justified only where the clear danger of substantive evils arises under circumstances affording no opportunity to test the merits of ideas by competition for acceptance in the market of public opinion.' And we added at page 105 of 310 U.S., at page 745 of 60 S.Ct.: 'But no clear and present danger of destruction of life or property, or invasion of the right of privacy, or breach of the peace can be thought to be inherent in the activities of every person who approaches the premises of an employer and publicizes the facts of a labor dispute involving the latter.' For that reason we invoked the test, employed in comparable situations (Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296, 307\n, 60 S.Ct. 900, 904, 128 A.L.R. 1352; Bridges v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 252\n, 62 S. Ct. 190, 86 L.Ed. --) that the statute which is the source of the restriction on free speech must be 'narrowly drawn to cover the precise situation giving rise to the danger.' 310 U.S. page 105, 60 S.Ct. page 746\n\n\n We recognized that picketing might have a coercive effect: 'It may be that effective exercise of the means of advancing public knowledge may persuade some of those reached to refrain from entering into advantageous relations with the business establishment which is the scene of the disputs. Every expression of opinion on matters that are important has the potentiality of inducing action in the interests of one rather than another group in society.' 310 U.S. page 104, 60 S.Ct. page 745.\n Picketing by an organized group is more than free speech, since it involves patrol of a particular locality and since the very presence of a picket line may induce action of one kind or another, quite irrespective of the nature of the ideas which are being disseminated. Hence those as- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 769, 777]\n\u00a0\n pects of picketing make it the subject of restrictive regulation.\n But since 'dissemination of information concerning the facts of a labor dispute' is constitutionally protected, a State is not free to define 'labor dispute' so narrowly as to accomplish indirectly what it may not accomplish directly. That seems to me to be what New York has done here. Its statute (Civil Practice Act,  876-a) as construed and applied in effect eliminates communication of ideas through peaceful picketing in connection with a labor controversy arising out of the business of a certain class of retail bakers. But the statute is not a regulation of picketing per se-narrowly drawn, of general application, and regulating the use of the streets by all picketeers. In substance it merely sets apart a particular enterprise and frees it from all picketing. If the principles of the Thornhill case are to survive, I do not see how New York can be allowed to draw that line.\n Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice MURPHY join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Compare Ex parte State of Texas, \n315 \nU.S. 8\n, 62 S.Ct. 418, 86 L.Ed . --. \n\n\n\n\n","7":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBETTS v. BRADY(1942)\nNo. 837\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1942\n\n\n\n\n[316 \nU.S. 455, 456]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Jesse Slingluff, Jr., G. Van Velsor Wolf, and William L. Marbury, Jr., all of Baltimore, Md., for petitioner.\n Messrs. William C. Walsh, of Baltimore, Md., and Robert E. Clapp, Jr., of Frederick, Md., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner was indicted for robbery in the Circuit Court of Carroll County, Maryland. Due to lack of funds \n\n[316 \nU.S. 455, 457]\n\u00a0\n he was unable to employ counsel, and so informed the judge at his arraignment. He requested that counsel be appointed for him. The judge advised him that this could not be done as it was not the practice in Carroll County to appoint counsel for indigent defendants save in prosecutions for murder and rape.\n Without waiving his asserted right to counsel the petitioner pleaded not guilty and elected to be tried without a jury. At his request witnesses were summoned in his behalf. He cross-examined the State's witnesses and examined his own. The latter gave testimony tending to establish an alibi. Although afforded the opportunity, he did not take the witness stand. The judge found him guilty and imposed a sentence of eight years.\n While serving his sentence, the petitioner filed with a judge of the Circuit Court for Washington County, Maryland, a petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleging that he had been deprived of the right to assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution. The writ issued, the cause was heard, his contention was rejected, and he was remanded to the custody of the prison warden.\n Some months later a petition for a writ of habeas corpus was presented to Hon. Carroll T. Bond, Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals of Maryland, setting up the same grounds for the prisoner's release as the former petition. The respondent answered, a hearing was afforded, at which an agreed statement of facts was offered by counsel for the parties, the evidence taken at the petitioner's trial was incorporated in the record, and the cause was argued. Judge Bond granted the writ but, for reasons set forth in an opinion, denied the relief prayed and remanded the petitioner to the respondent's custody.\n The petitioner applied to this court for certiorari directed to Judge Bond. The writ was issued on account of the importance of the jurisdictional questions involved \n\n[316 \nU.S. 455, 458]\n\u00a0\n and conflicting decisions1 upon the constitutional question presented. In awarding the writ, \n315 \nU.S. 791\n, 62 S.Ct. 639, 86 L.Ed. --, we requested counsel to discuss the jurisdiction of this court, 'particularly (1) whether the decision below is that of a court within the meaning of section 2372 of the Judicial Code, and (2) whether state remedies, either by appeal or by application to other judges or any other state court, have bene exhausted.'\n\n 1. \nSec. 237 of the Judicial Code declares this court competent to review, upon certiorari, 'any cause wherein a final judgment ... has been rendered ... by the highest court' of a state 'in which a decision could be had' on a federal question. Was Judge Bond's judgment that of a court within the meaning of the statute? Answer must be made in the light of the applicable law of Maryland.\n Art. 4,  6 of the State Constitution provides: 'All Judges shall by virtue of their offices be Conservators of the Peace throughout the State;' Sec. 1 of Art. 42 of the Public General Laws of Maryland (Flack's 1939 Edition) invests the Court of Appeals and the Chief Judge thereof, the Circuit Courts for the respective counties, and the several judges thereof, the Superior Court of Baltimore City, the Court of Common Pleas of that city, the Circuit Court and Circuit Court No. 2 of Baltimore City, the Baltimore City Court, and the judges of the said courts, out of court, and the Judge of the Court of Appeals from the City of Baltimore, with power to grant writs of habeas corpus and to exercise jurisdiction in all matters pertaining thereto. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 455, 459]\n\u00a0\n Although it is settled that the grant to the Court of Appeals of the power to issue the writ is unconstitutional and void,3 and although the statute does not confer on individual judges of the Court of Appeals the power to issue a writ and proceed thereon, nevertheless, those judges, as conservators of the peace, have the power under the quoted section of the Constitution. \n4\n In any event, Judge Bond is the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals and the judge of that court from the City of Baltimore and, as such, is empowered to act.\n Sections 2 to 6, inclusive, 9 to 12 inclusive, and 17 of the statute prescribe the procedure governing the issue of the writ, its service, the return, and the hearing. No question is made but that Judge Bond complied with these provisions. It is, therefore, apparent that in all respects he acted in a judicial capacity and that, in his proper person, he was a judicial tribunal having jurisdiction, upon pleadings and proofs, to hear and to adjudicate the issue of the legality of the petitioner's detention. If Judge Bond had been sitting in term time as a member of a court, clothed with power to act as one of the members of that court, his judgment would be that of a court within the scope of  237. Doubt that his judgment in the present instance is such arises out of our decision in McKnight v. James, \n155 \nU.S. 685\n, 15 S.Ct. 248, where we refused to review the denial of a discharge by a judge of an inferior court of Ohio who issued the writ and heard the case at chambers. It appeared that the petitioner had addressed his petition to a judge of the Circuit Court instead of the court itself and that, for this reason, the order of the judge was not reviewable by the Supreme Court of Ohio as it would have been had the writ been addressed \n\n[316 \nU.S. 455, 460]\n\u00a0\n to the Circuit Court though heard by a single judge. The petitioner had not exhausted his state remedy since, though he could have obtained a decision by the highest court of the state, he had avoided doing so, and then sought to come to this court directly from the order of the Circuit judge on the theory that that judge's order was the final order of the highest court of the state which could decide his case. In a later decision we referred to this and other cognate cases as deciding that appeals do not lie to this court from orders by judges at chambers,5 but the fundamental reason for denying our jurisdiction was that the appellant had not exhausted state remedies.\n In view of what has been said of the power of Judge Bond as a judicial tribunal to hear and finally decide the cause, and of the judicial quality of his action, we are of opinion that his judgment was that of a court within the intendment of Sec. 237.\n\n 2. \nDid the judgment entered comply with the requirement of Sec. 237 that it must be a final judgment rendered by the highest court in which a decision could be had? Again answer must be made in the light of the applicable law of Maryland. The judgment was final in the sense that an order of a Maryland judge in a habeas corpus case, whatever the court to which he belongs, is not reviewable by any other court of Maryland except in specific instances named in statutes which are here inapplicable. \n6\n It is true that the order was not final, and the petitioner has not exhausted state remedies in the sense that in Maryland, as in England, in many of the states, and in the federal courts, a prisoner may apply succes- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 455, 461]\n\u00a0\n sively to one judge after another and to one court after another without exhausting his right. \n7\n We think this circumstance does not deny to the judgment in a given case the quality of finality requisite to this court's jurisdiction. Although the judgment is final in the sense that it is not subject to review by any other court of the State, we may, in our discretion, refuse the writ when there is a higher court of the State to which another petition for the relief sought could be addressed,8 but this is not such a case. To hold that, since successive applications to courts and judges of Maryland may be made as of right, the judgment in any case is not final, would be to deny all recourse to this court in such cases.\n Since Judge Bond's order was a final disposition by the highest court of Maryland in which a judgment could be had of the issue joined on the instant petition we have jurisdiction to review it.\n\n 3. \nWas the petitioner's conviction and sentence a deprivation of his liberty without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, because of the court's refusal to appoint counsel at his request?\n The Sixth Amendment of the national Constitution applies only to trials in federal courts. \n9\n The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not incorporate, \n\n[316 \nU.S. 455, 462]\n\u00a0\n as such, the specific guarantees found in the Sixth Amendment10 although a denial by a state of rights or privileges specifically embodied in that and others of the first eight amendments may, in certain circumstances, or in connection with other elements, operate, in a given case, to deprive a litigant of due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth. \n11\n Due process of law is secured against invasion by the federal Government by the Fifth Amendment and is safeguarded against state action in identical words by the Fourteenth. The phrase formulates a concept less rigid and more fluid than those envisaged in other specific and particular provisions of the Bill of Rights. Its application is less a matter of rule. Asserted denial is to be tested by an appraisal of the totality of facts in a given case. That which may, in one setting, constitute a denial of fundamental fairness, shocking to the universal sense of justice, may, in other circumstances, and in the light of other considerations, fall short of such denial. \n12\n In the application of such a concept there is always the danger of falling into the habit of formulating the guarantee into a set of hard and fast rules the application of which in a given case may be to ignore the qualifying factors therein disclosed.\n The petitioner, in this instance, asks us, in effect, to apply a rule in the enforcement of the due process clause. He says the rule to be deduced from our former decisions is that, in every case, whatever the circumstances, one charged with crime, who is unable to obtain counsel, must be furnished counsel by the state. Expressions in the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 455, 463]\n\u00a0\n opinions of this court lend color to the argument,13 but, as the petitioner admits, none of our decisions squarely adjudicates the question now presented.\n In Powell v. Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45\n, 53 S.Ct. 55, 65, 84 A.L.R. 527, ignorant and friendless negro youths, strangers in the community, without friends or means to obtain counsel, were hurried to trial for a capital offense without effective appointment of counsel on whom the burden of preparation and trial would rest, and without adequate opportunity to consult even the counsel casually appointed to represent them. This occurred in a State whose statute law required the appointment of counsel for indigent defendants prosecuted for the offense charged. Thus the trial was conducted in disregard of every principle of fairness and in disregard of that which was declared by the law of the State a requisite of fair trial. This court held the resulting convictions were without due process of law. It said that, in the light of all the facts, the failure of the trial court to afford the defendants reasonable time and opportunity to secure counsel as a clear denial of due process. The court stated further that 'under the circumstances ... the necessity of counsel was so vital and imperative that the failure of the trial court to make an effective appointment of counsel was likewise a denial of due process', but added: 'whether this would be so in other criminal prosecutions, or under other circumstances, we need not determine. All that it is necessary now to decide, as we do decide, is that in a capital case, where the defendant is unable to employ counsel, and is incapable adequately of making his own defense because of ignorance, feeblemindedness, illiteracy, or the like, it is the duty of the court, whether requested or not, to assign \n\n[316 \nU.S. 455, 464]\n\u00a0\n counsel for him as a necessary requisite of due process of law; ....'\n Likewise, in Avery v. Alabama, \n308 \nU.S. 444\n, 60 S.Ct. 321, the state law required the appointment of counsel. The claim which we felt required examination, as in the Powell case, was that the purported compliance with this requirement amounted to mere lip service. Scrutiny of the record disclosed that counsel had been appointed and the defendant had been afforded adequate opportunity to prepare his defense with the aid of counsel. We, therefore, overruled the contention that due process had been denied.\n In Smith v. O'Grady, \n312 \nU.S. 329\n, 61 S.Ct. 572, the petition for habeas corpus alleged a failure to appoint counsel but averred other facts which, if established, would prove that the trial was a mere sham and pretense, offensive to the concept of due process. There also, state law required the appointment of counsel for one on trial for the offence involved.\n Those cases, which are the petitioner's chief reliance, do not rule this. The question we are now to decide is whether due process of law demands that in every criminal case, whatever the circumstances, a state must furnish counsel to an indigent defendant. Is the furnishing of counsel in all cases whatever dictated by natural, inherent, and fundamental principles of fairness? The answer to the question may be found in the common understanding of those who have lived under the Anglo- American system of law. By the Sixth Amendment the people ordained that, in all criminal prosecutions, the accused should 'enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.' We have construed the provision to require appointment of counsel in all cases where a defendant is unable to procure the services of an attorney, and where the right has not been intentionally and \n\n[316 \nU.S. 455, 465]\n\u00a0\n competently waived. \n14\n Though, as we have noted, the amendment lays down no rule for the conduct of the states, the question recurs whether the constraint laid by the amendment upon the national courts expresses a rule so fundamental and essential to a fair trial, and so, to due process of law, that it is made obligatory upon the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. Relevant data on the subject are afforded by constitutional and statutory provisions subsisting in the colonies and the states prior to the inclusion of the Bill of Rights in the national Constitution, and in the constitutional, legislative, and judicial history of the states to the present date. These constitute the most authoritative sources for ascertaining the considered judgment of the citizens of the states upon the question.\n The Constitutions of the thirteen original states, as they were at the time of federal union, exhibit great diversity in respect of the right to have counsel in criminal cases. Rhode Island had no constitutional provision on the subject until 1843, North Carolina and South Carolina had none until 1868. Virginia has never had any. Maryland, in 1776, and New York, in 1777, adopted provisions to the effect that a defendant accused of crime should be 'allowed' counsel. A constitutional mandate that the accused should have a right to be heard by himself and by his counsel was adopted by Pennsylvania in 1776, New Hampshire in 1774, by Delaware in 1782, and by Connecticut in 1818. In 1790 Massachusetts ordained that the defendant should have the right to be heard by himself or his counsel at his election. In 1798 Georgia provided that the accused might be heard by himself or counsel or both. In 1776 New Jersey guaranteed the accused the same privileges of witnesses and counsel as their prosecutors 'are or shall be entitled to.' Art. 16. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 455, 466]\n\u00a0\n The substance of these provisions of colonial and early state constitutions is explained by the contemporary common law. Originally in England a prisoner was not permitted to be heard by counsel upon the general issue of not guilty on any indictment for treason or felony. \n15\n The practice of English judges, however, was to permit counsel to advise with a defendant as to the conduct of his case and to represent him in collateral matters and as respects questions of law arising upon the trial. 16 In 1695 the rule was relaxed by statute17 to the extent of permitting one accused of treason the privilege of being heard by counsel. The rule forbidding the participation of counsel stood, however, as to indictments for felony, until 1836, when a statute accorded the right to defend by counsel against summary convictions and charges of felony. \n18\n In misdemeanor cases and, after 1695, in prosecutions for treason, the rule was that the defense must be conducted either by the defendant in person or by counsel, but that both might not participate in the trial. \n19\n\u00a0\n\n In the light of this common law practice, it is evident that the constitutional provisions to the effect that a defendant should be 'allowed' counsel or should have a right 'to be heard by himself and his counsel', or that he might be heard by 'either or both', at his election, were intended to do away with the rules which denied representation, in whole or in part, by counsel in criminal prosecutions, but were not aimed to compel the state to provide counsel for a defendant. At the least, such a construction by state courts and legislators can not be said to lack reasonable basis. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 455, 467]\n\u00a0\n The statutes in force in the thirteen original states at the time of the adoption of the Bill of Rights are also illuminating. It is of interest that the matter of appointment of counsel for defendants, if dealt with at all, was dealt with by statute rather than by constitutional provision. The contemporary legislation exhibits great diversity of policy. \n 20\n\u00a0\n\n The constitutions of all the states, presently in force, save that of Virginia, contain provisions with respect to the assistance of counsel in criminal trials. Those of nine \n\n[316 \nU.S. 455, 468]\n\u00a0\n states21 may be said to embody a guarantee textually the same as that of the Sixth Amendment or of like import. In the fundamental law of most states, however, the language used indicates only that a defendant is not to be denied the privilege of representation by counsel of his choice. \n22\n\u00a0\n\n In three states the guarantee, whether or not in the exact phraseology of the Sixth Amendment, has been held to require appointment in all cases where the defendant \n\n[316 \nU.S. 455, 469]\n\u00a0\n is unable to procure counsel. \n23\n In six the provisions (one of which is like the Sixth Amendment) have been held not to require the appointment of counsel for indigent defendants. \n24\n In eight, provisions, one of which is the same as that of the Sixth Amendment, have evidently not been viewed as requiring such appointment, since the courts have enforced statutes making appointment discretionary, or obligatory only in prosecutions for capital offenses or felonies. \n25\n\u00a0\n\n In twelve states it seems to be understood that the constitutional provision does not require appointment of \n\n[316 \nU.S. 455, 470]\n\u00a0\n counsel, since statutes of greater or less antiquity call for such appointment only in capital cases or cases of felony or other grave crime, 26 or refer the matter to the discretion of the court. 27 In eighteen states the statutes now require the court to appoint in all cases where defendants are unable to procure counsel. \n28\n But this has not always been \n\n[316 \nU.S. 455, 471]\n\u00a0\n the statutory requirement in some of those states. \n29\n And it seems to have been assumed by many legislatures that the matter was one for regulation from time to time as deemed necessary, since laws requiring appointment in all cases have been modified to require it only in the case of certain offenses. \n30\n\u00a0\n\n This material demonstrates that, in the great majority of the states, it has been the considered judgment of the people, their representatives and their courts that appointment of counsel is not a fundamental right, essential to a fair trial. On the contrary, the matter has generally been deemed one of legislative policy. In the light of this evidence we are unable to say that the concept of due process incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment obligates the states, whatever may be their own views, to furnish counsel in every such case. Every court has power, if it deems \n\n[316 \nU.S. 455, 472]\n\u00a0\n proper, to appoint counsel where that course seems to be required in the interest of fairness.\n The practice of the courts of Maryland gives point to the principle that the states should not be straight-jacketed in this respect, by a construction of the Fourteenth Amendment. Judge Bond's opinion states, and counsel at the bar confirmed the fact, that in Maryland the usual practice is for the defendant to waive a trial by jury. This the petitioner did in the present case. Such trials, as Judge Bond remarks, are much more informal than jury trials and it is obvious that the judge can much better control the course of the trial and is in a better position to see impartial justice done than when the formalities of a jury trial are involved. \n31\n\u00a0\n\n In this case there was no question of the commission of a robbery. The State's case consisted of evidence identifying the petitioner as the perpetrator. The defense was an alibi. Petitioner called and examined witnesses to prove that he was at another place at the time of the commission of the offence. The simple issue was the veracity of the testimony for the State and that for the defendant. As Judge Bond says, the accused was not helpless, but was a man forty-three years old, of ordinary intelligence and ability to take care of his own interests on the trial of that narrow issue. He had once before been in a criminal court, pleaded guilty to larceny and served a sentence and was not wholly unfamiliar with criminal procedure. It is quite clear that in Maryland, if the situation had been otherwise and it had appeared that the petitioner was, for any reason, at a serious disadvantage by reason of the lack \n\n[316 \nU.S. 455, 473]\n\u00a0\n of counsel, a refusal to appoint would have resulted in the reversal of a judgment of conviction. Only recently the Court of Appeals has reversed a conviction because it was convinced on the whole record that an accused tried without counsel had been handicapped by the lack of representation. \n 32\n\u00a0\n\n To deduce from the due process clause a rule binding upon the states in this matter would be to impose upon them, as Judge Bond points out, a requirement without distinction between criminal charges f different magnitude or in respect of courts of varying jurisdiction. As he says: 'Charges of small crimes tried before justices of the peace and capital charges tried in the higher courts would equally require the appointment of counsel. Presumably it would be argued that trials in the Traffic Court would require it.' And indeed it was said by petitioner's counsel both below and in this court, that as the Fourteenth Amendment extends the protection of due process to property as well as to life and liberty, if we hold with the petitioner logic would require the furnishing of counsel in civil cases involving property.\n As we have said, the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the conviction and incarceration of one whose trial is offensive to the common and fundamental ideas of fairness and right, and while want of counsel in a particular case may result in a conviction lacking in such fundamental fairness, we cannot say that the amendment embodies an inexorable command that no trial for any offense, or in any court, can be fairly conducted and justice accorded a defendant who is not represented by counsel.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 455, 474]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MURPHY concur.\n To hold that the petitioner had a constitutional right to counsel in this case does not require us to say that 'no trial for any offense, or in any court, can be fairly cnducted and justice accorded a defendant who is not represented by counsel.' This case can be determined by resolution of a narrower question: whethr in view of the nature of the offense and the circumstances of his trial and conviction, this petitioner was denied the procedural protection which is his right under the federal constitution. I think he was.\n The petitioner, a farm hand, out of a job and on relief, was indicted in a Maryland state court on a charge of robbery. He was too poor to hire a lawyer. He so informed the court and requested that counsel be appointed to defend him. His request was denied. Put to trial without a lawyer, he conducted his own defense, was found guilty, and was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment. The court below found that the petitioner had 'at least an ordinary amount of intelligence.' It is clear from his examination of witnesses that he was a man of little education.\n If this case had come to us from a federal court, it is clear we should have to reverse it, because the Sixth Amendment makes the right to counsel in criminal cases inviolable by the federal government. I believe that the Fourteenth Amendment made the sixth applicable to the states. \n1\n But this view, although often urged in dissents, has never been accepted by a majority of this Court \n\n[316 \nU.S. 455, 475]\n\u00a0\n and is not accepted today. A statement of the grounds supporting it is, therefore, unnecessary at this time. I believe, however, that under the prevailing view of due process, as reflected in the opinion just announced, a view which gives this Court such vast supervisory powers that I am not prepared to accept it swithout grave doubts, the judgment below should be reversed.\n This Court has just declared that due process of law is denied if a trial is conducted in such manner that it is 'shocking to the universal sense of justice' or 'offensive to the common and fundamental ideas of fairness and right.' On another occasion this Court has recgnized that whatever is 'implicit in the concept of ordered liberty' and 'essential to the substance of a hearing' is within the procedural protection afforded by the constitutional guaranty of due process. Palko v. Connecticut, \n302 \nU.S. 319, 325\n, 327 S., 58 S.Ct. 149, 152, 153.\n The right to counsel in a criminal proceeding is 'fundamental.' Powell v. Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45, 70\n, 53 S.Ct. '55, 64, 84 A.L. R. 527; Grosjean v. American Press Co., \n297 \nU.S. 233, 243\n, 244 S., 56 S.Ct. 444, 446. It is guarded from invasion by the sixth amendment, adopted to raise an effective barrier against arbitrary or unjust deprivation of liberty by the federal government. Johnson v. Zerbst, \n304 \nU.S. 458, 462\n, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1022\n\n\n An historical evaluation of the right to a full hearing in criminal cases and the dangers of denying it were set out in the Powell case where this Court said: 'What ... does a hearing include? Historically and in practice, in our own country at least, it has always included the right to the aid of counsel when desired and provided by the party asserting the right. ... Even the in- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 455, 476]\n\u00a0\n telligent and educated layman ... lacks both the skill and knowledge adequately to prepare his defense, even though he have a perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel in every step in the proceedings against him. Without it, though he be not guilty, he faces the danger of conviction because he does not know how to establish his innocence.' Powell v. Alagama, supra, \n287 \nU.S. 68, 69\n, 53 S.Ct. 64, 84 A. L.R. 527. Cf. Johnson v. Zerbst, supra, \n304 \nU.S. 462, 463\n, 58 S.Ct. 1022.\n A practice cannot be reconciled with 'common and fundamental ideas of fairness and right', which subjects innocent men to increased dangers of conviction merely because of their proverty. Whether a man is innocent cannot be determined from a trial in which, as here, denial of counsel has made it impossible to conclude, with any satisfactory degree of crtainty, that the defendant's case was adequately presented. No one questions that due process requires a hearing before conviction and sentence for the serious crime of robbery. As the Supreme Court of Wisconsin said in 1859, ' ... would it not be a little like mockery to secure to a pauper these solemn constitutional guaranties for a fair and full trial of the matters with which he was charged, and yet say to him when on trial, that he must employ his own counsel, who could alone render these guaranties of any real permanent value to him. ... Why this great solicitude to secure him a fair trial if he cannot have the benefit of counsel?' Carpenter v. Dane County, 9 Wis. 274, 276, 277.\n Denial to the poor of the request for counsel in proceedings based on charges of serious crime has long been regarded as shocking to the 'universal sense of justice' throughout this country. In 1854, for example, the Supreme Court of Indiana said: 'It is not to be thought of, in a civilized community, for a moment, that any citizen put in jeopardy of life or liberty should be debarred of counsel because he was too poor to employ such aid. No Court could be respected, or respect itself, to sit and hear \n\n[316 \nU.S. 455, 477]\n\u00a0\n such a trial. The defence of the poor, in such cases, is a duty resting somewhere, which will be at once conceded as essential to the accused, to the Court, and to the public.' Webb v. Baird, 6 Ind. 13, 18. And most of the other states have shown their agreement by constitutional provisions, statutes, or established practice judicially approved which assure that no man shall be deprived of counsel merely because of his proverty. \n2\n Any other practice seems to me to defeat the promise of our democratic society to provide equal justice under the law.\n\n\n APPENDIX.\n\n\n I.

On his naming counsel, the court will appoint or assign them. If from any cause, the prisoner decline to request or name counsel, and a trial is had, especially in the case of minors, the court will assign proper counsel. When counsel are assigned, the court will inquire of them, whether they have advised with the prisoner, so that he is ready to plead, and if not, will allow them proper time for that purpose. But it is usually the case that the prisoner has previously employed and consulted counsel, and of course is prepared to plead.' See Powell v.

Flack cites the Congressional debates, committee reports, and other data on the subject. Whether the amendment accomplished the purpose its sponsors intended has been considered by this Court in the following decisions, among others: O'Neil v.

In nine states, there are no clearly controlling statutory or constitutional provisions and no decisive reported cases on the subject. In two states, there are dicta in judicial decisions indicating a probability that the holding of the court below in this case would be fllowed under similar circumstances. In only two states (including the one in which this case arose) has the practice here upheld by this Court been affirmatively sustained. Appended to this opinion is a list of the several states divided into these four categories. \n\n\n\n\n","8":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOARD OF TRADE OF KANSAS CITY, MO. v.

Leffingwell, of Dallas, Tex., for appellees Texas Industrial Traffic League and others.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We have before us on this appeal orders embodying a series of determinations made by the Interstate Commerce Commission after inquiries into the grain rate structure stretching over a period of twelve years. The plaintiffs are millers, elevator companies, boards of trade, grain exchanges, and other business interests in Kansas City, St. Louis, Omaha, St. Joseph, Atchison, Leavenworth, and Minneapolis, the great grain centers known in the trade as 'primary markets'. The Commission's orders, they complain, create an unlawful discrimination under the Interstate Commerce Act,  1(5), 2, 3(1), 49 U.S.C.A.  1(5), 2, 3(1), by prohibiting the interruption of shipments of grain for the purpose of being stored, marketed, or processed-technically characterized as transit privileges-at these primary markets on the lower rates under which these privileges are available at competing interior points (i.e., \n\n[314 \nU.S. 534, 536]\n\u00a0\n grain centers other than primary markets). The District Court dismissed the complaint, 36 F.Supp. 865, and the case is here on appeal. Judicial Code  210, 28 U.S.C.  47a, 28 U.S.C.A.  47a.\n As one phase of the effort to relieve agricultural distress, Congress in 1925 by the Hoch-Smith Resolution directed the Interstate Commerce Commission to make a thorough investigation of the rate structure of common carriers 'in order to determine to what extent and in what manner existing rates and charges may be unjust ... or unduly preferential, thereby imposing undue burdens, or giving undue advantage as between the various localities and parts of the country, the various classes of traffic, and the various classes and kinds of commodities, and to make, in accordance with law, such changes, adjustments, and redistribution of rates and charges as may be found necessary to correct any defects so found to exist.' 43 Stat. 801, 49 U.S.C.  55, 49 U.S.C.A.  55.\n Accordingly, on September 30, 1926, the Commission instituted a comprehensive investigation into the rates and practices affecting grain and grain products in the Western District. \n1\n The Commission called its proceeding 'unusual', involving as it did 'three-score and more of major issues, affecting every part of a vast territorial domain, each of which would ordinarily present a case of more than average importance'. Grain and Grain Products Within the Western Dist. and for Export, 164 I.C.C. 619, 697. Extensive hearings were held, and on the basis of a huge record of some 53,000 pages of testimony, including 2,100 exhibits, 20,000 pages of memoranda, exceptions, and oral arguments, the Commission on July 1, 1930, issued a report and order prescribing maximum rates for grain and grain products. 164 I.C.C. 619. A supplemental report and order were issued on April \n\n[314 \nU.S. 534, 537]\n\u00a0\n 13, 1931. Grain and Grain Products Within the Western Dist. and for Export, 173 I.C.C. 511. Because the Commission did not take evidence relating to the drastic changes in economic conditions due to the depression occurring between the close of its hearings and the date of its orders, this Court set aside the orders. Atchison, etc., Ry. Co. v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 248\n, 52 S.Ct. 146. New and extensive hearings were thereupon held, and on October 22, 1934, the Commission in an elaborate report affirmed some of its earlier findings and modified others. Grain and Grain Products within the Western Dist. and for Export, 205 I.C.C. 301. Upon further consideration of the record, the Commission issued a supplemental order to remove discriminations between interior points. Grain and Grain Products Within the Western Dist. and for Export, 215 I.C.C. 83. Dealers at the primary markets thereupon filed formal complaints seeking modification of that part of the Commission's orders which differentiated between transit privileges at primary markets and those at interior points. Hearings upon these complaints produced more than 7,000 pages of new testimony and over 250 exhibits. On July 27, 1937, the Commission authorized but did not require the carriers to meet the requests of the primary markets. Grain Case Modifications, 223 I.C.C. 235. The carriers having declined to act on this authorization, the Commission was petitioned to enter a mandatory order. Proceedings were reopened, new arguments were heard, and on July 12, 1938, the Commission found that the prescribed rates did not subject the primary markets to any 'undue prejudice and disadvantage'. Grain Case Modifications, 229 I.C.C. 9, 16. Upon reconsideration this conclusion was affirmed on March 13, 1939. Grain Case Modifications, 231 I.C.C. 793. To upset these findings and to strike down the orders based upon them the present suit was filed.\n Since the transit privilege is at the core of this litigation, a brief exposition of its mechanics and manipulations becomes necessary. The privilege of transit enables grain to be shipped from point A to point B, there to be stored, marketed, or processed, and later \n\n[314 \nU.S. 534, 538]\n\u00a0\n reshipped to point C at a rate less than the combination of the separate rates from A to B and B to C. See Transit Case, 24 I.C.C. 340; Atchison, T . & S.F. Ry. v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 768\n, 777-779, 49 S.Ct. 494, 497, 498; Locklin, Economics of Transportation (1935) 122, 123, 629-631. The shipper pays the local rate on the inbound shipment to the transit point, B in our illustration. A receipted freight bill specifying the point of origin, the rate paid, and other pertinent data, is recorded with the transit bureau as evidence of intention of further transportation of the inbound grain or its equivalent. When the outbound shipment is tendered to the carrier, the freight bill is surrendered in order that the shipper may obtain an outbound rate lower than that which he would otherwise be compelled to pay. The privilege belongs, as it were, to both the grain and its shipper. 'The benefit attaching to grain shipped into the primary market is commonly so broad that it is transferable not only to another owner of the same grain, but to like grain coming from the same country point.' Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry. v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 768, 778\n, 49 S.Ct. 494, 498.\n This privilege was available in the primary markets under two different rate schemes: (1) the 'overhead through rate' and (2) the 'rate- break combination'.\n\n\n (1)\n An overhead through rate is the rate from an originating point to the final destination, or to a gateway like Chicago, via a particular point. Thus, on a shipment of grain from Enid, Oklahoma, to Chicago via Kansas City, the overhead through rate was 38.5 cents per hundred pounds. Under this rate, grain reaching Kansas City could receive the various privileges of transit upon payment of 23,5 cents (the local rate from Enid to Kansas City) upon the inbound shipment, and the difference (known as the 'transit balance') between the overhead through rate, 38.5 cents, and the 23.5 cents inbound rate, upon the outbound shipment. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 534, 539]\n\u00a0\n (2) On a 'rate-break' basis, however, grain moved on a combination of the local or flat rate from the originating point to the primary market and the 'proportional' rate from that market to a gateway or the final destination. The primary markets therefore came to be known as 'rate- break' points. The 'proportional' rate, representing an average of transit balances under overhead through rates, was designed to offset the competitive advantages of lines going through rate-break points as against lines starting there. The significance of the rate-break combination lay in the fact that for many points of origin there were no overhead through rates. In the above example, the proportional rate on outbound grain shipments from Kansas City to Chicago was 17.5 cents. The applicable rate on a shipment of grain from an originating point having no through rate to Chicago via Kansas City, with or without transit at Kansas City, was a combination of the local rate to Kansas City and the proportional rate from Kansas City to Chicago.\n Thus, the difference between the two systems permitting transit at primary markets was the rate at which the outbound traffic moved. Under the rate-break combination the outbound shipment moved at the proportional rate; under the overhead through rate, it moved at the transit balance. The availability of these two rate bases, the Commission found, gave rise to serious discriminations: 'Whether outbound shipments are at proportional rates or transit balances depends upon the selection of the inbound freight bill. If the inbound freight bill covers a shipment from an origin point from which there is no overhead rate with transit to final destination, the outbound shipment is at the proportional rate. But grain from a point from which there is no overhead rate with transit can, under present practice, be substituted for grain from a point from which there is such an overhead rate with transit, and can be forwarded, upon pres- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 534, 540]\n\u00a0\n entation of the inbound expense bill covering inbound transportation from the latter point, at the transit balance due that expense bill.' 164 I.C.C. 619, 634.\n'The uncertainty in advance as to the outbound basis of charge arises from the dependence of that charge upon a check of the individual shipper's range of inbound billing. The outbound charge will be a transit balance if the inbound freight bill surrendered covers a shipment from an origin from which there is a one-factor through rate less than the rate- break combination, and will be the higher proportional rate if the inbound freight bill surrendered covers a shipment from an origin from which there is no such one-factor through rate. Transit balances will vary with the measure both of the through rates and of the inbound rates to the transit point.\n\n'The advantage to the user of the transit balance over the user of the higher proportional rate is evident, and increases in the ratio of the increase in the storage capacity of the respective cash-grain dealers at the rate-break markets. In other words, the greater the storage capacity the wider the selection of inbound billing and proportionately more transit balances.' 205 I.C.C. 301, 335.\n\n In the judgment of the Commission these practices 'tended to disrupt the rate-break combinations, disorganize the general rate structure, make uncertain in advance the outbound basis of charge, give an undue preference to the users of transit balances over the users of proportional rates, depress the price of grain at the rate-break markets and, by direct reflection, at the country points, and reduce the revenues of the carriers.' 205 I.C.C. 301, 334.\n Thus, the issue before the Commission was 'whether the rates through the primary markets shall be made on the combination of flat rates to and proportional rates from the parkets exclusively, or in part, or at all.' Put- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 534, 541]\n\u00a0\n ting in the balance all the complex and conflicting interests, the Commission reached these conclusions: 'Just so long as transit balances remain a substantial factor in the adjustment of rates from the primary markets, just so long will there be undue preferences between outbound shippers, as well as general instability in rates resulting from shippers seeking the translation of transit balances into proportional rates. ... The best interests not only of the primary markets, but of the producer, consumer, and carrier will be served by the fullest possible application of the rate-break combinations through primary markets.' 164 I.C.C. 619, 644, 645.2\n Accordingly it prescribed new rate-break combinations3 and made them applicable to transit both at prim- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 534, 542]\n\u00a0\n ary markets and at interior points on routes passing through such markets. 4 The exclusive rate-break combinations were not made applicable to interior points not on routes passing through rate-break markets because the rate-break combinations had no relevance to these points. 164 I.C.C. 619, 645; 173 I.C.C. 511, 516, 517.\n A concrete illustration will rob this railroad jargon of its mystery. The through rate over numerous routes from Kansas City to Chicago was 16 cents. Some of these routes pass through Omaha, from which the proportional rate was also 16 cents. Other routes from Kansas City to Chicago do not pass through Omaha. Interior points like Falls City and Nebraska City, which are on routes through Omaha had to pay 6 1\/2 cents, the local rate to Omaha, plus 16 cents, the proportional rate from Omaha to Chicago. But other interior points lying between Kansas City and Chicago on routes not passing through Omaha were required to pay only the 16 cents through rate. The net result was that interior points on routes passing through rate-break markets were placed at a substantial competitive disadvantage with interior points not on such routes.\n Dealers at the interior points on routes passing through rate-break markets like Omaha petitioned the Commission to modify its orders so as to remove this discrimination between interior points. They urged on the Commission that inasmuch as the fundamental purpose of the rate-break combinations was the establishment of uniform proportional rates on outbound shipments from \n\n[314 \nU.S. 534, 543]\n\u00a0\n primary markets, this purpose would not be frustrated if, in order to meet the lower through rate over competitive routes, transit on the through rate were permitted at interior points on routes through rate-break markets. The Commission found that the requested modification would remove the discrimination between interior points without subjecting the primary markets to any new substantial competitive disadvantages. 215 I.C.C. 83, 92, 93. It found that under transit on an overhead through rate, dealers at interior points operated under important competitive disadvantages. The through rates were applicable only on 'reasonably direct', not 'markedly circuitous,' routes, and outbound shipments from the transit point were usually limited to the rails of either the inbound carrier or a carrier participating with it in a joint rate via the transit point. Dealers at rate-break markets, on the other hand, were free from such restrictions as to circuity of routes and choice of outbound carrier. The proportional rate was applicable to all lines from primary market to destination regardless of the inbound shipment's point of origin. The Commission found this to be a 'substantial advantage to the transit operators at the rate- break markets over the transit operators at the interior transit points'. 215 I.C.C. 83, 91. Accordingly, it modified its previous orders so as to permit transit at interior points on routes passing through a primary market 'on the basis of a lower rate in effect over a competing route between the same points'. 215 I.C.C. 83, 93.\n To give this order practical application: At all interior points lying on routes from Kansas City to Chicago, transit privileges were available at the 16 cents rate, while shipments stopping for transit at primary markets along such routes, e.g., Omaha, Atchison, Leavenworth, and St. Joseph, could move only at the rate-break combination of the 6 1\/2 cents inbound rate and the 16 cents outbound proportional rate. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 534, 544]\n\u00a0\n The crux of this litigation is the validity of the differentiation between primary markets and interior points thus made by the Commission in the setting of the whole history of grain rate regulation.\n Dealers at the primary markets complained against this differentiation. The Commission again canvassed the perplexing factors of the tangled problem before it. After pointing out that at the earlier stages of the grain rate inquiry 'especially the markets' had supported the system of 'rate-breaks at market points and overhead rates with transit at local points', the Commission observed: 'No extensive rate structure can be made perfect nor can any rate structure be made permanent in any real sense in a changing world. ... The two Grain cases together have demonstrated the impossibility, even on the part of those most experienced, most competent, and most expert, of seeing in advance the consequences of the particular changes in rates and practices here under consideration. Apparently nothing but experience can furnish a demonstration, and even the demonstration of experience may not prove to be conclusive unless it can be had on a scale sufficiently large and at intervals of time sufficiently close, and under substantially similar conditions.' 223 I.C.C. 235, 245, 246. It took occasion to recall these guiding considerations from its first report: 'It would be impossible to take any comprehensive action without adversely affecting certain of the conflicting interests upon this record. Nothing but experience can demonstrate what the effect will be regarding certain of these issues . ... All parties should cooperate to make careful note of the effect upon their interests, with the view to bringing to our attention from time to time, after a reasonable trial, those situations which may require further consideration.' 164 I.C.C. 619, 698. To yield to the wish of the dealers of the primary markets would, the Commission found, work 'a hardship upon the milling \n\n[314 \nU.S. 534, 545]\n\u00a0\n industry at many intermediate points, with little or no benefit to the markets, which would still be at a disadvantage in competing with other rate-break markets and interior points on lower-rated routes.' 223 I.C.C. 235, 245. It concluded, therefore, that the record did not justify the mandatory order sought by the markets. Instead it authorized the carriers by appropriate tariffs to make 'restricted departures from the exclusive application of proportional rates at rate-break points for a limited period of time' upon condition that such departures 'should be surrounded by such effective safeguards as will make it impossible to reestablish' the discriminations incident to the double system of rates at primary markets. 223 I.C.C. 235, 246.\n The carriers having declined to act on this authorization, the markets again sought a compulsory order. Upon reargument, the Commission concluded that 'the granting of the transit requested would break down the rate-break adjustment prescribed in the Grain Case; that said adjustment should be abandoned, if at all, only upon demonstration of its failure as a workable adjustment, over an adequate period of normal conditions in the grain trade; that such a test has not been given the adjustment'. 229 I.C. C. 9, 16.5 Accordingly, the Commission dismissed the complaints and withdrew its previous permission to the carriers voluntarily to establish the rates requested by the primary markets. After a second reargument the Commission adhered to this conclusion. 231 I.C.C. 793.\n The appellants do not claim that the Commission's findings are devoid of proof or that they were reached without observance of appropriate procedures. Their claim, in \n\n[314 \nU.S. 534, 546]\n\u00a0\n substance, is that whatever benefits the double system affords the primary markets are natural advantages, and that to deprive them of these advantages works an unlawful discrimination.\n The Act forbids the Commission to establish a rate structure which would give one transit point an 'undue or unreasonable preference or advantage' and would subject another point to an 'undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage'. But this does not mean that the law compels identity of treatment for like services at different places. It prohibits only 'undue' or 'unreasonable' discriminations. 'Whether a preference or advantage or discrimination is undue or unreasonable or unjust is one of those questions of fact that have been confided by Congress to the judgment and discretion of the Commission ..., and upon which its decisions, made the basis of administrative orders operating in futuro, are not to be disturbed by the courts except upon a showing that they are unsupported by evidence, were made without a hearing, exceed constitutional limits, or for some other reason amount to an abuse of power.' Manufacturers' Ry. Co. v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 457, 481\n, 38 S. Ct. 383, 389, see Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. v. Tennessee, \n262 \nU.S. 318, 322\n, 43 S.Ct. 583, 585; United States v. Chicago Heights Trucking Co., \n310 \nU.S. 344, 352\n, 353 S., 60 S.Ct. 931, 935, 936.\n The process of rate making is essentially empiric. The stuff of the process is fluid and changing-the resultant of factors that must be valued as well as weighed. Congress has therefore delegated the enforcement of transportation policy to a permanent expert body and has charged it with the duty of being responsive to the dynamic character of transportation problems. Cf. Railroad Commission v. Rowan & Nichols Oil Co., \n310 \nU.S. 573, 581\n, 582 S., 60 S.Ct. 1021, 1024.\n The wisdom of the narrow scope within which Congress has confined judicial participation in the rate-making process is strikingly vindicated by the history of this \n\n[314 \nU.S. 534, 547]\n\u00a0\n controversy. The Commission's laborious investigation into the grain rate structure disclosed that discriminations were inseparable from the operation, side by side, of two systems of rates allowing transit of grain at primary markets. This basic finding is not challenged. And it is this fact which created the problem for solution by the Commission. There was no ready answer either in law reports or in economic experience. Any solution had to rest on informed judgment. And judgment in a situation like this implies, ultimately, prophecy based on the facts in the record as illumined by the seasoned wisdom of the expert body. In this perspective, the Commission had several choices before it-but all inevitably rested upon trial and error. It might have established the overhead through rate as the exclusive basis of transit at primary markets. It might have banked on the exclusive rate-break combination. It might have abolished the privilege of free transit entirely. Of only one thing could the Commission be completely certain: no action could be taken without 'adversely affecting certain of the conflicting interests'. 164 I. C.C. 619, 698. Weighing the prospective gains and hurts which were part of all of the proposed remedies, the Commission decided upon the exclusive rate-break combination. It did so, however, with full recognition that the wisdom of its action had to meet the test of experience. Therefore, it treated its conclusion as part of a continuing process, and requested the parties to give the system which it adopted a 'reasonable trial', contemplating such further consideration as the practical operation of the system would require. The Commission refused the modifications asked by the appellants because the rate-break adjustment was 'entitled to a thorough test over an adequate period of normal conditions in the grain trade' and it had 'received no such fair test up to the present time'. To grant the re- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 534, 548]\n\u00a0\n quested modifications would 'break down the rate-break adjustment'. 229 I. C.C. 9, 15, 16. These findings are incontestable.\n That the Commission itself was of divided mind in the successive stages of this controversy emphasizes that the problem is enmeshed in difficult judgments of economic and transportation policy. Neither rule of thumb nor formula nor general principles provide a ready answer. We certainly have neither technical competence nor legal authority to pronounce upon the wisdom of the course taken by the Commission. It is not for us to tinker with so sensitive an organism as the grain rate structure only a minor phase of which is caught in the record before us. If we were to grant the relief sought by the appellants, we would be restoring evils which the exclusive rate-break adjustment was designed to remove-evils which, for all we know, would be far more serious than those complained of by the appellants.\n What we have said sufficiently disposes of the suggestion that the orders of the Commission must be stricken down because they wipe out natural competitive advantages of the primary markets. A rate structure found to involve serious discriminations among shippers, carriers, and transit points alike, is hardly a manifestation of nature beyond the Commission's power to repair.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS is of opinion that the decree of the District Court should be reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Western District is defined as the area 'on and west of the Mississippi River, west of Lakes Superior and Michigan, and west of and including Illinois'. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Commission specifically found that the adoption of the exclusive rate-break combination at the primary markets would give the markets substantial competitive advantages over interior transit points: 'The proportional rate is applicable over all outbound lines upon surrender of an inbound freight bill covering an inbound shipment by rail, whether the transportation through the rate-break market is over a reasonably direct route or not. It is the equivalent in all respects, and more, of a local rate. ... It is designed for the final gathering in by the rate-break market, for through transportation at less than the combinations of local rates that would otherwise apply, of grain not procurable under one-factor through rates less than the rate-break combinations (and resulting transit balances less than the proportional), because of the limitations on out-of-line and back-haul movement incident to the usual application of the one-factor through rates only over reasonably direct routes, and because of the further usual requirement of outbound shipment from the transit point over the rails of the inbound carrier. The proportional rates therefore open up to the rate-break markets the widest possible range of originating and distributing territory and afford, together with the larger number of carriers usually found converging inbound to and radiating outbound from the rate-break market, in the direction of the normal flow of the grain traffic, a decided advantage to that market over the interior transit point.' 205 I.C. C. 301, 340, 341. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Commission revised existing rate-break combinations, reducing both the inbound flat rates and the outbound proportionals, and ordered that the prescribed rate-break combinations be made the exclusive basis of charge upon grain shipments moving through or stopping for transit at primary markets, and that overhead through rates less than the prescribed rate-break combinations be cancelled. 164 I.C.C. 619, 645. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 'The restriction is laid on the intermediate points other than the market, as well as upon the market, in order not to discriminate against the market in favor of the other intermediate points.' 173 I.C.C. 511, 516. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] To rescind the previous modifications, the Commission found, 'would deprive these interior transit points of the same kind of transit accorded interior transit points on other routes and ... would not materially benefit complainants, who would still be confronted with their major competition'. 229 I.C.C. 9, 14. \n\n\n\n\n","9":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBONDHOLDERS COMMITTEE, MARLBOROUGH INV. CO., FIRST MORTG. BONDS(1942)\nNo. 128\nArgued: January 15, 1942Decided: February 2, 1942\n\n\n\n\n[315 \nU.S. 189, 190]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William Z. Kerr and Mr. Stephen V. Carey, both of Seattle, Wash., for petitioners.\n Mr. Samuel O. Clark, Jr., Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The primary question involved in these cases is whether the transaction in question qualified as a 'reorganization' under that portion of  112(i)(1) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 169, 198, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 513, which provides: 'The term 'reorganization' means ( A) a merger or consolidation (including the acquisition by one corporation of ... substantially all the properties of another corporation) ....'\n In 1927 the Marlborough Investment Co. issued its bonds in the principal amount of $500,000. They were secured by its apartment building in Seattle and the personal property therein. There was a default in May, 1932. A bondholders' committee was formed and there were deposited with it more than 97% of the total of over $450,000 face amount of the bonds than outstanding. In view of Helvering v. Alabama Asphaltic Limestone Co., 315 U.S. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 189, 191]\n\u00a0\n 179, 62 S.Ct. 540, 86 L.Ed. --, decided this day, the pracise mechanics whereby the reorganization was consummated are not material. Suffice it to say that pursuant to a plan of reorganization formulated by the committee under the broad powers accorded it in the deposit agreement, there was a foreclosure and sale; the committee was the successful bidder at the price of $340,425 which was paid by the surrender of deposited bonds plus cash; Marlborough House, Inc. was formed by the bondholders; it acquired the property from the committee and issued all of its stock to the depositing bondholders; and non-assenting bondholders were paid in cash their pro rata share of the purchase price. In determining the income tax liability of the committee1 for a part of 1933 and of the new corporation for a part of 1933 and for 1934 and 1935 the Commissioner used as the basis for computing depreciation the price bid at the foreclosure sale. The Board of Tax Appeals found that neither the fair market value of the deposited bonds plus the cash expended in partial payment nor the fair market value of the property was in excess of $340,425 at the date of the foreclosure sale or when the committee took possession. The Board held that since the new corporation had acquired the property in connection with a 'reorganization', it was entitled to use the basis in the hands of the old corporation, less depreciation. 40 B.T.A. 882. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 9 Cir., 118 F.2d 511.\n For the reasons stated in Helvering v. Alabama Asphaltic Limestone Co ., supra, this transaction clearly would have been a 'reorganization' within the meaning of  112(i)(1) but for one fact. That fact is that the prop- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 189, 192]\n\u00a0\n erty was not acquired by the committee or the new corporation from Marlborough Investment Co.2 In December, 1928, several years prior to the insolvency reorganization, Marlborough Investment Co., the issuer of the bonds, had transferred the property to another corporation. As a result of mesne conveyances the property was held in May, 1932 by State Developers, Inc. and one Cooley. While the foreclosure proceedings were pending that corporation and Cooley executed and delivered a quit claim deed to the property in consideration of the payment of the cash sum of $10,025 which was furnished by the committee.\n In view of these circumstances there was no 'reorganization' within the meaning of  112(i)(1). The parenthetical part of clause A which is relevant here covers 'the acquisition by one corporation' of substantially all of the properties 'of another corporation'. Clause B covers certain transfers 'by a corporation' of all or a part of its assets 'to another corporation' where the transferor or its stockholders continue in control. These were not 'properties' of Marlborough Investment Co. It had long since ceased to own them. It was not the 'transferor'. Furthermore,  113( a)(7), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 516, authorizes a carry-over of the basis of the properties3 in the hands of the 'transferor', not their basis in the hands of one who may have occupied an earlier position in the chain of ownership. Hence it is immaterial \n\n[315 \nU.S. 189, 193]\n\u00a0\n that under the rule of Helvering v. Alabama Asphaltic Limestone Co., supra, the bondholders had succeeded to all of the proprietary interest in Marlborough Investment Co. The property whose basis is in controversy here was not acquired from it. Nor was there a 'reorganization' as between the committee or the new corporation on the one hand and State Developers, Inc. and Cooley on the other. Cooley was an individual. The 'reorganization' provisions in question cover only inter-corporate transactions. Sec. 113(a)( 8), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 516, provides for a carry-over of the basis of the properties in the hands of the 'transferor' if the property was acquired by a corporation after December 31, 1920, by the issuance of its stock or securities 'in connection with a transaction' described in  112(b)(5). Sec. 112(b)(5) includes transfers by individuals; 4 but it requires that the transferor remain in control. Cooley and State Developers, Inc. were bought out for cash.\n It is argued that if the committee's acquisition of the properties is to be treated as a purchase rather than a 'reorganization', the cost to the committee should be measured by the amount of the cash advanced by the committee plus the face value of the deposited bonds. There is no foundation for that contention. The basis of assets bid in by a mortgage creditor on foreclosure is to be determined by the fair market value of the property. See Art. 193, Treasury Regulations 77; Helvering v. New President Corp., 8 Cir., 122 F.2d 92, 96, 97. Although the Commissioner used the bid price in ascertaining the basis, the Board found that the market value of the assets did not exceed that amount. Respondent therefore suggests that a re- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 189, 194]\n\u00a0\n mand to the Board to ascertain the fair market value is not necessary. Accordingly the judgment below is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The committee took possession of the property and managed it for a part of the year 1933 prior to the date when the new corporation acquired it. The Board held that the committee was taxable as a corporation on the income received during that period by it. The committee did not petition for review of that determination by the Circuit Court of Appeals. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Though respondent apparently did not urge this point before the Board or the court below, it may of course support the judgment here by any matter appearing in the record. Le Tulle v. Scofield, \n308 \nU.S. 415, 421\n, 60 S.Ct. 313, 316, and cases cited. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] By  114(a), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 519 the basis upon which depreciation is allowed is the adjusted basis provided in  113(b) for the purpose of determining gain or loss. By  113(b) such adjusted basis is the basis determined under  113(a). By  113(a) the basis of property shall be 'cost', with enumerated exceptions. One of those exceptions is contained in  113(a)(7) set forth in Palm Springs Holding Corp. v.

UNITED STATES(1942)\nNo. 43\nArgued: October 21, 1942Decided: November 9, 1942\n\n\n\n\n[317 \nU.S. 49, 50]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James J. Magner, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner braverman.\n Mr. John E. Dougherty, of Peoria, Ill., for petitioner Wainer.\n Messrs. Francis Biddle, Atty. Gen., and W. Marvin Smith, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The questions for decision are: (1) Whether a conviction upon the several counts of an indictment, each charging conspiracy to violate a different provision of the Internal Revenue laws, where the jury's verdict is supported by evidence of but a single conspiracy, will sustain a sentence of more than two years' imprisonment, the maximum penalty for a single violation of the conspiracy statute, and (2) whether the six-year period of limitation prescribed by  3748(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code  3748(a), is applicable to offenses arising under  37 of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. 88, 18 U.S.C.A.  88 (the conspiracy statute), where the object of the conspiracy is to evade or defeat the payment of a federal tax.\n Petitioners were indicted, with others, on seven counts, each charging a conspiracy to violate a separate and distinct internal revenue law of the United States. \n1\n On the trial there was evidence from which the jury could have found that for a considerable period of time petitioners, with others, collaborated in the illicit manufacture, trans- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 49, 51]\n\u00a0\n portation, and distribution of distilled spirits involving the violations of statute mentioned in the several counts of the indictment. At the close of the trial petitioners renewed a motion which they had made at its beginning to require the Government to elect one of the seven counts of the indictment upon which to proceed, contending that the proof could not and did not establish more than one agreement. In response the Government's attorney took the position that the seven counts of the indictment charged as distinct offenses the several illegal objects of one continuing conspiracy, that if the jury found such a conspiracy it might find the defendants guilty of as many offenses as it had illegal objects, and that for each such offense the two-year statutory penalty could be imposed.\n The trial judge submitted the case to the jury on that theory. The jury returned a general verdict finding petitioners 'guilty as charged', and the court sentenced each to eight years' imprisonment. On appeal the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, 125 F.2d 283, 286, on the authority of its earlier decisions in Fleisher v. United States, 91 F.2d 404, and Meyers v. United States, 94 F.2d 433. It found that 'From the evidence may be readily deduced a common design of appellants and others, followed by concerted action' to commit the several unlawful acts specified in the several counts of the indictment. It concluded that the fact that the conspiracy was 'a general one to violate all laws repressive of its consumma- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 49, 52]\n\u00a0\n tion does not gainsay the separate identity of each of the seven conspiracies'. We granted certiorari, \n316 \nU.S. 653\n, 62 S.Ct. 1037, to resolve an asserted conflict of decisions. \n2\n The Government, in its argument here, submitted the case for our decision with the suggestion that the decision below is erroneous.\n Both courts below recognized that a single agreement to commit an offense does not become several conspiracies because it continues over a period of time, see United States v. Kissel, \n218 \nU.S. 601, 607\n, 31 S.Ct. 124, 125; cf. Ex parte Snow, \n120 \nU.S. 274, 281\n, 283 S., 7 S.Ct. 556, 559, 560, and that there may be such a single continuing agreement to commit several offenses. But they thought that in the latter case each contemplated offense renders the agreement punishable as a separate conspiracy.\n The question whether a single agreement to commit acts in violation of several penal statutes is to be punished as one or several conspiracies is raised on the present record, not by the construction of the indictment, but by the Government's concession at the trial and here, reflected in the charge to the jury, that only a single agreement to commit the offenses alleged was proven. Where each of the counts of an indictment alleges a conspiracy to violate a different penal statute it may be proper to conclude, in the absence of a bill of exceptions bringing up the evidence, that several conspiracies are charged rather than one, and that the conviction is for each. See Fleisher v. United States, supra; Shultz v. Hudspeth, 10 Cir., 123 F.2d 729, 730. But it is a different matter to hold, as the court below appears to have done in this case and in Meyers v. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 49, 53]\n\u00a0\n United States, supra, that even though a single agreement is entered into, the conspirators are guilty of as many offenses as the agreement has criminal objects.\n The gist of the crime of conspiracy as defined by the statute is the agreement or confederation of the conspirators to commit one or more unlawful acts where 'one or more of such parties do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy'. The overt act, without proof of which a charge of conspiracy cannot be submitted to the jury, may be that of only a single one of the conspirators and need not be itself a crime. Bannon and Mulkey v. United States, \n156 \nU.S. 464, 468\n, 469 S., 15 S.Ct. 467, 469; Joplin Mercantile Co. v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 531, 535\n, 536 S., 35 S.Ct. 291, 292, 293; United States v. Rabinowich, \n238 \nU.S. 78, 86\n, 35 S.Ct. 682, 684; Pierce v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 239, 244\n, 40 S.Ct. 205, 207. But it is unimportant, for present purposes, whether we regard the overt act as a part of the crime which the statute defines and makes punishable, see Hyde v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 347\n, 357-359, 32 S.Ct. 793, 798, 799, Ann.Cas. 1914A, 614, or as something apart from it, either an indispensable mode of corroborating the existence of the conspiracy or a device for affording a locus poenitentiae, see United States v. Britton, \n108 \nU.S. 193\n, 2 S.Ct. 526; Id., \n108 \nU.S. 199, 204\n, 205 S., 2 S.Ct. 531, 534; Dealy v. United States, \n152 \nU.S. 539, 543\n, 547 S., 14 S.Ct. 680, 681, 683; Bannon and Mulkey v. United States, supra, \n156 \nU.S. 469\n, 15 S.Ct. 469; Hyde v. Shine, \n199 \nU.S. 62, 76\n, 25 S.Ct. 760, 761; Hyde v. United States, supra, \n225 \nU.S. 388\n, 32 S.Ct. 810, Ann.Cas.1914A, 614; Joplin Mercantile Co. v. United States, supra.\n For when a single agreement to commit one or more substantive crimes is evidenced by an overt act, as the statute requires, the precise nature and extent of the conspiracy must be determined by reference to the agreement which embraces and defines its objects. Whether the object of a single agreement is to commit one or many crimes, it is in either case that agreement which constitutes the conspiracy which the statute punishes. The one agreement cannot be taken to be several agreements and hence several conspiracies because it envisages the violation of several statutes rather than one. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 49, 54]\n\u00a0\n The allegation in a single count of a conspiracy to commit several crimes is not duplicitous, for 'The conspiracy is the crime, and that is one, however diverse its objects'. Frohwerk v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 204, 210\n, 39 S.Ct. 249, 252; Ford v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 593, 602\n, 47 S.Ct. 531, 534; United States v. Manton, 2 Cir., 107 F.2d 834, 838. A conspiracy is not the commission of the crime which it contemplates, and neither violates nor 'arises under' the statute whose violation is its object. United States v. Rabinowich, supra, \n238 \nU.S. 87\n- 89, 35 S.Ct. 682, 684, 685; United States v. McElvain, \n272 \nU.S. 633, 638\n, 47 S.Ct. 219, 220; see United States v. Hirsch, \n100 \nU.S. 33, 34\n, 35 S.. Since the single continuing agreement, which is the conspiracy here, thus embraces its criminal objects, it differs from successive acts which violate a single penal statute and from a single act which violates two statutes. See Blockburger v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 299\n, 301-304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 181, 182; Albrecht v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 1, 11\n, 12 S., 47 S.Ct. 250, 253, 254. The single agreement is the prohibited conspiracy, and however diverse its objects it violates but a single statute,  37 of the Criminal Code. For such a violation only the single penalty prescribed by the statute can be imposed.\n Petitioner Wainer contends that his prosecution was barred by the three-year statute of limitations, 18 U.S.C.  582, 18 U.S.C.A.  582, since the withdrew from the conspiracy more than three although not more than six years before his indictment. This Court, in United States v. McElvain, \n272 \nU.S. 633, 638\n, 47 S.Ct. 219, 220, and United States v. Scharton, \n285 \nU.S. 518\n, 52 S.Ct. 416, held that the three-year statute of limitations applicable generally to criminal offenses barred prosecution for a conspiracy to violate the Revenue Acts, since it was not within the exception created by the Act of November 17, 1921, 42 Stat. 220, now  3748(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S. C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  3748(a)(1), which provided a six-year statute of limitations 'for offenses involving the defrauding or attempting to defraud the United States or any agency thereof, \n\n[317 \nU.S. 49, 55]\n\u00a0\n whether by conspiracy or not'. To overcome the effect of these decisions, that Act was amended, Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 169, 288, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code  3748(a) by the addition of a second exception, which provided a six-year statute of limitations 'for the offense of willfully attempting in any manner to evade or defeat any tax or the payment thereof', and by the addition of a new paragraph, reading as follows:\n'For offenses arising under section 37 of the Criminal Code, ... where the object of the conspiracy is to attempt in any manner to evade or defeat any tax or the payment thereof, the period of limitation shall also be six years.'\n\n To be within this last paragraph it is not necessary that the conspiracy have as its object the commission of an offense in which defrauding or attempting to defraud the United States is an element. It is enough that the conspiracy involves an attempt to evade or defeat the payment of federal taxes, which was among the objects of the conspiracy of which petitioner was convicted. Enlargement, to six years, of the time for prosecution of such conspiracies was the expressed purpose of the amendment. See H.R.Rep.No.1492, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., 29.\n We do not pass upon petitioner Wainer's argument that his plea of former jeopardy should have been sustained, since the earlier indictment to which he pleaded guilty and which he insists charged the same offense as that of which he has now been convicted, is not a part of the record.\n The judgment of conviction will be reversed and the cause remanded to the district court where the petitioners will be resentenced in conformity to this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The seven counts respectively charged them with conspiracy, in violation of  37 of the Criminal Code, unlawfully (1) to carry on the business of wholesale and retail liquor dealers without having the special occupational tax stamps required by statute, 26 U.S.C.  3253, 26 U.S.C.A.

OF AMERICA(1942)\nNo. 772\nArgued: April 8, 1942Decided: June 1, 1942\n\n\n\n Mr. Clarence C. Chilcott, of Kansas City, Mo., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Dick H. Woods and Paul R. Stinson, both of Kansas City, Mo., for respondent. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 491, 492]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Excess Insurance Company of America, the respondent here, brought this suit for a declaratory judgment to determine its rights under a reinsurance agreement made in 1932 with the Central Mutual Insurance Company of Chicago, Illinois. By that contract the respondent agreed to reimburse Central, within specified limits, for any 'ultimate net loss' ( defined as 'the sum actually paid in cash in settlement of losses') sustained by Central under automobile public liability policies thereafter to be issued. Central undertook to notify the respondent of any accident that might be covered by the reinsurance agreement. In 1934 Central issued a public liability policy to Cooper-Jarrett, Inc. Later in that year the petitioner's decedent was killed by a truck leased by Cooper-Jarrett, Inc., and suit was brought against the latter in a Missouri state court. Central refused to defend the suit, however, claiming that the policy did not cover the accident.\n While the suit was pending both Central and Cooper-Jarrett, Inc., encountered financial difficulties. By order of an Illinois state court Central was liquidated and all claims against it barred. Cooper-jarrett, Inc., filed a petition for reorganization under  77B, Bankr.Act, 11 U.S.C. A.  207, in the Missouri federal district court, and the final decree in that proceeding discharged it from any judgment that had been or might be obtained by the petitioner. Cooper-Jarrett, Inc., having abandoned defense of the suit, the petitioner obtained a default judgment of $20,000 against it on April 22, 1939, and subsequently instituted garnishment proceedings against Central in a Missouri state court. Being unable to recover any part of the judgment from either Cooper-Jarrett, Inc., or Central, the petitioner on May \n\n[316 \nU.S. 491, 493]\n\u00a0\n 29, 1940, made the respondent a party to the garnishment proceeding through service on the Missouri superintendent of insurance.\n But in the meantime the respondent had filed this suit for a declaratory judgment in the federal District Court for Kansas. Its bill showed diversity of the parties' citizenship and the requisite jurisdictional amount. It alleged, inter alia, that when the bill in the federal suit was filed, the respondent was not a party to the garnishment proceeding in the state court; that, in violation of the terms of the reinsurance agreement, Central had never notified the respondent either of the accident resulting in the death of the petitioner's decedent or of the suit brought against Cooper-Jarrett, Inc.; that the respondent's only obligation under the reinsurance agreement was to indemnify Central against loss for sums actually paid in cash in settlement of losses for which Central was liable, and since Central had never satisfied the claim against Cooper-Jarrett, Inc., the respondent could not be obligated in any way under the reinsurance agreement; that Cooper-Jarrett, Inc., was not liable to the petitioner for the death of his decedent; that even if it were, Central was obligated to defend the suit, and its failure to do so discharged the respondent of any liability under the reinsurance agreement; that even if it were originally liable, the discharge of Central and Cooper-Jarrett, Inc., had the effect of releasing the respondent; and that in any event the default judgment against Cooper-Jarrett, Inc., had been fraudulently obtained.\n The petitioner moved to dismiss the suit, principally on the ground that the issues involved in the suit could now be decided in the garnishment proceeding pending in the Missouri state court. The District Court dismissed the bill, apparently because of a reluctance to prolong the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 491, 494]\n\u00a0\n litigation,1 without considering whether the claims asserted by the respondent could under Missouri law be raised in the pending garnishment proceeding. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that dismissal of the suit was an abuse of discretion, but instead of remitting the cause for a proper exercise of the District Court's discretion, reversed the judgment with directions that the District Court proceed to a determination on the merits. 10 Cir., 121 F.2d 776. In view of the important question affecting the interrelationship of the state and federal courts in the administration of the Federal Declaratory Judgments Act, 28 U.S.C.A.  400, we brought the case here. \n314 \nU.S. 606\n, 62 S.Ct. 482, 86 L.Ed. --.\n Although the District Court had jurisdiction of the suit under the Federal Declaratory Judgments Act, 28 U.S.C.A.  400, it was under no compulsion to exercise that jurisdiction. The petitioner's motion to dismiss the bill was addressed to the discretion of the court. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Quarles, 4 Cir., 92 F.2d 321; Maryland Casualty Co. v. Consumers Finance Service, 3 Cir., 101 F.2d 514; American Automobile Ins. Co. v. Freundt, 7 Cir., 103 F.2d 613; see Note, 51 Yale L. J. 511. Compare Canada Malting Co. v. Paterson Co., \n285 \nU.S. 413, 422\n, 423 S., 52 S.Ct. 413, 415; Douglas v. N.Y., N.H. & H.R. Co., \n279 \nU.S. 377\n, 49 S.Ct. 355. The motion rested upon the claim \n\n[316 \nU.S. 491, 495]\n\u00a0\n that since another proceeding was pending in a state court in which all the matters in controversy between the parties could be fully adjudicated, a declaratory judgment in the federal court was unwarranted. The correctness of this claim was certainly relevant in determining whether the District Court should assume jurisdiction and proceed to determine the rights of the parties. Ordinarily it would be uneconomical as well as vexatious for a federal court to proceed in a declaratory judgment suit where another suit is pending in a state court presenting the same issues, not governed by federal law, between the same parties. Gratuitous interference with the orderly and comprehensive disposition of a state court litigation should be avoided.\n Where a district court is presented with a claim such as was made here, it should ascertain whether the questions in controversy between the parties to the federal suit, and which are not foreclosed under the applicable substantive law, can better be settled in the proceeding pending in the state court. This may entail inquiry into the scope of the pending state court proceeding and the nature of defenses open there. The federal court may have to consider whether the claims of all parties in interest can satisfactorily be adjudicated in that proceeding, whether necessary parties have been joined, whether such parties are amenable to process in that proceeding, etc.\n We do not now attempt a comprehensive enumeration of what in other cases may be revealed as relevant factors governing the exercise of a district court's discretion. It is enough that it appears from the record before us that the District Court did not consider whether, under applicable local law, the claims sought to be adjudicated by the respondent in this suit for a declaratory judgment had either been foreclosed by Missouri law or could adequately be tested in the garnishment proceeding pending in the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 491, 496]\n\u00a0\n Missouri state court. This was a matter for determination, certainly in the first instance, by the District Court. Nor did the Circuit Court of Appeals, in reversing the judgment of the District Court, purport to find that under controlling Missouri law the issues set up by the respondent in this suit could not be contested in the pending Missouri proceeding. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Whether and under what circumstances a reinsurer can be reached through a judgment against the insured are questions of local law. Whether the judgment against Cooper-Jarrett, Inc., could serve as a basis for garnishment proceedings against the respondent was therefore a matter of Missouri law. But that issue was never tendered before the Kansas district court; that court did not profess to pass upon it, and the Circuit Court of Appeals, in reversing the decree of dismissal, shed no light upon it.\n If the lower courts had found that under Missouri law the respondent's claims could not adequately be tested in the pending garnishment proceeding, or that Missouri \n\n[316 \nU.S. 491, 497]\n\u00a0\n law on the subject was doubtful, and upon the basis of such a finding had taken jurisdiction of this suit for a declaratory judgment, we would not disturb such a finding. But no such finding can be extracted from this record. And it is not for us to attempt to pronounce independently upon Missouri law. To do so would be to disregard the limitations inherent in our appellate jurisdiction. It is not our function to find our way through a maze of local statutes and decisions on so technical and specialized a subject as the scope of a garnishment proceeding in a particular jurisdiction. For one thing, it is too easy to lose our way. For example, there are numerous decisions of the Supreme Court of Missouri which declare a general principle that the garnishee can assert any defenses in a garnishment proceeding that would be open in a suit brought against him by the judgment debtor. E.g., Weil v. Tyler, 38 Mo. 545, 547; McDermott v. Donegan, 44 Mo. 85, 89; Sheedy v. Second National Bank, 62 Mo. 17, 24, 21 Am.Rep. 407. We do not cite these decisions to show that the respondent's claims in this case could adequately be tested in the garnishment proceeding pending in the Missouri state court. For the crux of our ruling is that we should not be called upon to make such a determination in the first instance. But these utterances of the Missouri Supreme Court do serve as a warning that scattered opinions of an intermediate appellate court of a state may convey only doubts and confusion to one inexpert in the law of that state and yet be entirely clear and consistent when placed in the mosaic of the whole law of that state. Compare Mr. Justice Brandeis dissenting in Railroad Commission v. Los Angeles R. Corp., \n280 \nU.S. 145, 164\n, 50 S.Ct. 71, 76. We are not concerned here with the burden of proof in establishing facts as to which only the parties to a private litigation are interested. We are concerned rather with the duty of \n\n[316 \nU.S. 491, 498]\n\u00a0\n the federal courts to determine legal issues governing the proper exercise of their jurisdiction.\n The cause should be remanded to the District Court in order that it may properly exercise its discretion in passing upon the petitioner's motion to dismiss this suit.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS concurring.\n If we had here only the question as to whether the issues framed by respondent in this suit could be litigated in the statutory garnishment proceeding in Missouri, I would agree with the views expressed by the CHIEF JUSTICE. But there is the further, and for me the controlling, question whether, as stated by the majority, the claims raised by respondent had been 'previously foreclosed' under Missouri law. It is a fair inference from this record that respondent, like Central, received notice and had an opportunity to defend the suit brought against Cooper- Jarrett, although all of the attendant circumstances do not clearly appear. Under Missouri law the general rule seems to be that notice and opportunity to defend binds the reinsurer on judgments against the reassured. See e.g. Strong v. Phoenix Ins. Co., 62 Mo. 289, 21 Am. Rep. 417; Gantt v. American Central Ins. Co., 68 Mo. 503; City of St. Joseph v. Union Ry. Co., 116 Mo. 636, 643, 22 S.W. 794, 38 Am.St.Rep. 626; Finkle v. Western Auto. Ins. Co., 224 Mo.App. 285, 300, 26 S.W.2d 843. By statute (6 Mo.Stat.Ann.  5898, 5899) the liability of the insurance company becomes absolute when loss occurs; and judgment against the insured establishes privity between the injured party and the insurer. See Schott v. Continental Auto Ins. Underwriters, 326 Mo. 92, 31 S.W.2d 7; Lajoie v. Central West Casualty Co., 228 Mo.App. 701, 71 S.W.2d 803; Taverno v. American Auto Ins. Co., 232 Mo.App. 820, 112 S.W.2d 941. The problem is whether by reason of the insurer's liability under the policy and the statute, and \n\n[316 \nU.S. 491, 499]\n\u00a0\n respondent's liability under its reinsurance contract (See e.g. Homan v. Employers Reinsurance Corp., 345 Mo. 650, 136 S.W.2d 289, 127 A.L.R. 163), notice and opportunity to defend the earlier suit were sufficient (Schott v. Continental Auto Ins. Underwriters, supra) to bind respondent as reinsurer. Respondent's charges of fraud center on the adequacy of the notice which it received and the failure of the insured and the insurer to defend. That seems to be but one phase of the question whether under Missouri law respondent was bound by the judgment in the earlier suit.\n The exercise of jurisdiction under the Federal Declaratory Judgments Act is certainly not compulsory; it is discretionary. Borchard, Declaratory Judgments (2d ed.), p. 312. If it may fairly be said under Missouri law that respondent was bound by its failure or refusal to defend the earlier suit after notice, then it would clearly be an abuse of discretion for the District Court to take or at least to retain jurisdiction of the cause in case it appeared after a hearing on that issue that respondent was so bound.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE, dissenting.\n I think the decision of the circuit court of appeals was right and should be affirmed.\n Respondent, reinsurer of an automobile public liability insurance policy, has been made a party to a garnishment proceeding instituted under the Missouri statutes by petitioner, who has secured a Missouri default judgment upon a liability of the insured said to be covered by the policy. By this suit brought in the federal district court for Kansas, respondent now seeks among other things to set aside the judgment, so far as it establishes liability against the insurer, as fraudulently obtained.\n Respondent's bill of complaint states a cause of action which it is entitled to have adjudicated in some court. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 491, 500]\n\u00a0\n The considerations suggested by Mr. Justice DOUGLAS are of course relevant to the merits of respondent's case, and should be tried with other issues wherever and whenever they are to be tried. As the district court below had jurisdiction-and as no other reason is advanced for declining jurisdiction-it was plainly its duty to hear and decide all the issues necessary for disposition of the case unless it was made to appear with reasonable certainty that the issues could be adjudicated in the Missouri courts. Petitioner assumed that burden by his motion in the district court for an order dismissing the suit and remitting respondent to the state courts. The data, including statements of the facts spread upon the record, which he submitted in support of the motion have now received the consideration of three courts. None of them has said, and in the circumstances of this case no federal court could say, either with binding authority or with reasonable certainty that respondent can litigate in the Missouri courts its asserted right to set aside petitioner's judgment for fraud. Petitioner, who is not a citizen or resident of Missouri and not subject to the jurisdiction of its courts unless he voluntarily appears in an action there, has not said, and in this Court has carefully avoided saying, that he would appear in any independent suit brought in the Missouri courts to attack the judgment.\n Further, it affirmatively appears that the question whether respondent can litigate its present cause of action in the statutory garnishment proceeding in Missouri is at best not free from doubt. The Missouri garnishment statutes do not deal expressly with the nature of the issues that can be raised in a garnishment proceeding. Missouri Revised Statutes, 1939,  1560-1589, Mo.R.S.A.  1560-1589. But the Missouri intermediate appellate courts seem to agree that in such a proceeding the garnishee cannot challenge the validity and effectiveness of the judgment save for want of juris- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 491, 501]\n\u00a0\n diction of the court which rendered it. Potter v. Whitten, 161 Mo.App. 118, 131, 132, 142 S.W. 453; Nevatt v. Springfield Normal School, 79 Mo.App. 198, 201; Reid, Murdock & Co. v. Mercurio, 91 Mo.App. 673, 678. The Missouri Supreme Court has never disapproved these decisions.\n The court of appeals below in deciding that the cause should be litigated in the present suit declared, 121 F.2d at page 778:\n'A federal court may not refuse to assume jurisdiction merely on the ground that another remedy is available or because another suit is pending, if the controversy between the parties will not necessarily be determined therein. Maryland Casualty Co. v. Consumers Finance Service, Inc., supra ( 3 Cir., 101 F.2d 514).'\n\n Here it is evident, despite the diligence of counsel, that the ability of respondent to assert its cause of action in the Missouri garnishment proceeding is uncertain and must remain so until the Supreme Court of Missouri has spoken. Just how respondent's ability to maintain its suit in Missouri can be made more certain or even reasonably probable, or how the cause of justice will be advanced by compelling respondent to begin over again the nearly three years' course of litigation which it has now traveled, is not revealed. The concededly erroneous decision of the district court has been reversed by the circuit court of appeals. Unless this Court is now prepared to say that respondent's ability to maintain the suit in the state court is free from doubt, we should leave the judgment undisturbed and not deny to respondent the benefit of the federal jurisdiction which Congress has sanctioned. One of the chief purposes of creating the diversity of citizenship jurisdiction was to afford to suitors an unclouded opportunity to assert their rights in the federal courts when the exigencies of state court jurisdiction of subject matter or \n\n[316 \nU.S. 491, 502]\n\u00a0\n parties, or both together as in this case, render doubtful their ability to proceed in the state courts. In such a case a suitor ought not to be penalized, as respondent plainly is, for invoking the federal jurisdiction.\n The Missouri law, if not conclusively against the assertion of the present cause in the Missouri garnishment proceeding, is at least so doubtful that respondent ought not to be compelled to seek the futile prophecy of the district court in Kansas as to how the Missouri courts will resolve an unsettled point of Missouri practice. Since petitioner has failed to sustain his burden of showing that the case is a proper one for dismissal, the district court should exercise its jurisdiction by proceeding to determine the merits without further delay. If this litigation is ever to end, it is important for it to get started.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS and Mr. Justice JACKSON join in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It is difficult to ascertain from the record the precise grounds for the District Court's action. Some light is shed by the following colloquy which occurred at the conclusion of the argument upon the motion to dismiss the bill:\n'The Court: As I understand, the merits of the case with reference to the death of this decedent have never been tried.\n\n'Mr. Woods (counsel for the respondent): That is correct, and it is almost six years now.\n\n'The Court: Well, I don't think that this court will interfere with that. The case will be dismissed. You may draw a journal showing that after this long lapse of time, after your litigation in Missouri, that this court feels in its discretion that it ought not to interfere with that litigation in any way.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals contains a single sentence which, if read without reference to its context, might appear to be such a finding: 'The issues in the garnishment action could not determine the liability of appellant (the respondent here) under its reinsurance contract.' 121 F.2d at page 778. But, as we read its opinion, the court below clearly was referring only to the garnishment action against Central before the respondent was joined as a party. Of course, at that time the respondent would have no opportunity to raise in the garnishment proceeding the claims which it asserted in the federal suit for a declaratory judgment. But when the petitioner's motion to dismiss the federal suit was filed, the respondent had been made a party to the garnishment proceeding. And, as its opinion shows, the Circuit Court of Appeals did not find that under Missouri law the claims raised by the respondent in the federal suit, which were governed by Missouri law and were not previously foreclosed by it, could not be adjudicated in the garnishment proceeding after the respondent had been joined as a party. \n\n\n\n\n","12":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBUTLER BROS. v.

Neeves, of Chicago, Ill., for appellant.\n Mr. Valentine Brookes, of San Francisco, Cal., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[315 \nU.S. 501, 503]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal (Judicial Code  237(a), 28 U.S.C.  344(a), 28 U.S. C.A.  344(a) from a final judgment of the Supreme Court of California sustaining the validity of a statute of California against the claim that as construed and applied to appellant it violated the Fourteenth Amendment. 17 Cal.2d 664, 111 P.2d 334. The statute in question is the Bank and Corporation Franchise Tax Act. 2 Gen.Laws 1937, Act 8488, p. 3851; Stat. 1929, p. 19, amended, Stat.1931, p. 2226, Stat.1935, p. 965, St.1937, p. 2324. Sec. 4(3) of that Act provides for an annual corporate franchise tax payable by a corporation doing business within the State. The tax is measured by the corporation's net income and is at the rate of four per cent 'upon the basis of its net income' for the preceding year. The minimum annual tax is $25. Sec. 10 prescribes the method for computing the net income on which the tax is laid. It provides in part:\n'If the entire business of the bank or corporation is done within this State, the tax shall be according to or measured by its entire net income; and if the entire business of such bank or corporation is not done within this State, the tax shall be according to or measured by that portion thereof which is derived from business done within this State. The portion of net income derived from business done within this State, shall be determined by an allocation upon the basis of sales, purchases, expenses, of manufacturer, pay roll, value and situs of tangible property, or by reference to these or other factors, or by such other method of allocation as is fairly calculated to assign to the State the portion of net income reasonably attributable to the business done within this State and to avoid subjecting the taxpayer to double taxation.'\n\n The tax in dispute is for the calendar year 1936. Appellant paid the minimum tax of $25, asserting that it operated \n\n[315 \nU.S. 501, 504]\n\u00a0\n in California during 1935 at a loss of $82,851. The tax commissioner made an additional assessment of $3,798.43 which appellant paid, together with interest, under protest. This suit was brought to recover back the amount so paid on the theory that the method of allocation employed by the tax commissioner attributed to California income derived wholly from business done without that State.\n The facts are stipulated and show the following. Appellant is an Illinois corporation qualified to do business in California. Its home office is in Chicago, Illinois. It is engaged in the wholesale dry goods and general merchandise business, purchasing from manufacturers and others and selling to retailers only. It has wholesale distributing houses in seven states, including one at San Francisco, California. Each of its houses in the seven states maintains stocks of goods, serves a separate territory, has its own sales force, handles its own sales and all solicitation, credit and collection arrangements in connection therewith, and keeps its own books of account. For the period in question, all receipts from sales in California were credited to the San Francisco house. Appellant maintains a central buying division through which goods for resale are ordered, the goods being shipped by manufacturers to the houses for which they are ordered. All purchases made by appellant for sale at its various houses are made through that central buying division. The cost of the goods and the transportation charges are entered on the books of the house which receives the goods. No charges are made against any house for the benefit of appellant or any of its other houses by reason of the centralized purchasing. But the actual cost of operating the centralized buying division is allocated among the houses. The greater part of appellant's other operating expenses is incurred directly and exclusively at the respective houses. Certain items of expense are incurred and paid by appel- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 501, 505]\n\u00a0\n lant for the benefit of all the houses and allocated to them. No question exists as to the accuracy of the amounts of such expense or the method of allocation. The latter admittedly followed recognized accounting principles. For the year 1935 the amount of such allocated expense charged to the San Francisco house was $100,091. For purposes of this suit it was agreed that approximately 75% of that amount would have been incurred even though the San Francisco house was not operated. The accuracy and propriety of the basis of allocation of those common expenses for 1935 were admitted. Included in such expenses were executive salaries, certain accounting expenses, the cost of operating a central buying division, and a central advertising division. Except for such common expenses, each house is operated independently of each other house. Appellant computed its income from the San Francisco house for the period in question by deducting from the gross receipts from sales in California the cost of such merchandise, the direct expense of the San Francisco house, and the indirect expense allocated to it. By that computation a loss of $82,851 was determined. In the year 1935 the operations of all houses of appellant produced a profit of $1,149,677. The tax commissioner allocated to California 8.1372 per cent. of that amount. That percentage was determined by averaging the percentages which (a) value of real and tangible personal property, (b) wages, salaries, commissions, and other compensation of employees, and (c) gross sales, less returns and allowances, attributable to the San Francisco house bore to the corresponding items of all houses of appellant. No other factor or method of allocation was considered. The propriety of the use of that formula is not questioned if by reason of the stipulated facts a formula for allocation to California of a portion of appellant's income from all sources is proper. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 501, 506]\n\u00a0\n The stipulation also states that in the year 1935 the total sales made by appellant at all its houses amounted to $66,326,000, of which $5, 206,000 were made by the San Francisco house. The purchases made for the account of that house were substantially in the same proportion to total purchases. By reason of the volume of purchases made by appellant 'more favorable prices are obtained than would be obtainable in repect of purchases for the account of any individual house'. The addition of purchases 'in an amount equal to the purchases made for the account of the San Francisco house results in no more favorable prices than could be obtainable in respect of purchases in an amount equal to the purchases which would be made' by appellant for its other houses if the San Francisco house was not in existence; and 'a reduction in the volume of purchases in an amount equal to the purchases made for the San Francisco house would result in no less favorable prices being obtainable in respect of the purchases which would be made for the remaining houses' of appellant.\n Hans Rees' Sons, Inc., v. North Carolina, \n283 \nU.S. 123\n, 51 S.Ct. 385, constitutes appellant's chief support in its attack on the formula employed and the tax imposed by California. Appellant maintains that the use of the formula in question resulted in converting a loss of $ 82,851 into a profit of over $93,500 and that the difference of some $175, 000 has either been created out of nothing or has been appropriated by California from other states.\n We take a different view. We read the statute as calling for a method of allocation which is 'fairly calculated' to assign to California that portion of the net income 'reasonably attributable' to the business done there. The test, not here challenged which has been reflected in prior decisions of this Court, is certainly not more exacting. Bass, Ratcliff & Gretton, Ltd., v. State Tax Commission, \n266 \nU.S. 271\n, 45 S.Ct. 82; Ford Motor Co. v. Beau- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 501, 507]\n\u00a0\n champ, \n308 \nU.S. 331\n, 60 S.Ct. 273. Hence if the formula which was employed meets those standards, any constitutional question arising under the Fourteenth Amendment is at an end.\n One who attacks a formula of apportionment carriers a distinct burden of showing by 'clear and cogent evidence' that it results in extraterritorial values being taxed. See Norfolk & Western Ry. Co. v. North Carolina, \n297 \nU.S. 682, 688\n, 56 S.Ct. 625, 628. This Court held in Hans Rees' Sons, Inc., v. North Carolina, supra, 283 U.S. page 135, 51 S.Ct. page 389, that that burden had been maintained on a showing by the taxpayer that 'in any aspect of the evidence' its income attributable to North Carolina was 'out of all appropriate proportion to the business' transacted by the taxpayer in that State. No such showing has been made here.\n It is true that appellant's separate accounting system for its San Francisco branch attributed no net income to California. But we need not impeach the integrity of that accounting system to say that it does not prove appellant's assertion that extraterritorial values are being taxed. Accounting practices for income statements may vary considerably according to the problem at hand. Sanders, Hatfield & Moore, A Statement of Accounting Principles (1938), p. 26. A particular accounting system, though useful or necessary as a business aid, may not fit the different requirements when a State seeks to tax values created by business within its borders. Cf. Hamilton, Cost as a Standard for Price, 4 Law & Contempotary Problems 321. That may be due to the fact, as stated by Mr. Justice Brandeis in Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, \n254 \nU.S. 113, 121\n, 41 S.Ct. 45, 47, that a State in attempting to place upon a business extending into several States 'its fair share of the burden of taxation' is 'faced with the impossibility of allocating specifically the profits earned by the process conducted within its borders.' Furthermore, the particular system \n\n[315 \nU.S. 501, 508]\n\u00a0\n used may not reveal the facts basic to the State's determination. Bass, Ratcliff & Gretton, Ltd., v. State Tax Commission, supra, 266 U.S. page 283, 45 S.Ct. page 84. In either aspect of the matter the results of the accounting system employed by appellant do not impeach the validity of propriety of the formula which California has applied here.\n At least since Adams Express Co. v. Ohio State Auditor, \n165 \nU.S. 194\n, 17 S.Ct. 305, this Court has recognized that unity of use and management of a business which is scattered through several States may be considered when a State attempts to impose a tax on an apportionment basis. As stated in Hans Rees' Sons, Inc., v. North Carolina, supra, 283 U. S. page 133, 51 S.Ct. page 389, '... the enterprise of a corporation which manufactures and sells its manufactured product is ordinarily a unitary business, and all the factors in that enterprise are essential to the realization of profits.' And see Bass, Ratcliff & Gretton, Ltd., v. State Tax Commission, supra, 266 U.S. page 282, 45 S.Ct. page 84. By the same token, California may properly treat appellant's business as a unitary one. Cf. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Grosjean, \n301 \nU.S. 412\n, 57 S.Ct. 772, 112 A.L.R. 293. There is unity of ownership and management. And the operation of the central buying division alone demonstrates that functionally the various branches are closely integrated. Admittedly, centralized purchasing results in more favorable prices being obtained than if the purchases were separately made for the account of any one branch. What the savings were and what portion is fairly attributable to the volume contributed by the San Francisco branch do not appear. But the concession that a reduction or addition of purchases 'in an amount equal to the purchases made for the San Francisco house' would not result in higher or lower purchase prices respectively does not aid appellant's case. There is no justification on this record for singling out the San Francisco branch rather than another and concluding that it made no contribution to those savings. As aptly stated by the Supreme Court of California, 'If the omission of the California sales would \n\n[315 \nU.S. 501, 509]\n\u00a0\n have no effect on the purchasing power, the omission of sales in an equal amount wherever made would likewise have no effect on the company's ability to purchase at a saving. Thus, by proceeding in turn from state to state, it could be shown that none of the sales in any of the states should be credited with the income resulting from the purchasing of goods in large quantities.' Nor are there any facts shown which permit the conclusion that the other advantages of centralized management (Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Grosjean, supra) are attributable to other branches but not to the one in California. The fact of the matter is that appellant has not shown the precise sources of its net income of $1,149, 677. If factors which are responsible for that net income are present in other States but not present in California, they have not been revealed. At least in absence of that proof, California was justified in assuming that the San Francisco branch contributed its aliquot share to the advantages of centralized management of this unitary enterprise and to the net income earned.\n We cannot say that property, pay roll, and sales are inappropriate ingredients of an apportionment formula. We agree with the Supreme Court of California that these factors may properly be deemed to reflect 'the relative contribution of the activities in the various states to the production of the total unitary income', so as to allocate to California its just proportion of the profits earned by appellant from this unitary business. And no showing has been made that income unconnected with the unitary business has been used in the formula.\n The stipulation of facts states that if 'the Court deems that it is bound by any inference or presumption respecting the assessment made by the Commissioner, or that this stipulation fails to establish any fact necessary to a decision, the case shall be reopened for the taking of further proofs in respect thereof.' Appellant in its repetition for \n\n[315 \nU.S. 501, 510]\n\u00a0\n rehearing before the Supreme Court of California relied on that part of the stipulation in urging that the cause be remanded for a further hearing since that Court concluded that 'appellant has not furnished any explanation of why its California business differs so from the average that the formula produced an erroneous result.' The petition for rehearing was denied. Appellant now asserts that it has been denied procedural due process under the rule of Saunders v. Shaw, \n244 \nU.S. 317\n, 37 S.Ct. 638. We do not agree. The Supreme Court of California created no innovation and sprung no surprise when it placed on appellant the burden of establishing that the formula taxed extraterritorial values. As we have noted, that is settled doctrine. Appellant had a full opportunity to be heard on the issues which it tendered.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","13":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nC. J.

Cluff, of New York City, for petitioners.\n Messrs. Everett W. Mattoon and Eugene M. Elson, both of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondents. \n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 134]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Fish and Game Commission of California, having seized a purse net while it was being used for fishing in the navigable waters of the state in violation of the State Fish and Game Code, brought the present proceeding under  845 of the Code St.Cal.1933, p. 471, for forfeiture of the net. The question for decision is whether the state court's judgment, directing that the net be forfeited and ordering the commission to sell or destroy it, is a 'common law remedy' which the 'common law is competent to give' within the statutory exception to the exclusive jurisdiction in admiralty conferred on district courts of the United States by  9 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 76, 77, 28 U.S.C.  41(3) and 371 (Third), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(3) and 371(3).\n Section 845 of the California Fish and Game Code declares that a net used in violation of the provisions of the Code is a public nuisance and makes it the duty of any arresting officer to seize the net and report its seizure to the commission. The statute requires the commission to institute proceedings in the state superior court for the forfeiture of the seized net and authorizes the court, after a hearing and determination that the net was used unlawfully, to make an order forfeiting it and directing that it be sold or destroyed by the commission.\n In this case the commission seized the net while it was being used by the fishing vessel Reliance in navigable coastal waters of the state in violation of  89 and 842, which prohibit fishing by net in the area in question, and respondents, the members of the commission, brought this proceeding in the state superior court for the forfeiture of the net. Petitioners appeared as claimants and after a trial the court gave judgment that the net be forfeited, ordering respondents to sell or destroy it. The Supreme Court of California at first set the judgment aside, but after rehearing affirmed, 18 Cal.2d 835, \n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 135]\n\u00a0\n 118 P.2d 1, 3, holding that the remedy given by the judgment is a 'common- law remedy' which 'the common law is competent to give', and that the case is not within the exclusive jurisdiction in admiralty conferred on the federal courts by the Judiciary Act and hence was properly tried in the state court. Cf. Knapp, Stout & Co. Company v. McCaffrey, \n177 \nU.S. 638\n, 20 S.Ct. 824; The Hamilton, \n207 \nU.S. 398, 404\n, 28 S.Ct. 133, 134; Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., \n264 \nU.S. 109, 123\n, 44 S.Ct. 274, 276. We granted certiorari, \n316 \nU.S. 643\n, 62 S. Ct. 1036, the question being of importance in defining the jurisdiction of state courts in relation to the admiralty jurisdiction.\n Only a single issue is presented by the record and briefs-whether the state is precluded by the Constitution and laws of the United States from entertaining the present suit. It is not questioned that the state has authority to regulate fishing in its navigable waters, Manchester v. Massachusetts, \n139 \nU.S. 240\n, 11 S.Ct. 559; Lawton v. Steele, \n152 \nU.S. 133, 139\n, 14 S.Ct. 499, 501; Lee v. New Jersey, \n207 \nU.S. 67\n, 28 S.Ct. 22; Skiriotes v. Florida, \n313 \nU.S. 69, 75\n, 61 S.Ct. 924, 928; and it is not denied that seizure there of a net appurtenant to a fishing vessel is cognizable in admiralty. But petitioners insist that the present proceeding is not one which can be entertained by a state court since the judgment in rem for forfeiture of the net is not a common law remedy which the common law is competent to give, and that the case is therefore not within the statutory exception to the exclusive admiralty jurisdiction of the federal courts. In this posture of the case, and in the view we take, we find it necessary to consider only this contention.\n Section 371 (Third) of 28 U.S.C., 28 U.S.C.A.  371(3), derived from  9 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, confers exclusive jurisdiction on the federal courts 'of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, saving to suitors in all cases the right of a common-law remedy where the common law is competent to give it ....' A characteristic feature of the maritime law is its use of the procedure in rem derived from \n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 136]\n\u00a0\n the civil law, by which a libellant may proceed against the vessel, naming her as a defendant and seeking a judgment subjecting the vessel, and hence the interests of all persons in her, to the satisfaction of the asserted claim. Suits in rem against a vessel in cases of maritime tort and for the enforcement of maritime liens are familiar examples of a procedure by which a judgment in rem is sought, 'good against all the world'.\n The question whether a maritime cause of action can be prosecuted in the state courts by such a procedure was first discussed by this Court seventy-seven years after the adoption of the Constitution and the Judiciary Act, in The Moses Taylor, 4 Wall. 411, which held that a lien upon a vessel, created by state statute, could not be enforced by a proceeding in rem in the state courts. Decision was rested on the ground that exclusive jurisdiction of the suit was vested in the federal courts by the Judiciary Act, since a judgment in rem to enforce a lien is not a remedy which the common law is competent to give, a ruling which has since been consistently followed. The Hine v. Trevor, 4 Wall. 555; The Belfast, 7 Wall. 624; The Glibe, \n167 \nU.S. 606\n, 17 S. Ct. 930; The Robert W. Parsons, \n191 \nU.S. 17\n, 36-38, 24 S.Ct. 8, 14, 15; Rounds v. Cloverport Foundry & Machine Co., \n237 \nU.S. 303, 307\n, 308 S., 35 S.Ct. 596, 597, 598. Eleven years earlier this Court in Smith v. Maryland, 18 How. 71, without discussion of the point now at issue, had sustained the seizure and forfeiture of a vessel in a state court proceeding in rem, all pursuant to state statutes, for violation of a Maryland fishing law within the navigable waters of the state. The Court declared that the statute, which prescribed the procedure in rem in the state court, conflicted 'neither with the admiralty jurisdiction of any court of the United States conferred by congress, nor with any law of congress whatever'. 18 How. at page 76. The authority of that decision has never been questioned by this Court. \n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 137]\n\u00a0\n The common law as it was received in the United States at the time of the adoption of the Constitution did not afford a remedy in rem in suits between private persons. Hence the adoption of the saving clause in the Judiciary Act, as this Court has held in the cases already cited, did not withdraw from the exclusive jurisdiction of admiralty that class of cases in which private suitors sought to enforce their claims by the seizure of a vessel in proceedings in rem. But to the generalization that a judgment in rem was not a common law remedy there is an important exception. Forfeiture to the Crown of the offending object, because it had been used in violation of law, by a procedure in rem was a practice familiar not only to the English admiralty courts but to the Court of Exchequer. The Exchequer gave such a remedy for the forfeiture of articles seized on land for the violation of law. And, concurrently with the admiralty, it entertained true proceedings in rem for the forfeiture of vessels for violations on navigable waters .1 Such suits in the Exchequer were begun on information and were against the vessel or article to be condemned. Under the provisions of many statutes the suit might be brought by an informer qui tam, who was permitted to share in the proceeds of the for- \n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 138]\n\u00a0\n feited article; the judgment was of forfeiture and the forfeited article was ordered to be sold. This was the established procedure certainly as early as the latter part of the seventeenth century. \n2\n Proceedings in rem, closely paralleling those in the Exchequer, were also entertained by justices of the peace in many forfeiture cases arising under the customs laws (see Hoon, The Organization of the English Customs System, 1696-1786, pp. 277, 280-83), and the Act of 8 Geo. I, c. 18,  16, placed within that jurisdiction the condemnation of vessels up to fifteen tons charged with smuggling.\n While the English Acts of Navigation and Trade and numerous other forfeiture statutes conferred jurisdiction on all the English common law courts of record3 to enter- \n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 139]\n\u00a0\n tain suits for forfeiture, nevertheless suitors having ready access to the convenient procedure of exchequer or admiralty in qui tam actions seem to have had little occasion to resort to the King's Bench or Common Pleas. In the occasional reported forfeiture cases brought in King's Bench, the English reports give us little light on the procedure followed or the precise from of judgment entered. In one case, Roberts v. Withered, 5 Mod. 193, 12 Mod. 92, the court seems to have adapted the common law action of detinue to forfeiture cases by resort to the fiction that bringing the action was the equivalent of a seizure which vested the property in the Crown so that a suit in detinue or replevin in personam to gain possession would lie. See Stephen, Pleading (3rd Am.Ed.) pp. 47, 52, 69, 74; Ames, Lectures on Legal History, pp. 64, 71. Cf. Wilkins v. Despard, 5 Term.Rep. 112.\n Separate courts exercising the jurisdiction of the Court of Exchequer were never established in the American Colonies. Instead, that jurisdiction was absorbed by the common law courts which entertained suits for the forfeiture of property under English or local statutes authorizing its condemnation. Long before the adoption of the Constitution the common law courts in the Colonies-and later in the states during the period of Confederation-were exercising jurisdiction in rem in the enforcement of forfeiture statutes. Like the Exchequer, in cases of seizure on navigable waters they exercised a jurisdiction concurrently with the courts of admiralty. But the vice-admiralty courts in the Colonies did not begin to function with any real continuity until about 1700 or shortly after-\n__________ ralty ... or ... any Court of Record' in the American Colonies or Plantations. E.g., 6 Geo. II, c. 13,  3; 4 Geo. III, c. 15,  41. The important Act of 1696 (7 & 8 Wm. III, c. 22,  2) provided that forfeitures of ships and goods might be enforced 'in any of his Majesty's courts of record at Westminster, or in any court in his Majesty's plantations, where such offence shall be committed'. \n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 140]\n\u00a0\n ward.

By that time, the jurisdiction of common law courts to condemn ships and cargoes for violation of the Navigation Acts had been firmly established, apparently without question, and was regularly exercised throughout the colonies. In general the suits were brought against the vessel or article to be condemned, were tried by jury, closely followed the procedure in Exchequer, and if successful resulted in judgments of forfeiture or condemnation with a provision for sale. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 141]\n\u00a0\n The rise of the vice-admiralty courts-prompted in part by the Crown's desire to have access to a forum not controlled by the obstinate resistance of American juries-did not divest the colonial common law courts of their\n___________ tablished in 1698.

It was the admiralty courts, not the common law courts, which had difficulty in establishing their jurisdiction, although in 1759 the Board of Trade was able to write that 'With regard to breaches of the Law of Trade they are cognizable either in the courts of common law in the plantations, or in the courts of Admiralty, which have in such cases, if not in all, a concurrent jurisdiction with the courts of common law' (quoted in Andrews, vice-Admiralty Courts in the Colonies, supra, at p. 7); and Stokes reported that the same situation prevailed at the outbreak of the Revolution. See Stokes, A View of the Constitution of the British Colonies (1783), pp. 270, 357 et seq.\n In New York, admiralty jurisdiction was vested in the Mayor's Court in 1678, and that court continued to exercise jurisdiction in all maritime cases, including those\n___________ Indies, 1681-1685, Nos. 868-70; Edward Randolph, vol. 3, pp. 256-58.

See Select Cases of the Major's Court of New York City, 1674-1784 (Ed. Morris, 1935) pp. 39-40, 566 et seq. But cases of forfeiture were also regularly prosecuted before the common law courts of the colony-in the General Quarter Sessions of the Peace in New York City during the 1680s,5 and after the reorganization of the judiciary in 1691, in the SupremeCourt of Judicature,6 which was given jurisdiction 'of all pleas, Civill Criminall, \n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 145]\n\u00a0\n and Mixt, as fully & amply to all Intents & purposes whatsoever, as the Courts of Kings Bench, Comon Pleas, & Exchequer within their Majestyes Kingdome of England, have or ought to have', 1 Colonial Laws of New York ( 1894) p. 229.\n The Navigation Acts did not constitute the only authority for forfeiture proceedings in the common law courts. New York's own colonial legislation shows frequent use of the forfeiture sanction, applied sometimes to vessels as well as to commodities, as a means of enforcement of provincial laws fixing customs duties, regulating or prohibiting the exportation or importation of commodities, or requiring a specified manner of marking, storing or selling. 7 A common provision in these statutes was that the forfeitures imposed might be prosecuted in any court of record in the colony.\n The records of the New York Supreme Court of Judicature contain numerous instances of forfeiture proceedings during the eighteenth century. One is Hammond qui tam v. Sloop Carolina,8 a prosecution in 1735 for a \n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 146]\n\u00a0\n false customs certificate, which resulted in the discharge of the ship and her cargo for failure of proof. Later cases show more in detail how closely that court's procedure in forfeiture cases followed the essentials of the procedure in rem which had been developed in the English Exchequer. 9 Nor did the creation of a state Court of Admiralty after the Revolution effect a withdrawal of such jurisdiction from the common law courts. Statutes enacted in New York during the period of the Confederation, like the English and local legislation which preceded them, continued to employ forfeiture as a sanction,10 and \n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 147]\n\u00a0\n forfeiture proceedings continued to be brought in the Supreme Court and other common law tribunals. \n11\n The Act of April 11, 1787, 2 Laws of New York 509, 517, imposing import duties, provided that 'all ships and vessels, goods and merchandize which shall become forfeited by virtue of this act, shall be prosecuted by the collector, or officer or other person who shall seize the same, by information in the court of admiralty,12 or in the court of exchequer,13 or in any mayors court or court of common pleas in this State, in order to condemnation thereof'. There was provision for proclamations to be made 'in the accustomed manner', with detailed specification of the methods of making an appraisal and proceeding to judgment, and a \n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 148]\n\u00a0\n further provision (p. 518) leaving it to the discretion of the collector of the port of New York or the attorney general 'to direct in which of the courts aforesaid any information shall be brought touching such forfeiture'.\n In Pennsylvania we have a record of a similar exercise of jurisdiction in 1787 by the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas in Phile qui tam v. The Ship Anna, 1 Dall. 197, where the jury condemned the ship. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n Examination of the legislative history of the Judiciary Act of 1789 does not disclose precisely what its framers \n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 149]\n\u00a0\n had in mind when in  9 they used the phrase 'common law remedy'. But it is unlikely that, in selecting this phrase as the means of marking the boundary of the jurisdiction of state courts over matters which might otherwise be within the exclusive jurisdiction of admiralty, the draftsmen of  9 intended to withdraw from the state courts a jurisdiction and remedy in forfeiture cases which had been so generally applied by non- admiralty courts both in England and America, and which had become a recognized part of the common law system as developed in England and received in this country long before the American Revolution. Nor can we accept the suggestion that Congress, in this use of the phrase 'common law remedy', was harking back some hundreds of years to a period before the Exchequer had taken its place as one of the three great courts administering the common law, and was likewise disregarding the experience of the common law courts in America with which it was familiar-all without any indication of such a purpose. Considerations of practical convenience in the conduct of forfeiture proceedings for violations of local statutes occurring on state waters, as well as the contemporary and later history of the exercise of the admiralty jurisdiction, indicate that there was no purpose to limit such proceedings to the exclusive jurisdiction of the admiralty.\n Shortly after the adoption of the Constitution, state legislation was enacted regulating state tidal waters and authorizing forfeiture in the state courts of fish nets and vessels illegally used in fishing there. Such a statute was considered in 1823 in Corfield v. Coryell, Fed.Cas.No.3, 230, 4 Wash.C.C. 371, (cited in Smith v. Maryland, supra, 18 How. at page 75), where a New Jersey state court forfeiture of a vessel under a statute regulating the Delaware Bay was upheld as constitutional by Justice Washington, without question of the state court's jurisdiction because of the in rem nature of the proceeding. No suggestion \n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 150]\n\u00a0\n is to be found in that case or elsewhere that the Judiciary Act struck down the large body of state legislation, enacted shortly after 1789, which provided for the forfeiture in state courts of vessels or nets seized in navigable waters of a state for violating state fishing laws. 15 And such legislation has become rooted in the law enforcement programs \n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 151]\n\u00a0\n of about half the states,16 without intimation from this or any other court that the Judiciary Act prohibited it. See Boggs v. Commonwealth, 76 Va. 989, 993, 996; Dize v. Lloyd, C.C., 36 F. 651, 652, 653; Johnson v. Loper, 46 N.J.L. 321; Bradford v. De Luca, 90 N.J.L. 434, 103 A. 692; Doolan v. The Greyhound, 79 Conn. 697, 66 A. 511; Ely v. Bugbee, 90 Conn. 584, 98 A. 121, L.R.A.1916F, 910; State v. Umaki, 103 Wash. 232, 174 P. 447; State v. Mavrikas, 148 Wash. 651, 269 P. 805; Osborn v. Charlevoix Circuit Judge, 114 Mich. 655, 663, 666, 72 N.W. 982.\n It is noteworthy that ,Blackstone's Commentaries, more read in America before the Revolution than any other law book, referred to the information in rem in the Court \n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 152]\n\u00a0\n of Exchequer as the procedure by which forfeitures were inflicted for violation of Acts of Parliament. Bk. III, p. 262. And Kent, in his Commentaries, pointed out that 'seizures, in England, for violation of the laws of revenue, trade or navigation, were tried by a jury in the Court of Exchequer, according to the course of the common law; and though a proceeding be in rem, it is not necessarily a proceeding or cause in the admiralty' (12th Ed., Vol. 1, p. 374). He declared that, within the meaning of  9 of the Judiciary Act, the common law was competent to give such a remedy 'because, under the vigorous system of the English law, such prosecutions in rem are in the Exchequer, according to the course of the common law' (p. 376).\n Upon the adoption of the Constitution the national government took over the regulation of trade, navigation and customs duties which had been prolific sources of forfeiture proceedings in the state courts. This Court in suits brought in admiralty sustained the admiralty jurisdiction over forfeitures prescribed by Congress for the violation of federal revenue and other laws where the seizure had occurred on navigable waters. United States v. La Vengeance, 3 Dall. 297; United States v. The Schooner Sally, 2 Cranch 406; United States v. The Schooner Betsey and Charlotte, 4 Cranch 443; Whelan v. United States, 7 Cranch 112; The Samuel, 1 Wheat. 9. Those decisions held that when the seizure occurred on navigable waters the cause was maritime and hence triable without a jury in the federal courts. 17 But they obviously did not determine, and there was no occasion to determine, whether forfeiture proceedings belonged in the category of maritime causes that might also be tried in state courts be- \n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 153]\n\u00a0\n cause, within the meaning of the saving clause, the common law was competent to give the remedy.\n The Court has never held or said that the admiralty jurisdiction in a forfeiture case is exclusive, and it has repeatedly declared that, in cases of forfeiture of articles seized on land for violation of federal statutes, the district courts proceed as courts of common law according to the course of the Exchequer on informations in rem with trial by jury. The Sarah, 8 Wheat. 391, 396, note (a); Four Hundred and Forty- Three Cans of Frozen Egg Product v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 172\n, 33 S.Ct. 50, and cases cited. In United States v. 422 Casks of Wine, 1 Pet. 547, Justice Story defined such an action as a libel or information in rem on the Exchequer side of the court. And see Chief Justice Marshall's reference, in The Schooner Hoppet v. United States, 7 Cranch 389, 393, to 'proceedings in Courts of common law, either against the person or the thing for penalties or forfeitures'. In all this we perceive a common understanding of judges, lawyers and text writers, both before and after the adoption of the Constitution of the common law nature of the procedure and judgment in rem in forfeiture cases and of its use in such proceedings in the Exchequer and in the American common law courts.\n We conclude that the common law as received in this country at the time of the adoption of the Constitution gave a remedy in rem in cases of forfeiture, and that it is a 'common law remedy' and one which 'the common law is competent to give' within the meaning of  9 of the Judiciary Act of 1789. By that Act the states were left free to provide such a remedy in forfeiture cases where the articles are seized upon navigable waters of the state for violation of state law. It follows that Smith v. Maryland, supra, was rightly decided and is not in conflict with The Moses Taylor, supra, and cases following it, and that the judgment of the Supreme Court of California should be affirmed. \n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 154]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting.\n If this case involved only a fishnet, I should be inclined to acquiesce in the holding of the Court. Indeed, we have held that a state may seize and condemn a fishnet of trifling value without following the formal procedure of court action at all. Lawton v. Steele, \n152 \nU.S. 133\n, 14 S.Ct. 499. But the principle laid down here involves far more than a fishnet, for under it state courts are authorized through in rem proceedings to seize and condemn, for violation of local law, any equipment or vessel employed in maritime activity. Today's in rem action is against a fishnet used in patently illegal fashion; tomorrow's may be an action against a tramp-steamer or ocean liner which violates a harbor regulation or otherwise offends against the police regulations of a state or municipality. Persons guilty of violating state laws affecting maritime activity may be prosecuted by in personam actions in state courts,1 and the admiralty courts themselves can helpfully enforce state laws through in rem proceedings. \n2\n I do not believe, however, that the Judiciary Act permits states, through state common law courts which cannot reasonably be expected to have knowledge of admiralty law and practice, to give permanent halt to any portion of the maritime trade and commerce of the nation by bringing in rem proceedings against ships. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 155]\n\u00a0\n The Judiciary Act of 1789 places in the federal admiralty courts exclusive jurisdiction over admiralty cases except where the common law provides an equivalent remedy. It is conceded that as a general proposition the common law courts have no in rem remedy in naritime cases. However, the Court holds squarely, for the first time in its history, that there is an exception to this rule which permits states to bring in rem forfeiture proceedings in common law courts. The Court brushes aside as mere generalizations the many cases hereafter considered which declare that no equivalent of an admiralty in rem proceeding may be brought at common law. Today's holding is rested principally on the English and colonial practice prior to 1789 and on one case in this Court. I disagree, believing that the English practice is irrelevant, that the colonial law was not in accord with the English practice, and that a long series of cases since 1789 have clearly considered the proposition put by the Court, and have given the Judiciary Act a meaning squarely opposite to that now announced.\n The English Exchequer practice on which the Court appears to rely so heavily seems to me to be irrelevant because it was not in conformity with our own early American development. The colonists, of course, did not establish admiralty courts the moment they stepped from the vessels which brought them to the New World, and for a substantial portion of the seventeenth century maritime forfeitures were collected in the fashion of the English courts. However, toward the end of that century, it became acutely apparent in England that colonial juries would not enforce the navigation laws as England desired to see them enforced. This was particularly true in Massachusetts Bay4 and in other colonies where commercial \n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 156]\n\u00a0\n interests dominated. Hence in 1697, Vice Commissioners of Admiralty were established throughout the colonies to enforce the navigation laws of England without jury procedure. It was conceded by the earliest writers that the Vice Admiralty courts in the colonies 'obtained in a singular manner a jurisdiction in revenue causes, totally foreign to the original jurisdiction of the admiralty, and unknown to it.' \n5\n Yet, with the great adaptability of the early courts, this jurisdiction in the colonies was fitted into the judicial system so as to allow appeal, as in purely admiralty cases, to the High Court of Admiralty in England. The Vrouw Dorothea, 1754, reported in The Fabius, 2 C.Rob. 246.6\n The same conflict which took place in England between Coke as champion of the common law jurisdiction, and the admiralty courts also was carried on in the colonies. Cf. Talbot v. Commanders and Owners of The Three Brigs, 1 Dall. 95. As a result there was, throughout the eighteenth century, marked confusion as to the proper jurisdiction of each in forfeiture cases. For example, in 1702, the Board of Trade asked the advice of the Attorney General as to whether all forfeitures in connection with colonial trading matters under the Navigation Act of 1696 were to be prosecuted exclusively in courts of admiralty, and the Attorney General replied in the affirmative. \n7\n On the other hand it is clear, as the cases \n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 157]\n\u00a0\n cited by the Court show, that this view was not always maintained. One can only conclude that there was in 1789 no completely clear resolution of the conflict between admiralty and common law courts in forfeiture cases, though the cases hereafter considered indicate that the admiralty courts were winning the dominant role. At the same time it must be concluded by the proponents of the Court's view that American practice had come to be markedly different from the English.\n It is settled beyond question that the general admiralty law of the United States in 1789 was the law as developed in the colonies and not the law as it came from England. Prior to the middle of the nineteenth century a contrary view was often pressed upon the Court and was as often rejected with adequate reference to the differences between the two.8 The early American courts therefore were faced with the task of determining whether forfeiture actions should be brought exclusively in the common law courts, exclusively in the admiralty courts, or concurrently in either. In repeated decisions relating to forfeitures under federal laws, this Court, within a few years of the adoption of the Judiciary Act of 1789, held that forfeiture jurisdiction was exclusively in the admiralty courts.\n The leading case for this proposition is La Vengeance, 1796, 3 Dall. 297, 300. In that case the United States brought an action of forfeiture for exporting arms and ammunition. The United States contended in this Court that the action was criminal in its nature and that in any case it was not a civil suit within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction and therefore should have been tried before a jury as at common law. The Court held that the action was clearly civil since it was an in rem proceeding and that \n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 158]\n\u00a0\n it was subject to the maritime jurisdiction because the basic transportation activity involved was 'entirely a water transaction.' There is no suggestion whatever, in the brief opinion of the Court, of the possibility of a concurrent common law jurisdiction. This rule was followed in The Sally, 2 Cranch 406, where the government again contended that it was entitled to try forfeiture actions before a jury since the 'cause was of common law, and not of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,' and the same result was reached in The Samuel, 1 Wheat. 9.9\n One of the most elaborate arguments ever made in this Court on the issue now before us was presented in 1808 in United States v. The Betsey and Charlotte, 4 Cranch 443. That case arose on an action for forfeiture. Counsel for the claimant, who had also been the losing counsel in La Vengeance, contended that the action should have been tried as at common law. He strongly emphasized the Exchequer practice in England and said, 'There is nothing in the course of proceedings in rem which requires that they should be in a court of admiralty.' 4 Cranch 447. The argument he made was almost identical with that which the Court adopts in the instant case. He emphasized particularly that 'We have seen that in all cases of seizure for breaches of the laws of revenue, trade, or navigation, the common law is competent to give a remedy; and consequently this suiter is entitled to it.' 4 Cranch 449.\n The Court rejected entirely the argument of the counsel, held The Betsey and Charlotte indistinguishable from La Vengeance, and interpreted the Judiciary Act to mean that Congress had placed forfeitures 'among the civil causes of \n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 159]\n\u00a0\n admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.' La Vengeance was held conclusive of the proposition that in such cases there could be no right to trial by jury-in other words that under the American law as repeatedly declared between 1796 and 1808, the common law was not, within the meaning of the Judiciary Act, competent to give a remedy in forfeiture cases. \n10\n When the question of a right to a common law trial in a forfeiture case was certified to the Supreme Court in 1812, the Court found it unnecessary to hear any argument and counsel became so convinced that the authorities were conclusive that he did not press the case. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n These cases were reviewed many times in this Court and elsewhere, and cited for the proposition that in the United States, in noteworthy distinction from England, the admiralty forfeiture jurisdiction was exclusive. \n12\n This cul- \n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 160]\n\u00a0\n minated in a holding in 1868, The Eagle, 8 Wall. 15, 25, 26, that the words in the 1789 Act giving admiralty jurisdiction in forfeiture cases were superfluous and of no effect since 'the general jurisdiction in admiralty exists without regard to it.'\n Against the background of these cases we may consider Smith v. Maryland, 18 How. 71, which the Court cites for the existence of the forfeiture exception to the general rule as to exclusive admiralty jurisdiction of in rem proceedings. In that case the power of the state to protect a fishery by making it unlawful to catch oysters in a certain manner and to inflict a penalty of forfeiture upon a vessel employed in violation of the law was upheld. The entire argument was directed at considerations foreign to the of this case and the Judiciary Act was not even mentioned; the opinion of the Court deals almost exclusively with the question of whether the state statute was in conflict with the commerce clause of the Constitution. The Court held in passing that the mere existence of federal admiralty jurisdiction does not per se bar the states from legislating for the protection of its fisheries, a proposition which no one can doubt. It is apparent that the issue now before us, interpretation of the Judiciary Act, was not presented to the Court nor decided by it in the Smith case. The Court in the instant case treats Smith v. Maryland as a holding for a proposition which can flow from it only by accident. \n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 161]\n\u00a0\n If Smith v. Maryland accidentally interpreted the Judiciary Act, it did so in a manner in conflict not only with all the cases decided before it in which the issue was squarely considered but with the great number of cases decided since. In The Moses Taylor, 1866, 4 Wall. 411, 431, our leading case, the Court declared that 'a proceeding in rem, as used in the admiralty courts, is not a remedy afforded by the common law.' The considerations of policy which underlay this interpretation of the Judiciary Act were attributed to Justice Story: \"The admiralty jurisdiction,' says Mr. Justice Story, 'naturally connects itself, on the one hand, with our diplomatic relations and the duties to foreign nations and their subjects; and, on the other hand, with the great interests of navigation and commerce, foreign and domestic. There is, then, a peculiar wisdom in giving to the national government a jurisdiction of this sort which cannot be yielded, except for the general good, and which multiplies the securities for the public peace abroad, and gives to commerce and navigation the most encouraging support at home.\" The Moses Taylor, supra, 4 Wall. 430, 431.\n The language of The Moses Taylor has been repeated so often that I should have thought it to be a truism of the law. In The Belfast, 7 Wall. 624, 644, 'There is no form of action at common law which, when compared with the proceeding in rem in the admiralty, can be regarded as a concurrent remedy.' In Rounds v. Cloverport Foundry & Machine Co., \n237 \nU.S. 303, 306\n, 35 S.Ct. 596, 597, 'The proceeding in rem ... is within the exclusive jurisdiction of admiralty.' In Knapp, Stout & Co. Company v. McCaffrey, \n177 \nU.S. 638, 648\n, 20 S.Ct. 824, 829: 'The true distinction between such proceedings as are and such as are not invasions of the exclusive admiralty jurisdiction is this: If the cause of action be one cognizable in admiralty, and the suit be in rem against the thing itself ... the proceeding is essentially one in admiralty.' \n\n[318 \nU.S. 133, 162]\n\u00a0\n In Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., \n264 \nU.S. 109, 124\n, 44 S.Ct. 274, 277: 'A state may not provide a remedy in rem for any cause of action within the admiralty jurisdiction.' \n13\n\u00a0\n\n Cases prior to Smith v. Maryland explicitly held that forfeitures were not to be enforced by an in rem action at common law. Cases since Smith v. Maryland have repeatedly declared that admiralty's in rem jurisdiction is exclusive of state court action. I therefore see no reason for placing any reliance on the Smith case which only consequentially affected an issue to which it gave no consideration at all; and for purposes of settling a jurisdictional issue such as this, the English practice, which need give no consideration to the complexities of dual sovereignty and diverse state laws, seems peculiarly inapplicable. By permitting maritime suits against persons in state courts and by denying the state courts jurisdiction of suits against vessels, the right to trial by jury is adequately preserved at the same time that the policy of ultimate exclusive national regulation of ships in commerce is saved. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] We are not concerned here with the question whether the admiralty jurisdiction was fully concurrent with that of the Exchequer even in the case of seizures on navigable waters. During the historic struggle between the admiralty and the common law courts the latter sought, with varying success, to restrict the admiralty jurisdiction to the high seas and to exclude it from habors, estuaries, and other arms of the sea.

But by the 1690s such cases were tried at common law in the General Court before a jury. Although the records of the General Court were destroyed by fire during the evacuation of Richmond in 1865, copies of some of its more important proceedings during the 1690s, contemporaneously transmitted to England, have been preserved, and are reprinted in Executive Journals of the Council of Colonial Virginia (Ed.

II, c. 7, against The Mary and Margaret in the court of vice-admiralty. Four years later the Privy Council upheld the issuance of the writ, apparently accepting the view that a seizure in any part of New York harbor which was 'within the body of the county' rather than on the high seas came within the exclusive jurisdiction of the common law courts-a ruling which probably left to the vice-admiralty court but a small role in cases under the Navigation Acts, except when the particular Act contained an express grant of such jurisdiction (cf. Note 3, supra). See Reports of Cases in the Vice-Admiralty and Admiralty of New York 1715-1788 (Ed.

His comment leaves no doubt that he considered the admiralty jurisdiction for forfeiture exclusive: 'The reason of the legislature for putting seizures of this kind on the admiralty side of the court was the great danger to the revenue if such cases should be left to the caprice of juries.' 4 Cranch at page 446. \n[\nFootnote 11\n] Whelan v.

And so it had done before, in the case of the La Vengeance.' Waring v. Clarke, 5 How. 441, 458. 'All the cases thus arising under the revenue and navigation laws were held to be civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction within the words of the Constitution, and, as such, were properly assigned to the District Court, in the act of 1789, as part of its admiralty jurisdiction.'

Sewall Myer, of Houston, Tex., and Joseph A. Padway, of Washington, D.C., for petitioners.\n Mr. Bernard A. Golding, of Houston, Tex., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The facts of this case are simple. Ritter, the respondent, made an agreement with a contractor named Plaster for the construction of a building at 2810 Broadway, Houston, Texas. The contract gave Plaster the right to make his own arrangements regarding the employment of labor in the construction of the building. He employed non-union carpenters and painters. The respondent was also \n\n[315 \nU.S. 722, 723]\n\u00a0\n the owner of Ritter's Cafe, a restaurant at 418 Broadway, a mile and a half away. So far as the record discloses, the new building was wholly unconnected with the business of Ritter's Cafe. All of the restaurant employees were members of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees International Alliance, Local 808. As to their restaurant work there was no controversy between Ritter and his employees or their union. Nor did the carpenters' and painters' unions, the petitioners here, have any quarrel with Ritter over his operation of the restaurant. No construction work of any kind was performed at the restaurant, and no carpenters or painters were employed there.\n But because Plaster employed non-union labor, members of the carpenters' and painters' unions began to picket Ritter's Cafe immediately after the construction got under way. Walking back and forth in front of the restaurant, a picket carried a placard which read: 'This Place is Unfair to Carpenters and Joiners Union of America, Local No. 213, and Painters Local No. 130, Affiliated with American Federation of Labor.' Later on the wording was changed as follows: 'The Owner of This Cafe Has Awarded a Contract to Erect a Building to W. A. Plaster Who is Unfair to the Carpenters Union 213 and Painter Union 130, Affiliated With the American Federation of Labor.' According to the undisputed finding of the Texas courts, which is controlling here, Ritter's Cafe was picketed 'for the avowed purpose of forcing and compelling plaintiff (Ritter) to require the said contractor, Plaster, to use and employ only members of the defendant unions on the building under construction in the 2800 block on Broadway.' Contemporaneous with this picketing, the restaurant workers' union, Local No. 808, called Ritter's employees out on strike and withdrew the union card from his establishment. Union truck drivers refused to cross the picket line to deliver food and other supplies to the res- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 722, 724]\n\u00a0\n taurant. The effect of all this was 'to prevent members of all trades- unions from patronizing plaintiff's cafe and to erect a barrier around plaintiff's cafe, across which no member of defendant-unions or an affiliate will go.' A curtailment of sixty per-cent of Ritter's business resulted.\n Holding the petitioners' activities to constitute a violation of the state anti-trust law, Texas Penal Code, Art. 1632 et seq., the Texas Court of Civil Appeals enjoined them from picketing Ritter's Cafe. The decree forbade neither picketing elsewhere (including the building under construction by Plaster) nor communication of the facts of the dispute by any means other than the picketing of Ritter's restaurant. 149 S.W.2d 694. We brought the case here to consider the claim that the decree of the Court of Civil Appeals (the Supreme Court of Texas having refused a writ of error) infringed the freedom of speech guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n314 \nU.S. 595\n, 62 S.Ct. 111, 86 L.Ed. --.\n The economic contest between employer and employee has never concerned merely the immediate disputants. The clash of such conflicting interests inevitably implicates the well-being of the community. Society has therefore been compelled to throw its weight into the contest. The law has undertaken to balance the effort of the employer to carry on his business free from the interference of others against the effort of labor to further its economic self-interest. And every intervention of government in this struggle has in some respect abridged the freedom of action of one or the other or both.\n The task of mediating between these competing interests has, until recently, been left largely to judicial lawmaking and not to legislation. 'Courts were required, in the absence of legislation, to determine what the public welfare demanded, whether it would not be best subserved by leaving the contestants free to resort to any means not \n\n[315 \nU.S. 722, 725]\n\u00a0\n involving a breach of the peace or injury to tangible property, whether it was consistent with the public interest that the contestants should be permitted to invoke the aid of others not directly interested in the matter in controversy, and to what extent incidental injury to persons not parties to the controversy should be held justifiable.' Mr. Justice Brandeis in Truax v. Corrigan, \n257 \nU.S. 312, 363\n, 42 S.Ct. 124, 141, 27 A.L.R. 375. The right of the state to determine whether the common interest is best served by imposing some restrictions upon the use of weapons for inflicting economic injury in the struggle of conflicting industrial forces has not previously been doubted. See Mr. Justice Holmes in Aikens v. Wisconsin, \n195 \nU.S. 194, 205\n, 25 S.Ct. 3, 5, and Mr. Justice Brandeis in Truax v. Corrigan, supra, 257 U.S. at page 372, 42 S.Ct. at page 144, 27 A.L.R. 375; Dorchy v. Kansas, \n272 \nU.S. 306, 311\n, 47 S.Ct. 86, 87, and Senn v. Tile Layers Protective Union, \n301 \nU.S. 468, 481\n, 57 S.Ct. 857, 863. But the petitioners now claim that there is to be found in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment a constitutional command that peaceful picketing must be wholly immune from regulation by the community in order to protect the general interest, that the states must be powerless to confine the use of this industrial weapon within reasonable bounds.\n The constitutional right to communicate peaceably to the public the facts of a legitimate dispute is not lost merely because a labor dispute is involved, Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88\n, 60 S.Ct. 736, or because the communication takes the form of picketing, even when the communication does not concern a dispute between an employer and those directly employed by him. American Federation of Labor v. Swing, \n312 \nU.S. 321\n, 61 S.Ct. 568. But the circumstance that a labor dispute is the occasion of exercising freedom of expression does not give that freedom any greater constitutional sanction or render it completely inviolable. Where, as here, claims on behalf of free speech are met with claims on be- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 722, 726]\n\u00a0\n half of the authority of the state to impose reasonable regulations for the protection of the community as a whole, the duty of this Court is plain. Whenever state action is challenged as a denial of 'liberty', the question always is whether the state has violated 'the essential attributes of that liberty'. Mr. Chief Justice Hughes in Near v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 697, 708\n, 51 S.Ct. 625, 628. While the right of free speech is embodied in the liberty safeguarded by the Due Process Clause, that Clause postulates the authority of the states to translate into law local policies 'to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of its people .... The limits of this sovereign power must always be determined with appropriate regard to the particular subject of its exercise.' 283 U.S. at page 707, 51 S.Ct. at page 628. 'The boundary at which the conflicting interests balance cannot be determined by any general formula in advance, but points in the line, or helping to establish it, are fixed by decisions that this or that concrete case falls on the nearer or farther side.' Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter, \n209 \nU.S. 349, 355\n, 28 S.Ct. 529, 531, 14 Ann. Cas. 560.\n In the circumstances of the case before us Texas has declared that its general welfare would not be served if, in a controversy between a contractor and building workers' unions, the unions were permitted to bring to bear the full weight of familiar weapons of industrial combat against a restaurant business, which, as a business, has no nexus with the building dispute but which happens to be owned by a person who contracts with the builder. The precise question is, therefore, whether the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits Texas from drawing this line in confining the area of unrestricted industrial warfare.\n Texas has undertaken to localize industrial conflict by prohibiting the exertion of concerted pressure directed at the business, wholly outside the economic context of the real dispute, of a person whose relation to the dispute arises from his business dealings with one of the dispu- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 722, 727]\n\u00a0\n tants. The state has not attempted to outlaw whatever psychological pressure may be involved in the mere communication by an individual of the facts relating to his differences with another. Nor are we confronted here with a limitation upon speech in circumstances where there exists an 'interdependence of economic interest of all engaged in the same industry', American Federation of Labor v. Swing, \n312 \nU.S. 321, 326\n, 61 S.Ct. 568, 570. Compare Journeymen Tailors Union Local No. 195 v. Miller's Inc., \n312 \nU.S. 658\n, 61 S.Ct. 732, and Bakery & Pastry Drivers and Helpers Local No. 802 v. Wohl, \n315 \nU.S. 769\n, 62 S.Ct. 816, 86 L.Ed. --, decided this day. This line drawn by Texas in this case is not the line drawn by New York in the Wohl case. The dispute there related to the conditions under which bakery products were sold and delivered to retailers. The business of the retailers was therefore directly involved in the dispute. In picketing the retail establishments the union members would only be following the subject-matter of their dispute. Here we have a different situation. The dispute concerns the labor conditions surrounding the construction of a building by a contractor. Texas has deemed it desirable to insulate from the dispute an establishment which industrially has no connection with the dispute. Texas has not attempted to protect other business enterprises of the building contractor, Plaster, who is the petitioners' real adversary. We need not therefore consider problems that would arise if Texas had undertaken to draw such a line.\n It is true that by peaceful picketing workingmen communicate their grievances. As a means of communicating the facts of a labor dispute peaceful picketing may be a phase of the constitutional right of free utterance. But recognition of peaceful picketing as an exercise of free speech does not imply that the states must be without power to confine the sphere of communication to that directly related to the dispute. Restriction of picketing \n\n[315 \nU.S. 722, 728]\n\u00a0\n to the area of the industry within which a labor dispute arises leaves open to the disputants other traditional modes of communication. To deny to the states the power to draw this line is to write into the Constitution the notion that every instance of peaceful picketing-anywhere and under any circumstances-is necessarily a phase of the controversy which provoked the picketing. Such a view of the Due Process Clause would compel the states to allow the disputants in a particular industrial episode to conscript neutrals having no relation to either the dispute or the industry in which it arose.\n In forbidding such conscription of neutrals in the circumstances of the case before us, Texas represents the prevailing, and probably the unanimous, policy of the states. \n1\n We hold that the Constitution does not forbid Texas to draw the line which has been drawn here. To hold otherwise would be to transmute vital constitutional liberties into doctrinaire dogma. We must be mindful that 'the rights of employers and employees to conduct their economic affairs and to compete with others for a share in the products of industry are subject to modification or qualification in the interests of the society in which they exist. This is but an instance of the power of the State to set the limits of permissible contest open to industrial combatants.' Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88, 103\n, 104 S., 60 S. Ct. 736, 745.\n It is not for us to assess the wisdom of the policy underlying the law of Texas. Our duty is at an end when we find that the Fourteenth Amendment does not deny her the power to enact that policy into law.\n Affirmed. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 722, 729]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MURPHY concur.\n The petitioners sought to convey to the public certain information. The injunction here sustained imposed two restraints on their doing so: (1) it enjoined them from picketing the respondent's cafe; (2) it enjoined them from carrying banners in front of the respondent's cafe, banners which contained inscriptions telling the public that the respondent had awarded a building contract to a man who was unfair to organized labor.\n One member of the petitioner unions at a time peacefully walked in front of the respondent's cafe, carrying such a banner. It is not contended that the inscriptions were untruthful, nor that the language used was immoderate. There was no violence threatened or apprehended. Passers-by were not molested. It is clear from the opinion of the Texas Court of Civil Appeals that the injunction against picketing was granted not because of any law directly aimed at picketing-Texas has no statute against picketing as such-nor to prevent violence, disorder, breach of the peace, or congestion of the streets. The immediate purpose of the injunction was to frustrate the union's objective of conveying information to that part of the public which came near the respondent's place of business, an objective which the court below decided was a violation of Texas antitrust laws. Conveying this truthful information in the manner chosen by the union was calculated to, and did, injure the respondent's business. His business was injured because many of those whom the information reached were sympathetic with the union side of the controversy and declined to patronize the respondent's cafe or have any other business transactions with him. Does injury of this kind to the respondent's business justify the Texas courts in thus restricting freedom of expression? \n\n[315 \nU.S. 722, 730]\n\u00a0\n I am unable to agree that the controversy which prompted the unions to give publicity to the facts was no more than a private quarrel between the union and the non-union contractor. Whether members or non-members of the building trades unions are employed is known to depend to a large extent upon the attitude of building contractors. Their attitude can be greatly influenced by those with whom they do business. Disputes between one or two unions and one contractor over the merits and justice of union as opposed to non-union systems of employment are but a part of the nationwide controversy over the subject. I can see no reason why members of the public should be deprived of any opportunity to get information which might enable them to use their influence to tip the scales in favor of the side they think is right.\n If there had been any doubt before, I should have thought that our decision in Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88\n, 60 S.Ct. 736, settled the question. There we said at pages 102-104 of 310 U.S., at page 744 of 60 S.Ct.: 'In the circumstances of our times the dissemination of information concerning the facts of a labor dispute must be regarded as within that area of free discussion that is guaranteed by the Constitution. ... Free discussion concerning the conditions in industry and the causes of labor disputes appears to us indispensable to the effective and intelligent use of the processes of popular government to shape the destiny of modern industrial society. The issues raised by regulations, such as are challenged here, infringing upon the right of employees effectively to inform the public of the facts of a labor dispute are part of this larger problem. ... It may be that effective exercise of the means of advancing public knowledge may persuade some of those reached to refrain from entering into advantageous relations with the business establishment which is the scene of the dispute. ... But the group in power at any moment may not impose penal sanctions on \n\n[315 \nU.S. 722, 731]\n\u00a0\n peaceful and truthful discussion of matters of public interest merely on a showing that others may thereby be persuaded to take action inconsistent with its interests.'\n Whatever injury the respondent suffered here resulted from the peaceful and truthful statements made to the public that he had employed a non-union contractor to erect a building. This information, under the Thornhill case, the petitioners were privileged to impart and the public was entitled to receive. It is one thing for a state to regulate the use of its streets and highways so as to keep them open and available for movement of people and property, Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147, 160\n, 60 S.Ct. 146, 150; or to pass general regulations as to their use in the interest of public safety, peace, comfort, or convenience, Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296, 306\n, 307 S., 60 S.Ct. 900, 904, 128 A.L.R. 1352; or to protect its citizens from violence and breaches of the peace by those who are upon them, Thornhill v. Alabama, supra, \n310 \nU.S. 105\n, 60 S.Ct. 745. It is quite another thing, however, to 'abridge the constitutional liberty of one rightfully upon the street to impart information through speech or the distribution of literature ....' Schneider v. State, supra, \n308 \nU.S. 160\n, 60 S.Ct. 150. The court below did not rest the restraints imposed on these petitioners upon the state's exercise of its permissible powers to regulate the use of its streets or the conduct of those rightfully upon them. Instead, it barred the petitioners from using the streets to convey information to the public because of the particular type of information they wished to convey. In so doing, it directly restricted the petitioners' rights to express themselves publicly concerning an issue which we recognized in the Thornhill case to be of public importance. It imposed the restriction for the reason that the public's response to such information would result in injury to a particular person's business, a reason which we said in the Thornhill case was insufficient to justify curtailment of free expression. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 722, 732]\n\u00a0\n The injunction is defended, however, on the ground that the petitioners have been prohibited from passing information to the public at only some, but not at all places. It may be that the petitioners are left free to inform the public at other places or in other ways. Possibly they might, at greater expense, reach the public over the radio or through the newspapers, although if the theory of the court below be correct, it would seem that they could be enjoined from using these means of communication, too, to persuade people not to patronize the respondent's cafe. In any event, 'one is not to have the exercise of his liberty of expression in appropriate places abridged on the plea that it may be exercised in some other place.' Schneider v. State, supra, \n308 \nU.S. 163\n, 60 S.Ct. 151.\n According the Constitutional prohibition against any law 'abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press' amend. 1-a prohibition made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment-'as a command of the broadest scope that explicit language, read in the context of a liberty- loving society, will allow', Bridges v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 252\n, 62 S.Ct. 190, 194, 86 L.Ed. --, I think the judgment should be reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice REED, dissenting.\n The Texas court enjoined petitioners, a labor union of carpenters and joiners, another union of painters, and all of their members from picketing the restaurant of the respondent, E. R. Ritter, plaintiff below, doing business under the trade name of Ritter's Cafe, at 418 Broadway, in Houston, 'and from carrying banners peacefully and in any other manner upon the sidewalks in front' of the restaurant. There had been no violence. Only two pickets, one from each union, walked back and forth, carrying placards which before the injunction issued were modified to read, 'The Owner of This Cafe Has Awarded a Contract to Erect a Building to W. A. Plaster Who is Unfair to the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 722, 733]\n\u00a0\n Carpenters Union 213 and Painter Union 130, Affiliated with the American Federation of Labor.'\n Plaster, a building contractor, who putting up a structure for respondent, Ritter, in the 2800 block of Broadway, under a contract which did not require Plaster to employ union labor. The record does not show whether or not this new building is to be used in the restaurant business. He was employing non-union workers. The restaurant, however, was unionized, its employees being members of Hotel and Restaurant Employees' Local 808. They quit on the day the picketing began, union drivers refused to deliver supplies, and the business slumped sixty per cent. The court found petitioners' conduct an invasion of respondents' right to conduct a legitimate business and an attempt to interfere illegally with a contract with third parties.\n The injunction was issued by the Texas court because such invasion or attempt at invasion of the rights of a business man was held 'to create restrictions in the free pursuit' of business contrary to the Texas anti- trust laws. Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat. (Vernon, 1936) Arts. 7426, 7428; Tex. Penal Code (Vernon, 1936) Arts. 1632, 1634, 1635. Tex.Civ.App., 149 S.W.2d 694, 699. The petitioners' challenge to the validity of the injunction is based on the constitutional right of free speech guaranteed them by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147, 160\n, 60 S.Ct. 146, 150.\n This challenge involves two particularly delicate relationships. These are that between the federal and state governments and that between a state and labor unions within its borders. So far as the injunction depends upon the action of the Texas court in construing its anti-trust statutes to forbid such interference with the restaurant business, the order is unassailable here. But if such an interpretation denies to Texans claimed rights guaranteed to them by the federal Constitution, the state authority must \n\n[315 \nU.S. 722, 734]\n\u00a0\n accommodate its orders to preserve that right. Cf. International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 \nU.S. 216\n, 34 S.Ct. 853; Lindsey v. Washington, \n301 \nU.S. 397, 400\n, 57 S.Ct. 797, 798; Minnesota v. Probate Court, \n309 \nU.S. 270, 273\n, 60 S.Ct. 523, 525, 126 A.L.R. 530.\n Recent cases in this Court have sought to make more definite the extent and limitations of the rights of free speech in labor disputes. For some time there has been general acceptance of the fundamental right to publicize 'the facts of a labor dispute in a peaceful way through appropriate means.' One of the recognized means is by orderly picketing with banners or placards. Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88, 104\n, 60 S.Ct. 736, 745. In Carlson v. California, \n310 \nU.S. 106, 113\n, 60 S. Ct. 746, 749, we said: 'For the reasons set forth in our opinion in Thornhill v. Alabama, supra, publicizing the facts of a labor dispute in a peaceful way through appropriate means, whether by pamphlet, by word of mouth or by banner, must now be regarded as within that liberty of communication which is secured to every person by the Fourteenth Amendment against abridgment by a State.' The desire of both sides in labor controversies to gain advantages for themselves and limit similar opportunities for their opponents has led each to seek to expand or contract the constitutionally protected area for picketing operations as suits their respective purposes. Recognition of the basic right to picket made the location of lines beyond which picketing could not be employed an important objective of those who suffer from its use.\n In the Carlson and Thornhill cases legislation forbidding picketing for the purpose of interfering with the business of another was invalidated because it was an unconstitutional prohibition of the worker's right to publicize his situation. It was not thought of sufficient importance in either case to mention in the opinion whether the picket was an interested disputant with those picketed or an utter stranger to the controversy and the industry. In those \n\n[315 \nU.S. 722, 735]\n\u00a0\n carefully phrased decisions the possibility of state control of socially menacing evils, flowing from industrial disputes, was recognized, but those general evils were not of the kind which were considered to warrant interference with free speech by peaceful picketing. \n1\n We said:\n'It is true that the rights of employers and employees to conduct their economic affairs and to compete with others for a share in the products of industry are subject to modification or qualification in the interests of the society in which they exist. This is but an instance of the power of the State to set the limits of permissible contest open to industrial combatants. See Mr. Justice Brandeis in Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443\n at page 488, 41 S.Ct. 172, at page 184, 16 A.L.R. 196. It does not follow that the State in dealing with the evils arising from industrial disputes may impair the effective exercise of the right to discuss freely industrial relations which are matters of public concern. A contrary conclusion could be used to support abridgment of freedom of speech and of the press concerning almost every matter of importance to society,'2\n\n An instance of state control over peaceful picketing soon appeared. In Milk Wagon Drivers Union v. Meadowmoor Co., \n312 \nU.S. 287\n, 61 S.Ct. 552, 566, 132 A.L.R. 1200, this Court, though not without dissent, upheld Illinois' ruling that where 'acts of picketing in themselves peaceful' are enmeshed in violence, immediate future peaceful picketing may be enjoined. This decision compelled a less extreme result in Hotel & Restaurant Employees' Int'l Alliance v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, \n315 \nU.S. 437\n, 62 S.Ct. 706, 86 L.Ed. --, decided March 2, 1942. In the latter case, the order approved 'forbids only violence' and 'permits peaceful picketing.' Nothing more than the validity of prohibitions against violence was decided as to the constitutionality of the Wisconsin Employment Peace Act, St.Wis.1939,  111.01 et seq. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 722, 736]\n\u00a0\n On the same day that Meadowmoor was handed down, American Federation of Labor v. Swing, \n312 \nU.S. 321\n, 61 S.Ct. 568, was decided. In Swing's case a union of beauty shop workers picketed a beauty parlor. They were not and had not been employees of the establishment. We stated the issue thus: 'More thorough study of the record and full argument have reduced the issue to this: is the constitutional guarantee of freedom of discussion infringed by the common law policy of a state forbidding resort to peaceful persuasion through picketing merely because there is no immediate employer-employee dispute?' 3 There was nothing in the opinion to intimate that the answer would have varied, if the union had been a local of the teamsters or painters. The injunction granted by Illinois was set aside with these words:\n'Such a ban of free communication is inconsistent with the guarantee of freedom of speech. That a state has ample power to regulate the local problems thrown up by modern industry and to preserve the peace is axiomatic. But not even these essential powers are unfettered by the requirements of the Bill of Rights. The scope of the Fourteenth Amendment is not confined by the notion of a particular state regarding the wise limits of an injunction in an industrial dispute, whether those limits be defined by statute or by the judicial organ of the state. A state cannot exclude workingmen from peacefully exercising the right of free communication by drawing the circle of economic competition between employers and workers so small as to contain only an employer and those directly employed by him. The interdependence of economic interest of all engaged in the same industry has become a commonplace. American (Steel) Foundries v. Tri-City Council, \n257 \nU.S. 184, 209\n, 42 S.Ct. 72, 78, 27 A.L.R. 360. The right of free communication cannot therefore be mutilated by denying it to work- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 722, 737]\n\u00a0\n ers, in a dispute with an employer, even though they are not in his employ. Communication by such employees of the facts of a dispute, deemed by them to be relevant to their interests, can no more be barred because of concern for the economic interests against which they are seeking to enlist public opinion than could the utterance protected in Thornhill's case. 'Members of a union might, without special statutory authorization by a state, make known the facts of a labor dispute, for freedom of speech is guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.' Senn v. Tile Layers Union, \n301 \nU.S. 468, 478\n, 57 S.Ct. 857, 862.'4\n\n Today this Court decides Bakery & Pastry Drivers & Helpers Local 802 v. Wohl, \n315 \nU.S. 769\n, 62 S.Ct. 816, 86 L.Ed. --. In this case the union picketed manufacturing bakers who sold to and threatened to picket grocers and retail bakers who bought from peddlers. The peddlers purchased bakery goods and sold them to the trade. The labor controversy was the effort of the unions to compel the peddlers to hire a union driver one day a week. The state forbade the picketing of the manufacturers and of the retailers, regardless of whether the picketing placards were directed at the product or the general business of the retailers. \n5\n Although there is no possible labor relation between the peddlers and their customers or between the grocers and retail bakers and the union, we decline to permit New York to take steps to protect the places of business of those who dealt with the peddlers against picketing. It seems obvious that the selling of baked products, distributed by \n\n[315 \nU.S. 722, 738]\n\u00a0\n the peddlers is a minor part of the grocery business. Recent cases illustrate the present tendency of state courts to permit workers outside the industry picketed to publicize their labor disputes with others. \n6\n To permit the Wohl injunction, without evidence of special embarrassment to peace and order would, we hold, go beyond permissible limitations on free speech.\n We are of the view that the right of free speech upheld in these decisions requires Texas to permit the publicizing of the dissatisfaction over Mr. Ritter's contract for his new building. Until today orderly, regulated, picketing has been within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment. Such picketing was obviously disadvantageous to the business affected. In balancing social advantages it has been felt that the preservation of free speech in labor disputes was more important than the freedom of enterprise from the burdens of the picket line. It was a limitation on state power to deal as it pleased with labor disputes; a limitation consented to by the state when it became a part of the nation and one of precisely the same quality as those enforced in Carlson, Thornhill and Swing.\n We are not here forced, as the Court assumes, to support a constitutional interpretation that peaceful picketing 'must be wholly immune from regulation by the community in order to protect the general interest.' We do not doubt the right of the state to impose not only some but many restrictions upon peaceful picketing. Reasonable numbers, quietness, truthful placards, open ingress and egress, suitable hours or other proper limitations, not \n\n[315 \nU.S. 722, 739]\n\u00a0\n destructive of the right to tell of labor difficulties, may be required. The Court limits its holding to the peculiar circumstances of this case. All decisions necessarily are so limited but from the decisions rules are drawn. By this decision a state rule is upheld which forbids peaceful picketing of businesses by strangers to the business and the industry of which it is a part. The legal kernel of the Court's present decision is that the 'sphere' of free speech is confined to the 'area of the industry within which a labor dispute arises.' This rule is applied, in this case, even though the picketers are publicizing a labor dispute arising from a contract to which the sole owner of the business picketed is a party. Even if the construction contract covered an attached addition to the restaurant, the Court's opinion would not permit picketing directed against the restaurant. To construe this Texas decision as within state powers and the Wohl decision as outside their boundaries, plainly discloses the inadequacy of the test presumably employed, that is, the supposed lack of economic 'interdependence' between the picketers and the picketed.\n The philosophy behind the conclusion of the Court in this case gives to a state the right to bar from picket lines workers who are not a part of the industry picketed. We are not told whether the test of eligibility to picket is to be applied by crafts or enterprises or how we are to determine economic interdependence or the boundaries of particular industries. Such differentiations are yet to be considered. The decision withdraws federal constitutional protection from the freedom of workers outside an industry to state their side of a labor controversy by picketing. So long as civil government is able to function normally for the protection of its citizens, such a limitation upon free speech is unwarranted. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The authorities are collected in Teller, Labor Disputes and Collective Bargaining (1940), sec. 123; Hellerstein, Secondary Boycotts in Labor Disputes, 47 Yale L.J. 341; Frey, Cases on Labor Law (1941), pp. 239- 273; cf.

STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE(1942)\nNo. 255\nArgued: February 5, 1942Decided: March 9, 1942\n\n\n\n Mr. Hayden C. Covington, of Brooklyn, N.Y., for appellant.\n Mr. Frank R. Kenison, of Conway, N.H., for appellee. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 568, 569]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant, a member of the sect known as Jehovah's Witnesses, was convicted in the municipal court of Rochester, New Hampshire, for violation of Chapter 378, Section 2, of the Public Laws of New Hampshire: 'No person shall address any offensive, derisive or annoying word to any other person who is lawfully in any street or other public place, nor call him by any offensive or derisive name, nor make any noise or exclamation in his presence and hearing with intent to deride, offend or annoy him, or to prevent him from pursuing his lawful business or occupation.'\n The complaint charged that appellant 'with force and arms, in a certain public place in said city of Rochester, to wit, on the public sidewalk on the easterly side of Wakefield Street, near unto the entrance of the City Hall, did unlawfully repeat, the words following, addressed to the complainant, that is to say, 'You are a God damned racketeer' and 'a damned Fascist and the whole government of Rochester are Fascists or agents of Fascists' the same being offensive, derisive and annoying words and names'.\n Upon appeal there was a trial de novo of appellant before a jury in the Superior Court. He was found guilty and the judgment of conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State. 91 N.H. 310, 18 A.2d 754.\n By motions and exceptions, appellant raised the questions that the statute was invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States in that it placed an unreasonable restraint on freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of worship, and because it was vague and indefinite. These contentions were overruled and the case comes here on appeal.\n There is no substantial dispute over the facts. Chaplinsky was distributing the literature of his sect on the streets \n\n[315 \nU.S. 568, 570]\n\u00a0\n of Rochester on a busy Saturday afternoon. Members of the local citizenry complained to the City Marshal, Bowering, that Chaplinsky was denouncing all religion as a 'racket'. Bowering told them that Chaplinsky was lawfully engaged, and then warned Chaplinsky that the crowd was getting restless. Some time later a disturbance occurred and the traffic officer on duty at the busy intersection started with Chaplinsky for the police station, but did not inform him that he was under arrest or that he was going to be arrested. On the way they encountered Marshal Bowering who had been advised that a riot was under way and was therefore hurrying to the scene. Bowering repeated his earlier warning to Chaplinsky who then addressed to Bowering the words set forth in the complaint.\n Chaplinsky's version of the affair was slightly different. He testified that when he met Bowering, he asked him to arrest the ones responsible for the disturbance. In reply Bowering cursed him and told him to come along. Appellant admitted that he said the words charged in the complaint with the exception of the name of the Deity.\n Over appellant's objection the trial court excluded as immaterial testimony relating to appellant's mission 'to preach the true facts of the Bible', his treatment at the hands of the crowd, and the alleged neglect of duty on the part of the police. This action was approved by the court below which held that neither provocation nor the truth of the utterance would constitute a defense to the charge.\n It is now clear that 'Freedom of speech and freedom of the press, which are protected by the First Amendment from infringement by Congress, are among the fundamental personal rights and liberties which are protected by the Fourteenth Amendment from invasion by state \n\n[315 \nU.S. 568, 571]\n\u00a0\n action'. Lovell v. City of Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 444, 450\n, 58 S.Ct. 666, 668.1 Freedom of worship is similarly sheltered. Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296, 303\n, 60 S.Ct. 900, 903, 128 A.L. R. 1352\n\n\n Appellant assails the statute as a violation of all three freedoms, speech, press and worship, but only an attack on the basis of free speech is warranted. The spoken, not the written, word is involved. And we cannot conceive that cursing a public officer is the exercise of religion in any sense of the term. But even if the activities of the appellant which preceded the incident could be viewed as religious in character, and therefore entitled to the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment, they would not cloak him with immunity from the legal consequences for concomitant acts committed in violation of a valid criminal statute. We turn, therefore, to an examination of the statute itself.\n Allowing the broadest scope to the language and purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment, it is well understood that the right of free speech is not absolute at all times and under all circumstances. \n2\n There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention \n\n[315 \nU.S. 568, 572]\n\u00a0\n and punishment of which has never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem. \n3\n These include the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or 'fighting' words-those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace. \n4\n It has been well observed that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality. \n5\n 'Resort to epithets or personal abuse is not in any proper sense communication of information or opinion safeguarded by the Constitution, and its punishment as a criminal act would raise no question under that instrument.' Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296, 309\n, 310 S., 60 S.Ct. 900, 906, 128 A.L.R. 1352.\n The state statute here challenged comes to us authoritatively construed by the highest court of New Hampshire. It has two provisions-the first relates to words or names addressed to another in a public place; the second refers to noises and exclamations. The court (91 N.H. 310, 18 A. 2d 757) said: 'The two provisions are distinct. One may stand separately from the other. Assuming, without holding, that the second were unconstitutional, the first could stand if constitutional.' We accept that construction of severability and limit our consideration to the first provision of the statute. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[315 \nU.S. 568, 573]\n\u00a0\n On the authority of its earlier decisions, the state court declared that the statute's purpose was to preserve the public peace, no words being 'forbidden except such as have a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person to whom, individually, the remark is addressed'.7 It was further said: 'The word 'offensive' is not to be defined in terms of what a particular addressee thinks. ... The test is what men of common intelligence would understand would be words likely to cause an average addressee to fight. ... The English language has a number of words and expressions which by general consent and 'fighting words' when said without a disarming smile. ... Such words, as ordinary men know, are likely to cause a fight. So are threatening, profane or obscene revilings. Derisive and annoying words can be taken as coming within the purview of the statute as heretofore interpreted only when they have this characteristic of plainly tending to excite the addressee to a breach of the peace. ... The statute, as construed, does no more than prohibit the face-to-face words plainly likely to cause a breach of the peace by the addressee, words whose speaking constitute a breach of the peace by the speaker-including 'classical fighting words', words in current use less 'classical' but equally likely to cause violence, and other disorderly words, including profanity, obscenity and threats.'\n We are unable to say that the limited scope of the statute as thus construed contravenes the constitutional right of free expression. It is a statute narrowly drawn and limited to define and punish specific conduct lying within the domain of state power, the use in a public place of words likely to cause a breach of the peace. Cf. Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296, 311\n, 60 S.Ct. 900, 906, 128 A.L.R. 1352; Thornhill v. Alabama, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 568, 574]\n\u00a0\n \n310 \nU.S. 88, 105\n, 60 S.Ct. 736, 745. This conclusion necessarily disposes of appellant's contention that the statute is so vague and indefinite as to render a conviction thereunder a violation of due process. A statute punishing verbal acts, carefully drawn so as not unduly to impair liberty of expression, is not too vague for a criminal law. Cf. Fox v. Washington, \n236 \nU.S. 273, 277\n, 35 S.Ct. 383, 384.8\n Nor can we say that the application of the statute to the facts disclosed by the record substantially or unreasonably impinges upon the privilege of free speech. Argument is unnecessary to demonstrate that the appellations 'damn racketeer' and 'damn Fascist' are epithets likely to provoke the average person to retaliation, and thereby cause a breach of the peace.\n The refusal of the state court to admit evidence of provocation and evidence bearing on the truth or falsity of the utterances is open to no Constitutional objection. Whether the facts sought to be proved by such evidence constitute a defense to the charge or may be shown in mitigation are questions for the state court to determine. Our function is fulfilled by a determination that the challenged statute, on its face and as applied, does not contravene the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See also Bridges v.

U.S.(1942)\nNo. 1036\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1942\n\n\n\n On Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Indiana.\n Messrs. Nicholas Kelley, of New York City, and William D. Donnelly, of Washington, D.C., for appellants.\n Mr. Albert Holmes Baldridge, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellee. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 556, 557]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BYRNES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On May 27, 1938, an indictment was returned against appellants ( rfferred to hereafter as Chrysler) and Commercial Credit Company and certain subsidiaries of the latter in the District Court for the Northern District of Indiana. Two similar indictments were returned on the same day, one against Ford Motor Company and certain finance companies affiliated with it and the other against General Motors Corporation and General Motors Acceptance Corporation, its subsidiary. The gist of each of these indictments was that the automobile manufacturer had combined and conspired with its affiliated finance company or companies to restrain trade and commerce in the wholesale and retail sale and financing of its automobiles, in violation of the Sherman Act. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n During the ensuing months Chrysler and Ford reached an agreement with the government that the indictments against them would be quashed and consent decrees entered. Consequently, on November 7, 1938 bills of equity were filed against Chrysler and Ford praying for injunctions against the acts complained of. Answers were filed2 and on November 15, 1938 the consent decrees were entered.\n The lengthy decree against Chrysler need not be described in detail. \n3\n Paragraph 6 imposed numerous specific restraints upon discriminatory practices by Chrysler in favor of Commercial Credit Company. Paragraph 7 imposed correlative restraints upon Commercial Credit Company in its dealings with Chrysler. Paragraph 12A \n\n[316 \nU.S. 556, 558]\n\u00a0\n contained alternative provisions depending upon the outcome of the then still pending criminal proceedings against General Motors. It provided: (1) that if those proceedings should not result in conviction every provision of this consent decree against Chrysler should be suspended until such time as a substantially identical decree should be obtained against General Motors; or (2) that upon conviction of General Motors in the criminal proceedings or upon the entry of a decree in a civil action against General Motors or upon January 1, 1940-whichever should occur first-Chrysler should be free of all restraints imposed by paragraph 6 to the extent that substantially identical restraints had not been imposed upon General Motors by the verdict of guilty or by the civil decree and until such restraints were imposed.\n The question before us concerns paragraph 12, which is separate and distinct from paragraph 12A. Paragraph 12 forbade Chrysler to 'make any loan to or purchase the securities of' Commercial Credit Company or any other credit company. It then provided: 'It is an express condition of this decree that notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph of this paragraph 12 and of any other provisions of this decree, if an effective final order or decree not subject to further review shall not have been entered on or before January 1,1941, requiring General Motors Corporation permanently to divest itself of all ownership and control of General Motors Acceptance Corporation and of all interest therein, then and in the event, nothing in this decree shall preclude the manufacturer ( Chrysler) from acquiring and retaining ownership of and\/or control over or interest in any finance company, or from dealing with such finance company and with the dealers in the manner provided in this decree or in any order or modification or suspension thereof entered pursuant to paragraph 12a .... (emphasis added)'. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 556, 559]\n\u00a0\n Affiliation between Chrysler and Commercial Credit Company or another finance company was thus singled out for special treatment in paragraph 12. The various restraints imposed by paragraphs 6 and 7 were subject to termination upon the contingencies described in paragraph 12A, but the prohibition against affiliation was subject to expiration upon the distinct and different contingency described in paragraph 12, viz., the entry of 'an effective final order or decree not subject to further review ... on or before January 1, 1941, requiring General Motors Corporation permanently to divest itself of all ownership and control of General Motors Acceptance Corporation and of all interest therein * **.'\n Jurisdiction of the cause was retained by the District Court, in paragraph 14, for the purpose of enabling the parties to apply at any time 'for such further orders and directions as may be necessary or appropriate in relation to the construction of or carrying out of this decree' or 'for the modification thereof'.\n The criminal proceedings against General Motors resulted in conviction of the corporation on November 17, 1939. United States v. General Motors Corp., 7 Cir., 121 F.2d 376. General Motors appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. On May 1, 1941 that Court affirmed the conviction and on July 2, 1941 denied rehearing. A petition for certiorari was denied on October 13, 1941. \n314 \nU.S. 618\n, 62 S. Ct. 105, 86 L.Ed. --. A petition for rehearing was denied on November 10, 1941. \n314 \nU.S. 707\n, 62 S.Ct. 178, 86 L.Ed. --.\n Meantime, a civil suit for an injunction had been instituted by the government against General Motors on October 4, 1940 in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. On October 26, 1940 the government agreed to an extension of time to answer to January 20, 1941. This extension of time rendered it impossible for the government to obtain 'an effective final order or decree' against General Motors before January 1, 1941, as \n\n[316 \nU.S. 556, 560]\n\u00a0\n required by paragraph 12 of the consent decree against Chrysler. Accordingly, on December 17, 1940, the government filed a motion in the District Court in Indiana asking that paragraph 12 of the consent decree against Chrysler be modified by substituting 'January 1, 1942' for 'January 1, 1941'. Chrysler opposed this motion, but on December 21, 1940 an order was entered changing the date as requested. Chrysler appealed to this Court from the order of modification, but the appeal was dismissed on December 8, 1941 for want of a a quorum of Justices qualified to sit (\n314 \nU.S. 583\n, 62 S.Ct. 356, 86 L.Ed. --) and on January 5, 1942 rehearing was denied. \n314 \nU.S. 716\n, 62 S.Ct. 476, 86 L.Ed. --.\n Pursuant to additional stipulations between the government and General Motors the time to answer the government's complaint in the civil suit in the Illinois District Court was successively extended to January 27, 1941, to May 1, 1941, to June 15, 1941, and to June 21, 1941. On the latter date, the government filed an amended complaint. By agreement the time in which to answer this amended complaint was extended to July 15, 1941. General Motors then sought a further extension of time to answer the amended complaint, urging that the civil suit should be postponed pending a final determination of the criminal case and that it was about to petition for a writ of certiorari in the criminal case. The government refused to agree to an extension, stating that any further delay might prejudice the government in connection with its consent decree against Chrysler. The District Court nevertheless entered an order for an indefinite extension of the time in which General Motors might answer the amended complaint. On December 1, 1941 the government moved the District Court to set a day certain by which General Motors would be required to answer and otherwise plead. In the motion and in an accompanying affidavit the government explained the connection be- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 556, 561]\n\u00a0\n tween the consent decree against Chrysler and the civil suit against General Motors. After a hearing on the motion the District Court set January 15, 1942 as the date by which General Motors would be required to answer.\n The date fixed by the last mentioned order of the District Court in Illinois in the suit against General Motors created further difficulty with respect to the consent decree in the Chrysler case in the District Court of Indiana. It had now become impossible for the government to obtain 'an effective final order or decree' against General Motors, within the meaning of paragraph 12 of the Chrysler consent decree, prior to January 1, 1942. On December 22, 1941, therefore, the government moved the District Court in Indiana for a second modification of paragraph 12 of the Chrysler consent decree by substituting 'January 1, 1943' for 'January 1, 1942'. In its answer Chrysler opposed the modification. The government offered in evidence a transcript of the proceedings in the civil suit against General Motors. Hearing on the motion was continued to February 16, 1942. On that date no additional evidence was introduced, but argument of counsel was heard.\n The District Court thereupon made the following findings of fact: (a) that the District Court had specifically retained jurisdiction to modify the consent decree; (b) that paragraph 12 was 'framed upon the basis that the ultimate rights of the parties thereunder should be determined by the government's civil antitrust proceedings against General Motors Corporation and affiliated companies'; (c) that 'time was not of the essence with respect to lapse of the bar against affiliation (between Chrysler and Commercial Credit Company or any other finance company)'; (d) 'That to safeguard defendants against undue delay in such proceedings the decree provided for suspension of certain of its prohibitions in the event con- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 556, 562]\n\u00a0\n victions were not obtained in the criminal case against General Motors Corporation by January 1, 1940'; (e) 'that the decree provided for a termination of the bar against affiliation, if the civil proceedings against General Motors Corporation were not successfully concluded by a court of last resort by January 1, 1941'; (f) that a conviction had been obtained in the criminal proceedings against General Motors on November 17, 1939; (g) 'That the government has proceeded diligently and expeditiously in its suit to divorce General Motors Acceptance Corporation from General Motors Corporation'; and (h) 'that further extension of the bar against affiliation will not impose a serious burden upon defendants'. It then concluded as a matter of law 'that the purpose and intent of the decree will be carried out if Chrysler is given the opportunity at any future time to propose a plan for the acquisition of a finance company, and to make a showing that such plan is necessary to prevent Chrysler Corporation from being put at a competitive disadvantage during the pendency of complainant's civil litigation against General Motors Corporation, et al.'\n Upon the basis of these findings and conclusions, the District Court entered an order modifying paragraph 12 by changing the date to January 1, 1943, in compliance with the government's motion. The case is before us on direct appeal from this order. 15 U.S.C.  29, 15 U.S.C.A.  29; 28 U.S.C .  345, 28 U.S.C.A.  345.\n It is clear that under paragraph 14 of the original decree the District Court had jurisdiction to modify it. The question is whether the change in date in paragraph 12 amounted to an abuse of this power to modify. We think that the test to be applied in answering this question is whether the change served to effectuate or to thwart the basic purpose of the original consent decree. United States v. Swift & Co., \n286 \nU.S. 106\n, 52 S.Ct. 460. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 556, 563]\n\u00a0\n The text of the decree itself plainly reveals the nature of that purpose. It was, as stated in the District Court's findings, 'that the ultimate rights of the parties thereunder should be determined by the government's civil antitrust proceedings against General Motors and affiliated companies.' The time limitation was inserted to protect Chrysler from being placed at a competitive disadvantage in the event that the government unduly delayed the initiation and prosecution of the General Motors injunctive proceedings. The District Court found 'that the government has proceeded diligently and expeditiously in its suit to divorce General Motors Acceptance Corporation from General Motors Corporation.' There is room for argument that this statement is markedly generous to the government, inasmuch as the civil suit against General Motors was not instituted until almost two years after the entry of the consent decree and only three months prior to the limiting date in paragraph 12. But the finding is supported by several circumstances: the extended course of the appeals in the criminal proceedings against General Motors, for which the government was not responsible; the obvious bearing of the results in that litigation upon the method of handling the civil litigation with General Motors; and the ruling of the District Court in Illinois in July, 1941 in the General Motors civil action indefinitely extending the time to answer despite the government's objection, presumably to await the final disposition of the criminal case. In view of these considerations the finding of the court below was not unreasonable and we do not think that the government lost its right to seek a modification of the decree.\n The controlling factor thus becomes whether the extension of the ban on affiliation contained in paragraph 12 places Chrysler at a competitive disadvantage. Chrysler made no showing to that effect in the District Court. The \n\n[316 \nU.S. 556, 564]\n\u00a0\n order of December 21, 1941 set the hearing for February 16, 1942 with the explanation that Chrysler had 'requested a continuance in order to produce further evidence'. But on February 16 no evidence was forthcoming. The record therefore reveals that Chrysler terminated its affiliation with Commercial Credit in 1938 before the consent decree was entered and does not reveal that it has since asserted any desire or intention to affiliate with Commercial Credit or with any other finance company. Moreover, we cannot be blind to the fact that the complete cessation of the manufacture of new automobiles and light trucks has drastically minimized the significance of the competitive factor. \n4\n Consequently there is no warrant for disturbing the finding of the court below 'that further extension of the bar against affiliation will not impose a serious burden upon defendants.' If Chrysler desires to affiliate with a finance company and feels that its inability to do so places it at a disadvantage with its competitors, it should make such a showing to the District Court. That court expressly declared that Chrysler was free at any time to propose a plan for affiliation and to demonstrate that such a plan is necessary to avoid unfairness.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS, Mr. Justice MURPHY and Mr. Justice JACKSON took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, dissenting.\n In the spring of 1938 the Government instituted criminal proceedings against the three leading automobile manufacturers, Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors. For pres- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 556, 565]\n\u00a0\n ent purposes Ford may be disregarded. Each indictment charged violation of the Sherman Law arising out of the manufacturer's affiliation with a finance company and its employment of certain trade practices. Chrysler was prepared to consent to a decree prohibiting it from affiliation with any finance company, in addition to its acceptance of restraints against alleged illegal trade practices, provided, however, that the Government succeeded in obtaining similar relief against General Motors. The problem before the negotiators of the consent decree was, therefore, that of determining how long Chrysler should remain subject to the restraints imposed by the decree while General Motors, contesting the claims of the Government, refused to come to terms with it and put it to its law. As the Government recognizes in its brief here, Chrysler was 'entitled to protection against undue delay in the prosecution of the proceedings against General Motors'. With respect to the prohibition against affiliation, the problem was solved by providing in paragraph 12 that if the Government should not have obtained a final decree against General Motors by January 1, 1941, requiring General Motors to divest itself of all interest in its affiliated finance company, the prohibition against Chrysler would cease. This was made an 'express condition' notwhthstanding any other provisions in the decree. \n1\n Obviously, it was an essential feature of the consent \n\n[316 \nU.S. 556, 566]\n\u00a0\n decree against Chrysler that the prohibition of affiliation with the finance company should result in this great competitive disadvantage only long enough to enable the Government to press its claim against General Motors to successful conclusion with all reasonable speed. The parties might have refrained from fixing any definite period, leaving the matter wholly for determination in the future and by undefined standards of reasonableness. Instead, the Government chose to specify with particularity the length of the period-more than two years-in which Chrysler would be required to bear competitive hardships resulting \n\n[316 \nU.S. 556, 567]\n\u00a0\n from the lack of the same restraints upon General Motors.\n Considering the scope and nature of the decree, the interests, both public and private, with which it was dealing, and its technical draftsmanship, there can be no doubt that the precise limits of paragraph 12 were not casually or carelessly defined. Of course, the District Court had the power to modify the consent decree in order to effectuate its basic purposes. The fact that the decree embodied the agreement of the parties no more limited the power of the court than if it had been a contested decree. Swift & Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 311\n, 48 S.Ct. 311; United States v. Swift & Co., \n286 \nU.S. 106, 114\n, 52 S.Ct. 460, 462; United States v. Int. Harvester Co., \n274 \nU.S. 693\n, 47 S.Ct. 748. The decree itself contains an express recognition of the court's power of modification, but such a reservation plainly added nothing to the decree and subtracted nothing from the significance of terms made an express condition of the imposed restraint. The burden was still, as it always is, on the moving party-and here it was the Government-to show that circumstances justified a change in such terms. In fact, on December 17, 1940, within three weeks of the expiration of the restraint against Chrysler, the Government sought for an extension of that restraint for another year upon the grounds that the time 'was by mistake of the parties underestimated.' The extension was opposed but granted by the District Court. An appeal was brought here but was dismissed on December 8, 1941, 'for want of a quorum of Justices qualified to sit.' Chrysler Corporation v. United States, \n314 \nU.S. 583\n, 62 S.Ct. 356, 86 L.Ed . --. A week later the present proceedings were begun for a further extension. The effect of the modification sought by the Government and granted by the court below was to extend until January 1, 1943, the restrictions upon Chrysler's freedom of action which were not imposed upon its principal rival. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 556, 568]\n\u00a0\n In order to justify a modification having such drastic business consequences, it was surely incumbent upon the Government to show that it had proceeded with all deliberate speed against General Motors. The record reveals that no such showing was made. The history of the litigation against General Motors proves that it could not have been made. Although the consent decree against Chrysler was entered on November 15, 1938, the trial in the criminal action against General Motors was not begun until October 9, 1939. This trial resulted in a conviction against General Motors on November 17, 1939. Since the trial judge did not instruct the jury that affiliation as such was unlawful, and indeed the contrary, the criminal proceeding could no longer be claimed to control the validity of the affiliation prohibited by paragraph 12 of the Chrysler decree. Consequently, it is irrelevant that the criminal proceedings against General Motors were not finally concluded until this Court denied certiorari on October 13, 1941. But, in any event, the contingencies of review of a criminal conviction do not justify holding in abeyance an equity suit even though it concerns a related issue, when the determination of that equity suit within a time certain, to wit, January 1, 1941, explicitly defined the duration of the restraint imposed upon Chrysler. The appeal of the criminal conviction against General Motors was at last disposed of in the Circuit Court of Appeals on May 1, 1941. 121 F. 2d 376. But even then the Government did nothing to press the equity suit, indeed it promoted its further\n It was not until October 4, 1940, that the Government brought a civil suit in equity against General Motors. This was almost two years after the entry of the decree against Chrysler, and perhaps more important, less than three months before the date upon which the bar against \n\n[316 \nU.S. 556, 569]\n\u00a0\n Chrysler was to be lifted. Here again the record contains nothing to explain this period of inaction, when by the express terms of the decree, the duty of action was laid upon the Government and the result of such action was of obvious business importance to the status of Chrysler under its decree. Nor does the record show that the Government undertook to prevent any untoward delays in the determination of the General Motors civil suit. On the contrary, no less than six times did the Government agree to extensions of the time within which General Motors should plead. On October 26, 1940, the Government acquiesced in an extension to January 20, 1941; on January 16, 1941, in an extension to January 27, 1941; on January 24, 1941, in an extension of more than three months, to May 1, 1941; on April 21, 1941, in a further extension to June 15, 1941; and on June 13, 1941, in an additional extension to June 21, 1941. On that date the Government filed an amended complaint, and on June 28, 1941, it agreed to a further extension to July 15, 1941. On the latter date General Motors requested the court that it be given a further extension; the request recited the Government's opposition to the motion because of its effect upon the Chrysler decree. The court nevertheless granted General Motors an indefinite extension. On November 29, 1941, the Government for the first time moved that General Motors be required to file an answer or other pleading. In response to this motion the court ordered that General Motors file a pleading by January 15, 1942\n\n\n This is the background of fact in the light of which the District Court was required to judge whether the Government was equitably entitled to impose upon Chrysler for a further period the curtailment of its freedom of action embodied in the consent decree. Relevant to its determination, also, was the fact that paragraph 12 provided \n\n[316 \nU.S. 556, 570]\n\u00a0\n only that if the Government did not obtain a final order of divorcement against General Motors by January 1, 1941, then nothing in the decree against Chrysler would prohibit the latter from affiliating with a finance company. Nothing in paragraph 12 gave, or even purported to give, Chrysler any immunity from the anti-trust laws after January 1, 1941. Therefore, if the decree were not modified, it would not mean that the Government would be powerless to proceed against Chrysler if the latter resumed the activities forbidden by the decree. The Government would still be free to take any action it might have taken before Chrysler consented to the decree against it.\n A court of equity is not just an umpire between two litigants. In a very special sense, the public interest is in its keeping as the conscience of the law. The circumstance that one of the parties is the Government does not in itself mean that the interest which it asserts defines and comprehends the public interest which the court must vindicate. A modification of a decree requested by the Government is not ipso facto a modification warranted by considerations which control equity. Regard for the proper administration of justice which makes determinations depend upon proof and not upon unsupported assertions of one of the litigants is a vital aspect of the public interest. The burden obviously rested upon the Government to show good cause for disregarding an express provision in a carefully framed decree, and extending to twice its original duration the period of restraint against Chrysler. So to enlarge the burden of the decree without any such showing by the Government is a one-sided restriction of Chrysler's freedom of action, at least of its right to prove that the restricted action is innocent. Instead of exacting such proof from the Government, the District Court cast upon Chrysler the duty of showing that it would not be preju- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 556, 571]\n\u00a0\n diced if the fetters remained after the period fixed by the decree. He who seeks relief from equity has the burden of showing that he is entitled to it. It is unfair to cast upon Chrysler the burden of proving that it would not be harmed if the Government got what it wanted. As a practical business matter, Chrysler is not standing on an abstract right to devise means of financing its sales simply because it is not ready today with arrangements for a financial corporation, and the war precludes them. Such arrangements cannot be devised overnight. It may well take a year to get them under way.\n Considering, on the one hand, the drastic economic disadvantage to which Chrysler is put in being subjected to the hazard of contempt proceedings if it takes any steps toward preparing for affiliation in the future, and, on the other hand, the failure of the Government to explain the apparent lack of diligence in prosecuting the proceedings against General Motors and to show that the modification was necessary to achieve the purposes of the consent decree, I am bound to conclude that the order of the District Court, unexplained by any opinion, was not within the proper limits of its discretion.\n Mr. Justice REED joins in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 26 Stat. 209, 15 U.S.C.  1, 15 U.S.C.A.  1. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Chrysler's answer included an allegation that it had completely terminated its affiliation with Commercial Credit Company by February, 1938. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] The consent decree against Ford is substantially the same. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See the order of January 21, 1942 of the Director of Priorities of the Office of Production Management.

FIELDCREST DAIRIES(1942)\nNo. 706\nArgued: Decided: April 27, 1942\n\n\n\n\n[316 \nU.S. 168, 169]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James A. Velde, Walter V. Schaefer, and Barnet Hodes, all of Chicago, Ill., for petitioners.\n Mr. Fred A. Gariepy, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n Mr. Albert E. Hallett, Jr., of Chicago, Ill., for State of Illinois, as amicus curiae, by special leave of Court.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent, a Michigan corporation authorized to do business in Illinois, sells milk to wholesalers and retailers in various cities in the vicinity of Chicago. By an ordinance passed on January 4, 1935, the City of Chicago required that milk or milk products 'sold in quantities of less than one gallon shall be delivered in standard milk bottles.'  3094. Respondent sought a permit from petitioner Board of Health to sell milk in 'Pure-Pak' paper containers in that city. That permit was not granted. Thereafter respondent filed suit against petitioners in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging, inter alia, that its 'single service, \n\n[316 \nU.S. 168, 170]\n\u00a0\n sterile, sanitary and non-absorbent' containers are 'standard milk bottles' within the meaning of the Chicago ordinance; that if the ordinance is construed as prohibiting respondent from using its paper containers the ordinance is unconstitutional and invalid under the federal and state constitutions; and that the refusal of the permit has and will cause respondent irreparable damage. The complaint prayed for a declaratory judgment that the ordinance be construed so as not to prohibit respondent from using its containers or, in the alternative, that the ordinance insofar as it does prevent such use is unconstitutional and invalid. Issue was joined. In May, 1939, the District Court referred the cause to a master who held extended hearings. In July, 1939, the so-called Illinois Milk Pasteurization Plant Law (L.1939, pp. 660-666, Rev.Stat.1941, c. 56 1\/2,  115-134) was enacted, containing certain provisions regulating the use of single service and paper containers ( 15) and reserving to cities, villages and incorporated towns the power to regulate the distribution, etc. 'of pasteurized milk and pasteurized milk products, provided that such regulation not permit any person to violate any of the provisions of this Act.'  19. On April 27, 1940, the master submitted his report finding that respondent's paper containers were not 'standard milk bottles' within the meaning of the ordinance and that the ordinance as construed was valid and constitutional. In October, 1940, the District Court, on exceptions to the master's report, held that respondent's containers were 'standard milk bottles' within the meaning of the ordinance. And it went on to hold that under the Milk Pasteurization Plant Law the city was without power to prohibit the use of such containers. It entered a decree in accordance with that finding and enjoined petitioners from interfering with respondent in the sale and delivery of milk and milk products in those con- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 168, 171]\n\u00a0\n tainers. 35 F.Supp. 451, 452. On appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, that court held that the District Court erred in holding that respondent's containers were 'standard milk bottles' within the meaning of the ordinance. But it concluded that the ordinance insofar as it prohibited, rather than regulated, the use of paper containers was invalid by reason of the state Act. And it went on to intimate by way of obiter dictum that if the ordinance were construed to prohibit the use of respondent's containers it would not survive as a constitutional exercise of the police power. 7 Cir., 122 F.2d 132.\n On May 15, 1940, while the cause was pending before the District Court, Dean Milk Company, of which respondent is a wholly owned subsidiary, instituted an action in the Illinois state court against petitioners and other city officials raising substantially the same issues and seeking substantially the same relief as respondent raised and sought in the federal court. After judgment had been rendered by the District Court in this case and while the appeal was pending, Dean Milk Company moved in the state court for a decree granting the relief prayed for and retaining jurisdiction by the state court pending final determination of the appeal in this case. Such a decree was entered by the state court in December 1940\n\n\n We granted the petition for certiorari, \n314 \nU.S. 604\n, 62 S.Ct. 301, 86 L.Ed. --, because of the doubtful propriety of the District Court and of the Circuit Court of Appeals in undertaking to decide such an important question of Illinois law instead of remitting the parties to the state courts for litigation of the state questions involved in the case. Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co., \n312 \nU.S. 496\n, 61 S.Ct. 643.\n We are of the opinion that the procedure which we followed in the Pullman case should be followed here. Illinois has the final say as to the meaning of the ordinance in question. It also has the final word on the alleged conflict be- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 168, 172]\n\u00a0\n tween the ordinance and the state Act. The determination which the District Court, the Circuit Court of Appeals or we might make could not be anything more than a forecast-a prediction as to the ultimate decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois. Here as in the Pullman case 'a federal court of equity is asked to decide an issue by making a tentative answer which may be displaced tomorrow by a state adjudication.' 312 U.S. at page 500, 61 S.Ct. at page 645. Furthermore, the dispute in its broad reach involves a question as to whether a city has trespassed on the domain of a State. Though that issue was not in the case when the complaint was filed, it emerged, due to the passage of the Milk Pasteurization Plant Law, long before the District Court entered its decree. The delicacy of that issue and an appropriate regard 'for the rightful independence of state governments' (Beal v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., \n312 \nU.S. 45, 50\n, 61 S.Ct. 418, 421) reemphasize that it is a wise and permissible policy for the federal chancellor to stay his hand in absence of an authoritative and controlling determination by the state tribunals. As we said in the Pullman case, 'The resources of equity are equal to an adjustment that will avoid the waste of a tentative decision' and any 'needless friction with state policies.' See page 500 of 312 U.S. page 645 of 61 S.Ct., and cases cited; Thompson v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., \n309 \nU.S. 478, 483\n, 484 S., 60 S.Ct. 628, 630, 631. It is an exercise of a 'sound discretion, which guides the determination of courts of equity'. Beal v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., supra, 312 U.S. at page 50, 61 S.Ct. at page 421. In this case that discretion calls for a remission of the parties to the state courts which alone can give a definitive answer to the major questions posed. Plainly they constitute the more appropriate forum for the trial of those issues. See 54 Harv.L.Rev. 1379. Considerations of delay, inconvenience, and cost to the parties, which have been urged upon us, do not call for a different result. For we are here concerned with the much larger issue as to the appropriate relationship \n\n[316 \nU.S. 168, 173]\n\u00a0\n between federal and state authorities functioning as a harmonious whole.\n The desirability of the course which we have suggested is not embarrassed by any question as to whether ready recourse may be had to the state courts. The availability of the state tribunal is obvious, since a case involving substantially identical issues and brought by respondent's parent corporation is pending in the state court. Cf. Gilchrist v. Interborough Rapid Transit Co., \n279 \nU.S. 159\n, 49 S.Ct. 282.\n It is of course true that respondent sought to raise in its complaint a constitutional issue-an issue which lurks in the case even though it not be deemed substantial. But here, as in the Pullman case, that issue may not survive the litigation in the state courts. If it does not, the litigation is at an end. That again indicates the wisdom of allowing the local law issues first to be resolved by those who have the final say. Avoidance of constitutional adjudications where not absolutely necessary is part of the wisdom of the doctrine of the Pullman case.\n We therefore vacate the judgment and remand the cause to the District Court with directions to retain the bill pending a determination of proceedings in the state court in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS concurs in the result.\n Judgment vacated and cause remanded with directions. \n\n\n\n","18":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCLOVERLEAF BUTTER CO. v. PATTERSON(1942)\nNo. 28\nArgued: Decided: February 2, 1942\n\n\n\n As Amended on Denial of Rehearing March 9, 1942.\n Mr. Erle Pettus and Mr. Horace C. Wilkinson, both of Birmingham, Ala., for petitioner. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 149]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles L. Rowe and William H. Loeb, Asst. Attys. Gen., for respondents.\n\n\n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 150]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner, Cloverleaf Butter Company, is engaged at Birmingham, Alabama, in the manufacture of process or renovated butter from packing stock butter. It obtains 25% of its supplies of packing stock butter from the farmers and country merchants of Alabama and 75% from those of other states, and it ships interstate 90% of its finished product. The production of renovated butter is taxed and regulated by the United States. Internal Revenue Code, c. 16,  2320 to 2327 inc., 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Code,  2320 to 2327. It is also regulated by Alabama Ala.Code 1940, Tit. 2, c. 1.\n The respondents, Alabama officials charged with the duty of enforcing the Alabama laws in regard to renovated \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 151]\n\u00a0\n butter, entered petitioner's factory and in a little more than a year seized on sixteen separate occasions a total of over twenty thousand pounds of packing stock butter, the material from which the finished product is made. Defendants also seized some butter moving to the factory in interstate commerce. There is no allegation that condemnation proceedings have been completed.\n Alleging repeated seizures and danger of their continuance to the demoralization and financial impairment of its business, petitioners brought an action, Judicial Code  24(1), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(1) in the District Court to enjoin the defendants from acting under the Alabama statute either to determine the wholesomeness of renovated butter made from the raw material in petitioner's hands, to inspect its raw material and plant or to seize and to detain petitioner's packing stock butter. The theory of the bill is that the federal legislation and regulations concerning the manufacture of process or renovated butter exclude such state action. Cf. Hebe Co. v. Shaw, \n248 \nU.S. 297\n, 39 S.Ct. 125; Cor Products Refg. Co. v. Eddy, \n249 \nU.S. 427\n, 39 S.Ct. 325. There was a motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint did not state a cause of action. A stipulation entitled as one of 'facts' was entered into. The District Court dismissed the bill, the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, 5 Cir., 116 F.2d 227, and we granted certiorari because of the important question of federal law involved in petitioner' contention that these federal statutes providing for regulation of production of a commodity excluded state action. \n313 \nU.S. 551\n, 61 S.Ct. 834.\n The so-called stipulation of facts just mentioned is really a limitation of issues. One paragraph of the stipulation will crystallize the essential elements of the dispute. It reads: 'The parties to this cause stipulate and agree that the legal questions in dispute between the parties are: ... 2. Does the inspection of packing stock butter, in interstate commerce, used by the plaintiff in the manufac- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 152]\n\u00a0\n ture of process or renovated butter as alleged in the bill of complaint, made or directed to be made by the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States, pursuant to the Federal laws and regulations relating to renovated or process butter, have the effect in connection with said Federal laws of excluding the State of Alabama, its officers and agents, from inspecting or seizing or suspending the packing stock butter, in interstate commerce out of which renovated butter to be sold in interstate commerce as alleged in the complaint is manufactured by the plaintiff as alleged in the complaint?' As other paragraphs state variations of this controversy or conclusions of law not controlling on the courts, Estate of Sanford v. Comm'r, \n308 \nU.S. 39, 51\n, 60 S.Ct. 51, 59, we need not consider them further. The central question presented in the petition for certiorari accords with the excerpt from the stipulation.\n Apparently there is no specific allegation or admission that the packing stock butter which Alabama inspected and seized was the property of the petitioning manufacturer at the time. It has, however, been so treated by the courts and parties and properly so, we conclude, from the allegations of the bill. \n1\n The reach of this decision is therefore limited to Alabama's inspection and seizure of packing stock butter, actually owned by petitioner and held in its own hands or those of its bailees, whether in factory, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 153]\n\u00a0\n warehouse or course of carriage, for manufacture into process or renovated butter for interstate or foreign commerce.\n The test to be applied to the action of the state in seizing material intended solely for incorporation into a product prepared for interstate commerce is the effect of that action upon the national regulatory policy declared by the federal statute. Cf. Illinois Nat. Gas Co. v. Central Illinois Pub. Serv. Co., \n314 \nU.S. 498\n, 62 S.Ct. 384, 86 L.Ed. --, decided January 5, 1942. Not only \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 154]\n\u00a0\n does Congressional power over interstate commerce extend, the 'Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding,'2 to interstate transactions and transportation, but it reaches back to the steps prior to transportation and has force to regulate production 'with the purpose of so transporting' the product. United States v. Darby, \n312 \nU.S. 100, 117\n, 61 S.Ct. 451, 458, 459, 132 A.L.R. 1430. It extends to the intrastate activities which so affect commerce as to make regulation of them appropriate means to the attainment of a legitimate end, regulation of interstate commerce. Id., \n312 \nU.S. 118\n et seq., 61 S.Ct. 459, 132 A.L.R. 1430, and cases cited. By the regulatory provisions of Internal Revenue Code  2325, note 10, infra, the entire process of manufacture is subject to federal supervision. Thus so far as any situation here involved is concerned, the scope of Congressional power is such that it may override the exercise of state power and render impossible its application to petitioner's manufacturing processes.\n This power of Congress to exercise exclusive control over operations in interstate commerce is not in dispute here. \n3\n Nor is this power limited to situations where national uniformity is so essential that lacking Congres- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 155]\n\u00a0\n sional permission all state action is inadmissible notwithstanding a complete absence of federal legislation. \n4\n Exclusive federal regulation may arise, also, from the exercise of the power of Congress over interstate commerce where in the absence of Congressional action the states may themselves legislate. It has long been recognized that in those fields of commerce where national uniformity is not essential, either the state or federal government may act. Willson v. Black-bird Creek Marsh Co., 2 Pet. 245; California v. Thompson, \n313 \nU.S. 109, 114\n, 61 S.Ct. 930, 932. Where this power to legislate exists, it often happens that there is only a partial exercise of that power by the federal government. In such cases the state may legislate freely upon those phases of the commerce which are left unregulated by the nation. \n5\n But \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 156]\n\u00a0\n where the United States exercises its power of legislation so as to conflict with a regulation of the state, either specifically6 or by implication,7 the state legislation becomes inoperative and the federal legislation exclusive in its application.\n When the prohibition of state action is not specific but inferable from the scope and purpose of the federal legislation, it must be clear that the federal provisions are inconsistent with those of the state to justify the thwarting of state regulation. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Apparently there are no cases of this Court dealing specifically with state interference with federally regulated manufacturing. It is evident, we think, that the same principles govern state action in this field as in the instances cited under note 7 to show the exclusive power of federal enactments in transportation, employers liabil- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 157]\n\u00a0\n ity, quarantine and aliens. The rule is clear that state action may be excluded by clear implication or inconsistency. Its application to individual cases creates difficulties. The differentiation between cases where the assumption of federal power is exclusive and where it admits state action is narrow. For example, in Oregon-Washington R. & Nav. Co. v. Washington, \n270 \nU.S. 87\n, 46 S.Ct. 279, Section 8 of the Plant Quarantine Act, 37 Stat. 315, 318, as amended 39 Stat. 1165, 7 U.S.C .  161, 7 U.S.C.A.  161, was held to exclude a state quarantine against plant infestation. Yet a little later in Mintz v. Baldwin, \n289 \nU.S. 346\n, at page 352, 53 S.Ct. 611, 614, a very similar statute, the Cattle Contagious Diseases Act was held to permit a state quarantine, because this latter act differed from the former, in that its provisions, 'by specification of the cases in which action under it shall be exclusive, disclose the intention of Congress that, subject to the limitations defined, state measures may be enforced. This difference is essential and controlling.' Cf 21 U.S.C.  126, 21 U.S.C.A.  126.\n It is urged that the later Welch, Eichholz and Maurer cases, cited above, which allow state action when the federal statute does not cover the particular point regulated show a trend away from the doctrine of the Oregon-Washington R. & Nav. Co. decision. Other similar instances may be found in notes 3 and 5, supra. In all of these, however, it was the ruling of this Court that the federal enactment was consistent with the narrow regulation sought to be enforced by the state so that the state enactment did not stand 'as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.' Hines v. Davidowitz, \n312 \nU.S. 52, 67\n, 61 S.Ct. 399, 404. As the principle upon which the cases referred to in this paragraph are decided is clear, a single comparison will sufficiently illustrate the reasons which lead to a denial of state power. Savage v. Jones, \n225 \nU.S. 501\n, 32 S.Ct. 715, construed an Indiana statute requiring disclosure of formulas on foods offered \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 158]\n\u00a0\n for sale in Indiana while in interstate commerce. The Pure Food and Drugs Act, 34 Stat. 768, prohibited, so far as here pertinent, interstate shipments if misbranded by bearing 'any statement, design or device ... false or misleading.' This Court said, at page 532 of 225 U.S., at page 725 of 32 S.Ct.: 'Congress has thus limited the scope of its prohibitions. It has not included that at which the Indiana statute aims. Can it be said that Congress, nevertheless, has denied to the state, with respect to the feeding stuffs coming from another state and sold in the original packages, the power the state otherwise would have to prevent imposition upon the public by making a reasonable and nondiscriminatory provision for the disclosure of ingredients, and for inspection and analysis?' The Indiana Act was upheld. On the other hand McDermott v. Wisconsin, \n228 \nU.S. 115\n, 33 S.Ct. 431, 47 L.R.A.,N.S., 984, Ann.Cas.1915A, 39, makes plain the basis for prohibiting interferences with federal power. In this latter case a Wisconsin law, Laws Wis.1907, c. 557, required glucose mixtures offered for retail sale to be labeled 'Glucose flavored with' the flavoring material. Any other 'designation or brand' on the package was prohibited. A glucose mixture was offered labeled 'Karo Corn Syrup' '10% Cane Syrup, 90% Corn Syrup.' Pointing out that federal authority, for the sake of efficiency in protecting the public against misbranding in interstate trade, extended far enough to regulate labeling on packages while being offered to consumers, and that the Pure Food and Drug Act tolerated the more euphemistic label prohibited by the state, this Court said, at page 133 of 228 U.S., at page 435 of 33 S.Ct., 47 L.R.A.,N.S., 984, Ann.Cas.1915A, 39: 'Conceding to the state the authority to make regulations consistent with the Federal law for the further protection of its citizens against impure and misbranded food and drugs, we think to permit such regulation as is embodied in this statute is to permit a state to discredit and burden legitimate Federal regulations of interstate commerce, to destroy rights arising out of the Federal statute \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 159]\n\u00a0\n which have accrued both to the government and the shipper, and to impair the effect of a Federal law which has been enacted under the Constitutional power of Congress over the subject.' In the Savage case there was no conflict, inconsistency or interference; in the McDermott case there was. McDermott pointed out the distinction, and the inapplicability of the Savage rule to the Wisconsin situation. \n228 \nU.S. 115, 131\n, 132 S., 33 S.Ct. 431, 434, 435, 47 L.R.A.,N.S., 984, Ann.Cas.1915A, 39.\n Turning to the statutes in question we find that the greater part of the legislation relating to process or renovated butter is in  2320 to  2327 of the Internal Revenue Code. \n9\n These sections define process or renovated butter, fix the rate of poundage tax upon it, as well as the amount of special tax upon its manufacturers and provide for their collection. They require manufacturers to file such notices and inventories, keep such books, render such returns, post such signs, affix such number to his factory, and furnish such bond as the Treasury Department may require. Wholesale dealers are required to keep books and render returns to the same department. Penalties are provided. Specific provisions are made for inspection of the places of manufacture or storage of the materials and the renovated butter itself. Power is given to confiscate the finished product. Sanitary provisions applicable for slaughtering, meat canning or similar establishments are extended to cover process and renovated butter factories. The sections necessary for the discussion are set out in the note below. \n10\n The references to animal and meat in- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 160]\n\u00a0\n spection statutes in  2327(b) made applicable to the butter in question the power of the Secretary of Agriculture to inspect and certify as wholesome for human food salt pork and bacon intended for exportation and the requirement that inspected carcasses of cattle, sheep and swine found unwholesome shall not be subjects of interstate transportation.\n There are two provisions of law applicable to process and renovated butter production which may be conveniently considered and disposed of at this point. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 161]\n\u00a0\n (a) By section one of the Act of May 9, 1902, it is provided that importations of processed and renovated butter shall be subject to the laws of the state as though produced therein. \n11\n This is obviously an adaptation of the Wilson or Original Packages Act to the problem of butter substitutes, passed to overcome the force of some of the cases forbidding state prohibition of sales of these substitutes. \n12\n It is clearly inapplicable to the case now under consideration, but indicates a Congressional purpose not to hinder the free exercise of state power except as it may be inconsistent with the federal legislation. The argument that \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 162]\n\u00a0\n it is improper to infer a restriction on confiscation of material when confiscation of product is permitted fails to give weight to the difference between a confiscation which interferes with production under federal supervision and confiscation after production because of a higher standard demanded by a state for its consumers. The latter type is permissible under all the authorities.\n\n\n (b)\n By section four of the same Act, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  3282, R.S.  3243 was made to 'extend to and include and apply to' manufacture of processed and renovated butter. That section, now I.R.C.  3276, 26 U.S. C.A. Int.Rev.Code  3276, provides that the payment of the tax laid by the act under consideration 'shall not be held to exempt any person from any' state penalty 'or in any manner to authorize the commencement or continuance of such trade or business contrary to the laws of such State.' It is urged by respondent that this section makes it 'clear that the power of the States over the subject of the manufacture and sale of process and renovated butter within their respective limits was to be unrestricted, even though the effect of such regulation might be the imposition of an indirect burden upon interstate commerce.' This section without doubt manifests the will of Congress that federal taxation shall not, of itself, incapacitate the state. Austin v. Tennessee, \n179 \nU.S. 343\n, 21 S.Ct. 132; Plumley v. Massachusetts, \n155 \nU.S. 461, 466\n, 15 S.Ct. 154, 155. In our view, however, the section goes no farther than to make certain that federal taxation shall not paralyze state action. Other regulations may or may not supersede state laws. Cf. Merchants' Exchange v. Missouri, \n248 \nU.S. 365, 368\n, 39 S.Ct. 114, 115; Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co. v. Illinois, \n298 \nU.S. 155, 159\n, 56 S.Ct. 685, 686.\n There are also two other elements of the federal legislation which may be considered from the negative viewpoint. This is not solely a revenue act. Respondent strongly urges that it must be treated as primarily for the purpose of increasing federal income and that therefore there should be no judicial deduction that the incidental \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 163]\n\u00a0\n regulatory features are exclusive. For this there is support in the precedents. McCray v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 27\n, 24 S.Ct. 769, 1 Ann.Cas. 561.13 While there has long been recognition of the authority of Congress to obtain incidental social, health or economic advantages from the exercise of constitutional powers,14 it has been said that such collateral results must be obtained from statutory provisions reasonably adapted to the constitutional objects of the legislation. Linder v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 5, 17\n, 45 S.Ct. 446, 448, 39 A.L.R. 229. But here the respondent's contention is inapplicable because the regulatory provisions in controversy are authorized by the Commerce Clause. Pittsburgh Melting Co. v. Totten, \n248 \nU.S. 1, 8\n, 39 S.Ct. 3, 4; Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, \n310 \nU.S. 381\n, 60 S.Ct. 907; United States v. Darby, supra, \n312 \nU.S. 119\n, 61 S.Ct. 459, 132 A.L.R. 1430.\n Further, we agree with respondent's contention that there is no authority to confiscate or destroy materials under the renovated butter act. It should be noted that packing stock adulterated under the definitions of  402 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 52 Stat. 1046, 21 U.S.C.A.  342, when introduced into or while in interstate commerce may be confiscated under  304, 21 U.S.C.A.  334 while in interstate commerce or at any time thereafter. Cf. United States v. Nine Barrels of Butter, D.C., 241 F. 499. Petitioner argues that the provisions for meat inspection made applicable to process and renovated butter factories by I.R.C.  2327, note 10, supra, include Title 21,  72 of the United States Code, 21 U.S.C.A.  72. Section 72 does authorize the destruction of unfit carcasses of cattle, hogs and sheep intended for human consumption and we assume, if applicable, would authorize a similar destruction of the materials intended for butter \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 164]\n\u00a0\n manufacture. Section 72, however, is derived from 34 Statutes at Large 674. The provisions which I.R.C.  2327 makes applicable are the sanitary provisions as set forth in the Act of June 30, 1906, c. 3913, 34 Stat. 676. 15 These relate only to inspection and not to condemnation or destruction. 16 Nor do we find such power in the regulatory provisions of  2325, note 10, supra, or any interpretation by the Department of Agriculture leading to that conclusion. The regulations contain no directions for condemnation. B.D.I. Order No. 1-Revised, December 24, 1936; 9 C.F.R. 301. The views of the Solicitors of Agriculture have long been in accord with our conclusion. Opinion No. 2829, October 18, 1940.17 \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 165]\n\u00a0\n The state act which petitioners say conflicts and interferes with the Federal is the usual type of general food and drug regulation. Alabama Code 1940, Tit. 2, c. 1. Power is conferred on the state board of agriculture and industries to promulgate rules and regulations with the commissioner of agriculture and industries as the chief administrative official. The issue arises over action taken under  495, Code Ala.1940, Tit. 2, quoted so far as pertinent below. \n 18\n\u00a0\n\n The controversy comes to this. The federal law requires,  2325, note 10, supra, 'a rigid sanitary inspection ... of all factories and storehouses where process or renovated butter is manufactured, packed, or prepared for market, and of the products thereof and materials going into the manufacture of the same,' i.e., packing stock butter. \n19\n\u00a0\n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 166]\n\u00a0\n But as we have seen, the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States cannot condemn the packing stock butter. The commissioner of agriculture and industries of Alabama claims authority under the state statute to condemn packing stock butter held for renovation. 20 Does the state's claim interfere or conflict with the federal power?\n On the face of the statutes a solution of the conflict might be reached on the ground that the state statute authorizes condemnation only when the packing stock butter is held for sale 'within the state' in its then condition. Such a suggestion does not meet the issue, however. The bill alleges and the motion to dismiss and stipulation admit the seizure of a kind of raw material none of which, either that seized or used, had ever been so held or offered for sale in packing stock condition.\n We lay aside also, as inapplicable, the suggestion that the highest court of Alabama in State v. Cecil, 216 Ala. 391, 113 So. 254, held that the Agricultural Code of that state was not intended to cover goods in interstate commerce and that therefore since these materials are in interstate commerce they are beyond the scope of the Alabama Code. The opinion in the Cecil case dealt with a different section, one relating to licensing farm product commission merchants. The defendant was engaged in interstate business only. For that section the decision of the Alabama court is final. It did not consider the section here under examination and, in our view, which of course is not controlling on Alabama courts,  495 in the absence of conflict or interference with a specific federal act would be effective to condemn goods held in Alabama under the terms of the section, even though the goods were commingled with a mass, some of which would be ultimately \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 167]\n\u00a0\n exported from the state. State power over food supplies held within its borders would extend at least so far. Sligh v. Kirkwood, \n237 \nU.S. 52\n, 35 S. Ct. 501. On the other hand, federal control over interstate commerce would, if it is exercised, extend over that portion of the material which would ultimately be sold in Alabama as renovated butter. The Minnesota Rate Cases (Simpson v. Shepard), \n230 \nU.S. 352, 399\n, 33 S.Ct. 729, 739, 48 L.R.A.,N.S., 1151, Ann.Cas.1916A, 18; Currin v. Wallace, \n306 \nU.S. 1, 11\n, 59 S.Ct. 379, 385; United States v. Rock Royal Co-op., \n307 \nU.S. 533, 568\n, 59 S.Ct. 993, 1010; United States v. Darby, \n312 \nU.S. 100, 122\n, 61 S.Ct. 451, 461, 132 A.L.R. 1430. But, of course, if any of the finished product is offered for sale in Alabama, such product becomes immediately subject to the requirements of the pure food laws of that state.\n Coming finally to the query whether the state's claim interferes or conflicts with the purpose or provisions of the federal legislation, we determine that it does. The manufacture and distribution in interstate and foreign commerce of process and renovated butter is a substantial industry which, because of its multi-state activity, cannot be effectively regulated by isolated competing states. Cf. Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, \n301 \nU.S. 548, 588\n, 57 S.Ct. 883, 891, 109 A.L.R. 1293; United States v. Darby, \n312 \nU.S. 100, 122\n, 61 S.Ct. 451, 461, 132 A.L.R. 1430. Its wholesome and successful functioning touches farm producers and city consumers. Science made possible the utilization of large quantities of packing stock butter which fell below the standards of public demand21 and Congress under- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 168]\n\u00a0\n took to regulate the production in order that the resulting commodity might be free of ingredients deleterious to health. It left the states free to act on the packing stock supplies prior to the time of their delivery into the hands of the manufacturer and to regulate sales of the finished product within their borders. But once the material was definitely marked for commerce by acquisition of the manufacturer, it passed into the domain of federal control.\n Inspection of the factory and of the material was provided for explicitly. Confiscation of the finished product was authorized upon a finding of its unsuitability for food through the use of unhealthful or unwholesome materials, a finding that might be based upon visual or delicate laboratory tests, or upon observation of the use of such materials in the process of manufacture. I.R.C.  2325; 9 C.F.R.  301.41- 301.43. By the statutes and regulations,22 the Department of Agriculture has authority to watch the consumer's interest throughout the process of manufacture and distribution. It sees to the sanitation of the factories in such minutiae as the clean hands of the employees and the elimination of objectionable odors, inspects the materials used, including air for aerating the oils and confiscates the finished product when materials which would be unwholesome if utilized are present after manufacture. \n23\n Confiscation by the state of material in production nullifies federal discretion over ingredients. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 169]\n\u00a0\n It is said that the state and the United States have worked cooperatively in protecting consumers from vicious practices in the handling of processed butter; that any action by the state aids the policy of both in disposing of unfit food and that therefore a harmonious federal state relationship should not be hampered. Our duty to deal with contradictory functions of state and nation on any occasion and particularly when one or the other is challenged by private interests calls for the utmost effort to avoid conclusions which interfere with the governmental operations of either. Nothing could be more fertile for discord, however, than a failure to define the boundaries of authority. Clashes may and should be minimized by mutual tolerance but they are much less likely to happen when each knows the limits of its responsibility. And, it is only reasonable to assume that the theory of denying inconsistent powers to a state is based largely upon the benefits to the regulated industry of freedom from inconsistencies.\n Congress hardly intended the intrusion of another authority during the very preparation of a commodity subject to the surveillance and comprehensive specifications of the Department of Agriculture. To uphold the power of the State of Alabama to condemn the material in the factory while it was under federal observation and while federal enforcement deemed it wholesome would not only hamper the administration of the federal act but would be inconsistent with its requirements. Whether the sanction used to enforce the regulation is condemnation of the material or the product is not significant. Since there was federal regulation of the materials and composition of the manufactured article, there could not be similar state regulation of the same subject. \n24\n\u00a0\n\n Reversed. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 170]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE.\n I think the judgment should be affirmed.\n The decision of the Court appears to me to depart radically from the salutary principle that Congress, in enacting legislation within its constitutional authority, will not be deemed to have intended to strike down a state statute designed to protect the health and safety of the public unless the state act, in terms or in its practical administration, conflicts with the act of Congress or plainly and palpably infringes its policy. Sinnot v. Davenport, 22 How. 227, 243; Missouri, K. & T. Ry. Co. v. Haber, \n169 \nU.S. 613, 623\n, 18 S.Ct. 488, 492; Reid v. Colorado, \n187 \nU.S. 137, 148\n, 23 S.Ct. 92, 96; Savage v.

South Dakota, \n250 \nU.S. 118, 122\n, 39 S.Ct. 403, 404; Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry. v. Railroad Comm., \n283 \nU.S. 380, 391\n, 51 S.Ct. 553, 555; Townsend v. Yeomans, \n301 \nU.S. 441, 454\n, 57 S.Ct. 842, 848; Kelly v. Washington, \n302 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, 58 S.Ct. 87, 92; cf. Maurer v. Hamilton, \n309 \nU.S. 598, 614\n, 60 S.Ct. 726, 734, 135 A.L.R. 1347.\n We have here no question of an unexercised discretionary power given by Congress to a federal official as the means of regulating interstate commerce, where the full exercise of his authority would conflict with an assertion of the state power. In such circumstances the state's authority to act turns upon the question, which this Court has often been called upon to answer, whether the failure of the federal official to exercise his full power is in effect a controlling administrative ruling that no further regulation by either federal or state government is needful. Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line Ry. Co., \n272 \nU.S. 605\n, 47 S.Ct. 207; cf. Mintz v. Baldwin, \n289 \nU.S. 346\n, 53 S.Ct. 611; Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Railway Comm., \n297 \nU.S. 471\n, 56 S.Ct. 536; Welch Co. v. New Hampshire, \n306 \nU.S. 79\n, 59 S.Ct. 438. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 171]\n\u00a0\n Here, concededly, the Secretary is exercising all the authority he has. His authority under 32 Stat. 196, 26 U.S.C.  2325, 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev.Code  2325, to seize and condemn is restricted to the manufactured product, 'renovated butter'. It does not extend to 'packing stock butter' intended to be used in making the product. But as construed by the Court the act has deprived Alabama of the power which it would otherwise possess to seize spoiled packing stock butter, without conferring that authority on any federal officer. Thus both the federal and the state governments are left powerless to condemn an article which is a notorious menace to health,1 a substantial part of which is never shipped out of the state. A congressional purpose to immunize from regulation, state and national, a substance so obviously requiring control is not lightly to be inferred, especially where public health or safety is concerned. Mintz v. Baldwin, supra, \n289 \nU.S. 350\n, 53 S.Ct. 613; Kelly v. Washington, supra, \n302 \nU.S. 14\n, 58 S.Ct. 94; Welch Co. v. New Hampshire, supra, \n306 \nU.S. 85\n, 59 S.Ct. 441.\n The Secretary is also given authority by the federal act to inspect the place and process of manufacturing renovated butter, the ingredients going into it, and the renovated product itself, which he may confiscate if he finds it to be deleterious to health. But his authority over packing stock butter before it is used for manufacture is restricted to its inspection. The inspection thus affords a means of determining whether the manufactured product in which packing stock is used and which the Secretary may seize contains a deleterious ingredient, the presence \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 172]\n\u00a0\n of which in the product can often be ascertained, if at all, only by delicate chemical tests. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The legislative history of the federal act shows what is evident from its words, that its aim is to use the federal power to prevent, by seizure and condemnation, the interstate distribution of renovated butter when found unfit for food. 35 Cong.Rec. 3316, 4586. The grant of authority to the Secretary to inspect the ingredients and seize the product gives no indication of a congressional purpose to hamper state control over the contaminated materials before their manufacture into the finished product. Indeed, Congress not only confined the Secretary's authority to make seizures to the renovated product, but in assuming this control it was at pains to provide by 32 Stat. 193, 21 U.S.C.  25, 21 U.S.C.A.  25 that the states should be free to exert their police power over the renovated material 'in the same manner as though' it 'had been produced in such State or Territory.' The sponsor in the Senate of the bill containing this provision emphasized that it was not intended to restrict the power of the states, but rather to expand their authority to include original packages in interstate commerce. 35 Cong.Rec. 3605. In the face of these disavowals with respect to the finished product which Congress brought under federal authority, one can hardly infer a congressional purpose to restrict the states' power over the ingredient which Congress did not seek to control; or that Congress could have had any object in denying the states power to seize the offensive ingredient when it left them free to seize the product because it contained the ingredient.\n Moreover, not only is there a complete want of conflict between the two statutes and their administration, but it seems plain that the Alabama statute, both by its terms and in its practical administration, aids and supplements \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 173]\n\u00a0\n the federal regulation and policy. Consequently there is no room for any inference that Congress, by its enactment, sought to stay the hands of the state in the exercise of a power with which the federal act does not conflict. The basic and identical concern of both governments is to protect the consuming public from contaminated butter. If the state seizes unfit packing stock, the federal authorities are relieved of the necessity of detecting it and of seizing the renovated product which it contaminates. 3 In exercising the powers conferred on him by the Act, the Secretary is not concerned with the quality of packing stock save as it is used in making renovated butter. Seizure of it by the state at the same time removes all necessity and duty of federal inspection, since, in any \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 174]\n\u00a0\n event, it will never become an ingredient of renovated butter.\n The opinion, while recognizing that the Department has long taken the view that it has no power to seize packing stock butter, disregards administrative actualities in assuming that state seizure of it would involve an 'intrusion' into the federal domain, which would 'hamper and administration of the federal act'. The record of administration is not one of belligerency and jurisdictional jealousy, but of active and sympathetic cooperation between state and federal agencies in effecting a common purpose, prevention of the consumption of unfit butter, whether that objective is accomplished by state seizure of the packing stock or federal condemnation of the renovated product. 4 To find in such circumstances an intent to restrict \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 175]\n\u00a0\n state power, not required by the words of the statute, is to condemn a working, harmonious federal-state relationship for the sake of a sterile and harmful insistence on exclusive federal power.\n The controlling elements in this case seem identical with those in the application of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, 34 Stat. 768, 21 U. S.C.A.  1 et seq., which this Court has held imposes no restriction on state action which supplements the federal act and does not conflict with its terms or practical administration. In sustaining local regulations requiring the labels placed on animal food stuffs to disclose their ingredients, in addition to the truthful description of the product demanded by the federal act, this Court said: 'The requirements, the enforcement of which the bill seeks to enjoin, are not in any way in conflict with the provisions of the Federal act. They may be sustained without impairing in the slightest degree its operation and effect. There is no question here of conflicting standards, or of opposition of state to Federal authority.' Savage v. Jones, supra, \n225 \nU.S. 539\n, 32 S.Ct. 728. State regulation yields only when it is in conflict with the administration or terms of the Pure Food and Drug Act. Cf. McDermott v. Wisconsin, \n228 \nU.S. 115\n, 33 S.Ct. 431, 47 L.R.A.,N.S., 984, ann.Cas.1915A, 39. The same view has been taken in other cases where state and federal governments \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 176]\n\u00a0\n by concurrent and non-conflicting control over subjects of commerce were seeking to protect the health or safety of the public. Corn Products Refining Co. v. Eddy, \n249 \nU.S. 427\n, 39 S.Ct. 325; Reid v. Colorado, \n187 \nU.S. 137\n, 23 S.Ct. 92; Missouri, K. & T. Ry. Co. v. Haber, supra; cf. Whipple v. Martinson, \n256 \nU.S. 41\n, 41 S.Ct. 425; Hartford Acc. & Ind. Co. v. Illinois, \n298 \nU.S. 155\n, 56 S.Ct. 685; Kelly v. Washington, supra. Such should be our construction of the Renovated Butter Act. It seems ironical for us to say that although state seizures of petitioner's packing stock are not precluded by the judicial and administrative5 construction of the Pure Food and Drug Act, which authorizes federal confiscation of the filthy ingredient, petitioner has nevertheless discovered an avenue of escape by appeal to the Renovated Butter Act which does not authorize federal seizure of the ingredient.\n It is one thing for courts in interpreting an Act of Congress regulating matters beyond state control to construe its language with a view to carrying into effect a general though unexpressed congressional purpose. It is quite another to infer a purpose, which Congress has not expressed, to deprive the states of authority which otherwise constitutionally belongs to them, over a subject which Congress has not undertaken to control. Due regard \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 177]\n\u00a0\n for the maintenance of our dual system of government demands that the courts do not diminish state power by extravagant inferences regarding what Congress might have intended if it had considered the matter, or by reference to their own conceptions of a policy which Congress has not expressed and is not plainly to be inferred from the legislation which it has enacted. Considerations which lead us not to favor repeal of statutes by implication, United States v. Borden Co., \n308 \nU.S. 188, 198\n, 199 S., 60 S. Ct. 182, 188; United States v. Jackson, \n302 \nU.S. 628, 631\n, 58 S.Ct. 390, 392; Posados v. National City Bank, \n296 \nU.S. 497, 503\n, 505 S., 56 S.Ct. 349, 353, should be at least as persuasive when the question is one of the nullification of state power by congressional legislation.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, Mr. Justice MURPHY, and Mr. Justice BYRNES join in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER.\n I agree entirely with the opinion of the CHIEF JUSTICE. I shall add only a few words on the general bearing of the majority opinion upon the legislative process.\n From the very beginning of our government in 1789, federal legislation like that now under review has usually not only been sponsored but actually drafted by the appropriate executive agency. This was true of the Act of August 10, 1912, 37 Stat. 273, amending the Renovated Butter Act. The Department of Agriculture not only urged the enactment of the legislation upon Congress, it drafted its provisions. If the Department wanted Congress to withdraw from the states their power to condemn unsanitary packing stock and to confide such power in the federal government, it could easily have made appropriate provision in the draft submitted by it to Congress. However, the Department did not do so. It did ask Congress to make some restrictions upon the authority which had been exercised by the states in regulating the manufac- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 178]\n\u00a0\n ture and sale of butter for the protection of their citizens. But the restrictions did not include withdrawal from the states of the power to condemn unhealthful packing stock butter. The sponsors of this legislation, the experts of the Department of Agriculture, could have submitted to Congress appropriate language for the accomplishment of that result. They did not do so. The Court now does it for them even though the Department has no such desire.\n To require the various agencies of the government who are the effective authors of legislation like that now before us to express clearly and explicitly their purpose in dislodging constitutional powers of states-if such is their purpose-makes for care in draftsmanship and for responsibility in legislation. To hold, as do the majority, that paralysis of state power is somehow to be found in the vague implications of the federal renovated butter enactments, is to encourage slipshodness in draftsmanship and irresponsibility in legislation.\n The majority opinion points out that the successive Solicitors of the Department of Agriculture have uniformly been of the opinion that the Department lacks the power to condemn or destroy unwholesome packing stock butter. If the Department were not content to have the states continue to exercise that power, it would have gone to Congress. In these circumstances it is strange to find in this legislation a denial to the states of powers which the Department has disclaimed and to the exercise of which by the states it has never objected.\n The result of this decision is to deny Alabama the power to protect the health of its citizens without replacing such protection by that of the federal government. The CHIEF JUSTICE does well to call attention to the fact that such a construction of the Renovated Butter Act gratuitously destroys the harmonious cooperation between the nation and the states in safeguarding the health of our people. If \n\n[315 \nU.S. 148, 179]\n\u00a0\n ever there was an intrusion by this Court into a field that belongs to Congress and which it has seen fit not to enter, this is it. And what is worse, the decision is purely destructive legislation-the Court takes power away from the states but is of course unable to transfer it to the federal government. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Petitioner, paragraph 19 of its bill of complaint, avers that packing stock butter is delivered to it for processing which is produced in Alabama and other states; that the Alabama officials, paragraph 20, claim the right to enter the premises where it receives the butter acquired by it in interstate commerce and to 'seize, suspend or otherwise deprive plaintiff of the right to use such raw material or packing stock butter, and to stop and search trucks moving in interstate commerce hauling said raw material from places without the State of Alabama to plaintiff's place of business in Birmingham, Alabama, and to seize, suspend or otherwise deprive plaintiff the right to use the said raw material or packing stock butter being so transported in interstate commerce and to (stop and search) trucks transporting the aforesaid raw material from points in Alabama to plaintiff's plant in Birmingham, Alabama, to be used in the manufacture of process or renovated butter as process or renovated butter as aforesaid.' \n Petitioner further avers, as to seizures at its plant, 'Between, to- wit, the 17th day of April, 1939, and the 22nd day of June, 1940, defendants on 16 separate occasions, seized in Birmingham, Alabama, a total of 20924 pounds of plaintiff's raw material or packing stock butter which originated in whole or in part in states of the United States outside of the State of Alabama and which had been so delivered to the plaintiff's plant in Birmingham, Alabama, as raw material and which was not being sold, offered or exposed for sale, or attempted for sale in its then condition but was being held by the plaintiff solely and exclusively for the purpose of using the same as raw material out of which to manufacture process or renovated butter in the usual course of plaintiff's business. ... Plaintiff avers on, to-wit, the 21st day of June, 1940, in making the last seizure, above referred to, the defendants stopped a truck moving in interstate commerce from the State of Georgia to the State of Alabama transporting said raw material known as packing stock butter from the State of Georgia to the plaintiff in Birmingham, Alabama. Plaintiff avers that as a result of the seizure of said raw materials by defendants, it has been denied the use thereof; the seizure and detention of said raw material has caused great financial loss to the plaintiff in that plaintiff is required to pay the storage on the same and is denied the use of such raw materials that plaintiff sorely needs in the conduct of its business, and has caused plaintiff's plant to remain idle from time to time for the lack of sufficient raw material to keep the same operating; that said action of the defendants demoralizes plaintiff's employees who are employed, to operate said plant, and is calculated to and does interfere with the sale of its finished product in interstate commerce.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Constitution, Article VI. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Cases which sustain state enactments as permissible, where federal legislation generally applicable to the field exists, recognize that federal action might forbid or exclude the state statutes approved in those instances.

For example, a lot of butter may be infested with maggots and should be condemned for use in the manufacture of renovated butter. If not, in the melting process fat from these maggots will be mixed with the butterfat and the animal fat may be detected in the finished product only by chemical laboratory tests, if at all.'\n\n A representative of the Department, appearing at the House Committee Hearings on the Agricultural Appropriation Bill for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1913, noted another difficulty in locating contaminated renovated butter:\n'But if 500 pounds of rotten packing stock is in a factory, maybe there is 10,000 pounds of other packing stock there; and you can understand how impossible it is for us to follow through that packing stock so as to be able to identify it when it comes out of the factory and is offered for sale.'\n\n Hearings of the House Committee on Agriculture on the Agricultural Appropriation Bill, 62d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 328. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The memorandum of the Chief of The Bureau of Dairy Industry to the Solicitor of The Department of Agriculture, October 4, 1940, states in part: 'The development and perfection during the past few years of new methods for analyzing and examining butter has resulted in increased regulatory activity and action against farm-made or 'packing stock' butter intended for use in the manufacture of process or renovated butter. Certain State regulatory agencies and the Federal Food and Drug Administration have been particularly active.\n'The Bureau of Dairy Industry, which is the administrative agency designated by the Secretary of Agriculture to enforce the process or renovated butter act, is entirely sympathetic with the activities of these agencies, although the apparently limiting provisions of Section 5 of the Act of May 9, 1902 (32 Stat. 196), with which this Bureau is primarily concerned, as construed in opinions of your office, have necessarily governed and guided this Bureau in its administrative policy in carrying out the provisions of the Act.'\n\n In his Annual Report on Regulatory Work of the Bureau of Dairy Industry, 1940, the Officer in Charge of Dairy Products Inspection reported, p. 4: 'In conducting the inspection of all process or renovated butter factories, this office has maintained close contact with ... local state and city regulatory agencies and officials and whenever possible cooperative action for improvement of conditions have been taken.' Id., 1939, p. 4: 'The result of State regulatory activity in the South has been beneficial in improving the procurement methods used in getting packing stock butter to the factories. More frequent pickups have been inaugurated and both Atlanta and Birmingham factories have expended hundreds of dollars in new specially made cans with tight fitting covers, and the packing stock received is very much cleaner.' Id., 1938, p. 2: 'Much of the credit for improvement in quality of packing stock butter belongs to State and Federal regulatory agencies cooperating in campaigns to improve procurement practices.' Id., p. 3: 'In conducting the inspection of process or renovated butter factories, this office has maintained close contact with State and city regulatory officials and when deemed advisable co-operative action for improvement of sanitary conditions has been taken.' \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] A report by the officer in charge of the Cereal and Dairy Section, Food Division, of the Food and Drug Administration, to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, on January 20, 1942, discloses that between July 1, 1933 and January 1, 1942, thirty-six seizures were made of lots of packing stock butter consigned to process butter plants. In commenting upon the extent of state cooperation in such seizures, it was noted that in twenty- one of such cases the packing stock was detained by the state authorities pending the filing by federal officials of a libel for condemnation proceedings under the Pure Food and Drug Act, 21 U.S.C.  334, 21 U.S.C.A .  334. These seizures included four lots of packing stock totalling over 5,000 pounds shipped to petitioner, and detained by the Alabama authorities until condemnation proceedings were begun in the federal court. \n\n\n\n\n","19":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOCHRAN v. STATE OF KANSAS(1942)\nNo. 510\nArgued: Decided: May 11, 1942\n\n\n\n Mr. H. Thomas Austern, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Jay Kyle, of Topeka, Kan., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1933, the petitioner Cochran was convicted by a jury in a Kansas state court upon a charge of passing a $12.60 check with knowledge that it was forged. His motion for a new trial was overruled. Upon a finding that Cochran \n\n[316 \nU.S. 255, 256]\n\u00a0\n had previously been convicted of two other felonies the court sentenced him to life imprisonment as an habitual criminal pursuant to a Kansas statute. Kan.Gen.Stat. (Corrick, 1935) 21-107a. Two days later he was sent to the state penitentiary where he has since been confined.\n In January, 1941, Cochran acting in his own behalf filed an original application for habeas corpus in the Supreme Court of Kansas. His application sets out the allegations, among others, that the trial judge had denied him the right to summon witnesses and to testify on his own behalf; and that officials of the state penitentiary enforcing prison rules there in effect had suppressed appeal documents he had prepared, thereby making it impossible for him to perfect an appeal during the two year period allowed by Kansas statute. The State filed a return containing a certified copy of the information on which Cochran was tried, journal entries of the trial, an order overruling Cochran's motion for a new trial, and the judgment and sentence.\n The Kansas Supreme Court denied the writ, stating that 'the records of courts are not set aside upon the unsupported statements of a defeated litigant.' Cochran v. Amrine, 153 Kan. 777, 113 P.2d 1048, 1049. We accept the court's conclusion that the record, showing that Cochran was represented by counsel throughout, and revealing on its face no irregularities in the trial, is sufficient refutation of his unsupported charge that he was denied the right to summon witnesses and testify for himself.\n But the allegations that prison officials frustrated Cochran's efforts to perfect an appeal are a different matter. Since these allegations relate to a period subsequent to Cochran's commitment, and since that is the latest event referred to in the record, the record itself affords no refutation. Nor are these allegations denied in any other part of the State's answer. Moreover, the opinion of the court itself recognizes that these allegations had 'some basis', \n\n[316 \nU.S. 255, 257]\n\u00a0\n pointing out that 'under rules ... prevailing at the penitentiary' for some time following Cochran's commitment he was prevented from sending out a petition for habeas corpus, and that it was not until October, 1935, ( after the time for appeal had expired) that such a petition was actually filed. On the other hand, nothing in the opinion indicates that the court denied the application on the ground that it had canvassed the allegations and supporting affidavits of Cochran and three others pertaining to suppression of appeal and had concluded that they were untrue.\n Cochran's application for habeas corpus does not bear the name of counsel. Not a lawyer, he apparently prepared it himself. On the issue of denial of opportunity to perfect an appeal, he alleged that the 'record shows that the duly authorized officers and prison officials exercised unlawful authority by surpressing your petitioners appeal documents', etc. In its brief and argument before us, the State has contended that the word 'record' can refer only to the trial record set out in its return to Cochran's application. Since that record does not show the alleged suppression, it is urged that Cochran's application was properly denied because wholly unsupported. As we have pointed out, the record of the trial court proceedings, relating as it did to a period ending with Cochran's commitment, could prove nothing with respect to independent subsequent events. Hence, to place the construction urged by the State on the word 'record' as used by Cochran would not merely impute to him a technical precision which his application as a whole contradicts; it would render the application entirely meaningless.\n The State properly concedes that if the alleged facts pertaining to suppression of Cochran's appeal 'were disclosed as being true before the supreme court of Kansas, there would be no question but that there was a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth amend- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 255, 258]\n\u00a0\n ment.' And in Kansas, habeas corpus is recognized as affording a remedy for a person held in prison in violation of a right guaranteed by the Federal Constitution. \n1\n However inept Cochran's choice of words, he has set out allegations supported by affidavits and nowhere denied that Kansas refused him privileges of appeal which it afforded to others. Since no determination of the verity of these allegations appears to have been made, the cause must be remanded for further proceedings.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See, e.g., In re Jarvis, 66 Kan. 329, 31 P. 576.

UNITED STATES(1942)\nNo. 1026\nArgued: May 1, 1942Decided: June 1, 1942\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York.\n Mr. Charles E. Hughes, Jr., of New York City, for appellant.\n Mr. Telford Taylor, of Washington, D.C., for appellees the United States and Federal Communications Commission. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 408]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Louis G. Caldwell, of Washington, D.C., for appellee Mutual Broadcasting System, Inc.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Federal Communications Commission, by its order of May 2, 1941, as amended by its order of October 11, 1941, promulgated regulations which purport to require the Commission to refuse to grant a license to any broadcasting station which enters into certain defined types of contract with any broadcasting network organization. These regulations, it is alleged, affect adversely appellant's contractual relations with broadcasting stations and impair its ability to carry on its business in maintaining and operating its nationwide broadcasting network. The regulations as amended on October 11, 1941, together with a supplemental 'minute' promulgated by the Commission on October 31, 1941, are set forth at the end of this opinion. The question for our decision is whether appellant is entitled to secure a judicial review of the order by a suit brought under  402(a) of the Communications Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 1093, 47 U.S.C.  402(a), 47 U.S.C.A.  402(a), and the Urgent Deficiencies Act, 38 Stat. 219, 220, 28 U.S.C.  47, 28 U.S.C.A.  47.\n Pursuant to  402(a) appellant brought the present suit against the United States in the Southern District of New York, to enjoin enforcement of the Commission's order as contrary to the public interest and beyond the Commission's statutory authority, and on the further ground, if the order be deemed within that authority, that the statute is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power by Congress in violation of Article I,  1 of the Constitution, and operates to deprive appellant of property \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 409]\n\u00a0\n without due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The case was heard by a court of three judges, which permitted the Commission and the Mutual Broadcasting Company to intervene as defendants. It granted appellees' motion to dismiss the complaint for want of jurisdiction, D.C., 44 F.Supp. 688, and stayed the operation of the Commission's order pending direct appeal to this Court.\n In 1938 the Communications Commission authorized an investigation 'to determine what special regulations applicable to radio stations engaged in chain or other broadcasting are required in the public interest, convenience, or necessity'. Extensive hearings were held by a committee consisting of three members of the Commission, at whose request the national networks, including appellant, intervened. In June, 1940, the committee made a report, on the basis of which briefs were filed and oral argument was presented before the full Commission by the three national networks and other interested parties. In May, 1941, the Commission issued its 'Report on Chain Broadcasting' and ordered the adoption of the regulations which, in their amended form, are the subject of the present controversy.\n The relevant facts stated in the bill of complaint are as follows: Appellant or its predecessor has been engaged in the business of nationwide network or chain broadcasting since 1927. It has a large amount of physical property used in the business and has built up a valuable goodwill. For its broadcasts it maintains a staff of employees and expends large amounts for musicians and broadcasting performers. It has commitments by long-term contracts aggregating more than $4,000,000 for broadcasting expenditures, including those for the use of land and buildings and for the furnishing of news and broadcasting programs in the next few years. Appellant's total property devoted to its broadcasting business exceeds $18,000,000 in value; \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 410]\n\u00a0\n its earnings from the network exceeded $3,000,000 in both 1939 and 1940\n\n\n Chain broadcasting is the means by which radio programs are made available to all or a large part of the nationwide radio audience. It is defined by the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C.  153(p), 47 U.S.C.A.  153(p ), as the 'simultaneous broadcasting of an identical program by two or more connected stations'. The chain broadcaster prepares radio programs, for which it engages performers in advance, and simultaneously broadcasts them over a large number of radio stations to which the programs are transmitted from some central point of origination by wire telephone lines leased by the broadcaster, here the appellant. The programs, which are prepared well in advance of the broadcast and given by persons employed for the purpose by appellant, are of two classes-commercial programs sponsored and paid for by advertisers, and sustaining programs furnished by appellant and not paid for by any advertiser.\n Appellant's network comprises 123 stations in 122 cities in the United States. It is so operated as to enable ninety per cent of the radio audience of the United States to listen simultaneously to programs provided by appellant and broadcasted over these stations. Appellant owns and operates seven of the stations and leases an eighth, all licensed by the Commission. With the remaining 115 stations it enters into individual contracts usually for periods of five years, terminable in some instances by appellant on twelve months' notice. By these contracts appellant undertakes to furnish each station with an average of at least sixty hours per week of network sustaining and sponsored programs. The sustaining programs are furnished without charge, the station being free to use them or not as it chooses. Appellant undertakes to furnish the station with all commercial programs which the sponsor requests the station to broadcast and to pay the station a specified \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 411]\n\u00a0\n hourly rate for the use of its facilities in broadcasting such programs. Appellant agrees not to furnish its programs to other stations in the same city; the affiliated station, with exceptions not now material, agrees not to broadcast the program of any other network. Of critical importance in the present litigation is the stipulation of the affiliated station that it will, upon not less than twenty-eight days' notice from appellant, broadcast the sponsored or commercial program furnished to it by appellant for at least fifty 'converted' hours (averaging seventy-nine regular clock hours) per week.\n These provisions of appellant's contracts are alleged to be indispensable to the maintenance and efficient operation of its network and to the existence of a strong and efficient network broadcasting system, and necessary to enable appellant to compete with other advertising media. On May 2, 1941 the Commission issued its order which, as amended by its order of October 11, 1941, promulgated the 'Chain Broadcasting Regulations' of which appellant complains, and which the Commission characterized in its Report as 'the expression of the general policy we will follow in exercising our licensing power'.1 The regulations provide that no license shall be granted to a broadcast \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 412]\n\u00a0\n station having contracts with a network organization, containing any of several provisions which are characteristic of appellant's contracts with its affiliates. These included provisions by which the station is prevented from broadcasting the programs of any other network organization ( 3.101); or which prevent another station serving substantially the same area from broadcasting the network programs not taken by the station applying for license, or prevent another station serving a substantially different area from broadcasting any program of the network organization ( 3.102); or by which the station contracts for affiliation with the network for a period longer than two years (3.103); or by which the station 'options for network programs any time subject to call on less than 56 days' notice or more time than a total of three hours' within each of four specified segments of the broadcast day, the regulation declaring 'such options may not be exclusive as against other network organizations and may not prevent or hinder the station from optioning or selling any or all of the time covered by the option, or other time, to other network organizations' (3.104); or which prevent the station (a) from rejecting network programs which the station reasonably believes to be unsatisfactory or unsuitable or (b) from substituting for the network program a program of outstanding local or national importance (3.105).\n After making its order of May 2, 1941, the Commission deferred its effective date until further order. By its order of October 11, 1941, the Commission fixed the effective date as November 15, 1941, and directed 'that the effective date of Regulation 3.106 with respect to any station may be extended from time to time in order to permit the orderly disposition of properties', and 'that the effective date of Regulation 3. 107 shall be suspended indefinitely and any further order of the Commission placing said Regulation 3.107 in effect shall provide for not less \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 413]\n\u00a0\n than six months' notice and for further extension of the effective date from time to time in order to permit the orderly disposition of properties.'\n The bill of complaint also alleges that the purpose and effect of the regulations are to prohibit station licensees from having agreements of the kind which appellant has with its affiliates; that prior to the order of May 2, 1941, it was the practice of the Commission to renew the licenses of stations annually and that the licensed stations have had a reasonable expectancy of the annual renewal of their licenses; that 115 licensed stations have such contracts with appellant expiring at various times between the original effective date of the regulations and December 31, 1947. It is alleged that when their current licenses expire, at the latest, and perhaps earlier through the revocation of existing licenses, such stations face the loss of their licenses if they perform or continue in force or renew any existing contracts containing the described provisions.\n The bill alleges that since the stations fear the loss of their licenses, as a result of the regulations, they will not negotiate for or renew affiliation contracts containing such provisions. And because they fear the loss of their licenses the stations have threatened to cancel and repudiate their affiliation contracts, and many have notified appellant that they will not be bound by their contracts after the regulations become effective. As a consequence appellant's ability to conduct its business and maintain its public broadcasting service is seriously impaired and the regulations will make the operation of appellant's business more costly, reduce its earnings and render its property and business less valuable.\n The bill of complaint was filed October 30, 1941. The following day the Commission promulgated a supplemental 'minute' setting up a procedure by which the validity of the regulations might be tested upon application for a license by an individual licensee. The minute declared \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 414]\n\u00a0\n that if a station wished to challenge the regulations the Commission would grant a temporary extension of its license until there had been a final court determination of the issues. In the event of such litigation, and if the validity of the regulations were sustained, 'the Commission will nevertheless grant a regular license to the licensee, otherwise entitled thereto, who has unsuccessfully litigated that issue, if the licensee thereupon conforms to the decision'.\n An affidavit subsequently submitted by appellant in support of its motion for a temporary injunction states that since the Commission's minute of October 31st, appellant has continued to receive indications that its affiliates will cancel and repudiate their contracts and refuse to renew them, and has received no indication that the minute has or will have the effect of inducing stations to assume the burden of testing the validity of the regulations. Attached to the affidavit are letters from five affiliates, written after October 31st, indicating their intention not to be bound by the contracts. The affidavit also states appellant's belief that it would have received more such letters had it not been for its circulation of information concerning the pendency of this suit.\n Accepting the allegations of the complaint as true, as for present purposes we must, it is evident that application by the Commission of its regulations in accordance with their terms would disrupt appellant's broadcasting system and seriously disorganize its business. As the bill alleges, station licenses have been renewable by the Commission annually,2 whereas appellant's contracts are for five year periods and many of them will survive the expiration of the existing licenses to the affiliated stations. Under Regulations 3.101, 3.102, 3.103 and 3.104, each affili- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 415]\n\u00a0\n ate must repudiate his contract or be denied the renewal of his license. In either case this would deprive appellant of the station's participation in its network, for which its contracts call.\n Regulation 3.104 not only requires all options by appellant to be exercised on 56 days' rather than 28 days' notice as at present, but provides that no option time is exclusive of other networks, and thus allows to appellant no option time within which it can command the use of affiliated stations for any program for broadcasting on a national scale. These sections together thus operate to break down the network enterprise in which appellant and its affiliates are by their contracts cooperating, and to substitute a system in which every station is available to every network on a 'first come first served basis'.\n The Commission concedes by its brief that as provided by  312(a) 'Any station license may be revoked ... because of conditions revealed by such statements of fact as may be required (of a licensee) from time to time which would warrant the Commission in refusing to grant a license on an original application'. Consequently the regulations by their terms, read in conjunction with  312(a), expose licensees, who renew their affiliation contracts, to revocation proceedings by the Commission whenever upon a statement which the Commission may require it appears that the licensee has entered into an affiliation contract which the regulations proscribe.\n A proceeding to set aside an order of the Commission under  402(a) and the Urgent Deficiencies Act is a plenary suit in equity. Hence the questions raised by the motion to dismiss are whether the Commission's order is an 'order', review of which is authorized by  402(a) of the Act, and if so whether the bill states a cause of action in equity. The suit cannot be maintained unless both questions are answered in the affirmative. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 416]\n\u00a0\n Section 402(a) makes applicable the provisions of the Urgent Deficiencies Act to 'suits to enforce, enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend any order of the Commission' except orders 'granting or refusing an application for a construction permit for a radio station, or for a radio station license, or for renewal of an existing radio station license, or for modification of an existing radio station license, or suspending a radio operator's license'. Review of the orders excepted from  402(a) is by appeal to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia under the provisions of  402(b). See Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc., v. Federal Communications Comm., \n316 \nU.S. 4\n, 62 S.Ct. 875, 86 L.Ed. --. Since the Commission's order neither grants, denies nor modifies any license, any review in advance or independently of an application for a station license must be under  402(a), and then only if the Commission's order promulgating the regulations is an 'order' within the meaning of this section. The particular label placed upon it by the Commission is not necessarily conclusive, for it is the substance of what the Commission has purported to do and has done which is decisive. Powell v. United States, \n300 \nU.S. 276, 284\n, 285 S., 57 S.Ct. 470, 474, 475; A.F. of L. v. Labor Board, \n308 \nU.S. 401, 408\n, 60 S.Ct. 300, 303.\n The Commission's investigation of the contractual relations between the networks and the stations, which resulted in the order now under attack, was for the stated purpose of prescribing regulations of such relationships. The order authorizing the investigation recited that the proceeding was taken under  303(i) of the Act, which gives the Commission 'authority to make special regulations applicable to radio stations engaged in chain broadcasting'. Since the Commission is not in terms given authority to regulate contractual relations between the stations and the networks, regulation of them could be accomplished only by regulating licensed radio stations which participate in chain broadcasting. It was by regulations in terms applicable to such stations that the Com- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 417]\n\u00a0\n mission sought to control their contractual relationships with the networks.\n The order is thus in its genesis and on its face, and in its practical operation, an order promulgating regulations which operate to control such contractual relationships, and it was adopted by the Commission in the avowed exercise of its rule-making power. Such regulations which affect or determine rights generally even though not directed to any particular person or corporation, when lawfully promulgated by the Interstate Commerce Commission, have the force of law and are orders reviewable under the Urgent Deficiencies Act. Assigned Car Cases, \n274 \nU.S. 564\n, 47 S.Ct. 727; United States v. Baltimore & O.R. Co., \n293 \nU.S. 454\n, 55 S.Ct. 268. And regulations of like character, by which the Communications Commission has prescribed generally the records and accounts to be kept by telephone companies subject to its jurisdiction, are similarly reviewable under  402(a). American T. & T. Co. v. United States, \n299 \nU.S. 232\n, 57 S.Ct. 170.\n The regulations here prescribe rules which govern the contractual relationships between the stations and the networks. If the applicant for a license has entered into an affiliation contract, the regulations require the Commission to reject his application. If a licensee renews his contract, the regulations, with the sanction of  312(a), authorize the Commission to cancel his license. In a proceeding for revocation or cancellation of a license, the decisive question is whether the station, by entering into a contract, has forfeited its right to a license as the regulations prescribe. It is the signing of the contract which, by virtue of the regulations alone, has legal consequences to the stations and to appellant. The regulations are not any the less reviewable because their promulgation did not operate of their own force to deny or cancel a license. It is enough that failure to comply with them penalizes licensees, and appellant, with whom they contract. If an administrative order has that effect it is reviewable and it \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 418]\n\u00a0\n does not cease to be so merely because it is not certain whether the Commission will institute proceedings to enforce the penalty incurred under its regulations for non-compliance. Assigned Car Cases, supra; American T. & T. Co. v. United States, supra.\n The regulations are rules which in proceedings before the Commission require it to reject and authorize it to cancel licenses on the grounds specified in the regulations without more. If the regulations are valid they alter the status of appellant's contracts and thus determine their validity in advance of such proceedings. By striking them down by a determination proclaimed in advance that licenses shall be cancelled or refused because of a previous failure to comply with the regulations, they impose a penalty and sanction for noncompliance far more drastic than the fines customarily inflicted for breach of reviewable administrative orders.\n Most rules of conduct having the force of law are not self-executing but require judicial or administrative action to impose their sanctions with respect to particular individuals. Unlike an administrative order or a court judgment adjudicating the rights of individuals, which is binding only on the parties to the particular proceeding, a valid exercise of the rule-making power is addressed to and sets a standard of conduct for all to whom its terms apply. It operates as such in advance of the imposition of sanctions upon any particular individual. It is common experience that men conform their conduct to regulations by governmental authority so as to avoid the unpleasant legal consequences which failure to conform entails. And in this case it is alleged without contradiction that numerous affiliated stations have conformed to the regulations to avoid loss of their licenses with consequent injury to appellant.\n Such regulations have the force of law before their sanctions are invoked as well as after. When as here they \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 419]\n\u00a0\n are promulgated by order of the Commission and the expected conformity to them causes injury cognizable by a court of equity, they are appropriately the subject of attack under the provisions of  402(a) and the Urgent Deficiencies Act. American T. & T. Co. v. United States, supra; Rochester Tel. Corp. v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 125\n, 59 S.Ct. 754; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Goodrich Transit Co., \n224 \nU.S. 194\n, 32 S. Ct. 436; Kansas City So. Ry. v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 423\n, 34 S.Ct. 125, 52 L.R.A.,N.S., 1; Assigned Car Cases, supra; Chicago, R.I. & P. Ry. Co. v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 80\n, 52 S.Ct. 87; United States v. Baltimore & O.R. Co., supra.\n It is no answer to say that the regulations are addressed only of the Commission and merely prohibit it from granting-and authorize it to cancel- licenses in the case of all stations entering into such contracts, and that accordingly all stations are left free to enter into contracts or not as they choose. They are free only in the sense that all those who do not choose to conform to regulations which may be determined to be lawful are free by their choice to accept the legal consequences of their acts. Failure to comply with the regulations entails such consequences to the station owner and to appellant. These are the loss of the affiliated stations' licenses if they adhere to their contracts, and disruption of appellant's network through the declared unlawfulness of the contracts, if the regulations are valid.\n The purposes sought to be accomplished by  402(a) and the Urgent Deficiencies Act would be defeated if a suitor were unable to resort to them to avoid reasonably anticipated irreparable injury resulting from such legal consequences of the Commission's order, merely because the Commission as yet has neither refused to renew a license, as the regulations require, nor cancelled a license, as the regulations permit. Such an argument addressed to the form rather than the substance of the order was rejected in Powell v. United States, supra; \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 420]\n\u00a0\n cf. A.F. of L. v. Labor Board, supra, \n308 \nU.S. 408\n, 60 S.Ct. 303. The Powell case likewise repudiates the suggestion that merely because the order is not in terms addressed to those whose rights are affected, they cannot seek its review. See also Western Pacific C.R. Co. v. Southern Pac. Co., \n284 \nU.S. 47\n, 52 S.Ct. 56; Claiborne- Annapolis Ferry Co. v. United States, \n285 \nU.S. 382\n, 52 S.Ct. 440.\n The order here is not one, as the Government argues and as the court below seemed to think, where the complainant's rights are affected only on the contingency of future administrative action as in United States v. Los Angeles & S.L.R.R., \n273 \nU.S. 299\n, 47 S.Ct. 413; cf. Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States, supra, \n307 \nU.S. 130\n, 59 S.Ct. 757. As the Court declared in the Los Angeles case, \n273 \nU.S. 309, 310\n, 47 S.Ct. 414, reviewable orders are 'an exercise either of the quasi judicial function of determining controversies or of the delegated legislative function of rate making and rule making'. And the Court pointed out that the 'so-called order' in that case did not 'determine any right or obligation' or change the plaintiff's 'existing or future status or condition', and that it was 'merely the formal record of conclusions reached after a study of data collected in the course of extensive research conducted by the Commission' and 'is the exercise solely of the function of investigation.'\n Here the Commission exercised its rule-making power by adopting regulations whose operation is not made subject to future administrative determinations, save only as the Commission may be called on to decide in any given case whether a station's contract with a network is within the regulations. The regulations' applicability to all who are within their terms does not depend upon future administrative action. Instead they operate to control such action and to determine in advance the rights of others affected by it. The Commission gave its own recognition \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 421]\n\u00a0\n that such is their operation by its successive postponements of the effective date of the order for a period now expired, and by its suspension of Regulations 3.106 and 3.107, in order to enable the networks to dispose of their properties.\n Of course the Commission was at liberty to follow a wholly different procedure. Instead of proclaming general regulations applicable to all licenses, in advance of any specific contest over a license, it might have awaited such a contest to declare that the policy which these regulations embody represents its concept of the public interest. As a matter of sound administrative practice, both the rule-making proceeding and the specific license proceeding undoubtedly have much to commend them. But they are by no means the same, nor do they necessarily give rise to the same kind of judicial review. Having adopted this order under its rule-making power, the Commission cannot insist that the appellant be relegated to that judicial review which would be exclusive if the rule-making power had never been exercised and consequently had never subjected appellant to the threatened irreparable injury.\n The court below assumed that if appellant had any equitable cause of action, it must be prosecuted in an ordinary suit and not under the provisions of the Urgent Deficiencies Act. But we think this mistakes both the nature of the regulations and the purpose of suits under that Act, as incorporated in  402(a). Such a cause of action obviously can arise only because of the operation of the regulations. The regulations are the effective implement by which the injury complained of is wrought, and hence must be the object of the attack. It is because they are an exercise of the rule-making power, and because they presently determine rights on the basis of which the Commission is required to withhold licenses and au- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 422]\n\u00a0\n thorized to cancel them, that there is an order within the meaning of  402(a) and the Urgent Deficiencies Act.\n The Commission argues that since its Report characterized the regulations as announcements of policy, the order promulgating them is no more subject to review than a press release similarly announcing its policy. Undoubtedly regulations adopted in the exercise of the administrative rule-making power, like laws enacted by legislatures, embody announcements of policy. But they may be something more. When, as here, the regulations are avowedly adopted in the exercise of that power, couched in terms of command and accompanied by an announcement of the Commission that the policy is one 'which we will follow in exercising our licensing power', they must be taken by those entitled to rely upon them as what they purport to be-an exercise of the delegated legislative power- which, until amended, are controlling alike upon the Commission and all others whose rights may be affected by the Commission's execution of them. The Commission's contention that the regulations are no more reviewable than a press release is hardly reconcilable with its own recognition that the regulations afford legal basis for cancellation of the license of a station if it renews its contract with appellant.\n Appellant's standing to maintain the present suit in equity is unaffected by the fact that the regulations are not directed to appellant and do not in terms compel action by it or impose penalties upon it because of its action or failure to act. It is enough that, by setting the controlling standards for the Commission's action, the regulations purport to operate to alter and affect adversely appellant's contractual rights and business relations with station owners whose applications for licenses the regulations will cause to be rejected and whose licenses the regulations may cause to be revoked. Chicago Junction Case, \n264 \nU.S. 258\n, 266-268, 44 S.Ct. 317, 320; Western Pacific C.R. Co. v. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 423]\n\u00a0\n Southern Pac. Co. supra; Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry Co. v. United States, supra; compare, in the case of an attack upon the validity of a statute, Truax v. Raich, \n239 \nU.S. 33, 38\n, 39 S., 36 S.Ct. 7, 9, L.R.A. 1916D, 545, Ann.Cas.1917B, 283; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, \n268 \nU.S. 510\n, 45 S.Ct. 571, 39 A.L.R. 468.\n What we have said of the allegations of the complaint, and of the effect of the Commission's order if those allegations are sustained upon the trial, is enough to establish the threat of irreparable injury to appellant's business and to show also that the injury can not be avoided, as the Commission suggests, by appellant's intervention in proceedings upon applications for renewal of licenses by its affiliates or in proceedings to cancel their licenses, if and when such proceedings are instituted. Appellant has sufficiently alleged that the affiliates are cancelling or threatening to cancel their contracts in order to conform to the regulations. It is to avoid the irreparable injury which would result from such wholesale cancellations of its contracts, induced by the force of the regulations, that appellant makes its attack on them now rather than in later proceedings on the individual applications for licenses in those cases, if any, in which the stations are willing to seek licenses without complying with the prerequisites laid down by the regulations.\n The issues in such a proceeding are not necessarily the same as the issues here. Intervention in it would afford appellant no assurance either of an adjudication of appellant's contentions or that the action of other stations would be governed by it. Moreover, if the Commission's order is as we hold a reviewable order, appellant is free to seek review under  402(a). It is not thereby, as the court below seemed to think, improperly substituting a different procedure and court for that which Congress has prescribed for the trial of like issues so far as they may be raised on review of an order denying a license. Such issues may likewise be involved in a proceeding, upon the Commission's own motion, for modification or cancellation \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 424]\n\u00a0\n of a license, which concededly is reviewable under  402(a). See Scripps- Howard Radio, Inc., v. Federal Communications Commission, supra. But review of the order by a licensee in such a proceeding affords no adequate remedy. If ever instituted, which is uncertain, it would come too late to save appellant from the injury wrought by the outlawry of its contracts.\n Nor does the Commission's minute, filed after the present suit was brought, afford an adequate basis for requiring appellant to seek relief by intervention in a proceeding on application for a license reviewable under  402(b). In that event the minute would not operate to broaden the issues involved in the renewal application. Nor would it afford a basis for restraining enforcement of the regulations as to other affiliated stations, pending adjudication of the validity of the regulations. Without full exploration of the subject, such as can be had only at the trial, we cannot say that the minute will afford a sufficient inducement to persuade the affiliated stations to cease cancellations and assume the initiative in litigating the validity of the regulations and of the contracts which they undertake to condemn. The affidavit filed in the court below on the application for a stay is to the contrary. And in any case we are of the opinion that there are no equitable principles by which the right of appellant, upon the showing made by its complaint and affidavit, to test the order under  402(a) can justly be suspended to await action which the station owners may or may not take in assuming the burden of challenging the regulations.\n We need not stop to discuss here the great variety of administrative rulings which, unlike this one, are not reviewable-either because they do not adjudicate rights or declare them legislatively, or because there are adequate administrative remedies which must be pursued before resorting to judicial remedies, or because there is no occasion to resort to equitable remedies. But we should \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 425]\n\u00a0\n not for that reason fail to discriminate between them and this case in which, because of its peculiar circumstances, all the elements prerequisite to judicial review are present. The ultimate test of reviewability is not to be found in an overrefined technique, but in the need of the review to protect from the irreparable injury threatened in the exceptional case by administrative rulings which attach legal consequences to action taken in advance of other hearings and adjudications that may follow, the results of which the regulations purport to control.\n We conclude that the Commission's promulgation of the regulations is an order reviewable under  402(a) of the Act, and that the bill of complaint states a cause of action in equity. The stay now in effect will be continued, on terms to be settled by the court below.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice BLACK took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n ORDER OF MAY 3, 1941, AS AMENDED OCTOBER 11, 1941\n Now, therefore, it is hereby ordered, That the following regulations be and they are hereby adopted:\n Sec. 3.101. Exclusive affiliation of station.-No license shall be granted to a standard broadcast station having any contract, arrangement, or understanding, express or implied, with a network organization under which the station is prevented or hindered from, or penalized for, broadcasting the programs of any other network organization.\n Sec. 3.102. Territorial exclusivity.-No license shall be granted to a standard broadcast station having any contract, arrangement, or understanding, express or implied, with a network organization which prevents or hinders another station serving substantially the same area from broadcasting the network's programs not taken by the former station, or which prevents or hinders \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 426]\n\u00a0\n another station serving a substantially different area from broadcasting any program of the network organization. This regulation shall not be construed to prohibit any contract, arrangement, or understanding between a station and a network organization pursuant to which the station is granted the first call in its primary service area upon the programs of the network organization.\n Sec. 3.103. Term of affiliation.-No license shall be granted to a standard broadcast station having any contract, arrangement, or understanding, expressed or implied, with a network organization which provides, by original term, provisions for renewal, or otherwise for the affiliation of the station with the network organization for a period longer than two years: Provided, That a contract, arrangement, or understanding for a period up to two years, may be entered into within 120 days prior to the commencement of such period.\n Sec. 3.104. Option time.-No license shall be granted to a standard broadcast station which options for network programs any time subject to call on less than 56 days' notice, or more time than a total of three hours within each of four segments of the broadcast day, as herein described. The broadcast day is divided into 4 segments, as follows: 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.; 1:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.; 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.; 11:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. Such options may not be exclusive as against other network organizations and may not prevent or hinder the station from optioning or selling any or all of the time covered by the option, or other time, to other network organizations.\n Sec. 3.105. Right to reject programs.-No license shall be granted to a standard broadcast station having any contract, arrangement, or understanding, express or implied, with a network organization which (a), with respect to programs offered pursuant to an affiliation contract, prevents or hinders the station from rejecting or refusing network programs which the station reasonably believes to be unsatisfactory or unsuitable; or which (b), with respect to network programs so offered or already con- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 427]\n\u00a0\n tracted for, prevents the station from rejecting or refusing any program which, in its opinion, is contrary to the public interest, or from substituting a program of outstanding local or national importance.\n Sec. 3.106. Network ownership of stations.-No license shall be granted to a network organization, or to any person directly or indirectly controlled by or under common control with a network organization, for more than one standard broadcast station where one of the stations covers substantially the service area of the other station, or for any standard broadcast station in any locality where the existing standard broadcast stations are so few or of such unequal desirability (in terms of coverage, power, frequency, or other related matters) that competition would be substantially restrained by such licensing.\n Sec. 3.107. Dual network operation.-No license shall be issued to a standard broadcast station affiliated with a network organization which maintains more than one network: Provided, That this regulation shall not be applicable if such networks are not operated simultaneously, or if there is no substantial overlap in the territory served by the group of stations comprising each such network.\n Sec. 3.108. Control by networks of station rates.-No license shall be granted to a standard broadcast station having any contract, arrangement, or understanding, express or implied, with a network organization under which the station is prevented or hindered from, or penalized for, fixing or altering its rates for the sale of broadcast time for other than the network's programs.\n (Effective date.) These regulations shall become effective immediately: Provided, That, with respect to existing contracts, arrangements, or understandings, or network organization station licenses, the effective date shall be deferred until November 15, 1941: Provided further, That the effective date of Regulation 3.106 with respect to any station may be extended from time to time in order to permit the orderly disposition of properties; And provided further, That the effective date of Regulation 3.107 shall be suspended indefinitely and any further order of the Commission placing said Regulation 3.107 in effect shall provide for not less than six months' notice and for \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 428]\n\u00a0\n further extension of the effective date from time to time in order to permit the orderly disposition of properties.\n THE MINUTE OF OCTOBER 31, 1941\n The Commission today adopted the following minute setting forth the procedure that it will follow in applying the policies announced in the Chain Broadcasting Regulations:\n If a station wishes to contest the validity of the Chain Broadcasting Regulations adopted in Docket No. 5060, or the reasonableness of their application to the particular station, its license will be set for hearing. In order to insure that the station may remain on the air and be in no way injured by any such Commission proceeding and appeal to court from a decision in such proceeding, the Commission will grant such licensee a temporary extension of its license, with renewals from time to time until there has been a final determination of the issues raised at such hearing. In the event of such litigation, and if the validity of the application of the Chain Broadcasting Regulations to such licensee is sustained by the courts, the Commission will nevertheless grant a regular license to the licensee, otherwise entitled thereto, who has unsuccessfully litigated that issue, if the licensee thereupon conforms to the decision.\n The supplementary decision and order in Docket No. 5060 indefinitely suspended Regulation 3.107, relating to the operation of more than one network by a single network organization. No similar suspension was made of that portion of Regulation 3.106, relating to network operation of more than one standard broadcast station with substantially overlapping service areas. The Commission will postpone indefinitely any action to prevent such dual station operation if it is shown that the operation of two stations in any city is indispensable to the continued operation of two networks by a single network organization.\n The adoption of the foregoing procedure is without prejudice to the rights of any person who may petition the Commission for modification or stay of the Chain Broadcasting Regulations. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 429]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, dissenting.\n The criteria governing judicial review of 'orders' under the Urgent Deficiencies Act were defined by a unanimous Court in United States v. Los Angeles & S.L.R.R., \n273 \nU.S. 299, 309\n, 310 S., 47 S.Ct. 413, 414: 'The so-called order here complained of is one which does not command the carrier to do, or to refrain from doing, any thing; which does not grant or withhold any authority, privilege, or license; which does not extend or abridge any power or facility; which does not subject the carrier to any liability, civil or criminal; which does not change the carrier's existing or future status or condition; which does not determine any right or obligation.' If 'broadcasting company' were substituted for 'carrier', this analysis of the legal consequences of the action of the Interstate Commerce Commission in the Los Angeles case would fit perfectly the legal consequences of the action of the Federal Communications Commission in making public the challenged regulations.\n The fact that an action of an administrative agency occasions even irreparable loss does not in itself afford sufficient grounds for judicial review. Even if the Commission committed a wrong, the question of judicial reviewability still remains that put in the Los Angeles case, 273 U.S. at page 313, 47 S.Ct. page 416, to wit, is it 'a wrong for which Congress provides a remedy under the Urgent Deficiencies Act' of October 22, 1913, 38 Stat. 208, 219, 28 U.S.C.A.  47, as incorporated in  402(a) of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C.A.  402(a)?\n For Congress has not authorized resort to the federal courts merely because someone feels aggrieved, however deeply, by an action of the Federal Communications Commission. A District Court of the United States can take a case only when Congress has authorized that type of case to be taken. Congress did not leave opportunity for reviewing damaging action by the Federal Communica- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 430]\n\u00a0\n tions Commission to the general equity powers of the district courts. It circumscribed the power of the courts in relation to the Commission in the most detailed way. Its incorporation by reference, in the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., of the scope of review allowed in reviewing an 'order' of the Interstate Commerce Commission gave all the precise, definite, and technical boundaries which the concept of a reviewable 'order' had acquired through the decisions of this Court prior to the enactment of the Communications Act. The precise requirements of an 'order' of the Commission for purposes of judicial review are therefore as inflexible as though they were written into the Act itself.\n Our problem, then, is this: Does the issuance of the chain broadcasting regulations constitute an 'order' reviewable in a proceeding brought under  402(a) of the Communications Act, in the light of the settled rules for determining what such an 'order' is when a determination of the Interstate Commerce Commission is made the basis of judicial review. It is therefore necessary to put out of mind what this case is not. It is not the invocation of equity jurisdiction in order to avoid threatened irreparable harm resulting from the criminal enforcement of an unconstitutional statute, as in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, \n268 \nU.S. 510\n, 45 S.Ct. 571, 39 A.L.R. 468. Nor do we have here a resort to equity because it is essential for the protection of asserted rights that criminal prosecutions unauthorized by law be restrained, as in Shields v. Utah Idaho Cent. R. Co., \n305 \nU.S. 177, 183\n, 59 S.Ct. 160, 163.\n In promulgating these regulations the Communications Commission merely announced its conception of one aspect of the public interest, namely, the relationship of certain provisions in network-affiliation contracts to the obligation of a station licensee to render the most effective service to the listening public. The regulations themselves \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 431]\n\u00a0\n determine no rights. They alter the status of neither the networks nor licensees. As such they require nobody-neither the networks, the licensees, nor the Commission-to do any thing. They are merely an announcement to the public of what the Commission intends to do in passing upon future applications for station licenses. No action of the stations or the networks can violate the regulations, for there is nothing the regulations require them to do or refrain from doing.\n Announcements of general policies intended to be followed by administrative agencies customarily take any one of various forms. Sometimes they are noted in the agency's annual report to Congress, sometimes in a public announcement or press release, and sometimes, as was the case here, they are published as 'rules' or 'regulations'. See Final Report of the Attorney General's Committee on Administrative Procedure ( 1941), pp. 26, 27. But whatever form such announcements may take, their nature and effect is the same. The reason why the Commission formulated its chain broadcasting policy in the form of a 'regulation' is given in its report: 'We believe that the announcement of the principles we intend to apply in exercising our licensing power will expedite business and further the ends of justice. ... Good administrative practice would seem to demand that such a statement of policy or rules and regulations be promulgated wherever sufficient information is available upon which they may be based.' Report on Chain Broadcasting, Federal Communications Commission, Order No. 37, Docket No. 5060, p. 85.\n With respect to its jurisdiction over matters relating to radio broadcasting, the Communications Commission is essentially a licensing agency. Its regulatory power over the industry is derived, for the most part, from its authority to grant and withhold station licenses. Under  309 \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 432]\n\u00a0\n of the Communications Act of 1934 the Commission is required to examine each application for a station license and to determine in each case whether a grant would serve public interest, convenience, or necessity. As was noted in Federal Communications Commission v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., \n309 \nU.S. 134, 138\n, 60 S.Ct. 437, 439, the Act 'expresses a desire on the part of Congress to maintain, through appropriate administrative control, a grip on the dynamic aspects of radio transmission.' To that end Congress established an administrative procedure under which the Commission must make a specific determination in each case whether the public interest would be served by granting the particular application before it. No announcement of general licensing policy can relieve the Commission of its statutory obligation to examine each application for a license and determine whether a grant or denial is required by the public interest.\n The Commission recognized this fact in issuing these regulations. It explicitly stated that a determination of the requirements of the public interest will, in spite of the regulations, still have to be made in passing upon particular applications: 'Announcements of policy may take the form of regulations or of general public statements. In either case, the applicant's right to a hearing on the question whether he does in fact propose to operate in the public interest in fully preserved. The regulations we are adopting are nothing more than the expression of the general policy we will follow in exercising our licensing power. The formulation of a regulation in general terms is an important aid to consistency and predictability and does not prejudice any rights of the applicant.' Report on Chain Broadcasting, supra, p. 85.\n Subsequent to the promulgation of the regulations, the Commission found that substantial modifications were necessary. In its supplemental report on these amend- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 433]\n\u00a0\n ments the Commission gave further evidence of the flexible nature of the regulations: 'The Commission stands ready at all times to amend and modify its regulations upon the petition of any network, national or regional, or any station or group of stations if it can be shown that those regulations prevent profitable network operations, or unduly disturb any aspect of broadcasting, or that because of special or changed circumstances the chain broadcasting regulations should not be applicable to any particular situation.' Moreover, in its Minute of October 31, 1941, designed primarily to protect the interests of station licensees who contest the validity of the regulations, the Commission again made it abundantly clear that the regulations were not final: 'If a station wishes to contest the validity of the Chain Broadcasting Regulations ..., or the reasonableness of their application to the particular station, its license will be set for hearing.'\n The regulations do not, therefore, commit the Commission to any definitive course of action in passing upon applications for licenses. Consistently with the regulations (and, parenthetically, consistently with the authority of the Commission to depart from general regulations where such departure is in the public interest, see Federal Radio Commission v. Nelson Bros. B. & M. Co., \n289 \nU.S. 266, 285\n, 53 S.Ct. 627, 636, 89 A.L.R. 406), the Commission is free to dilute them with amendments and exceptions. The construction of the regulations and their application to particular situations is still in the hands of the Commission. Administrative adjudication is still open. Before its completion it is not ripe for judicial review.\n The characteristics of the administrative determinations in all the cases on which the Court's opinion relies were wholly different. In each one the force of the law either through criminal prosecution or injunction or fine or some other judicial remedy could immediately be brought to \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 434]\n\u00a0\n bear to enforce the command of the administrative agency. In none of the cases was an administrative action held reviewable which in itself entailed no immediate legal consequences.\n Thus, in the Assigned Car Cases, \n274 \nU.S. 564\n, 47 S.Ct. 727, suit was brought under the Urgent Deficiencies Act to annul an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission prescribing for all railroads within its jurisdiction a rule governing distribution of cars for the transportation of bituminous coal. Under  402 of the Transportation Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 456, 476, 49 U.S.C.  1(12)(14), 49 U.S.C.A.  1(12, 14), the carriers were required 'to make just and reasonable distribution of cars', and the Commission was authorized to 'establish reasonable rules, regulations, and practices with respect to car service by carriers by railroad'. Failure of a carrier to comply with such regulations issued by the Commission was declared unlawful, subjecting the carrier to a fine of $ 100 for each offense. Since the order of the Commission commanded carriers to take specified actions, and since the failure to comply with the order would bring immediate legal sanctions, the order was held reviewable.\n Similarly, in United States v. Baltimore & O.R. Co., \n293 \nU.S. 454\n, 55 S.Ct. 268, the Interstate Commerce Commission required railroads subject to its jurisdiction to equip locomotives with a suitable type of power-operated reverse gear. The Boiler Inspection Act, 36 Stat. 913, 916, 45 U.S.C.A.  22 et seq., expressly provided that violation by a carrier of any rule or regulation issued by the Commission under the Act was punishable by a fine recoverable in a civil action. A suit under the Urgent Deficiencies Act to set aside the Commission's order was therefore entertained.\n American T. & T. Co. v. United States, \n299 \nU.S. 232\n, 57 S.Ct. 170, was a suit under  402(a) of the Communications Act of 1934, the same provision upon which jurisdiction of the present litigation is based, to set aside an order of the Federal Communications Commission prescribing a uniform system of \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 435]\n\u00a0\n accounts for telephone companies within the Act. Section 220(a) authorized the Commission to prescribe such forms of accounts, and  220(d) made the failure or refusal of a company to keep accounts in the manner prescribed by the Commission unlawful, punishable by a $500 forfeiture for each day of the continuance of the offense. Because of the legal sanctions immediately attaching upon its violation, the order was held reviewable.\n In Interstate Commerce Commission v. Goodrich Transit Co., \n224 \nU.S. 194\n, 32 S.Ct. 436, the Commission, under the authority vested in it by  20 of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  20, issued orders prescribing forms of accounts, records, and memoranda and calling for annual reports of carriers by water. Section 20(7) made it unlawful for such carriers to keep any accounts other than those prescribed by the Commission. A suit to set aside the orders was therefore entertained. Similarly, in Kansas City So. Ry. v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 423\n, 34 S.Ct. 125, 52 L.R.A., N.S., 1, suit was brought to annul regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission prescribing a uniform bookkeeping and accounting system for interstate railway carriers. Since carriers who failed to keep accounts as ordered by the regulations were subject to penalties under  20(7) of the Act, jurisdiction was taken. And in Chicago, R.I. & P. Ry. Co. v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 80\n, 52 S.Ct. 87, the Interstate Commerce Commission prescribed car-hire settlement rules governing use by common carriers of each other's cars. Violation of such rules by carriers was declared unlawful and subject to fines. Consequently, a suit to set aside the rules was entertained.\n Of course, the mere fact that an administrative order determines a status does not mean that it is not reviewable. If an administrative determination of status has the effect of subjecting a person to legal obligations, whether embodied in statute or previously formulated administrative commands, or otherwise affecting legal rights, such a determination possesses the elements of a \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 436]\n\u00a0\n reviewable order. Thus, in Rochester Tel. Corp. v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 125\n, 59 S.Ct. 754, the Federal Communications Commission had issued orders requiring all telephone carriers subject to the Communications Act of 1934 to file schedules of their charges, copies of contracts with other carriers, etc. Section 203(e) of the Act provides that a carrier which fails or refuses to comply with such rules of the Commission shall forfeit $500 for each offense, and $25 for each day of its continuance. After investigation and hearing, the Commission determined that the Rochester Telephone Corporation was a telephone carrier subject to the Act and therefore subject to the previously promulgated general orders directed to carriers within the Commission's jurisdiction. 'The order of the Communications Commission in this case was therefore reviewable. It was not a mere abstract declaration regarding the status of the Rochester under the Communications Act, nor was it a stage in an incomplete process of administrative adjudication. The contested order determining the status of the Rochester necessarily and immediately carried direction of obedience to previously formulated mandatory orders addressed generally to all carriers amenable to the Commission's authority. Into this class of carriers the order under dispute covered the Rochester, and by that fact, in conjunction with the other orders, made determination of the status of the Rochester a reviewable order of the Commission.' Rochester Tel. Corp. v. United States, 307 U.S. at pages 143, 144, 59 S.Ct. at page 764. Compare A.F. of L. v. Labor Board, \n308 \nU.S. 401, 408\n, 60 S.Ct. 300, 303. Unlike the action taken by the Federal Communications Commission in the Rochester case, its action here carried no directions of obedience of any kind to anyone.\n It is said that the regulations derive legal effect through  312(a) giving the Commission authority to revoke licenses, and that 'by virtue of the regulations alone', the networks and their affiliates are now subjected to legal \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 437]\n\u00a0\n detriment. But this is merely another way of phrasing the main contention that the regulations at once and without further action by the Commission release legal sanctions. But the regulations have no such effect. To be sure, the Commission can revoke a station license 'because of conditions revealed by such statements of fact as may be required from time to time which would warrant the Commission in refusing to grant a license on an original application'. But the Commission may never require a licensee to file a statement of fact under  312(a); its provisions may therefore never come into operation. In any event, the regulations as such do not subject licensees to any sanctions. A license can be revoked under  312(a) because of the licensee's failure to operate its station in the public interest, as required by the statute. The regulations adopted by the Commission cannot operate to revoke any licenses. It is only after a proceeding has been started (in which the licensee is entitled to a hearing during which the revocation order is suspended) and adversely concluded against a party that legal sanctions come into play-the Commission can bring proceedings to enforce its order of revocation and, correspondingly, the licensee can bring suit under  402(a) challenging the validity of the Commission's termination of the license.\n Section 502 of the Communications Act provides that the violation of 'any rule, regulation, restriction, or condition made or imposed by the Commission under authority of this Act (chapter)' shall be a criminal offense. Would the renewal by a licensee of its network-affiliation contract subject it to the criminal penalties imposed by  502? Obviously not, for the regulations do not forbid a licensee from taking that or any other action. And, for the same reason, a license could not be revoked under the provision of  312(a) which authorizes revocation 'for violation \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 438]\n\u00a0\n of or failure to observe ... any regulation of the Commission authorized by this Act (chapter) ....' If the Commission had issued regulations which ordered licensees to do or refrain from doing something, the problem would be entirely different. Violation by a licensee of such a regulation would be grounds for revocation of its license, under  312(a), and for the imposition of criminal penalties, under  502. And, the other requisites being present, such a regulation could be reviewed as a final administrative determination.\n This leaves only the suggestion that since the action taken by the Commission, although not the completion of its adjudicatory process, nevertheless drastically affects substantial business interests, it is proper for the courts to intercede at this stage. Even if this argument were to be considered as if it had never before been made to and rejected by this Court, its infirmities are obvious. As a practical matter, the impact upon the business operations of the networks and their affiliated stations would probably be as disturbing as if the policies formulated in the regulations had been expressed through a press release, or if only the report, which is not only the foundation of the regulations but also embodies them, had been published without the regulations which are only the summary of the report, or if Congress itself had incorporated these regulations into the text of the Communications Act. It will hardly be argued that any of these steps could be the subject of judicial review before the Commission acted upon particular applications. But assume that the greater formality given to the announcement of the Commission's statement of policy through the regulations intensified the practical business consequences. Congress has not conferred upon the district courts jurisdiction over 'practical business consequences'. They can review action of administrative \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 439]\n\u00a0\n agencies only when there is an 'order', and when Congress in  402(a) made only an 'order' of the Communications Commission reviewable, it incorporated the settled doctrine established by an unbroken series of decisions in this Court that the courts could review only a final determination by an agency whereby its administrative process has been concluded.\n This is not the first time that the federal courts have been urged to sit in judgment upon 'practical business consequences' where the action to be reviewed did not represent the final stage of administrative adjudication. The arguments made in this case have been made in the past but heretofore have always been rejected by this Court. The classic formulation and application of the doctrine of finality as to orders under the Urgent Deficiencies Act was contained in United States v. Los Angeles & S.L.R.R., \n273 \nU.S. 299\n, 47 S.Ct. 413. In view of the thoroughness of the argument at the bar, and the weightiness of the opinion, that case has ever since been regarded as furnishing the guideposts in this field of law. It should govern here.\n Suit was brought there to annul and enjoin an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission determining the final valuation for rate-making purposes of the Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad Company which operated a thousand miles of railroad lines. The valuation fixed by the Commission was $45,200,000; the carrier claimed that if the Commission had employed proper standards of valuation, the figure would be $70,000,000, a difference of $24,800,000. At the time suit was brought approximately 250, 000 miles of railroad lines throughout the country were undergoing valuation. The validity of the criteria employed by the Commission in the case of the Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad Company was therefore of enormous national significance. In the words of \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 440]\n\u00a0\n Commissioner Eastman, 'This case deals with an issue of greater moment to the country than any that we have ever determined.' 75 I.C.C. 523. These issues, involving practically every phase of valuation law, were canvassed in an adversary proceeding before the Commission lasting nearly a year and a half, resulting in a report of one hundred and forty pages, and expressed in a formal 'order' of ten pages. Counsel for the railroad company there, as do counsel for the broadcasting company here, relied upon the practical finality of the order as a basis for review: 'As a practical matter, the Commission in any and all proceedings in which it has occasion to use this valuation will give it not prima facie but conclusive effect. In the valuation proceeding before the Commission which resulted in this order petitioner introduced its evidence of the value of the properties and the proceeding resulted in a valuation greatly at variance with the evidence and contentions of petitioner. No greater effect will be given to evidence which petitioner may introduce in some future proceeding before the Commission in an attempt to overcome the prima facie effect accorded by the Act to this valuation order. Therefore, unless and until set aside and annulled, this valuation will stand as a continuing menace against petitioner, and may be repeatedly used to petitioner's prejudice in rate, division, consolidation, security-issue and recapture proceedings.' Brief for Appellee, pp. 64, 65.\n The Court specifically referred to this argument of counsel: 'One ( argument in support of jurisdiction) is that since the Commission has by reason of errors of law and of judgment grossly undervalued the property, its report will, unless suppressed, injure the credit of the carrier with the public.' Finding, however, that the order did not finally determine any legal rights, the Court refused review: 'Its (the Commissioner's) conclusions, if erroneous in law, may \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 441]\n\u00a0\n be disregarded. But neither its utterances, nor its processes of reasoning, as distinguished from its acts, are a subject for injunction.' 273 U.S. at pages 314, 315, 47 S.Ct. at page 416.1\n To argue that irreparable injury implies reviewability is in effect to contend that there must be a remedy because the plaintiff claims serious damage. But in these situations-in reviewing 'orders' under the Urgent Deficiencies Act-federal courts can give a remedy only to enforce a legal right, and a legal right cannot be derived merely by concluding that a particular claim of hardship should afford a remedy. While formally we may appear to be dealing with technicalities, behind these considerations lie deep issues of policy in the division of authority as between administrative agencies and courts in carrying out the constitutional will of Congress. The source of the misconception underlying the claim for equitable relief in this case is the assumption that this is merely an ordinary invocation of equity, as though it were a controversy between two litigants of which only the courts are or can be seized. What we are here concerned with is due regard for the proper distribution made by Congress of legal authority as between two law-enforcing agencies of government, the administrative and the judicial. See United States v. Morgan, \n307 \nU.S. 183, 190\n, 191 S., 59 S.Ct. 795, 799; Federal Communications Commission v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., \n309 \nU.S. 134\n, 60 S.Ct. 437. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 442]\n\u00a0\n This case illustrates anew the influence of a particular instance of felt hardship in derailing legal principles from customary tracks. But this is not an isolated case. If threatened damage through general pronouncement of policy for future administrative action, even if cast in the formal language of a regulation, is to give rise to equitable review apart from the rule that judicial review is premature because of want of administrative finality, the same basis of irreparable harm which is here equated to jurisdiction will bear rich litigous fruit in the case of 'regulations' issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission which are damaging in their immediate repercussions to stock exchange and holding companies, or regulations announced by the Treasury for the guidance of taxpayers but which adversely affect business interests, or regulations by the Federal Power Commission, etc. Suppose, for example, that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue issues a ruling that profits derived by radio stations from their network operations are subject to a tax deemed by them onerous and illegal. Could a network successfully bring a suit in equity prior to the imposition of such taxes to invalidate the ruling on the ground that its practical consequence was the cancellation of or refusal to renew network affiliations? One had supposed that the answer was clearly no. But surely in principle the problem is essentially that of the cases before us.\n A final consideration remains. We are not dealing with the reviewability of administrative orders in vacuo. The reviewability of an order of the Federal Communications Commission depends upon the statutory scheme of judicial review embodied in  402 of the Communications Act of 1934. Therefore, even if the regulations could be deemed to possess the essential attributes of a reviewable order, it would not inevitably follow that the order is reviewable in the manner provided for by  402(a) of the Act. The scope and historical background of the provisions for judi- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 443]\n\u00a0\n cial review contained in the Communications Act of 1934 have too recently been canvassed, see Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission, \n316 \nU.S. 4\n, 62 S.Ct. 875, 86 L.Ed. --; Federal Communications Commission v. Columbia Broadcasting System, \n311 \nU.S. 132\n, 61 S.Ct. 152; Federal Communications Commission v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., \n309 \nU.S. 134\n, 60 S.Ct. 437, to require detailed consideration here. Briefly, the Act created two avenues by which orders of the Federal Communications Commission were open to review by the federal courts. Under  402(a), incorporating the provisions of the Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22, 1913, 38 Stat. 208, 219, relating to judicial review of orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission, a suit to enforce, set aside, annul, or suspend an order of the Federal Communications Commission may be brought in a specially constituted district court, with a right of direct appeal to this Court, only if the order does not fall within the exceptions enumerated by  402(b), namely, orders granting or denying applications for station licenses or construction permits and for renewal or modification of licenses. Review of the orders comprehended within  402(b) is available only through an appeal to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, with no right of direct appeal to this Court.\n If the regulations do constitute an order, what kind of an order can it be? It must be in the nature of a blanket denial, operating in futuro, to be sure, of applications for renewal of station licenses. But the Act expressly precludes judicial review of orders denying renewal applications of licensees in any manner other than that prescribed by  402(b), to wit by an appeal to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. As the court below held, the effect of taking jurisdiction in these cases is to substitute a different court and a different procedure for those specified by Congress. This Court has not in the past displayed such an indifference to the particularities \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 444]\n\u00a0\n of legislation defining the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts. On the contrary, only last Term did the Court insist upon strict compliance with the statutory scheme for judicial review established by the Communications Act of 1934. See Federal Communications Commission v. Columbia Broadcasting System, \n311 \nU.S. 132\n, 61 S.Ct. 152.\n Even if we were free to disregard the scheme for judicial review which Congress has established, I could not agree that an appeal under  402(b) would not be an adequate means for testing the claims made in the present litigation. There is essentially only one issue on the merits in this proceeding, namely, whether the adoption by the Commission of the policies expressed in the regulations transgresses its statutory and constitutional authority. But this issue could be raised and fully determined in an appeal under  402(b) from an order denying a renewal application. Indeed, in its Minute of October 31, 1941, the Commission explicitly stated that the validity of the regulations could be put in issue in a renewal proceeding. If anything, therefore, the issues in an appeal under  402(b) would be broader and not narrower than the issues here. Moreover, since the reasonableness of the application of the regulations to the particular situation would also be in issue in the renewal proceeding, the reviewing court would have before it a record containing elements of concreteness and particularity not present in the record now before us.\n The Commission's Minute enables a licensee to contest the validity of the regulations, or the reasonableness of applying them to the particular case, without fear of losing its license. 'In order to insure that the station may remain on the air and be in no way injured by any such Commission proceeding (contesting the validity of the regulations) and appeal to court from a decision in such proceeding, the Commission will grant such licensee a \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 445]\n\u00a0\n temporary extension of its license, with renewals from time to time until there has been a final determination of the issues raised at such hearing. In the event of such litigation, and if the validity of the application of the Chain Broadcasting Regulations to such licensee is sustained by the courts, the Commission will nevertheless grant a regular license to the licensee, otherwise entitled thereto, who has unsuccessfully litigated that issue, if the licensee thereupon conforms to the decisions.'\n Plainly, therefore, a licensee is under no compulsion to cancel or modify its affiliation contract. Licensees who regard the regulations as invalid are free to continue their existing contracts and at the same time challenge the regulations in the orderly manner provided by the Act-and without any danger of losing their right to continue broadcasting. Similarly, the interests of the networks may be protected through intervention in renewal proceedings. Under the Commission's procedure, Rule 1.102 of the Rules of Practice and Procedure, where a renewal application is designated for hearing because of the licensee's contractual arrangements with others, the latter are customarily permitted to intervene. See, for example, Application of E. J. Regan and F. Arthur Bostwick, Docket No. 5788; Application of John H. Stenger, Jr., Docket No. 5430.\n We need go no farther than this litigation to perceive the unfortunate effects of premature judicial review. The chain broadcasting regulations were issued on May 2, 1941, more than a year ago. They were adopted by the Commission as a consequence of its finding, after an investigation lasting more than three years, that certain features of network-affiliation contracts prevented licensees from effectively discharging their obligation to render the fullest service to the listening public. The policy formulated by the Commission may or may not be wise-that is not our concern. But we cannot blink the fact that this litigation has for more than a year pre- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 407, 446]\n\u00a0\n vented the Commission from testing by experience the practical wisdom of a policy found by it to be required by the public interest. The commencement of a proceeding under  402(b) would not have presented the jurisdictional problems present in this proceeding. Surely those desirous of a speedy adjudication of the issue of the validity of the regulations were aware that the commencement of a proceeding under  402(a) would not produce a prompt adjudication on the merits, but that it would instead result in postponing for a considerable period the effective date of the regulations, with all the contingent advantages afforded by such postponement.\n Hardship there may well come through action of an administrative agency. But to slide from recognition of a hardship to assertion of jurisdiction is once more to assume that only the courts are the guardians of the rights and liberties of the people. In denying that it had power to review the action of the Federal Communications Commission because that body had not yet determined a legal right, the court below, as Judge Learned Hand's opinion abundantly proves, was not respecting a rule of etiquette. On the contrary, it merely recognized that the federal courts are entrusted with the correction of administrative errors or wrongdoing only to the extent of Congressional authorization. To say that the courts should reject the doctrine of administrative finality and take jurisdiction whenever action of an administrative agency may seriously affect substantial business interests, regardless of how intermediate or incomplete the action may be, is, in effect, to imply that the protection of legal interests is entrusted solely to the courts. The unbroken current of this Court's decisions in construing the scope of judicial review under the Urgent Deficiencies Act, and which is the only warrant for jurisdiction in this case, repels such a contention. The decision should therefore be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice REED and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS join in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Commission in its Report says, p. 85:\n'We believe that the announcement of the principles we intend to apply in exercising our licensing power will expedite business and further the ends of justice.\n\n'Announcements of policy may take the form of regulations or of general public statements. In either case, the applicant's right to a hearing on the question whether he does in fact propose to operate in the public interest is fully preserved. The regulations we are adopting are nothing more than the expression of the general policy we will follow in exercising our licensing power. The formulation of a regulation in general terms is an important aid to consistency and predictability and does not prejudice any rights of the applicant. Good administrative practice would seem to demand that such a statement of policy or rules and regulations be promulgated wherever sufficient information is available upon which they may be based.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] On October 11, 1941, the Commission amended Regulation 3.34 to make the normal license period two years. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] To the same effect is United States v. Illinois Cent. R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 82\n, 37 S.Ct. 584. There the Interstate Commerce Commission issued an order fixing the time and place for hearing complaints made by various coal companies seeking damages against railroads for failing to supply a sufficient number of coal cars for their shipping needs. The railroads brought suit under the Urgent Deficiencies Act to annul this order, alleging that unless the hearing were restrained, the railroads would be put to enormous expense and inconvenience. The Court held that the notice of hearing 'had no characteristic of an order, affirmative or negative', and since it 'was a mere incident in the proceeding', the suit could not be entertained. 244 U.S. at page 89, 37 S. Ct. at page 587. \n\n\n\n\n","21":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOLUMBIA RIVER PACKERS ASS'N v. HINTON(1942)\nNo. 142\nArgued: Decided: February 2, 1942\n\n\n\n Mr. Jay Bowerman, of Portland, Ore., and Mr. Ralph E. Moody, of Salem, Ore., for petitioner.\n Mr. Ben Anderson, of Portland, Ore.; and Mr. Ralph E. Moody, of Salem, Ore., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner filed a bill for an injunction charging that the respondents attempted to monopolize the fish industry in Oregon, Washington, and Alaska, in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, 26 Stat. 209, 15 U.S.C.A.  1-7, 15 note. The Norris-La- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 143, 144]\n\u00a0\n Guardia Act declares that no federal court shall, except under certain specified circumstances, have jurisdiction to issue an injunction in any case which involves or grows out of a 'labor dispute.' \n1\n The jurisdictional requirements were not present here. But the District Court held that since this case did not involve or grow out of a 'labor dispute', these requirements were irrelevant; and finding that the respondents had violated the Sherman Act to the injury of the petitioner, issued the injunction sought. 34 F.Supp. 970. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that a 'labor dispute' was involved and that the District Court was therefore without jurisdiction to enjoin. 117 F.2d 310. To review this question, we granted certiorari. \n314 \nU.S. 600\n, 62 S.Ct. 123, 86 L.Ed. --.\n The petitioner has plants for proceeding and canning fish in Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. It distributes its products in interstate and foreign commerce. Its supply of fish chiefly depends upon its ability to purchse from independent fishermen. The dispute here arose from a controversy about the terms and conditions under which the respondents would sell fish to the petitioner.\n The respondents are the Pacific Coast Fishermen's Union, its officers and members,2 and two individuals who, like the petitioner, process and sell fish. Although affiliated with the C.I.O., the Union is primarily a fishermen's association, composed of fishermen who conduct their operations in the Pacific Ocean and navigable streams in Washington and Oregon and some of their employees. The fishermen own or lease fishing boats, ranging in value from $100 to $15,000, and carry on their business as inde- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 143, 145]\n\u00a0\n pendent entrepreneurs, uncontrolled by the petitioner or other processors.\n The Union acts as a collective bargaining agency in the sale of fish caught by its members. Its constitution and by-laws provide that 'Union members shall not deliver catches outside of Union agreements', and in its contracts of sale it requires an agreement by the buyer not to purchase fish from nonmembers of the Union. The Union's demand that the petitioner assent to such an agreement precipitated the present controversy. Upon the petitioner's refusal, the Union induced its members to refrain from selling fish to the petitioner, and since the Union's control of the fish supply is extensive, the petitioner was unable to obtain the fish it needed to carry on its business.\n We think that the court below was in error in holding this controversy a 'labor dispute' within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. That a dispute among businessmen over the terms of a contract for the sale of fish is something different from a 'controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment, or concerning the association ... of persons ... seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment' 29 U.S. C.A.  113, calls for no extended discussion. This definition and the stated public policy of the Act-aid to 'the individual unorganized worker ... commonly helpless ... to obtain acceptable terms and conditions of employment' and protection of the worker 'from the interference, restraint, or coercion of employers of labor' 29 U.S.C.A.  102-make it clear that the attention of Congress was focussed upon disputes affecting the employer-employee relationship, and that the Act was not intended to have application to disputes over the sale of commodities. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[315 \nU.S. 143, 146]\n\u00a0\n We recognize that by the terms of the statute there may be a 'labor dispute' where the disputants do not stand in the proximate relation of employer and employee. But the statutory classification,4 however broad, of parties and circumstances to which a 'labor dispute' may \n\n[315 \nU.S. 143, 147]\n\u00a0\n relate does not expand the application of the Act to include controversies upon which the employer-employee relationship has no bearing. Our decisions in New Negro Alliance v. Sanitary Grocery Co., \n303 \nU.S. 552\n, \n304 \nU.S. 542\n, 58 S.Ct. 703, and Milk Wagon Drivers' Union v. Lake Valley Farm Products, Inc., \n311 \nU.S. 91\n, 61 S.Ct. 122, give no support to the respondents' contrary contention, for in both cases the employer-employee relationship was the matrix of the controversy.\n The controversy here is altogether between fish sellers and fish buyers. The sellers are not employees of the petitioners or of any other employer nor do they seek to be. On the contrary, their desire is to continue to operate as independent businessmen, free from such controls as an employer might exercise. That some of the fishermen have a small number of employees of their own, who are also members of the Union, does not alter the situation. For the dispute here, relating solely to the sale of fish, does not place in controversy the wages or hours or other terms and conditions of employment of these employees.\n We are asked to consider other contentions pressed by the respondents which it is said would support the reversal below. But the Circuit Court neither canvassed nor passed upon these contentions. It will be free to do so upon remand.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] '... no court of the United States ... shall have jurisdiction to issue any restraining order or temporary or permanent injunction in a case involving or growing out of a labor dispute, except in a strict conformity with the provisions of this Act (such sections). ...' 47 Stat. 70, 29 U.S.C.A.  101. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Two of the respondents, although members of the Union, are not fishermen.

U S(1942)\nNo. 39\nArgued: Decided: January 5, 1942\n\n\n\n Messrs. Joseph V. McEnery and Thomas J. Clary, both of Philadelphia, Pa., for Continental Casualty Co. et al.\n Mr. Richard H. Demuth, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This certificate brings to this Court from the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit questions concerning \n\n[314 \nU.S. 527, 528]\n\u00a0\n the power of a District Court of the United States to relieve an innocent surety from the penalty of a forfeited recognizance.\n The principal in the recognizance, 'Herbert R. Short, was convicted in the District Court for the District of New Jersey on June 20, 1940, upon two counts of an indictment charging conspiracy and was on that day directed to appear in the court on July 19, 1940, for sentence. On July 19, 1940, Short did not appear in the said court. The court thereupon ordered a bench warrant to issue and ordered the recognizance to be forfeited. Short was apprehended on August 29, 1940. On September 12, 1940, he was brought before the District Court and sentence was then imposed upon him.'\n The surety, Continental Casualty Company, and its indemnitor, Marie M. Short, the wife of the principal, the convicted defendant, filed a joint petition in the District Court within the term at which the order of forfeiture had been entered, praying for remission of the forfeiture. 'The District Court found as a fact that the default of Herbert R. Short, the principal in the recognizance, was willful, and dismissed the petition for remission of the forfeiture upon the ground that it was without power under Section 1020 of the Revised Statutes, 18 U.S.C.  601, (18 U.S.C.A.  601) to grant the petition in view of the willful default of the principal, and that it had no power independently of the statute to entertain the petition.'\n The Court of Appeals being in doubt as to the power of the District Court certified the following questions to this Court for instructions:\n'1. Is Section 1020 of the Revised Statutes (18 U.S.C.  601 (18 U.S. C.A.  601)) the exclusive source of the power of the District Court of the United States at any time to remit the forfeiture of the penalty of a recognizance taken in a criminal cause? \n\n[314 \nU.S. 527, 529]\n\u00a0\n\n'2. Is the word 'party' appearing in the phrase 'willful default of the party' in Section 1020 of the Revised Statutes (18 U.S.C.  601 (18 U. S.C.A.  601)) intended to describe\n\n\n'(a) the person who makes application to the court for the remission of the forfeiture of the penalty, whether that person is the principal or the surety in the recognizance, or\n\n'(b) only the principal in the recognizance?\n\n'3. If the answer to Question 1 is 'No' does the District Court of the United States have common law power to remit the forfeiture of the penalty of a recognizance taken in a criminal cause, where the default of the principal in the recognizance was willful?\n\n'4. If Question 3 is answered and the answer thereto is 'Yes' is the common law power to remit the forfeiture limited to exercise upon an application made within the term of court at which the order of forfeiture was entered?'\n\n The answers depend upon the construction of Section 601 of Title 18 of the United States Code, 18 U.S.C.A.  601, set out below. \n1\n This section assumed its present form in the Revised Statutes  1020, approved June 22, 1874. R.S. Title LXXIV,  5596, repealed all acts mentioned in the revision passed prior to December 1, 1873. The revision substituted the word 'party' for the word 'parties' which was in the earlier act, and by reenactment thus raised the question as to whether the willful default mentioned in both the revision and the former act may be that either of the principal or his bail or whether it is restricted on account of the revision to the principal \n\n[314 \nU.S. 527, 530]\n\u00a0\n only. The provision for remission of forfeitures was first enacted in 1839 as  6 of an 'Act in amendment of the acts respecting the Judicial System of the United States.' 2 The act included various procedural provisions designed to fix practice in the federal courts. The change to the singular in the Revised Statutes was made without any explanation of its purpose and indeed without the brackets or italics used to indicate a repeal or amendment. See Preface, R.S. (2d ed., 1878), p. v. The revised form, however, is to be accepted as correct, notwithstanding a possible discrepancy. R.S.  5596; United States v. Bowen, \n100 \nU.S. 508\n, 513; Bate Refrigerating Co. v. Sulzberger, \n157 \nU.S. 1, 45\n, 15 S.Ct. 508, 519. Cf. U.S.C. (1940 ed.) p LVII,  2(a).\n It appears to us that there can be but one person who can willfully default within the meaning of the section. This is the principal in the recognizance. By its terms he agrees to 'appear for judgment.' When without excuse he fails to appear, there is a willful default. The surety only guarantees that the principal will not default. In a certain sense the surety may default by failure to pay its obligation but this is plainly not the kind of default to which the statute refers. Nor will the possibility of collusion of the surety with the absconding principal permit an interpretation that misconduct on the part of the applicant for relief from forfeiture is the 'default' meant by the statute. The condition of the bond is the appearance of the principal at the time set. Nothing less satisfies the condition.\n The appellants urge against this conclusion that since the object of 'a recognizance is not to enrich the treasury' but to promote convenience of criminal administration, United States v. Feely, Fed.Cas.No. 15,082, and to remedy hardships caused by defaults, the word 'party' should be liberally construed to cover not only principals but sure- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 527, 531]\n\u00a0\n ties, without willful default, even though the principal may have deliberately violated the terms of the recognizance. They further point out that justice suffers no affront since surrender of the fugitive in time for trial is another and an essential condition of the remission of the penalty.\n But the considerations of policy are too confused to afford a clear test of Congressional purpose. Paid sureties are often, as here, indemnified. Remission of penalty would inure to the benefit of defendants, who had violated their undertakings of appearance with consequent disorganization of criminal administration. A bail charged with custody of a defendant, Taylor v. Taintor, 16 Wall. 366, 371, may exercise to the substantial benefit of criminal administration a high degree of care to prevent default, if he knows the later fortuitous apprehension of the principal will not relieve him of the forfeit. It is not for courts to say whether strict forfeiture on willful default or a generous attitude toward innocent bail will be most conductive to the public welfare. Hence, not for reasons of policy, but because of the language of the statute, we conclude that Congress has chosen the former.\n After the change to 'party,' with exceptions in the District Courts,3 all the Circuits except the First4 and Tenth have reached out conclusion, to wit, that the statute requires as a condition to the remission of the penalty a determination that the principal in the recognizance is free of willful default. \n5\n No Circuit has decided to the contrary. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 527, 532]\n\u00a0\n Since there is no doubt as to the willful default of the principal, under the interpretation of the statute just reached, relief, if any there is for the bail, must be in other sources of judicial power as suggested in Questions 1 and 3 of the certificate. That is to say that in addition to the statutory power the courts have a common law power to remit forfeitures in their discretion. United States v. Feely, C.C.1815, Fed.Cas. No.15,082, 1 Brock. 255, is relied upon as authority. In that case, decided before the statute, Chief Justice Marshall exercised the power and stayed proceedings. Appellant urges that forfeiture is a judgment within the power of courts to modify on application made as here during the term and that this power is not affected by the statute which was intended to extend the power to remission after the term in which forfeiture was entered.\n No authority, historical or judicial is cited by appellant to support its view that the purpose of the Act of February 28, 1839, was to confer power upon the courts of the United States to act after the term in which the forfeiture was entered in contradistinction to power already existing to relieve from forfeitures during the term. We see \n\n[314 \nU.S. 527, 533]\n\u00a0\n nothing in the act itself to persuade us that the generality of the words 'whenever it appears to the court' means after the term in which the forfeiture was entered. Such a desire on the part of Congress to extend the power of the courts would be manifested by the language of extension under than differentiation. If the reason was as appellant contends, why qualify the discretion after the term by the conditions of the statute and leave the discretion during the term unqualified?\n Whatever may have been the powers of the courts of the United States before the statute, those powers are now regulated by statute. Cf. United States v. Mack, \n295 \nU.S. 480, 488\n, 55 S.Ct. 813, 817. These statutory powers are exclusive. Before remission may be allowed there must be a determination of lack of wilfulness in the default, that a trial can be had, and that public justice does not otherwise require the enforcement of the penalty. The statement of the conditions negatives action without the satisfaction of those requirements. Generally speaking a 'legislative affirmative description' implies denial of the nondescribed powers. Durousseau v. United States, 6 Cranch 307, 314. The circumstances of this inquiry carry us beyond the rule of expressio unius est exclusio alterius, cf. Ford v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 593, 611\n, 47 S. Ct. 531, 537, and into the domain of inconsistency of purpose. Cf. Texas & Pac. Ry. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426\n, 436 et seq., 27 S.Ct. 350, 353, 9 Ann.Cas. 1075. There cannot logically be two series of tests to determine the power of a federal court to relieve of forfeiture under a recognizance. The conditions for action make action without meeting the conditions, we think, contrary to Congressional purpose, as expressed in the statute. Since the passage of the original statute on remission of forfeitures, the courts of the United States have, in general, held the same view that the statutory power was exclusive. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[314 \nU.S. 527, 534]\n\u00a0\n Our answer to Question 1 is 'Yes'.

Frey, both of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioners.\n Mr. Hale Houts, of Kansas City, Mo., for respondents. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 631, 632]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BYRNES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In the District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri respondents brought this suit to recover certain freight charges from petitioners. The case was tried without a jury and judgment rendered in favor of respondents in the sum of $2,263.47. On appeal, the judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, 121 F.2d 645.\n We brought the case here because of the claim that the courts below sustained the jurisdiction of the District Court although the matter concerned called for the exercise of the administrative discretion of the Interstate Commerce Commission, under the established rule first announced in Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426\n, 27 S. Ct. 350, 9 Ann.Cas. 1075, as explained in Great N. Ry. v. Merchants' Elev. Co., \n259 \nU.S. 285\n, 42 S.Ct. 477.\n The shipments, amounting to seven car loads, moved from points in several states, the cars being billed by petitioners to themselves at St. Louis, Missouri. The petitioners billed the contents of the cars as scrap iron and paid the tariff charge applicable to that classification. When the cars arrived at St. Louis, the respondents caused the Western Weighing and Inspection Bureau to inspect their contents. As a result of that inspection, respondents claimed that the articles were actually 'pipe thread protecting rings' and that they belonged in the classification of 'pipe fittings'. The tariff rates on pipe fittings being higher than the rate on scrap iron, demand was made upon petitioners for the difference in freight charges. The demand was refused and this suit followed.\n The trial court found that the articles in question were governed by the tariff for 'pipe-fittings' and not by that for 'scrap-iron'. The Circuit Court of Appeals sustained this finding. In the light of certain proceedings \n\n[315 \nU.S. 631, 633]\n\u00a0\n before the Interstate Commerce Commission affecting the articles in question and their relation to the tariffs in controversy, we hold that the lower courts were right.\n The only questions of any moment presented by this case arise in connection with these proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission. In 1937 petitioners filed with the Commission a complaint against a number of railroads in which they asserted that certain shipments of iron or steel pipe thread protecting rings should have been classified under the freight tariffs as scrap iron or steel and not as pipe fittings. They also urged as an alternative contention that even though the shipments were classed as pipe fittings rather than scrap, the rate was unreasonably high. On August 6, 1937 the Commission dismissed the complaint, holding both that the pipe thread protecting rings fell within the classification of pipe fittings and that the rates so imposed were not unreasonable. Crancer and Fleischman et al. v. Abilene & Southern Railway Company et al., 223 I.C.C. 375.\n In their answer and in a motion to stay proceedings filed in the District Court in the present case, petitioners asserted that on or about March 16, 1939 (the date on which respondents brought this suit) they had instituted a second action before the Commission. In their complaint in this 1939 action, petitioners alleged that the freight charges demanded by the respondents on the shipments involved in the suit now before us were 'unjust and unreasonable ... to the extent that they exceeded or exceed rates applicable on scrap iron and scrap steel'. It is not clear from this language whether petitioners intended to raise anew the question of classification or whether they were simply requesting the Commission to pass again on the reasonableness of the rate. But in its opinion dated February 18, 1941 the Commission stated: 'While com- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 631, 634]\n\u00a0\n plainants admit for the purpose of this proceeding that the rates on scrap iron are not applicable, they contend that reasonable rates on thread protectors should bear some definite relation to the scrap-iron rates.' Valley Steel Products Company et al. v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company et al., 243 I.C.C. 509, 512. We conclude that the classification question is not involved in the 1939 I.C.C. proceeding. This proceeding is still pending. The effective date of the February 18, 1941 opinion and order has been indefinitely postponed, a further hearing has been held, but no subsequent opinion or order has been issued. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Petitioners raise two contentions with respect to these I.C.C. proceedings and their bearing upon the present suit. First, they contend that it was reversible error for the District Court to admit in evidence a copy of the 1937 opinion of the Commission. At the trial, petitioners objected to its admission on the ground that the opinion has 'absolutely no probative value in this case at all,' that it is not 'determinative' or 'conclusive' and 'not even persuasive' in this case, and that there was no pleading that 'this opinion ... is res adjudicata of the issues before your Honor.' With respect to this point we can only say that petitioners have made a bold attempt to transform their weakness into strength. The present case turns upon whether these iron pipe thread protecting rings are to be classified under the freight tariffs as pipe fittings or scrap. That was the very question decided by the Commission in its 1937 opinion, and it was decided adversely to petitioners. It is true that the shipments in the two cases are not the same and that no evidence was introduced to prove that their contents were identical. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 631, 635]\n\u00a0\n Consequently, the issues in the present suit are not res adjudicata. But the Commission's 1937 opinion could hardly have been more relevant to the question before the District Court. As the Circuit Court observed: 'Since the case was tried without a jury, we can see no possible prejudice to appellants by the consideration of the opinion of the Commission by the Court as evidence, rather than by an examination of the same opinion in his library. There is no suggestion that the latter course would have been improper. The trial court did not treat the opinion as being res adjudicata.' 121 F.2d 645, 650. We think this is the least that could be said, and that the District Court properly admitted and considered the administrative determination of virtually the same question as that before it.\n Second, petitioners contend that the District Court erred in denying their motion to stay proceedings in this case pending action by the I.C.C. in the second proceeding before the Commission. As we have said, the classification question alone was involved in the case before the District Court. The Commission had passed upon that question almost two years earlier. In their newly instituted proceeding, petitioners did not resurrect that dispute but confined themselves to the contention that the rates on pipe fittings were unreasonable as applied to their pipe thread protecting rings. The issue of the reasonableness of the rates was not open to the District Court. The meaning of the tariff had been determined by the Commission. It remained to the railroad only to collect the rates for which the tariff called and for the District Court only to see that the railroad did collect them. 'Until changed, tariffs bind both carriers and shippers with the force of law. Under Section 6 of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C.A.  6) the carrier cannot deviate from the rate specified in the tariff for any service in connection \n\n[315 \nU.S. 631, 636]\n\u00a0\n with the transportation of property. That section forbids the carrier from giving a voluntary rebate in any shape or form. This Court has had occasion recently to sustain action of the Commission aimed at carriers' practices resulting in collection of less than the tariff rate. It is equally important to aid the efforts of a carrier in collecting published charges in full. Involuntary rebates from tariff rates should be viewed with the same disapproval as voluntary rebates.' Lowden v. Simonds-Shields- Lonsdale Grain Co., \n306 \nU.S. 516, 520\n, 521 S., 59 S.Ct. 612, 614. Nothing involved in the pending administrative proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission was essential to the determination of the issue in this suit. If the trial judge had in the exercise of his discretion continued the trial of the cause until such time as the Commission had passed upon the reasonableness of the rate, the delay might have made it impossible for the carrier to produce the witnesses who had made the inspection of the shipments. On the other hand, the petitioners suffered no hardship as a result of the trial court's insistence on proceeding with the trial. If petitioners pay the judgment in this case and the Commission should in the still pending proceeding decide to modify the tariffs, petitioners can obtain a complete remedy by way of reparation.

Hartel and Leopold Stahl, both of New Orleans, La., and James V. Hayes, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Warner W. Gardner, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Of the several questions raised by this record only one requires our attention: Whether under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 52 Stat. 1060, 29 U. S.C.  201, et seq., 29 U.S.C.A.  201 et seq., the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor has authority to delegate his statutory power to sign and issue a subpoena duces tecum.\n On application of respondent, pursuant to  9 of the Act, the District Court for Eastern Louisiana ordered petitioner to show cause why it should not be compelled to obey a subpoena duces tecum. The subpoena, issued by a regional director of the Wage and Hour Division, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 357, 359]\n\u00a0\n commanded the production at New Orleans, Louisiana, before a specified officer of the Division, of all books, papers, and records showing for a period of eighteen months after the effective date of the Wage and Hour provisions of the Act the hours worked by employees each working day and each working week, all wages paid, all purchases made and shipments received, and all goods sold, shipped, delivered, transported, or offered for sale at petitioner's Shreveport, Louisiana plant.\n The District Court denied petitioner's motion to dismiss the proceeding for want of jurisdiction, and ordered it to produce the demanded books, papers, and records relating to wages and hours, but left undecided, until again presented to the court in the course of investigation, the further question whether the books and records relating to purchases and shipments specified in the subpoena should be produced. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, Cudahy Packing Co. v. Fleming, 119 F.2d 209, specifically ruling that the subpoena was validly issued and that the court had jurisdiction to enforce it. We granted certiorari, \n314 \nU.S. 592\n, 62 S.Ct. 87, 86 L.Ed. --, on a petition which presented as a ground for reversal the want of authority in the regional director to issue the subpoena and, as a reason for allowing the writ, the conflict on this point of the decision below with that of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Lowell Sun Co. v. Fleming, 120 F. 2d 213, certiorari granted, \n314 \nU.S. 599\n, 62 S.Ct. 112, 86 L.Ed. --.\n By  11 of the Act the Administrator and his designated representatives are authorized to conduct investigations which he may deem necessary 'to determine whether any person has violated any provision of the Act (sections 201-219 of this title), or which may aid in the enforcement of the provisions of this Act (sections 201-219 of this title).' The Act does not define the Administrator's power to issue subpoenas or specifically authorize him to delegate it to others. But for the purposes of any hearing or investigation,  9 of the Act makes applicable to the powers and \n\n[315 \nU.S. 357, 360]\n\u00a0\n duties of the Administrator, the Chief of the Children's Bureau,1 and the industry committees,2 the subpoena provisions of  9 and 10 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. 15 U.S.C.  49 and 50, 15 U.S.C.A.  49, 50. The Administrator is thus given all the powers with respect to subpoenas which are conferred upon the Federal Trade Commission, and no more. Under  9 of the Trade Commission Act the Commission may require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, and production of documents by subpoena; and any members of the Commission may sign the subpoenas. The Commission may apply to any district court within whose jurisdiction an investigation is carried on for an order compelling compliance with a subpoena.\n The Administrator argues that he is given authority to delegate to regional directors the signing and issuance of subpoenas by  4(c) of the present Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  204(c), and that in any case this authority is to be implied from the structure of the Act and the nature of the duties which are imposed upon him. Section 4(c) provides: 'The principal office of the Administrator shall be in the District of Columbia, but he or his duly authorized representative may exercise any or all of his powers in any place'. On its face this seems no more than a definition of the geographical or territorial jurisdiction of the Administrator and his representatives. The designation of the District of Columbia as the location of the Administrator's principal office is qualified by the provision that either the Administrator or his representative may exercise 'his powers' in 'any place'. Only if such is its meaning does  4(c) comport with the structure and related provisions of the Act. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 357, 361]\n\u00a0\n If, as the Administrator contends, the section is to be read as authorizing delegation of the subpoena power, that authority is without limitation. He may confer the power on any employee appointed under  4(b), whom 'he deems necessary to carry out his functions and duties', or even on those who render the voluntary and uncompensated service which he may accept under that section. Moreover, if so read,  4(c) likewise gives the Administrator unrestricted authority to delegate every other power which he possesses, and would render meaningless and unnecessary the provisions of  11 authorizing the Administrator to delegate his power of investigation to designated representatives.\n If such is the meaning of the Act he could delegate at will his duty to report periodically to Congress,  4(d), to appoint industry committees and their chairmen, to fix their compensation and prescribe their procedure,  5, to approve or disapprove their reports by orders whose findings of fact, if supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive,  10, to define certain terms used in the Act,  13, to provide by regulations or orders for the employment of learners and handicapped workers,  14, as well as other duties. A construction of the Act which would thus permit the Administrator to delegate all his duties, including those involving administrative judgment and discretion which the Act has in terms given only to him, can hardly be accepted unless plainly required by its words.\n The Administrator seeks to meet this difficulty by construing  4(c) as authorizing the delegation of some but not all of his administrative functions. But we cannot read 'any or all' as meaning 'some'. And in any case if only some functions can be delegated, we are afforded no legislative guide for determining which may and which may not be delegated. We think that the words of the section, read in their statutory setting, make it reasonably \n\n[315 \nU.S. 357, 362]\n\u00a0\n plain that its only function is to provide that the Administrator and his representatives may exercise either within or without the District of Columbia such powers as each possesses. This construction is fully supported by the legislative history of  4(c).3 \n\n[315 \nU.S. 357, 363]\n\u00a0\n The Administrator also urges that his authority to delegate the subpoena power is to be inferred from the nature of his duties and from the fact that under  11 he may through designated representatives gather data and make investigations authorized by the Act. He points to the wide range of duties imposed upon him, the vast extent of his territorial jurisdiction, and the large number of investigations required for the enforcement of the Act. From this he argues that Congress must have intended that he should be permitted to delegate his authority to sign and issue subpoenas. But this argument loses force when examined in the light of related provisions of the Act and of the actual course of Congressional legislation in this field.\n Unlimited authority of an administrative officer to delegate the exercise of the subpoena power is not lightly to be inferred. It is a power capable of oppressive use, especially when it may be indiscriminately delegated and the subpoena is not returnable before a judicial officer. Under the present Act, the subpoena may, as in this case, be used to compel production at a distant place of practically all of the books and records of a manufacturing business, covering considerable periods of time. True, there can be no penalty incurred for contempt before there is a judicial order of enforcement. But the subpoena is in form an official command, and even though improvidently issued it has some coercive tendency, either because of ignorance of their rights on the part of those whom it purports to command or their natural respect for \n\n[315 \nU.S. 357, 364]\n\u00a0\n what appears to be an official command, or because of their reluctance to test the subpoena's validity by litigation. All these are cogent reasons for inferring an intention of Congress not to give unrestricted authority to delegate the subpoena power which it has in terms granted only to the responsible head of the agency.\n The subpoena power differs materially in these respects from the power to gather data and make investigations which is expressly made delegable by  11. Without the subpoena that power is in effect a power of inspection at the employer's place of business to be exercised only on his consent. It is much less burdensome than the requirement of his selection f great numbers of books and papers and their production at other places. Because of these differences it seems to us fairly inferable that the grant of authority to delegate the power of inspection and the omission of authority to delegate the subpoena power shows a legislative intention to withhold the latter. Moreover, if a subpoena power in the regional directors were to be implied from their delegated authority to investigate, we should have to say that Congress had no occasion expressly to grant the subpoena power to the Administrator, who also has the power to investigate, and that the grant to him was superfluous and without meaning or purpose.\n The entire history of the legislation controlling the use of subpoenas by administrative officers indicates a Congressional purpose not to authorize by implication the delegation of the subpoena power. The Interstate Commerce Act, 4 the National Labor Relations Act,5 and the Federal Trade Commission Act,6 whose subpoena provisions were adopted by the present Act and by the Pack- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 357, 365]\n\u00a0\n ers and Stockyards Act,7 all fail to grant authority to delegate the issuance of subpoenas. It appears that none of the agencies administering these acts, has construed the authority of its head to include the power to delegate the signing and issuance of subpoenas. \n8\n On the other hand, Congress, in numerous cases, has specifically authorized delegation of the subpoena power. \n9\n In others it has granted the power to particularly designated subordinate officers or agents, thus negativing any implied power in the head to delegate generally to subordinates. \n10\n The \n\n[315 \nU.S. 357, 366]\n\u00a0\n suggestion that the Administrator is given authority to delegate the subpoena power because the applicable Trade Commission Act authorizes individual members of the Commission as well as the Commission itself to sign subpoenas overlooks the fact that the Administrator alone occupies a position under this Act corresponding to that of the Commissioners under their Act. The structure of the Trade Commission Act lends no support to the view that the Administrator has an implied power to delegate the signing and issuance of subpoenas to persons undesignated by the statute, a power not granted to or exercised by the Commission or its members.\n All this is persuasive of a Congressional purpose that the subpoena power shall be delegable only when an authority to delegate is expressly granted. That purpose has been emphasized here not only by the authority expressly given to delegate the power to conduct investigations, and in the adoption by reference of the subpoena provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which contain no authority to delegate, but by the legislative history of the present Act, which shows that the authority to delegate the subpoena power was eliminated by the Conference Committee from the bills which each House had adopted. \n13\n Such authority expressly granted in the bill which passed the Senate, was rejected by the Conference Committee. It also discarded the provisions of the House bill which committed the administration of the Act to the Secretary of Labor, who has a general power of delegation under Rev.Stat.  161, 5 U.S.C.  22, 5 U.S.C.A.  22 and placed in his stead the Administrator, who was given only the subpoena powers of the Federal Trade Commission incorporated in the House bill. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 357, 367]\n\u00a0\n We cannot assume that Congress was of the opinion that the present agency, when appropriately organized for the purpose, would be any the less able to function without the power in the Administrator to delegate the signing and issuance of subpoenas than the Federal Trade Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission, and other agencies which have not been given and do not assert the power. Nor can we assume, as the Government argues, that Congress is wholly without design in withholding the power in this case and granting it in others, or even if it had been, that it is any part of the judicial function to restore to the Act what Congress has taken out of it. Even though Congress has underestimated the burden which it has placed upon the Administrator, which is by no means clear, we think that the legislative record establishes that Congress has withheld from him authority to delegate the exercise of the subpoena power, and that this precludes our restoring it by construction.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS dissenting.\n We have here the narrow but important question as to the power of the Administrator to delegate his power to issue a subpoena. That problem does not involve questions as to the scope of the subpoena issued or the fact that it required documents in Shreveport to be produced at New Orleans. Statements in the opinion of the Court as to the 'oppressive use' of the subpoena introduce issues wholly irrelevant to the single question before us. Those issues would not be changed one iota had the Administrator himself signed this subpoena. And if the policy underlying the opinion is a desire to see a more restrictive and discriminating use of the subpoena power, the requirement that the Administrator alone exercise the power seems idle. For his duties under this Act are \n\n[315 \nU.S. 357, 368]\n\u00a0\n manifold and far flung. The Act extends to thousands upon thousands of persons and businesses. It is estimated that the Act covers 15,500,000 persons employed by more than 360,000 employers in 48 States, the District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The Administrator has 13 regional directors and one territorial representative. He has about 2200 employees. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1941, there were 41,399 complaints received, 48,449 plant inspections made, 1, 749 cases litigated, 6000 subpoenas issued.\n The problem of enforcement is intricate and exacting. If the Administrator must issue subpoenas, it seems hardly likely that he can do anything but sign them in blank. If he tried to do anything but formulate the general policy to govern the exercise of the subpoena power, he could perform little more than ministerial acts. Certainly he cannot be expected to relieve his regional offices of all questions as to where hearings shall be held, what documents are necessary for a hearing, what asserted violations should be investigated, which employer will make full and free disclosure, which will act only under the conpulsion of a subpoena, and similar minutiae of daily administration. The Administrator in Washington can hardly exercise an independent judgment as to what the range or course of a particular investigation should be in remote Alaska or Puerto Rico. At least he cannot do so unless the processes of law enforcement are to come to a standstill. Yet those matters control the nature, scope and content of subpoenas issued. Such functions must of necessity rest largely with the investigating and enforcement representatives of this kind of an administrative agency.\n It would seem that his functions in this regard must of necessity largely lie in the formulation of a general policy which is to govern the exercise of the subpoena power. He has formulated that policy. The instructions to his \n\n[315 \nU.S. 357, 369]\n\u00a0\n subordinates direct a discriminating and sparing use of the subpoena power, 1 a restriction of the scope2 of subpoenas duces tecum, and a regard for the convenience of those whose records are sought. \n3\n Delegation is a matter of degree. An authority need not be delegated completely or not at all. It is sufficient that the administrative officer supervise and direct the execution of his duties. So far as the subpoena power is concerned, it would seem that the Administrator has satisfied all statutory demands in this situation by his selection of the limited group which can issue subpoenas, by formulating the policy to guide them, and by ratifying a subpoena issued by his subordinate.\n We need not, however, rest on that alone. The subpoena power is the concomitant of the power to investigate. Congress has specifically provided that the power to make and conduct investigations may be delegated. Sec. 11(a), 29 U.S.C.A.  211(a), provides in part: \n\n[315 \nU.S. 357, 370]\n\u00a0\n 'The Administrator or his designated representatives may investigate and gather data regarding the wages, hours, and other conditions and practices of employment in any industry subject to this Act (sections 201- 219 of this title), and may enter and inspect such places and such records ( and make such transcriptions thereof), question such employees, and investigate such facts, conditions, practices, or matters as he may deem necessary or appropriate to determine whether any person has violated any provision of this Act (sections 201-219 of this title), or which may aid in the enforcement of the provisions of this Act (sections 201-219 of this title).'\n But now we are told that that power when delegated is only a power to be exercised with the employer's consent; that if resistance is encountered, the only one who can sign the subpoena to obtain that data is the Administrator. The power to delegate the authority to make investigations is certainly the greater of the two powers. In fact, the decision to make the investigation is the significant and controlling one. Once that is made, the decision to issue a subpoena under this Act must rest with the regional offices if it is to be an informed one. Without the subpoena power the power to investigate will often be an empty one.\n Hence, in view of the nature of the Administrator's functions and the fact that the power to make investigations can be delegated, the lesser but companion power to delegate the issue of subpoenas should be implied as an incident of the office.\n A subpoena of course exerts a coercive influence. So does an investigation. So does all law enforcement. And any power, including the judicial power, may be abused. But as I have said, we have here no question of abuse of power. We cannot assume that the Administrator would haul a business into court where the representative of the Administrator abused the subpoena power. At least we should assume that where the Administrator \n\n[315 \nU.S. 357, 371]\n\u00a0\n seeks enforcement of the subpoena and stands behind his subordinate who has issued the subpoena, the subpoena is as much the Administrator's as if he had signed it. Cf. Norris v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 77, 82\n, 42 S.Ct. 9, 11.\n The reasons for holding that authority to delegate this power is an incident of the office are certainly no less cogent than those underlying the cases which hold that an administrative officer may delegate the function of holding hearings without express statutory authority. As stated by Chief Justice Hughes in Morgan v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 468, 481\n, 56 S.Ct. 906, 912, 'Assistants may prosecute inquiries. Evidence may be taken by an examiner.' Such a delegation has been approved under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Southern Garment Mfrs. Ass'n v. Fleming, App.D.C., 122 F.2d 622. Can it be that the power to hold hearings and take evidence is so unimportant as compared with the power to sign subpoenas that the power to delegate the one but not the other can be implied? Can it be that the requirements of 'practicable administrative procedure' (Morgan v. United States, supra, 298 U.S. page 481, 56 S.Ct. page 912) are relevant and controlling in the one instance but not in the other? Both the power to conduct hearings and the power to issue subpoenas are intermediate steps in administrative procedure. The findings of the examiner are advisory only; this kind of subpoena is a command without legal sanction unless supported by a court decree. But the function of the examiner is not simply ministerial. The role which he fills is significant. The very essence of a fair hearing may depend on his conduct. If that function may be delegated without express statutory authority, it should follow a fortiori that the lesser subpoena power may also be delegated by reason of the requirements of 'practicable administrative procedure.'\n The legislative history of this Act does not stand in the way. There is no indication whatsoever that the choice of the House bill as against the Senate bill was in any \n\n[315 \nU.S. 357, 372]\n\u00a0\n way influenced by the presence in the latter of an express power of the proposed Board to delegate its subpoena power. The controversy centered on the question as to where administration of the Act should be lodged. See H. Rep. No. 1452, 75th Cong., 1st Sess.; H.Rep. No. 2182, 75th Cong., 3d Sess .; S.Rep. No. 884, 75th Cong., 1st Sess. As a matter of fact, if we are to speculate as to the intent of Congress on this point we must assume that all delegation of the subpoena power was not precluded. The provisions of  9 and 10 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  49, 50, were 'made applicable to the jurisdiction, powers, and duties of the Administrator'.  9, 29 U.S.C.A.  209. The Federal Trade Commission Act lodges the subpoena power in the Commission.  9. But it also provides that any member of the Commission may sign subpoenas.  9. If the Commission has a limited power of delegation, it is hard to see why the Administrator has none. Logical difficulties prevent literal incorporation of the whole of  9 into the Fair Labor Standards Act. But it certainly is impossible to deduce that a more stringent rule governs the Administrator than the Commission.\n Nor can it be inferred that because Congress has expressly granted delegation of the subpoena power under some statutes but not under others that the power may not be implied. The omission of that power in a particular statute may be an historical accident or a matter of design. Whether or not the power can fairly be implied as an incident of a particular office must depend on the nature of that office, the other statutory provisions which govern it, and the legislative history of its creation. The farthest we need go here is to say that where the legislative history is inconclusive the power to delegate is not necessarily precluded.\n A requirement that the Administrator himself exercise the subpoena power at this stage of the enforcement of \n\n[315 \nU.S. 357, 373]\n\u00a0\n the law may well retard the social and economic program which the Act inaugurated. We should be alert to prevent sheer technicalities from interposing delay in a law enforcement program. If the subpoena power is abused, Congress and the courts are open to remedy it. Meanwhile the subpoena power should be treated sympathetically and regarded as a necessary legal sanction to obtain compliance with the law by those who, having lost the battle in the legislature, seek a delaying action in the courts.\n I am authorized to state that Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice BYRNES, and Mr. Justice JACKSON, join in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Chief of the Children's Bureau administers the child labor provisions of the Act. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The function of the industry committees and their relation to the Administrator are discussed in Opp Cotton Mills v. Administrator, \n312 \nU.S. 126\n, 61 S.Ct. 524. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] S. 2475, passed by the Senate on July 31, 1937, (81 Cong.Rec. 7957), and sent to the Conference Committee, provided for a Labor Standards Board, and contained  3(e), which read: 'The principal office of the Board shall be in the District of Columbia, but it may meet or exercise any or all of its powers at any other place'. Section 12(b) of this bill also specifically authorized the Board to delegate its subpoena power. The House Committee on Labor, to which the Senate bill was referred, amended it to provide for an Administrator instead of a Board (see 82 Cong.Rec. 1391), but it included a  3(d) corresponding to  3(e) of the Senate bill, save for the substitution of the Administrator for the Board. Section 11(b) of the bill sponsored by the House Committee also authorized any employee designated by the Administrator to subpoena witnesses. This bill, however, was recommitted to the Committee by the House on December 17, 1937, (82 Cong.Rec. 1835), and the Committee reported out a new bill on April 21, 1938, (83 Cong.Rec. 5680) which placed the administration in charge of the Secretary of Labor rather than an Administrator, contained no section comparable to  3(e) of the Senate bill or  3(d) of the recommitted House bill, and in  7 applied  9 and 10 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to the powers and duties of the Secretary. The bill with these changes passed the House on May 24, 1938 (83 Cong.Rec. 7449) and went to the Conference Committee.\n The Conference put the Administrator rather than the Secretary in charge of Administering the Act, and included the present  4(c). The Conference also retained the House bill's adoption by reference of  9 and 10 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, but extended their operation to investigations as well as hearings, and made them applicable to the powers and duties of the Administrator, the Chief of the Children's Bureau, and the industry committees. 83 Cong.Rec. 9247-8.\n The inclusion of  4(c), closely resembling  3(e) of the Senate bill and  3(d) of the recommitted House bill, both of which gave separate specific authority to delegate the subpoena power, indicates that the purpose of the conference, and of Congress in adopting the Act, was not to grant a general substantive power of delegation, including that over subpoenas, but to define the places where powers otherwise granted should be exercised. The addition in  4(c) of the phrase 'or his designated representative', the equivalent of which did not appear in either the House or Senate bills, must be taken merely as recognizing that the Administrator or his subordinates could exercise elsewhere than in the District of Columbia the powers which each had under other provisions of the Act. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 25 Stat. 858, 859, 49 U.S.C.  12, 49 U.S.C.A.  12. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] 49 Stat. 456, 29 U.S.C.  161(1), 29 U.S.C.A.  161(1). \n[\nFootnote 6\n] 38 Stat. 722, 15 U.S.C.  49, 15 U.S.C.A.  49. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] 42 Stat. 168, 7 U.S.C.  222, 7 U.S.C.A.  222. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] See Monograph of the Attorney General's Committee on Administrative Procedure, Part 11, Interstate Commerce Commission, Sen.Doc.

Apparently the actual issuance of subpoenas, though not their signing, is delegated to subordinates in some of these agencies. We are not concerned here with the validity of such a practice, since both the signing and issuance of subpoenas is delegated by the Administrator. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] Veterans Administration Act, 49 Stat. 2033, 38 U.S.C.  131, 38 U.S. C.A.  131; Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, 52 Stat. 1107, as amended, 45 U.S.C.  362(a)(m), 45 U.S.C.A.  362 (a, m); Walsh-Healey (Public Contracts) Act, 49 Stat. 2038, 41 U.S.C.  39, 41 U.S.C.A.  39; Merchant Marine Act, 52 Stat. 954, 46 U.S.C.  1124(a), 46 U.S.C.A.  1124(a); Federal Power Act, 49 Stat. 857, 16 U.S.C.  825f(b), 16 U.S.C.A.  825f(b ); Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 85, 15 U.S.C.  77s(b), 15 U.S.C.A.  77s(b); Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 900, 15 U.S.C.  78u(b), 15 U.S.C.A.  78u(b); Public Utility Holding Company Act, 49 Stat. 831, 15 U.S.C.  79r(c), 15 U.S.C.A.  79r(c). \n[\nFootnote 10\n] Communications Act, 48 Stat. 1096, 47 U.S.C.  409, 47 U.S.C.A.  409; Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation Act, 49 Stat. 1382, 46 U.S. C.  239(e), 46 U.S.C.A.  239(e); Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 1021, 49 U.S.C.  644, 49 U.S.C.A.  644; Motor Carrier Act, 49 Stat. 549, 49 U.S.C.  305(d), 49 U.S.C.A.  305(d); Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Comp.Act, 44 Stat. 1438, 33 U.S.C.  927, 33 U.S.C.A.  927.\n The grant of the subpoena power by the Fair Labor Standards Act to the Chief of the Children's Bureau and to the industry committees is not of this class, however, since they perform functions which the Administrator does not control and could not exercise himself. In these respects they occupy an independent status under the Act. \n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] See note 3, supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Administrator's Confidential Manual provides:\n'The use of subpoenas should be restricted entirely to cases where difficulties have been met with in the course of inspection. If the evidence or documents sought have been refused or if the witnesses from whom information is requested refuse to be frank or require protection from coercion by their employer, the use of subpoenas will be helpful and proper.

Federal Deposit Ins. Corporation \n315 \nU.S. 447\n (1942) ]\n\n\n[315 \nU.S. 447, 449]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Giesecke, Harold C. Ackert, and Franklin E. Reagan, all of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioner.\n\n\n[315 \nU.S. 447, 453]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Francis M. Shea, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent instituted this suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern Division of the Eastern \n\n[315 \nU.S. 447, 454]\n\u00a0\n District of Missouri on a demand note for $5000 executed by petitioner in 1933 and payable to the Belleville Bank & Trust Co., Belleville, Illinois. Respondent insured that bank January 1, 1934; and it acquired the note in 1938 as part of the collateral securing a loan of over $1,000,000 to the bank, made in connection with the assumption of the latter's deposit liabilities by another bank. Since 1935 the note had been among the charged off assets of the bank. The note was executed by petitioner in renewal of notes which it had executed in 1926. Petitioner who was engaged in the securities business at St. Louis, Missouri, had sold the bank certain bonds which later defaulted. The original notes were executed to enable the bank to carry the notes and not show any past due bonds. Proceeds of the bonds were to be credited on the notes. \n1\n The receipts for the notes contained the statement, 'This note is given with the understanding it will not be called for payment. All interest payments to be repaid.' Respondent had no knowledge of the existence of the receipts until after demand for payment on the renewal note was made in 1938. Certain interest payments on the notes were made prior to renewal for the purpose of keeping them 'as live paper'. Petitioner's president who signed the original notes knew that they were executed so that the past due bonds would not appear among the assets of the bank, and that the purpose of the interest payments was 'to keep the notes alive'. The original notes were signed in St. Louis, Missouri, were payable at petitioner's office there, and were delivered to the payee in Illinois. The evidence does not disclose where the note sued upon was signed, though it was dated at Belleville, Illinois, and payable to the bank there. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 447, 455]\n\u00a0\n The main point of controversy here revolves around the question as to what law is applicable. The District Court held that Illinois law was applicable and that petitioner was liable. The Circuit Court of Appeals applied 'general law' to determine that the note was an Illinois rather than a Missouri contract; and it decided that under Illinois law respondent was the equivalent of a holder in due course and entitled to recover. 8 Cir., 117 F.2d 491. Petitioner contends that under the rule of Klaxon Company v. Stentor Electric Mfg. Co., \n313 \nU.S. 487\n, 61 S.Ct. 1020, a federal court sitting in Missouri must apply Missouri's conflict of law rules; that if, as was the case here, Illinois law was not pleaded or proved, a Missouri court would have ascertained Illinois law from Missouri decisions since in such a case Illinois law would be presumed to be the same as the Missouri law; and that the District Court was bound to follow that same course. We granted the petition for certiorari, \n314 \nU.S. 592\n, 62 S.Ct. 80, 86 L.Ed. --, because of the asserted conflict between the decision below and Klaxon Company v. Stentor Electric Mfg. Co., supra.\n We held in the latter decision that a failure of a federal court in a diversity of citizenship case to follow the forum's conflict of laws rules 'would do violence to the principle of uniformity within a state' upon which Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A.L.R. 1487, was based. 313 U.S. at page 496, 61 S.Ct. at page 1021. The jurisdiction of the District Court in this case, however, is not based on diversity of citizenship. Respondent, a federal corporation, brings this suit under an Act of Congress authorizing it to sue or be sued 'in any court of law or equity, State or Federal.' \n2\n Sec. 12B, Federal \n\n[315 \nU.S. 447, 456]\n\u00a0\n Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C.  264(j), 12 U.S.C.A.  264(j), 48 Stat. 162, 168, 172, 49 Stat. 684, 692. And see 28 U.S.C.  42, 28 U.S.C.A.  42, 43 Stat. 941. Whether the rule of the Klaxon case applies where federal jurisdiction is not based on diversity of citizenship, we need not decide. For we are of the view that the liability of petitioner on the note involves decision of a federal not a state question under the rule of Deitrick v. Greaney, \n309 \nU.S. 190\n, 60 S.Ct. 481.\n Petitioner in its answer alleged that the note was given without any consideration whatever and with the understanding that no suit would be brought thereon; and that respondent was not a holder in due course. Respondent in its reply alleged that petitioner was estopped to assert those defenses on the grounds that the note was executed for the purpose of permitting the bank to avoid having its records show any past due bonds; that this constituted a misrepresentation which would deceive the creditors of the bank, the state banking authorities and respondent; that petitioner participated in the misrepresentation not only by reason of its knowledge as to the purpose which the note would serve but also by reason of its payment of interest in order to make the notes appear as a good asset. The District Court held that respondent was an innocent holder of the note in good faith and for value and that petitioner was estopped to assert want of consideration as a defense.\n Sec. 12B(s) of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C.  264(s), 12 U.S.C. A.  264(s), provides that 'Whoever, for the purpose of obtaining any loan from the Corporation ... or for the purpose of influencing in any way the action of the Corporation under this section, makes any statement, know- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 447, 457]\n\u00a0\n ing it to be false, or willfully overvalues any security, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $5,000, or by imprisonment for not more than two years or both.' Subdivision (y) of the same section provided, at the time respondent insured the Belleville bank,3 that such a state bank 'with the approval of the authority having supervision' of the bank and on 'certification' to respondent 'by such authority' that the bank 'is in solvent condition' shall 'after examination by, and with the approval of' the respondent be entitled to insurance. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n These provisions reveal a federal policy to protect respondent and the public funds which it administers against misrepresentations as to the securities or other assets in the portfolios of the banks which respondent insures or to which it makes loans. If petitioner and the bank had arranged to use the note for the express purpose of deceiving respondent on insurance of the bank or on the making of the loan, the case would be on all fours with Deitrick v. Greaney, supra. In that case the defendant for the purpose of concealing a national bank's acquisition of its own stock had the shares held by a straw man and executed a note to the bank, it being agreed that the shares were to be held for the bank and that he was not to be liable on the note. We held as a \n\n[315 \nU.S. 447, 458]\n\u00a0\n matter of federal law, based on the policy of the National Banking Act to prevent the impairment of a bank's capital resources by prohibiting such acquisitions, that the defendant could not rely on his own wrongful act to defeat the obligation of the note as against the receiver of the bank. The defendant's act was itself a violation of the statute. 309 U.S. page 198, 60 S.Ct. page 484. But the reach of the rule which prevents an accommodation maker of a note from setting up the defense of no consideration against a bank or its receiver or creditors is not delimited to those instances where he has committed a statutory offense. As indicated by the cases cited in the Deitrick case, 309 U.S. page 198, 60 S. Ct. page 484, an accommodation maker is not allowed that defense as against the receiver of the bank and its creditors, or at times even as against the bank itself, where his act contravenes a general policy to protect the institution of banking from such secret agreements. In some of those cases the accommodation maker was party to the scheme of deception in the sense that he had full knowledge of the intended use of the paper. Putnam v. Chase, 106 Or. 440, 212 P. 365; Vallely v. Devaney, 49 N.D. 1107, 194 N.W. 903; Niblack v. Farley, 286 Ill. 536, 122 N.E. 160; Cedar State Bank v. Olson, 116 Kan. 320, 226 P. 995; Bay Parkway Nat. Bank v. Shalom, 270 N.Y. 172, 200 N.E. 685; German-American Finance Corp. v. Merchants & Mfrs. State Bank, 177 Minn. 529, 225 N.W. 891, 64 A.L.R. 582. In others he had 'no positive idea of committing any fraud upon any one.' Denny v. Fishter, 238 Ky. 127, 129, 36 S.W.2d 864, 865; Iglehart v. Todd, 203 Ind. 427, 442, 178 N.E. 685; Mount Vernon Trust Co. v. Bergoff, 272 N. Y. 192, 5 N.E.2d 196. And see Pauly v. O'Brien, C.C., 69 F. 460; Williston on Contracts (Rev.Ed.)  1632. Yet he has not been allowed to escape liability on the note as against the receiver even though he was 'very ignorant and ill-informed of the character of the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 447, 459]\n\u00a0\n transaction'. Rinaldi v. Young, 67 App.D.C. 305, 92 F.2d 229, 231. Indeed recovery was allowed by the bank itself in Mount Vernon Trust Co. v. Bergoff, supra, where the court said (272 N.Y. page 196, 5 N.E.2d page 197 ): 'The defendant may not have intended to deceive any person, but, when she executed and delivered to the plaintiff bank an instrument in the form of a note, she was chargeable with knowledge that, for the accommodation of the bank, she was aiding the bank to conceal the actual transaction. Public policy requires that a person who, for the accommodation of the bank, executes an instrument which is in form a binding obligation, should be estopped from thereafter asserting that simultaneously the parties agreed that the instrument should not be enforced.'\n Furthermore, the fact that creditors may not have been deceived or specifically injured is irrelevant. As we held in the Deitrick case, 309 U. S. page 198, 60 S.Ct. page 484 it is the 'evil tendency' of the acts to contravene the policy governing banking transactions which lies at the root of the rule. See 7 Zollman, Banks & Banking (1936)  4783.\n Those principles are applicable here because of the federal policy evidenced in this Act to protect respondent, a federal corporation, from misrepresentations made to induce or influence the action of respondent, including misstatements as to the genuineness or integrity of securities in the portfolios of banks which it insures or to which it makes loans. Those principles call for an affirmance of the judgment below.\n Petitioner at the time it executed the renewal note in 1933 did not know that it was to be used to deceive respondent, as the Act creating respondent was not passed until later. But the permission which it gave the bank to carry the note as a real asset was a continuing one and not revoked. That permission must be presumed to have \n\n[315 \nU.S. 447, 460]\n\u00a0\n included authority for the bank to treat the note as genuine for purposes of examination at the hands of the public authorities as well as for its general banking activities.\n Respondent insured the bank in 1934. The loan was made in 1938 to satisfy respondent's liability to the depositors of the bank under that insurance agreement. Respondent was authorized to insure such a bank only on a certificate from the state authority that the bank was solvent. We assume that such certificate was given, for to assume otherwise would be to infer that respondent did not discharge its statutory duties. The genuineness of assets ostensibly held by a bank is certainly germane to a determination of solvency. Clearly respondent is a member of the creditor class which the banking authorities were intended to protect. Plainly one who gives such a note to a bank with a secret agreement that it will not be enforced must be presumed to know that it will conceal the truth from the vigilant eyes of the bank examiners. If the bank had wilfully padded the bank's assets with the spurious note in order to obtain insurance from respondent there seems no doubt but that  12B(s) would have been violated. Moreover, as we have seen, the inability of an accommodation maker to plead the defense of no consideration does not depend on his commission of a penal offense. The test is whether the note was designed to deceive the creditors or the public authority or would tend to have that effect. It would be sufficient in this type of case that the maker lent himself to a scheme or arrangement whereby the banking authority on which respondent relied in insuring the bank was or was likely to be misled. As we have said, petitioner's authority to the bank to use this note was a continuing one. The use to which it was put was not unusual but within the normal scope of banking activities. The fact that the note was charged off by the bank subsequent to the time when respondent insured \n\n[315 \nU.S. 447, 461]\n\u00a0\n the bank and prior to the time when it acquired the note under the loan is immaterial. A note may be nonetheless an asset though it is charged off. And respondent is suing here to protect its rights as an insurer, a relationship with the bank which was created prior to the time when the note was charged off. The fact that subsequently respondent learned that the note had been charged off certainly was not notice that the note was spurious. It is indeed clear that at no time prior to the demand for payment did respondent know that the note was not genuine. It needs no argument to demonstrate that the integrity of ostensible assets has a direct relation to solvency. And it is no more a defense here than it was in the Deitrick case that no damage was shown to have resulted from the fraudulent or unlawful act. The federal policy expressed in the Act, like its counterpart in state law, is not dependent on proof of loss or damage caused by the fraudulent practice.\n Though petitioner was not a participant in this particular transaction and, so far as appears, was ignorant of it, nevertheless it was responsible for the creation of the false status of the note in the hands of the bank. It therefore cannot be heard to assert that the federal policy to protect respondent against such fraudulent practices should not bar its defense to the note. Criminal penalties are no more the sole sanctions of the federal policy expressed in this Act than were the criminal penalties imposed on the agreement in the Deitrick case. If the secret agreement were allowed as a defense in this case the maker of the note would be enabled to defeat the purpose of the statute by taking advantage of an undisclosed and fraudulent arrangement which the statute condemns and which the maker of the note made possible. The federal policy under this Act of protecting respondent in its various functions against such arrangements is \n\n[315 \nU.S. 447, 462]\n\u00a0\n no less clear or emphatic than the federal policy of outlawing purchases by a bank of its own stock involved in the Deitrick case. Cf. Rinaldi v. Young, supra; Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Woods, D.C., 34 F.Supp. 296.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and I concur in the result on the ground that in the circumstances of this case respondent is entitled to recover, whatever law be deemed controlling. If Illinois law governs, respondent is admittedly entitled to recover as a holder in due course. If Missouri law governs, petitioner is estopped to assert the defenses on which it now relies. Whether the case is governed by the law of one state or the other, or by 'federal common law' drawn here from one state or the other, the result is the same.\n When the original accommodation notes were executed in 1926, petitioner fully knew that the whole transaction was aimed at giving the bank an appearance of assets where there were none. Petitioner's representative admitted that the bank 'suggested that we issue a note to the Bank,' which would enable it 'to carry this note and not show any past due paper.' He had been in the investment security business since 1910; he 'knew what the bank meant', and that it was subject to periodic examinations by the state bank examiner, and he assumed the bank did not want past due paper. On these facts the trial judge held that petitioner is estopped to assert absence of consideration as a defense.\n Nothing in Missouri statutes or decisions brought to our notice would warrant us in setting aside this ruling. A case decided in 1901, Chicago Title & Trust Co. v. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 447, 463]\n\u00a0\n Brady, 165 Mo. 197, 65 S.W. 303, might have called for a different result. There an accommodation maker was held not estopped to assert absence of consideration as a defense against the bank's receiver, even though he had known that the note was part of a scheme to deceive the state banking authorities by swelling the apparent assets of the bank. But in 1920 the Missouri Supreme Court made it clear that the Brady decision can no longer be taken to represent the law of that state. Such is the purport of Bank of Slater v. Union Station Bank, 283 Mo. 308, 320, 222 S.W. 993, 996:\n'The facts in this case inevitably suggest the question (of estoppel) we have discussed in this paragraph. Counsel for respondent, however, have not raised it, being deterred, doubtless, by the decision in (Chicago) Title & Trust Co. v. Brady, 165 Mo. 197, 65 S.W. 303, where a contrary doctrine is countenanced, and we therefore refrain from ruling upon the proposition. We have touched upon it for the reason that if the Brady case, supra, is considered as announcing 'the Missouri rule' upon this topic, as some commentators have said, that rule is apparently in conflict with numerous and respectable authorities, and its soundness may admit of question.'\n\n No subsequent decision was cited, nor have we found any, to show that the court has since reverted to the doctrine of the Brade case. It cannot be said, therefore, that in holding petitioner estopped the trial judge departed from Missouri law.\n There is no federal statute to override either the Missouri law as to estoppel or the Illinois law which treats respondent as a holder in due course. Were this Court, in the absence of federal legislation, to make its own choice of law, compare United States v. Guaranty Trust Co., \n293 \nU.S. 340\n, 55 S.Ct. 221, 95 A.L.R. 651; O'Brien v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 1 Cir., 113 F.2d 539; and Hinderlider v. La Plata Co., 304 \n\n[315 \nU.S. 447, 464]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 92, 58 S.Ct. 803, decided the same day as Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A. L.R. 1487, Illinois or Missouri law would furnish the governing principles. See Board of Com'rs v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 343\n, 60 S.Ct. 285; Royal Indemnity Co. v. United States, \n313 \nU.S. 289, 296\n, 61 S.Ct. 995, 997; just v. Chambers, \n312 \nU.S. 383, 387\n, 668 S., 61 S.Ct. 687, 690.\n We are unable to find an estoppel created by federal statute. Reliance is placed upon Deitrick v. Greaney, \n309 \nU.S. 190\n, 60 S.Ct. 480. But that case rested on a plain violation of an explicit provision of a federal statute in force at the time of its occurrence. This is not true here. An accommodation ote deposited in a bank before an act of Congress is on the books can hardly become a violation of the act after it is passed merely because the note remains in the bank. One cannot violate a statute before it comes into being. Insofar as the statute may apply to arrangements whereby the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation might have been misled to its detriment into insuring an insolvent bank, the record is barren of any indication that the $5,000 note in question had any relation to the bank's solvency or to the Corporation's undertaking as an insurer.\n The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is bringing this suit as pledgee. As to the note sued upon, it is in no different position than would be any other pledgee. Indeed, from the business point of view, its position is less favorable. For it became pledgee only in 1938, three years after the note had been charged off on the books of the bank. The Corporation had since 1934 been making a regular annual examination of the bank's books, which showed this fact; and the schedule of collateral given to respondent when it became pledgee made it perfectly clear that the note had been charged off.\n We are not concerned here with liability based on any doctrine of 'equitable estoppel' evolved as a principle of \n\n[315 \nU.S. 447, 465]\n\u00a0\n federal common law having no statutory roots. For we have put to one side, as unnecessary to the disposition of this case, the duty of this Court to make law 'interstitially' (as Mr. Justice Holmes put it in Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205, 221\n, 37 S.Ct. 524, 531, L.R.A.1918C, 451, Ann.Cas.1917E, 900) in controversies arising in the federal courts outside their diversity jurisdiction.\n Of course the policy expressed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act might be violated, as the National Bank Act was violated in the Deitrick case, wholly apart from any question of estoppel or proof of loss to the Corporation. Our difficulty is that the statute cannot be stretched to fit this case. And it seems unnecessary to force such a result when a solution according to settled doctrines is available.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON, concurring.\n I think we should attempt a more explicit answer to the question whether federal or state law governs our decision in this sort of case than is found either in the opinion of the Court or in the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER. That question, as old as the federal judiciary, is met inescapably at the threshold of this case. It is the one which moved us to grant certiorari, and we could not resort to the rule announced without at least a tacit answer to it. The petitioner asserts that the decisions in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A.L.R. 1487, and Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Electric Mfg. Co ., \n313 \nU.S. 487\n, 61 S.Ct. 1020, govern this case. If they do, we would not be free to disregard the law of Missouri and Illinois and to apply a doctrine of estoppel actually-but not avowedly-drawn from common-law sources to effectuate the policy we think implicit in federal statutes.\n The Rules of Decision Act1 provides that 'the laws of the several States, except where the Constitution, treaties, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 447, 466]\n\u00a0\n or statutes of the United States otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law, in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply.' Whether 'laws of the several States' as so used included non-statutory law embodied in judicial decisions of state courts was long a subject of controversy. After acting for half a century on the belief that it did, the Court in Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, decided that it did not. Almost a century later that decision with its numerous and sorry progeny was overruled, and the Court answered that it did. Erir R. Co. v. Tompkins, supra. It later held that state decisions on conflicts of laws were also binding on the federal courts. Klaxon v. Stentor Electric Mfg. Co., supra. Thus, the Rules of Decision Act as now interpreted requires federal courts to use state law whether declared by the legislature or by the courts as rules of decision 'in cases where they apply,' except where federal law shall 'otherwise require or provide.' These recent cases, like Swift v. Tyson which evoked them, dealt only with the very special problems arising in diversity cases, where federal jurisdiction exists to provide nonresident parties an optional forum of assured impartiality. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[315 \nU.S. 447, 467]\n\u00a0\n The Court has not extended the doctrine of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins beyond diversity cases. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n This case is not entertained by the federal courts because of diversity of citizenship. It is here because a federal agency brings the action, and the law of its being provides, with exceptions not important here, that: 'All suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity to which the Corporation shall be a party shall be deemed to arise under the laws of the United States: ....'4 That this \n\n[315 \nU.S. 447, 468]\n\u00a0\n provision is not merely jurisdictional is suggested by the presence in the same section of the Act of the separate provision that the Corporation may sue and be sued 'in any court of law or equity, State or Federal.' \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Although by Congressional command this case is to be deemed one arising under the laws of the United States, no federal statute purports to define the Corporation's rights as a holder of the note in suit or the liability of the maker thereof. There arises, therefore, the question whether in deciding the case we are bound to apply the law of some particular state or whether, to put it bluntly, we may make our own law from materials found in common-law sources.\n This issue has a long historical background of legal and political controversy as to the place of the common law in federal jurisprudence. \n6\n As the matter now stands, it \n\n[315 \nU.S. 447, 469]\n\u00a0\n seems settled that the federal courts may not resort to the common law to punish crimes not made punishable by Act of Congress;7 and that, apart from special statutory or constitutional provision, they are not bound in other fields by English precedents existing at any particular date. The federal courts have no general common law, as in a sense they have no general or comprehensive jurisprudence of any kind, because many subjects of private law which bulk large in the traditional common law are ordinarily within the province of the states and not of the federal government. But this is not to say that wherever we have occasion to decide a federal question which cannot be answered from federal statutes alone we may not resort to all of the source materials of the common law or that when we have fashioned an answer it does not become a part of the federal non-statutory or common law.\n I do not understand Justice Brandeis's statement in Erir R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, at page 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, at page 822, 114 A.L.R. 1487, that 'There is no federal general common law,' to deny that the common law may in proper cases be an aid to or the basis of de- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 447, 470]\n\u00a0\n cision of federal questions. In its context it means to me only that federal courts may not apply their own notions of the common law at variance with applicable state decisions except 'where the Constitution, treaties, or statutes of the United States (so) require or provide.' \n8\n Indeed, in a case decided on the same day as Erir R. Co. v. Tompkins, Justice Brandeis said that 'whether the water of an interstate stream must be apportioned between the two States is a question of 'federal common law' upon which neither the statutes nor the decisions of either State can be conclusive.' Hinderlider v. La Plata Co., \n304 \nU.S. 92, 110\n, 58 S.Ct. 803, 811.\n Were we bereft of the common law, our federal system would be impotent. This follows from the recognized futility of attempting all- complete statutory codes, and is apparent from the terms of the Constitution itself.\n The contract clause, article 1,  10, which prohibits a state from passing any 'Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts' is an example of the part the common law must play in our system. This provision is meaningless unless we know what a contract is. The Constitution wisely refrains from saying. We have very recently held upon a long line of authority that in applying this clause we are not bound by the state's views as to whether there is a contract. Irving Trust Co. v. Day, \n314 \nU.S. 556\n, 62 S.Ct. 398, 86 L.Ed. --. Take the case where the question is whether a promise made without consideration comes within the protection of the contract clause. Is there any doubt as to where we must go for the answer that we do not find in the Constitution itself? This Court has not hesitated to read the com- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 447, 471]\n\u00a0\n mon-law doctrine of consideration into the contract clause, and to restrict the protection of that clause to promises supported by consideration. Durkee v. Board of Liquidation, \n103 \nU.S. 646\n, 648; Pearsall v. Great Northern Ry. Co., \n161 \nU.S. 646, 667\n, 16 S.Ct. 705, 710; Grand Lodge v. City of New Orleans, \n166 \nU.S. 143, 146\n, 17 S.Ct. 523, 524. Compare Allegheny College v. National Chautauqua County Bank, 246 N.Y. 369, 159 N.E. 173, 57 A.L.R. 980.\n Other recognitions of our common-law powers abound in the Constitution. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n A federal court sitting in a non-diversity case such as this does not sit as a local tribunal. In some cases it may see fit for special reasons to give the law of a particular state highly persuasive or even controlling effect, but in the last analysis its decision turns upon the law of the United States, not that of any state. Federal law \n\n[315 \nU.S. 447, 472]\n\u00a0\n is no juridical chameleon, changing complexion to match that of each state wherein lawsuits happen to be commenced because of the accidents of service of process and of the application of the venue statutes. It is found in the federal Constitution, statutes, or common law. Federal common law implements the federal Constitution and statutes, and is conditioned by them. \n10\n Within these limits, federal courts are free to apply the traditional common-law technique of decision and to draw upon all the sources of the common law in cases such as the present. Board of Commissioners v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 343, 350\n, 60 S.Ct. 285, 288.\n The law which we apply to this case consists of principles of established credit in jurisprudence selected by us because they are appropriate to effectuate the policy of the governing Act. The Corporation was created and financed in part by the United States11 to bolster the entire banking and credit structure. The Corporation did not simply step into the private shoes of local banks. The purposes sought to be accomplished by it can be accomplished only if it may rely on the integrity of banking statements and banking assets. In this case the Corporation attempted to realize on a note that was a part of the assets at the time it insured the bank. It is met by the plea that the note was a sham knowingly given to enable the bank to conceal the worthlessness of certain bonds which it had bought from the maker, a broker. This deception was not for the single day on which the note was delivered; its purpose and its effect was to \n\n[315 \nU.S. 447, 473]\n\u00a0\n operate as a continuing inducement to existing creditors and to those who might become creditors to rely on this note as a $5,000 item counting towards its solvency. It may not have contemplated the then unborn Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as the particular object of its deception, but its purpose was to conceal a loss from then unknown and unidentified persons who might be or become creditors or banking supervisors on behalf of the public. Under the Act the Corporation has a dual relation of creditor or potential creditor and of supervising authority toward insured banks. \n12\n The immunity of such a corporation from schemes concocted by the cooperative deceit of bank officers and customers is not a question to be answered from considerations of geography. That a particular state happened to have the greatest connection in the conflict of laws sense with the making of the note involved or that the subsequent conduct happened to be chiefly centered there is no enough to make us subservient to the legislative policy or the judicial views of that state. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n I concur in the Court's holding because I think that the defense asserted is nowhere admissible against the Corporation and that we need not go to the law of any particular state as our authority for so holding.\n I hardly suppose that Congress intended to set us com- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 447, 474]\n\u00a0\n pletely adrift from state law with regard to all questions as to which it has not provided a statutory answer. An intention to give persuasive or binding effect to state law has been found to exist in a number of cases similar in that they arose under a law of the United States but were not governed by any specific statutory provision. 14 No doubt many questions as to the liability of parties to commercial paper which comes into the hands of the Corporation will best be solved by applying the local law with reference to which the makers and the insured bank presumably contracted. The Corporation would succeed only to the rights which the bank itself acquired where ordinary and good-faith commercial transactions are involved. But petitioners' conduct here was not intended to confer any right on the bank itself, for as to it the note was agreed to be a nullity. Petitioners' conduct was intended to and did have a direct and independent effect on unknown third parties, among whom the Corporation now appears. \n15\n The policy of the federal Act does not seem \n\n[315 \nU.S. 447, 475]\n\u00a0\n to me to leave dependent on local law the question whether one may plead his own scheme to deceive a bank's creditors and supervising authorities as against the Corporation. Even though federal criminal sanctions might not be applicable to these facts, and even though the doctrine of Deitrick v. Greaney, \n309 \nU.S. 190\n, 60 S.Ct. 480, may not fully comprehend the present case, I think we now may borrow a doctrine of estoppel from the same source from which the Court borrowed it in that case, and to reach the same result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The bank sold some of the bonds in 1937 for $100 and credited this amount to interest due on the note. This credit paid interest to May 1, 1933. No later payments were made on the note. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] That subdivision of the Act further provides: 'All suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity to which the Corporation shall be a party shall be deemed to arise under the laws of the United States: Provided, That any such suit to which the Corporation is a party in its capacity as receiver of a State bank and which involves only the rights or obligations of depositors, creditors, stockholders and such State bank under State law shall not be deemed to arise under the laws of the United States.' And see S.Rep. No. 1007, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 5. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] These provisions of subdivision (y) were dropped when  12B was amended by the Banking Act of 1935. 49 Stat. 684. See S.Rep. No. 1007, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 9. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Subdivision (y) also gave respondent power to prescribe rules and regulations for the further examination of such bank. Though subdivision ( y) was revised in 1935, as indicated in note 3, supra, subdivision (k)(2) of the amended Act gave respondent's examiners power 'to make a thorough examination of all the affairs' of such banks and in doing so 'to administer oaths and to examine and take and preserve the testimony of any of the officers and agents thereof'. They were directed to make a 'full and detailed report of the condition of the bank to the Corporation.' 12 U. S.C.  264(k)(2), 12 U.S.C.A.  264(k)(2). \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n]  34 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 28 U.S.C.  725, 28 U.S.C.A.  725. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'However true the fact may be, that the tribunals of the states will administer justice as impartially as those of the nation, to parties of every description, it is not less true that the constitution itself either entertains apprehensions on this subject, or views with such indulgence the possible fears and apprehensions of suitors, that it has established national tribunals for the decision of controversies between aliens and a citizen, or between citizens of different states.' Chief Justice Marshall in Bank of United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 87. See also, Dodge v. Woolsey, 18 How. 331, 354; Burgess v. Seligman, \n107 \nU.S. 20, 34\n, 2 S.Ct. 10, 21; Lankford v. Platte Iron Works, \n235 \nU.S. 461, 478\n, 35 S.Ct. 173, 177. But compare Friendly, The Historic Basis of Diversity Jurisdiction, 41 Harvard Law Review 483. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Its effect even in such cases seems not to have been definitely settled. In an equity case it was said that 'the doctrine applies though the question of construction arises not in an action at law, but in a suit in equity.' Ruhlin v. New York Life Insurance Co., \n304 \nU.S. 202, 205\n, 58 S. Ct. 860, 861. That case was in the federal courts by reason of diversity jurisdiction. In a later case in which a suit in equity was brought in federal court to enforce liability under a federal statute the Court said: 'The Rules of Decision Act does not apply to suits in equity. Section 34 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 28 U.S.C. 725, 28 U.S.C.A.  725, directing that the 'laws of the several states' 'shall be regarded as rules of decision' in the courts of the United States, applies only to the rules of decision in 'trials at common law' in such courts, but applies as well to rules established by judicial decision in the states as those established by statute. ... In the circumstances we have no occasion to consider the extent to which the federal courts, in the exercise of the authority conferred upon them by Congress to administer equitable remedies, are bound to follow state statutes and decisions affecting those remedies.' Russell v. Todd, \n309 \nU.S. 280, 287\n, 294 S., 60 S.Ct. 527, 531, 534. In any event, the estoppel here involved seems no more an equity matter than the issue of good-faith purchase involved in Cities Service Oil Co. v. Dunlap, \n308 \nU.S. 208\n, 60 S.Ct. 201, where state law was held to govern. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Paragraph Fourth of 12 U.S.C.  264(j), 12 U.S.C.A.  264(j) empowers the Corporation 'To sue and be sued, complain and defend, in any court of law or equity, State or Federal. All suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity to which the Corporation shall be a party shall be deemed to arise under the laws of the United States: Provided, That any such suit to which the Corporation is a party in its capacity as receiver of a State bank and which involves only the rights or obligations of depositors, creditors, stockholders and such State bank under State law shall not be deemed to arise under the laws of the United States.'\n In a number of respects and with varying degrees of explicitness the Act elsewhere makes reference to state law. Specific federal criminal sanctions are provided. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] A similar provision without more is found in many federal statutes. E.g., 15 U.S.C.  604, 15 U.S.C.A.  604 (Reconstruction Finance Corporation); 12 U.S.C.  24, 12 U.S.C.A.  24 (National Banks); 12 U.S.C .  341, 12 U.S.C.A.  341 (Federal Reserve Banks); 12 U.S.C.  1432, 12 U. S.C.A.  1432 (Federal Home Loan Banks); 12 U.S.C.  1716(c)(3), 12 U.S.C. A.  1716(c)(3) (National Mortgage Associations). This is not to suggest, however, that questions not specifically dealt with in these statutes cannot be federal questions simply because of the absence of an express provision that suits 'shall be deemed to arise under the laws of the United States.' \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Judicial opinions discussing various aspects of the question include: Wheaton v. Peters, 1834, 8 Pet. 591, 658; Kendall v. United States, 1838, 12 Pet. 524, 621; Smith v. Alabama, 1888, \n124 \nU.S. 465, 478\n, 8 S.Ct. 564, 569; Bucher v. Cheshire R.R.

Co. v. Tompkins to discredit Swift v. Tyson, led that scholar to conclude that United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32, and United States v. Coolidge, 1 Wheat, 415, establishing the above proposition, were probably wrongly decided. Warren, History of the Federal Judiciary Act of 1789, 37 Harvard Law Review 49, 73. The error, if it be one, comports, however, with the present tendency to constrict the jurisdiction of federal courts, and I think is likely to survive. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Similarly, Mr. Justice Holmes's statement that there is no 'transcendental body of law outside of any particular State but obligatory within it unless and until changed by statute' was made with reference to 'matters that are not governed by any law of the United States or by any statute of the State.' See Black & White Taxicab Co. v. Brown & Yellow Taxicab Co., \n276 \nU.S. 518, 533\n, 48 S.Ct. 404, 409, 57 A.L.R. 426. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Thus, the Judiciary Article provides that 'the judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties' made under their authority. Article 3,  2. It does not give any definition of what are cases in law and equity; it simply assumes the existence of a jurisprudence from which the courts can ascertain the meaning of those terms.\n Particularly in the clauses dealing with the rights of the individual, the Constitution uses words and phrases borrowed from the common law, meaningless without that background, and obviously meant to carry their common-law implications. Thus, we find in it the following: 'convicted'; 'Indictment'; 'Treason, Felony, and Breach of the Peace'; 'Piracies and Felonies'; 'Privilege of the Writ of habeas Corpus'; 'Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law'; 'Bribery'; 'original Jurisdiction'; and 'appellate Jurisdiction' both as to Law and Fact'. In the Bill of Rights Amendments, the necessity for resort to the common law for constitutional interpretation is even more obvious. Here we find: 'unreasonable searches and seizures'; 'Warrants'; 'presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury'; 'due process of law'; 'right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury'; 'in Suits at common law'; and 'no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law'. \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] For example, the common-law doctrines of conflict of laws worked out in a unitary system to deal with conflicts between domestic and truly foreign law may not apply unmodified in conflicts between the laws of states within our federal system which are affected by the full faith and credit or other relevant clause of the Constitution. \n[\nFootnote 11\n] 12 U.S.C.  264(d), 12 U.S.C.A.  264(d). \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] 12 U.S.C.  264(i), (k), (l), 12 U.S.C.A.  264(i, k, l). \n[\nFootnote 13\n] Compare Central Vermont Ry.

To insist that the $5,000 note in question does not appear from the record to have had 'any relation to the bank's solvency or the Corporation's undertaking as an insurer' is to part company with the realities of the period in question when small banks-and large ones as well-were operating on perilously narrow margins of solvency, if any. To hold that the Corporation is to be judged as a mere private pledgee of a particular piece of paper is to ignore the comprehensive public character of its function. And the wrong to it was sustained when it became committed to insure the bank-not later when as a step to working its way out of loss it took assets already equitably its own as a pledge and put up money for a plan to continue banking facilities to the community. To say that the note had been charged off is to stress the irrelevant. This was admittedly long after the Corporation had become bound as the bank's insurer. It also attributes to the 'charge-off' an unwarranted significance. The classification of this paper as inadmissible for a commercial bank would have been justified by its obvious 'slow' character, or may have been due to mere lack of information as to the ability of a nonresident debtor to meet it. It is no acknowledgment or notice of a legal defect in the paper. \n\n\n\n\n","26":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDAVIS v. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND INDUSTRIES OF WASHINGTON(1942)\nNo. 86\nArgued: November 18, 1942Decided: December 14, 1942\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied Jan. 11, 1943. See \n317 \nU.S. 713\n, 63 S.Ct. 438, 87 L.Ed. --. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 249, 250]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Alfred J. Schweppe, Maurice R. McMicken, and Otto B. Rupp, all of Seattle, Wash., for petitioner.\n Mr. Edward S. Franklin, of Seattle, Wash., for respondent.\n\n Mr Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this case the Washington Supreme Court held that the state could not, consistently with the Federal Constitution, make an award under its state compensation law to \n\n[317 \nU.S. 249, 251]\n\u00a0\n the widow of a workman drowned in a navigable river. 12 Wash.2d 349, 121 P. 2d 365. The circumstances which caused the court to reach this conclusion were these:\n The petitioner's husband, a structural steelworker, was drowned in the Snohomish River while working as an employee of the Manson Construction and Engineering Company, a contributor to the Workmen's Compensation Fund of the State of Washington. Contributions of Washington employers to this Fund are compulsory in certain types of occupations, including the job for which the deceased had been employed. Rem.Rev.Stat. of Wash.1932,  7674. That job was to dismantle an abandoned drawbridge which spanned the river. A part of the task was to cut steel from the bridge with oxyacetylene torches and move it about 250 feet away for storage there to await delivery to a local purchaser. The steel when cut from the bridge was lowered to a barge by a derrick; and when loaded, the barge was to be towed by a tug, hauled by cable, or, if the current made it necessary, both towed and hauled to the storage point. Three vessels which had been brought there along the stream, for use by the employer in the work-a tug, derrick barge, and a barge,-were all licensed by the U.S. Bureau of Navigation. The derrick barge was fastened to the bridge; the barge was tied to the derrick barge. Deceased had helped to cut some steel from the bridge and, at the time of the accident, was working on the barge which had not yet been completely loaded for its first carriage of steel to the place of storage. His duty appears to have been to examine the steel after it was lowered to the barge, and, when necessary, to cut the pieces to proper lengths. From this barge he fell or was knocked into the stream in which his body was found.\n The Washington statute provides compensation for employees and dependents of employees, such as decedent, if its application can be made 'within the legislative jurisdiction of the state.' A further statement of coverage \n\n[317 \nU.S. 249, 252]\n\u00a0\n applies the Act to 'all employers and workmen ... engaged in maritime occupations for whom no right or obligation exists under the maritime laws.' Rem.Rev.Stat.Wash.  7674, 7693a. A line of opinions of this Court beginning with Southern Pac. Co. v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205, 216\n, 37 S.Ct. 524, 529, L.R.A.1918C, 451, Ann.Cas.1917E, 900, held that under some circumstances states could but under others could not, consistent with Article III,  2 of the Federal Constitution,1 apply their compensation laws to maritime employees. State legislation was declared to be invalid only when it 'works material prejudice to the characteristic features of the general maritime law, or interferes with the proper harmony and uniformity of that law in its international and interstate relations.' When a state could and when it could not grant protection under a compensation act was left as a perplexing problem, for it was held 'difficult, if not impossible' to define this boundary with exactness.\n With the manifest desire of removing this uncertainty so that workers whose duties were partly on land and partly on navigable waters might be compensated for injuries, Congress on October 6, 1917, five months after the Jensen decision, passed an Act attempting to give such injured persons the 'rights and remedies under the workmen's compensation law of any State.' 40 Stat. 395, 28 U.S.C.A.  41(3), 371(3). May 17, 1920, this Court declared the Act unconstitutional. Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, \n253 \nU.S. 149\n, 40 S.Ct. 438, 11 A.L.R. 1145. June 10, 1922, 42 Stat. 634, 28 U.S.C.A.  41(3), 371(3), Congress made another effort to permit state compensation laws to protect these waterfront employees, but this second effort was also held invalid. State of Washington v. W. C. Dawson & Co., \n264 \nU.S. 219\n, 58 S.Ct. 749. March 4, 1927, came the Federal Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act, 33 U.S.C.  901 et seq., 33 U.S.C.A.  901 et seq. Here again, however, Congress made clear its purpose to \n\n[317 \nU.S. 249, 253]\n\u00a0\n permit state compensation protection whenever possible by making the federal law applicable only 'if recovery for the disability or death through workmen's compensation proceedings may not validly be provided by State law.'\n Harbor workers and longshoremen employed 'in whole or in part, upon the navigable waters' are clearly protected by this Federal Act; but, employees such as decedent here occupy that shadowy area within which, at some undefined and undefinable point, state laws can validly provide compensation. This Court has been unable to give any guiding, definite rule to determine the extent of state power in advance of litigation, and has held that the margins of state authority must 'be determined in view of surrounding circumstances as cases arise.' Baizley Iron Works v. Span, \n281 \nU.S. 222, 230\n, 50 S.Ct. 306, 307. The determination of particular cases, of which there have been a great many, has become extremely difficult. It is fair to say that a number of cases can be cited both in behalf of and in opposition to recovery here. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[317 \nU.S. 249, 254]\n\u00a0\n The very closeness of the cases cited above and others raising related points of interpretation has caused much serious confusion. \n3\n It must be remembered that under the Jensen hypothesis, basic conditions are factual: Does the state law 'interfere with the proper harmony and uniformity of 'maritime law? Yet employees are asked to determine with certainty before bringing their actions that factual question over which courts regularly divide among themselves and within their own membership. As penalty for error, the injured individual may not only suffer serious financial loss through the delay and expense of litigation, but discover that his claim has been barred by the statute of limitations in the proper forum while he was erroneously pursuing it elsewhere. See e.g., Ayers v. Parker, D.C., 15 F.Supp. 447. Such a result defeats the purpose of the federal act, which seeks to give 'to these hardworking men, engaged in a somewhat hazardous employment, the justice involved in the modern principle of compensation', and the state acts such as the one before us which aims at 'sure and certain relief for workmen.' \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[317 \nU.S. 249, 255]\n\u00a0\n The horns of the jurisdictional dilemma press as sharply on employers as on employees. In the face of the cases referred to above, the most competent counsel may be unable to predict on which side of the line particular employment will fall. The employer's contribution to a state insurance fund may therefore wholly fail to protect him against the liabilities for which it was specifically planned. If this very case is affirmed for example, the employer will not only lose the benefit of the state insurance to which he has been compelled to contribute and by which he has thought himself secured against loss for accidents to his employees; he must also, by virtue of the conclusion that the employee was subject to the federal act at the time of the accident, become liable for substantial additional payments. He will also be subject to fine and imprisonment for the misdemeanor of having failed, as is apparently the case, to secure payment for the employee under the federal act. 33 U.S.C.  938, 932, 33 U.S.C.A.  938, 932.\n We are not asked here to review and reconsider the constitutional implications of the Jensen line of decisions. On the contrary, even the petitioner argues that such action might bring about still worse confusion in an already uncertain field, and points out that state and federal agencies have made real progress toward closing the gap. There is much force in this argument. Since 1917, Congress and the states have sought to restore order out of the confusion which resulted from the Jensen decision. That success has not finally been achieved is illustrated by the present case. The Longshoremen's Act passed with specific reference to the Jensen rule, provided a partial solution. The Washington statute represents a state effort to clarify the situation. Both of these laws show clearly that neither was intended to encroach on the field occupied by the other. But the line separating the scope of the two being undefined and undefinable with exact \n\n[317 \nU.S. 249, 256]\n\u00a0\n precision, marginal employment may, by reason of particular facts, fall on either side. Overruling the Jensen case would not solve this problem. In our decision in Parker v. Motor Boat Sales, \n314 \nU.S. 244\n, 62 S.Ct. 221, we held that Congress has by the Longshoremen's Act accepted the Jensen line of demarcation between state and federal jurisdiction. Obviously the determination of the margin becomes no simpler because the standard applied is considered to be embedded in a statute rather than in the Constitution. Nor can we gain assistance in this circumstance from the clause in the federal act which makes that act exclusive. 33 U.S.C.  905, 33 U.S.C.A.  905. That section gains meaning only after a litigant has been found to occupy one side or the other of the doubtful jurisdictional line and is no assistance in discovering on which side he can properly be placed.\n There is, in the light of the cases referred to, clearly a twilight zone in which the employees must have their rights determined case by case, and in which particular facts and circumstances are vital elements. That zone includes persons such as the decedent who are, as a matter of actual administration, in fact protected under the state compensation act.\n Faced with this factual problem we must give great-indeed, presumptive-weight to the conclusions of the appropriate federal authorities and to the state statutes themselves. Where there has been a hearing by the federal administrative agency entrusted with broad powers of investigation, fact finding, determination, and award, our task proves easy. There we are aided by the provision of the federal act, 33 U.S.C.  920, 33 U.S.C.A.  920, which provides that in proceedings under that act, jurisdiction is to be 'presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary.' Fact findings of the agency, where supported by the evidence, are made final. Their conclusion that a case falls within the federal jurisdiction is therefore \n\n[317 \nU.S. 249, 257]\n\u00a0\n entitled to great weight and will be rejected only in cases of apparent error. It was under these circumstances that we sustained the Commissioner's findings in Parker v. Motor Boat Sales, supra.\n In the instant case we do not enjoy the benefit of federal administrative findings and must therefore look solely to state sources for guidance. We find here a state statute which purports to cover these persons, and which indeed does cover them if the doubtful and difficult factual questions to which we have referred are decided on the side of the constitutional power of the state. The problem here is comparable to that in another field of constitutional law in which courts are called upon to determine whether particular state acts unduly burden interstate commerce. In making the factual judgment there, we have relied heavily on the presumption of constitutionality in favor of the state statute. South Carolina State Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros., \n303 \nU.S. 177, 188\n, 191 S., 625, 58 S.Ct. 510, 515, 517.5\n The benefit of a presumption is also given in cases of conflict of state or state and territorial workmen's compensation acts under the Full Faith and Credit clause, Const. art. 4,  1. There, as here, the issue is a factual one arising from a clash of interest of two jurisdictions. In such a case involving the question of whether the California or the Alaska Workmen's Compensation Act should apply to a \n\n[317 \nU.S. 249, 258]\n\u00a0\n resident of California injured in Alaska who brought suit in California, this Court has said: 'The enactment of the present statute of California was within state power and infringes no constitutional provision. Prima facie, every state is entitled to enforce in its own courts its own statutes, lawfully enacted.' Alaska Packers' Ass'n v. Industrial Accident Commission, \n294 \nU.S. 532, 547\n, 55 S.Ct. 518, 524. And see Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial Accident Commission, \n306 \nU.S. 493, 503\n, 59 S.Ct. 629, 633.\n Not only does the state act in the instant case appear to cover this employee, aside from the constitutional consideration, but no conflicting process of administration is apparent. The federal authorities have taken no action under the Longshoremen's Act, and it does not appear that the employer has either made the special payments required or controverted payment in the manner prescribed in the Act. 33 U.S.C.  914(b) and (d), 33 U.S.C.A.  914(b, d). Under all the circumstances of this case we will rely on the presumption of constitutionality in favor of this state enactment; for any contrary decision results in our holding the Washington act unconstitutional as applied to this petitioner. A conclusion of unconstitutionality of a state statute can not be rested on so hazardous a factual foundation here any more than in the other cases cited.\n Giving the full weight to the presumption, and resolving all doubts in favor of the Act, we hold that the Constitution is no obstacle to the petitioner's recovery. The case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER concurring.\n Any legislative scheme that compensates workmen or their families for industrial mishaps should be capable of simple and dependable enforcement. That was the aim of Congress when, with due regard for the diverse conditions in the several States, it afforded to harbor workers the \n\n[317 \nU.S. 249, 259]\n\u00a0\n benefits of state workmen's compensation laws. Act of October 6, 1917, c. 97, 40 Stat. 395, as amended by the Act of June 10, 1922, c. 216, 42 Stat. 634, 28 U.S.C.A.  41(3), 371(3). But Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205\n, 37 S.Ct. 524, L.R.A.1918C, 451, Ann.Cas.1917E, 900, and cases following, frustrated this purpose.\n Such a desirable end cannot now be achieved merely by judicial repudiation of the Jensen doctrine. Too much has happened in the twenty- five years since that ill-starred decision. Federal and state enactments have so accommodated themselves to the complexity and confusion introduced by the Jensen rulings that the resources of adjudication can no longer bring relief from the difficulties which the judicial process itself brought into being. Therefore, until Congress sees fit to attempt another comprehensive solution of the problem, this Court can do no more than bring some order out of the remaining judicial chaos as marginal situations come before us. Because it contributes to that end, I join in the Court's opinion.\n Theoretic illogic is inevitable so long as the employee in a situation like the present is permitted to recover either under the Federal act (cf. Parker v. Motor Boat Sales, \n314 \nU.S. 244\n, 62 S.Ct. 221; Northern Coal Co. v. Strand, \n278 \nU.S. 142\n, 49 S.Ct. 88; Nogueira v. New York, N.H., & H.R. Co., \n281 \nU.S. 128\n, 50 S.Ct. 303; Employers' Liability Assurance Co. v. Cook, \n281 \nU.S. 233\n, 50 S.Ct. 308) or under a state statute. Cf. Millers' Indemnity Underwriters v. Braud, \n270 \nU.S. 59\n, 46 S.Ct. 194; Alaska Packers' Ass'n v. Industrial Accident Comm., \n276 \nU.S. 467\n, 48 S.Ct. 346. That is the practical result, whether it be reached by the Court's path or that apparently left open under the Chief Justice's views. It is scant comfort to an employer that he may find he has committed a misdemeanor in not posting a bond as required by the federal Act because he may have been advised, not unnaturally, that under the prior rulings of this Court the activities of his employees were local in nature and hence he could be sued only under state law. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 249, 260]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE.\n Any effort to lessen the uncertainties and complexities which have followed in the wake of the Jensen decision and its successors during the past twenty-five years deserves sympathetic consideration. But in the present state of the law, the Court's attempt to remove them by construing state workmen's compensation acts and the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act so that their coverages overlap, can hardly be deemed to be within judicial competence.\n Section 3 of the Longshoremen's Act, 33 U.S.C.  903, 33 U.S.C.A.  903, authorizes payment of compensation 'only ... if recovery for the disability or death through workmen's compensation proceedings may not validly be provided by State law'. In Parker v. Motor Boat Sales, \n314 \nU.S. 244, 250\n, 62 S.Ct. 221, 225, we held, as a matter of construction of this clause of the statute, that it had adopted the rationale of Jensen and its followers, regardless of their constitutional validity, as 'the measure by which Congress intended to mark the scope of the Act they brought into existence'. We thus decided that if by the application of the Jensen doctrine recovery could not constitutionally be had under state laws, the federal act conferred a right of recovery whether or not the Jensen decision was sound.\n The Court's opinion in the present case seems to proceed upon the assumption that if petitioner had filed a claim under the federal act, and the federal commissioner had awarded compensation, we would sustain his ruling, although the Court now holds that the state authorities erroneously concluded they were without constitutional power to make the award. Indeed, after our decision in Parker v. Motor Boat Sales, supra, petitioner's right of recovery under the federal act can hardly be doubted; not only could a federal commissioner properly decide \n\n[317 \nU.S. 249, 261]\n\u00a0\n in favor of jurisdiction, but any candid application of the Jensen rule would seem to compel reversal of a federal commissioner who declined jurisdiction. See Northern Coal Co. v. Strand, \n278 \nU.S. 142\n, 49 S.Ct. 88, and Employers' Liability Assurance Co. v. Cook, \n281 \nU.S. 233\n, 50 S.Ct. 308, both cited to justify the federal award in the Motor Boat case, 314 U.S. at page 247, 62 S.Ct. at page 223.\n Congress by the enactment of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act has left no room for an overlapping dual system of the sort which the Court now espouses by placing its decision on a new doctrine that recovery under either the state or the federal act is to be sustained if the case is thought a close one. Section 5 of the Act, 33 U.S.C.  905, 33 U.S.C.A .  905, provides that the employer's liability under it 'shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer to the employee, his legal representative, husband or wife, parents, dependents, next of kin, and anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages from such employer at law or in admiralty on account of such injury or death ....' See Nogueira v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co., \n281 \nU.S. 128, 137\n, 50 S.Ct. 303, 305. I cannot say that this section does not mean what it says. If there is liability under the federal act, that liability is exclusive. It follows that in any case in which compensation might have been awarded under the federal act, a recovery under state law is in plain derogation of the terms of the federal statute, as construed in the Motor Boat case, supra. \n1\n Congress has made it our duty, before we sanction a recovery under state law, to ascertain that an award under the federal act can not be had. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 249, 262]\n\u00a0\n The proposition that an employee in a 'twilight zone' (where it is doubtful whether the federal or a state act applies) can recover under either act, not only controverts the words of the statute but also imposes an unauthorized burden on the employer. Besides being subjected to a liability which the statute forbids, he is compelled, in order to protect himself in the large number of cases in which the Court apparently would allow recovery under either act, to comply with both. Under the federal act, the employer must post security for compensation in a manner specified in  32, 33 U.S.C.  932, 33 U.S.C.A.  932, and failure to do so is a misdemeanor,  38, 33 U.S.C.  938, 33 U.S.C.A.  938, punishable by fine and imprisonment. Under state acts, there is an obligation to contribute insurance premiums, or take some comparable step, to say nothing of penal sanctions which a state may impose.\n Congress has directed that if the case is within the federal statute, the employer shall be relieved of all other obligation. But in order to relieve the employee in a doubtful case of the necessity of filing two claims, one under each act, a double burden is imposed on the employer by an inadmissible construction of the federal act. The dual system of presumptions, which are to operate in favor of the employee but apparently never against him, will serve to sustain an exercise of either state or federal jurisdiction in every case within the so-called 'twilight zone'. But this is accomplished only by depriving employers of the immunity which Congress sought to confer when it set up a system in which federal and state acts are made mutually exclusive.\n Although the basic question in these cases is said to be 'factual', the twilight zone doctrine does not reveal how-in view of the great weight which is to be given the federal commissioner's finding, as in the Motor Boat case-we can in this case disregard the findings of four state \n\n[317 \nU.S. 249, 263]\n\u00a0\n tribunals,2 or what the function of this Court is to be in cases where the federal and the state commissioners both find against jurisdiction, or how the line which marks the doubtful case is to be drawn more readily than that which, under the Jensen doctrine, separates state from federal power.\n Notwithstanding the ruling in the Motor Boat case that Congress had adopted the Jensen boundary of federal jurisdiction, there are in the present case special circumstances which take it out of that ruling and leave us free to reconsider Jensen's constitutional basis. The exclusive liability section of the federal statute contains a proviso that if the employer fails to give security for payment of compensation, as required, then the employee may elect to claim compensation under the federal statute, 'or to maintain an action at law or in admiralty'. The purpose of this proviso seems to be to preserve to the employee all remedies which he might otherwise have had, in the event that the employer does not give the prescribed security. Since this record does not show that the employer complied, petitioner is free to pursue any available remedy which the Constitution permits and which the state may choose to afford.\n Only if the Court were to overrule the Jensen case in its constitutional aspects could I join in a reversal of the judgment here. If we are to continue to apply the Jensen \n\n[317 \nU.S. 249, 264]\n\u00a0\n doctrine, even when not required to do so by the federal act, then our own decisions, including the recent Motor Boat case, preclude a reversal of the Washington courts. Escape from Jensen's embarrassments by the adoption of the twilight zone doctrine, in disregard of the jurisdictional command of the federal statute, is plainly not permissible. I am not persuaded that it is practicable. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This Article extends the jurisdiction of Federal Courts 'to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Cases which lend strength to petitioner's position are: Sultan Railway & Timber Co. v.

PINK(1942)\nNo. 466\nArgued: Decided: December 21, 1942\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied Apr. 5, 1943. See \n318 \nU.S. 801\n, 63 S.Ct. 850, 87 L.Ed. --. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 264, 265]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Walter R. Johnson, of Lincoln, Neb., and Howard Saxton, of Omaha, Neb., for petitioner.\n Mr. Edward F. Keenan, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n This case is here on a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of New York. It appears from the record that a judgment of that court was affirmed by an order of the Appellate Division, 263 App.Div. 937, 33 N.Y.S. 2d 109, which was on June 18, 1942 ordered affirmed by the Court of Appeals, 288 N.Y. 712, 43 N.E.2d 93, whose remittitur to the Supreme Court was issued the same day. On June 25 the order and judgment of the Court of Appeals were made the order and judgment of the Supreme Court. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 264, 266]\n\u00a0\n A motion was afterwards filed in the Court of Appeals to amend its remittitur by adding to it the statement that a federal question, on which the petition for certiorari relies, was presented and necessarily passed upon in that court. So far as appears, the motion did not seek a reargument or rehearing of any part of the case; it was no more than a request that the Court of Appeals declare what had in fact occurred upon its previous decision of the case. On July 29 the Court of Appeals granted the motion and amended its remittitur accordingly. 289 N.Y. 624, 43 N.E.2d 840. On September 16, the Supreme Court directed that the order amending the remittitur be made the order of the Supreme Court. The petition for certiorari was filed in this Court on October 20.\n Under the three-months limitation imposed by the statute, 28 U.S.C.  350, 28 U.S.C.A.  350, the petition for certiorari is timely only if the amendment of the remittitur extended the time within which to apply for certiorari. We are unable to conclude that it had such effect. Unlike a motion for reargument or rehearing, it did not seek to have the Court of Appeals reconsider any question decided in the case. The final judgment already rendered was not challenged; what was sought was merely the court's certification that a federal question had been presented to it for decision, and this could have no different effect on the finality of the judgment than a like amendment of the court's opinion.\n A timely petition for rehearing tolls the running of the three-months period because it operates to suspend the finality of the state court's judgment, pending the court's further determination whether the judgment should be modified so as to alter its adjudication of the rights of the parties. Here no such alteration of the rights adjudicated was asked, and the finality of the court's first order was never suspended. Accordingly we must deny the petition \n\n[317 \nU.S. 264, 267]\n\u00a0\n for certiorari on the ground that it was not filed within the time provided by law.\n Certain questions with respect to the timeliness of applications for review of state court judgments, which are now pending before us in petitions for rehearing in two cases, have recurred so frequently that we think it appropriate to add a word for the guidance of the Bar. It is true that our writ to review a judgment of the highest court of a state may properly run to a lower court where the record is physically lodged, and where under New York practice a judgment is entered upon the remittitur of the Court of Appeals. It is nevertheless immaterial whether the record is physically lodged in the one court or the other, since we have ample power to obtain it from either. Atherton v. Fowler, \n91 \nU.S. 143\n, 146. In reliance upon the early decision in Green v. Van Buskerk, 3 Wall. 448, the period for appeal or application for certiorari has on occasion been computed not from the judgment or order of the New York Court of Appeals, but from the judgment subsequently entered by the lower court upon the Court of Appeals' remittitur. This practice, which is a departure from the rule applied to cases from other states, is inconsistent with our many decisions on the nature of a final judgment under  237 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  344, 28 U.S.C.A.  344, and cannot be sanctioned. See especially Chief Justice Waite's opinion in Mower v. Fletcher, \n114 \nU.S. 127\n, 5 S.Ct. 799, where a state appellate court's judgment was held to be final and reviewable when it ended the litigation by fully determining the rights of the parties, so that nothing remained to be done by the lower court except the ministerial act of entering the judgment which the appellate court had directed. See also Wurts v. Hoagland, \n105 \nU.S. 701\n, 702, and Clark v. Williard, \n292 \nU.S. 112, 117\n, 118 S., 54 S.Ct. 615. This rule applies with equal force to cases from New York, \n\n[317 \nU.S. 264, 268]\n\u00a0\n in which the judgment or order of the Court of Appeals is reviewable here as a final judgment when the record reveals that it leaves nothing to be done by the lower court except the ministerial act of entering judgment on the remittitur. Such an order is, within the meaning of  237 of the Judicial Code, a final judgment reviewable here.\n For the purpose of the finality which is prerequisite to a review in this Court, the test is not whether under local rules of practice the judgment is denominated final (Wick v. Superior Court, \n278 \nU.S. 575\n, 49 S. Ct. 94; Cheltenham & Abbington Sewerage Company v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, \n317 \nU.S. 588\n, 63 S.Ct. 38, 87 L.Ed . --, decided October 12, 1942), but rather whether the record shows that the order of the appellate court has in fact fully adjudicated rights and that the adjudication is not subject to further review by a state court. See Gorman v. Washington University, \n316 \nU.S. 98\n, 62 S.Ct. 962. Where the order or judgment is final in this sense, the time for applying to this Court runs from the date of the appellate court's order, since the object of the statute is to limit the applicant's time to three months from the date when the finality of the judgment for purposes of review is established.\n It was for this reason that we recently held that the three-months requirement had not been complied with in Monks v. Lee, \n317 \nU.S. 590\n, 63 S. Ct. 50, 87 L.Ed. --, and Bunn v. City of Atlanta, \n317 \nU.S. 666\n, 63 S.Ct. 73, 87 L.Ed. --, in which cases judgments were brought here for review from the courts of California and Georgia, and in each of which a petition for rehearing is today denied. The petition for certiorari in this case must likewise be denied for want of jurisdiction.\n So ordered.\n Petition dismissed. \n\n\n\n","28":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDUNCAN v.

On that day, upon Duncan's signing an instrument presented to him by the company's claim agent, he was paid $600 'for living and other expenses pending further developments as to the extent and effect of said injuries and negotiations for settlement of (his) claim.' The instrument also stated that:\n'In consideration of said payment of $600.00, I agree with said Trustee that I will endeavor, in good faith, to adjust and settle any claim I may have for my injuries without resorting to litigation, but I agree that if my claim is not so adjusted, and I elect to bring suit, I will first return the said sum of $600.00 to said Trustee and said return shall be a prerequisite to the filing and maintenance of any such suit.'\n\n About eight months later, April 4, 1938, negotiations for settlement not having been successful, Duncan, without returning the $600, sued the respondent in a Missouri state court, charging that his injuries resulted from the negligence of the respondent's servants or agents. Among other pleadings the respondent filed a plea in abatement alleging that 'this suit and action have been begun and commenced by plaintiff without the pre- requisite return to defendant trustee of said sum of $600, ... and this action is pre-mature and should be dismissed by the Court.' Duncan replied that the agreement, so far as it purported to create a condition precedent to bringing suit, was void under Section 5 of the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 35 Stat. 65, 66, which in part provides:\n'Any contract, rule, regulation, or device whatsoever, the purpose or intent of which shall be to enable any common carrier to exempt itself from any liability created by this Act (chapter), shall to that extent be void ....' \n\n[315 \nU.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n The trial judge held the agreement did not bar Duncan's suit, but submitted the issues of negligence to the jury with instructions that if their verdict should be for him the railroad would be entitled to a credit of $600 and interest. The verdict was for Duncan and after appropriate subtraction for the prior payment to him, judgment for $5,000 was entered in his favor. The Springfield Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the invalidating effect of Section 5 does not extend to contracts made after an employee is injured, 146 S.W.2d 112, and the Missouri Supreme Court declined to review its action.\n\n In Philadelphia, Baltimore & Washington R. Co. v. Schubert, \n224 \nU.S. 603, 611\n, 32 S.Ct. 589, 591, this Court referred to Section 5 as follows:\n'The evident purpose of Congress was to enlarge the scope of the section, and to make it more comprehensive by a generic, rather than a specific, description. It thus brings within its purview 'any contract, rule, regulation, or device whatsoever, the purpose or intent of which shall be to enable any common carrier to exempt itself from any liability created by this act.' It includes every variety of agreement or arrangement of this nature ....'\n\n While this interpretation is broad enough to bring within Section 5 contracts made after as well as before the injury, the agreement at issue in the Schubert case was made prior to the injury, and the actual decision therefore does not control agreements which, like that now before us, are made after the injury has occurred. Moreover, several state courts have expressed the view that contracts made after the injury has occurred are not invalidated by Section 5. See, e.g., Ballenger v. Southern R. Co., 106 S.C. 200, 203, 90 S.E. 1019; Patton v. Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co., 59 Okl. 155, 156, 158 P. 576; Lindsay v. Acme Cement Plaster Co., 220 Mich. 367, 377, 190 N.W. 275; Carlson v. Northern Pac. R. Co., 82 Mont. 559, 568, 268 P. 549, 58 A.L.R. 1304. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n Because of this divergence of judicial opinion as to the interpretation of Section 5, and because the scope of Section 5 is of fundamental importance in the administration of the Federal Employers' Liability Act, we granted certiorari.\n Section 3 of the first Federal Employers' Liability Act1 passed by Congress in 1906 provided that 'no contract of employment, insurance, relief benefit, or indemnity for injury or death entered into by or on behalf of any employee, nor the acceptance of any such insurance, relief benefit, or indemnity by the person entitled thereto, shall constitute any bar or defense to any action brought to recover damages for personal injuries to or death of such employee. ...' The court below, taking the position that the word 'contract' as used in Section 3 referred only to contracts entered into before the injury occurred, concluded that Section 5 of the present act is no broader in this respect, but merely includes contracts, rules, regulations, or devices in effect before the injury. In our opinion, the difference in the language of the two sections and the legislative history of the later one cannot be reconciled with this conclusion.\n It is clear from the Congressional committee hearings and reports on the Federal Employers' Liability Act now in force not only that close study was made of the entire 1906 Act and in particular of Section 3, but also that considerable attention was given to state employers' liability acts and experience under them. Section 3 was incorporated verbatim in one of the two bills introduced in the Senate, but it was the bill containing the broader language of the present Section 5 that survived consideration. See Hearings on S. 3080, February 20, 1908, p. 3, and compare Senate Report No. 460, 60th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 4. Without more, the change from 'contract' to 'any contract, rule, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n regulation, or device whatsoever' would seem to be an enlargement ample to include agreements made after the event of injury.\n But there is more. Under the state acts there had been widespread attempts by employers to contract themselves out of the liabilities the acts were intended to impose. State legislatures had responded to this practice by adopting provisions which proscribed employer-employee agreements intended to deprive employees of the statutory benefits. These provisions varied in scope and language. Some declared agreements attempting to exempt employers from liability void only when they were part of contracts of employment. One state, although not limiting the statutory invalidation to contracts of employment, specifically restricted it to agreements 'entered into prior to the injury.' Other states, presumably after experience had shown that narrower limitations were inadequate to stamp out ingenious evasions of the statutory responsibilities, adopted measures invalidating agreements of any type, regardless of when made, which attempted to exempt employers from liability. House Report No. 1386, 60th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 30-75.\n The report of the House Judiciary Committee on the second Federal Employers' Liability Act set out all of the state statutes then in effect. Because the various state measures directed against contractual arrangements intended to exempt employers from liability were thus laid before Congress, the rejection of the restrictive language of Section 3 of the old act indicates a deliberate abandonment of the limitations of that section. And the adoption of Section 5 of the present act without adding any of the other limitations which some of the state statutes had embodied argues persuasively that Congress wanted Section 5 to have the full effect that its comprehensive phraseology implies. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n Concluding that the phrase 'any contract, rule, regulation, or device whatsoever' as used in Section 5 comprehends the instrument signed by Duncan long after he had been injured, we turn to the remaining question: whether 'the purpose or intent' of the instrument was to enable the respondent 'to exempt itself from any liability created by (the) Act ( chapter).' The instrument prepared by the respondent for Duncan's signature purported to create a condition precedent to his bringing suit, the refunding of $600. By its terms, unless this condition were satisfied- and in view of Duncan's straitened circumstances the probability of satisfaction would seem negligible-Duncan's only means of enforcing such liabilities as should have been assumed by the respondent would be taken from him. Hence, the agreement, if valid, would effectively exempt the respondent from liability under the act no matter what the merits of Duncan's claim.\n The respondent contends, however, that Section 5 does not invalidate compromises of disputed claims, and that the agreement here is in the nature of a conditional compromise. We need not here determine what limitations, if any, Section 5 places upon the validity of agreements not to sue if made in consideration of a bona fide compromise and settlement of claims arising under the act, because the very language of the agreement indicates it is not a compromise and settlement. While the agreement does contemplate the possibility of future settlement, it expressly stated that the $600 was advanced 'for living and other expenses pending further developments is to the extent and effect of ... injuries and negotiations for settlement of (the) claim.' And the claim agent of the respondent testified that the agreement was in a form regularly used by the respondent when its employees 'had a long disability period like he ( Duncan) had had ... to tide \n\n[315 \nU.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n them over until they had their recovery before we negotiate final settlement.' We are unpersuaded, therefore, by any argument which depends upon treating the agreement signed by Duncan as a compromise.\n The judgment of the Springfield Court of Appeals is\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 34 Stat. 232.

Vanderbilt, of Newark, N.J., and Jack Rinzler, of Passaic, N.J., for Adrian Ettelson and others.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals has certified the following question:\n In a civil action in a district court upon a claim of a character formerly cognizable at law in which the defendant has filed a counterclaim of a character formerly cognizable in equity (or in an action at law under the provisions of Section 274b1 of the Judicial Code), is an order that the issue raised by the counterclaim shall be heard and disposed of by the court prior to the issue raised by the complaint an order granting an injunction within the meaning of Section 1292 of the Judicial Code and therefore appealable under that section?\n From the certificate it appears that the question arises upon these facts: The plaintiffs filed, in a New Jersey State Court, a complaint in five counts to recover amounts alleged to be due plaintiffs by the defendant on life insur- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 188, 190]\n\u00a0\n ance policies issued by it upon the life of Richard Ettelson, deceased. The cause was removed to the United States District Court for New Jersey. Plaintiffs demanded a jury trial. The defendant filed an answer in the District Court setting up that the policies were obtained by the fraud of the insured and are void because of material false statements made by the insured in the application for the policies. The answer did not allege that the false statements were knowingly and intentionally made.\n With the answer the defendant filed a counterclaim alleging that the policies were obtained by the fraud of the insured and are void because of the material false statements made by him in the application; and prayed that the policies be decreed void upon the return by the defendant of the premiums paid thereon, and that the plaintiffs be enjoined from further prosecuting the action at law. The plaintiffs moved for dismissal of the counterclaim on the ground that the defendant has an adequate remedy at law on the law side of the court in the pending action in which issue has been joined; and further that the counterclaim fails to state a claim upon which equitable relief can or should be granted by the court.\n The District Court denied the motion to dismiss and ordered that the counterclaim should be heard and disposed of by the court sitting in equity prior to trial of the issue made by the complaint and answer in the action at law. 42 F.Supp. 488. The plaintiffs thereupon appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals and the defendant moved that court to dismiss the appeal in the view that the District Court's order is not appealable.\n The parties agree that, if the question had arisen prior to the adoption of the Rules of Civil Procedure,3 our decision in Enelow v. New York Life Insurance Company, \n293 \nU.S. 379\n, 55 S.Ct. 310, would require an affirmative answer to the question. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 188, 191]\n\u00a0\n The defendant asserts, and the plaintiffs deny, that the rules require a negative answer. The defendant points to Rule 1 which states that the object of the rules is 'to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action'; and more particularly to Rule 2 which declares that 'there shall be one form of action to be known as 'civil action\".\n The defendant's contention, in brief, is that whereas, when the Enelow case was decided, the distinction between actions at law and suits in equity in federal courts still persisted, this distinction has now been abolished; that equitable defenses, whether a bar to plaintiffs' recovery at law or the basis of affirmative relief against the plaintiffs, are part and parcel of the single action initiated by the plaintiffs and that any direction by the court respecting the order in which the claim and the counterclaim are to be heard is interlocutory, amounting, at most, to a stay of the trial of one branch of the litigation, and in no sense an injunction against the plaintiffs. We cannot agree.\n At the argument of the cause much time was devoted to the applicable law of New Jersey where the action originated. It was urged that, under that law, upon allegation and proof of innocent misrepresentations inducing the issue of a policy, an insurer is entitled to a decree cancelling the policy and restraining any action at law upon it. It was urged that this feature of the local law must be considered in determining the appealability of the District Court's order. But, whatever effect should be given the New Jersey law in determining the correctness of the District Judge's action, the local law has no bearing upon the decision of the narrow question certified.\n As in the Enelow case, so here, the result of the District Judge's order is the postponement of trial of the jury action based upon the policies; and it may, in practical \n\n[317 \nU.S. 188, 192]\n\u00a0\n effect, terminate that action. It is as effective in these respects as an injunction issued by a chancellor. If the order be found to be erroneous it will have to be set aside and the plaintiffs permitted to pursue their action to judgment. The plaintiffs are, therefore, in the present instance, in no different position than if a state equity court had restrained them from proceeding in the law action. Nor are they differently circumstanced than was the plaintiff in the Enelow case. The relief afforded by section 129 is not restricted by the terminology used. The statute looks to the substantial effect of the order made. Enelow v. New York Life Insurance Co ., supra, 293 U.S. at page 383, 55 S.Ct. at page 311. Compare General Electric Co. v.

Gallagher, of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner, born in Japan, became a resident of the United States in 1905. April 15, 1941, he filed a libel in admiralty against the vessel Rally in the District Court for the Southern District of California. He claimed wages were due him for services as a seaman and fisherman on the Rally, and sought an allowance for maintenance and cure on allegations that he had sustained severe injuries while engaged in the performance of his duties. Claimants of the vessel appeared and filed an answer on grounds not here material, but later, on January 20, 1942, moved to abate the action on the ground that petitioner, by reason of the state of war then existing between Japan and the United States, had become an enemy alien and therefore had no 'right to prosecute any action in any \n\n[317 \nU.S. 69, 71]\n\u00a0\n court of the United States during the pendency of said war.' The District Judge granted the motion. Petitioner sought mandamus in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to compel the District Court to vacate its judgment and proceed to trial of his action, but his motion for leave to file was denied without opinion. We granted leave to file in this Court, \n316 \nU.S. 650\n, 62 S.Ct. 1301, and the cause was submitted on answer, briefs and oral argument.\n Although the Court's order of abatement for the duration of the war rested solely on the ground of petitioner's status as an alien enemy, it has been argued here that the writ should be denied because the Court could have dismissed the bill on other grounds, particularly claimed defects in the allegations of the libel. These contentions are irrelevant here. Unless the action was properly abated for the reasons set out in the motion and the Court's order, the petitioner is entitled to have the District Court proceed with his action and pass upon the sufficiency of his allegations. This is an essential step in an orderly trial leading to a final judgment from which an appeal will lie to correct errors. If the Court's order of abatement was erroneous, mandamus is the appropriate remedy. 28 U.S.C. 377, 28 U.S.C.A.  377; McClellan v. Carland, \n217 \nU.S. 268\n, 279-282, 30 S.Ct. 501, 503, 504; Ex parte Metropolitan Water Co., \n220 \nU.S. 539, 546\n, 31 S.Ct. 600, 603.\n'Alien enemy' as applied to petitioner is at present but the legal definition of his status because he was born in Japan with which we are at war. Nothing in this record indicates, and we cannot assume, that he came to America for any purpose different from that which prompted millions of others to seek our shores-a chance to make his home and work in a free country, governed by just laws, which promise equal protection to all who abide by them. His suit invokes the protection of those laws through our courts both to obtain payment of wages alleged to have been promised him by American citizens for lawful work \n\n[317 \nU.S. 69, 72]\n\u00a0\n and reimbursement on account of damages suffered while working for those citizens.\n\n Petitioner contends that he has the right under the common law and treaties to proceed with his action, and that this right is not limited by the statutes. In our view the possibility of treaty rights, which has not been argued extensively, need not be considered. Applicable treaties are ambiguous and should not be interpreted without more care than is necessary in this case. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n There doubtless was a time when the common law of England would have supported dismissal of petitioner's action, but that time has long since passed. A number of early English decisions, based on a group concept which made little difference between friends and enemies barred all aliens from the courts. This rule was gradually relaxed as to friendly aliens2 until finally in Wells v. Williams, 1 Ld.Raym. 282 (1698), the Court put the necessities of trade ahead of whatever advantages had been \n\n[317 \nU.S. 69, 73]\n\u00a0\n imagined to exist in the old rule, and held that enemy aliens in England under license from the Crown might proceed in the courts. As applied ever since, alien enemies residing in England have been permitted to maintain actions, while those in the land of the enemy were not; and this modern, humane principle has been applied even when the alien was interned as is petitioner here. \n3\n Schaffenius v. Goldberg, (1916) 1 K.B. 284.\n The original English common law rule, long ago abandoned there, was, from the beginning, objectionable here. The policy of severity toward alien enemies was clearly impossible for a country whose life blood came from an immigrant stream. In the war of 1812, for example, many persons born in England fought on the American side. \n4\n Harshness toward immigrants was inconsistent with that national knowledge, present then as now, of the contributions made in peace and war by the millions of immigrants who have learned to love the country of their adoption more than the country of their birth. Hence in 1813\n\n\n\n\n[317 \nU.S. 69, 74]\n\u00a0\n Chief Justice Kent, in Clarke v. Morey, 10 Johns., N.Y., 69, 72, set the legal pattern which, with sporadic exceptions, has since been followed. \n5\n The core of that decision he put in these words: 'A lawful residence implies protection, and a capacity to sue and be sued. A contrary doctrine would be repugnant to sound policy, no less than to justice and humanity.' 6 Thus the courts aligned their policy with that enjoined upon the President by Congress in 1812 when it directed him to administer the laws controlling aliens in a manner that would be 'consistent with public safety, and according to the dictates of humanity and national hospitality.' 50 U.S.C.  22, 50 U.S.C.A.  22.\n In asking that the rights of resident aliens be abrogated in their behalf, private litigants in effect seek to stand in the position of government. But only the government, and not the private individual, isvested with the power to protect all the people, including loyal aliens, from possible injury by disloyal aliens. If the public welfare demands that this alien shall not receive compensation for his work or payment for his injuries received in the course of his employment, the government can make the decision without allowing a windfall to those claimants. Even if petitioner were a nonresident enemy alien, it might be more appropriate to release the amount of his claim to the \n\n[317 \nU.S. 69, 75]\n\u00a0\n Alien Property Custodian rather than to the claimants; and this is precisely what was done in Birge-Forbes Co. v. Heye, \n251 \nU.S. 317, 323\n, 40 S.Ct. 160, 161, in which this Court said that the sole objection to giving judgment for an alien enemy 'goes only so far as it would give aid and comfort to the other side.' The ancient rule against suits by resident alien enemies has survived only so far as necessary to prevent use of the courts to accomplish a purpose which might hamper our own war efforts or give aid to the enemy. This may be taken as the sound principle of the common law today.\n It is argued that the petitioner is barred from the courts by the Trading With the Enemy Act, 50 U.S.C.Appendix  1 et seq., 50 U.S.C.A. Appendix  1 et seq. The particular clause relied on is Sec. 7: 'Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to authorize the prosecution of any suit or action at law or in equity in any court within the United States by an enemy or ally of enemy prior to the end of the war, except as provided in Section 10 hereof (which relates to patents). ...' Analysis of its terms makes clear that this section was not meant to apply to petitioner, and an examination of its legislative history makes this doubly certain. Section 7 bars from the courts only an 'enemy or ally of enemy.' Section 2 of the Act defines the 'alien enemy' to which the Act applies as those residing within the territory owned or occupied by the enemy; the enemy government or its officers,7 or citizens \n\n[317 \nU.S. 69, 76]\n\u00a0\n of an enemy nation, wherever residing, as the President by proclamation may include within the definition. Since the President has not under this Act8 made any declaration as to enemy aliens, the Act does not bar petitioner from maintaining his suit.\n This interpretation, compelled by the words of the Act, is wholly in accord with its general scope, for the Trading With the Enemy Act was never intended, without Presidential proclamation, to affect resident aliens at all. Prior to the passage of the Act, the courts had consistently held that during a state of war, commercial intercourse between our nationals and nonresident alien enemies, unless specifically authorized by Congress and the Executive, was absolutely prohibited, and that contracts made in such intercourse were void and unenforceable. \n9\n This strict barrier could be relaxed only by Congressional direction, and therefore the Act was passed with its declared purpose 'to mitigate the rules of law which prohibit all intercourse between the citizens of warring nations, and to permit under careful safeguards and restrictions, certain kinds of business to be carried on.' \n10\n Thus Congress expressly recognized by the passage of the Act that 'the more enlightened views of the present day as to treat- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 69, 77]\n\u00a0\n ment of enemies makes possible certain relaxations in the old law.' \n11\n\u00a0\n\n Since the purpose of the bill was to permit certain relations with non-resident alien enemies, there is no frustration of its purpose in permitting resident aliens to sue in our courts. Statements made on the floor of the House of Representatives by the sponsor of the bill make this interpretation conclusive. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n Not only has the President not seen fit to use the authority possessed by him under the Trading With the Enemy Act to exclude resident aliens from the Courts, but his administration has adopted precisely the opposite program. The Attorney General is primarily responsible for the administration of alien affairs. He has construed the existing statutes and proclamations as not barring this petitioner from our courts,13 and this stand is em- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 69, 78]\n\u00a0\n phasized by the government's appearance in behalf of petitioner in this case. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n The consequence of this legislative and administrative policy is a clear authorization to resident enemy aliens to proceed in all courts until administrative or legislative action is taken to exclude them. Were this not true, contractual promises made to them by individuals, as well as promises held out to them under our laws, would become no more than teasing illusions. The doors of our courts have not been shut to peaceable law-abiding aliens seeking to enforce rights growing out of legal occupations. Let the writ issue.\n Writ issued. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Petitioner argues that his case is covered by article 23h of the Annex to the IVth Hague Convention of 1907: 'It is especially prohibited ... to declare abolished, suspended, or inadmissible in a Court of law the rights and action of the nationals of the hostile party.' This clause, which was added to the Convention of 1899 without substantial discussion either by the Delegates in General Assembly or by the committee and sub- committee which dealt with it, III Proceedings of the Hague Convention of 1907, 12, 107, 136, 240; and I ibid. 83, was construed by an English Court to apply solely in enemy areas occupied by a belligerent. Porter v. Freudenberg, (1915) 1 K.B. 857. The question has not been raised in the courts in this country, but the English interpretation was repeated with approval by Representative Montague of the Interstate Commerce Committee in his address to the House when he presented to it the Trading With the Enemy Act, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix  1 et seq. 55 Cong.Rec. 4842 (1917). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] According to Littleton, an alien might not sue in either a real or personal action; but this rule was modified by Coke to bar such actions only by alien enemies and to permit personal actions by alien friends. See Coke on Littleton 129b. Pollock and Maitland suggest that this modification by Coke was 'a bold treatment of a carefully worded text.' 1 History of English Law, 2d ed., 459. The early law treated all aliens as a group. See the sub-titles of Pollock and Maitland's chapter, 'The Sorts and Conditions of Men', some of which are: The Knights, The Unfree, The Clergy, Aliens, The Jews, Women, etc. Ibid., Chap. II. For a summary of English views now largely obsolete on alien standing in court see Hansard, Law Relating to Aliens, chap. 7 (1844). For a survey of the common law on inheritance of land by aliens see Techt v. Hughes, 229 N.Y. 222, 128 N.E. 185, 11 A.L.R. 166, Cardozo, J. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Petitioner was interned some months after the court had abated his action. The government has filed a supplemental brief stating that it does not consider that this circumstance alters the position of petitioner in respect to his privilege of access to the courts. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] One writer estimates that half of the 400 men on board the Constitution when it captured the Guerriere were seamen who had deserted the British, and the ship United States was reported by its captain to have no men on board who had not served with British war ships.

He accepted so much of that doctrine as required enemy aliens entitled to relief in the courts to have entered the country under safe conduct or license. Story on Civil Pleadings, p. 10; Story's Equity Pleadings, Sec. 51-54, and particularly Sec. 724. This requirement was reduced to legal fiction in Clarke v. Morey, supra, 10 Johns., N.Y., at page 72, when Chief Justice Kent held that 'The license is implied by law and the usage of nations.' \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Some possible confusion on the part of the Court below and of other courts may have developed from our per curiam opinion in Ex parte Colonna, \n314 \nU.S. 510\n, 62 S.Ct. 373, in which leave to file a petition for writs of prohibition and mandamus in connection with a proceeding brought in behalf of the Italian government was denied on the basis of the Trading With the Enemy Act. That opinion emphasized that an enemy government was included within the definition of the classification 'enemy' as used in that act, and that such enemy plaintiffs had no right to prosecute actions in our courts. The decision has no bearing on the rights of resident enemy aliens. The Colonna decision was momentarily misapplied in Kaufman v. Eisenberg, 177 Misc. 939, 32 N.Y.S.2d 450, but the trial judge corrected a stay in proceedings he had previously allowed upon his further consideration of the fact that the plaintiff was a resident alien. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The President has issued a Proclamation taking certain steps with reference to alien enemies under the Alien Enemy Act of 1798 as amended, 50 U.S.C.  21, 50 U.S.C.A.  21, but this Proclamation has no bearing on the power of the President under the Trading With the Enemy Act. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] Report of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Report No. 111, 65th Cong., 1st Sess., pages 15-22.

The government has an elaborate protective program. Under the Alien Enemy Act, 50 U.S.C.  21, 50 U.S.C.A.  21, the President has ordered the internment of aliens, has instituted a system of identification, and has regulated travel.

Royall, of Raleigh, N.C., for petitioners.\n\n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Francis B. Biddle, Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n In these causes motions for leave to file petitions for habeas corpus were presented to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which entered orders denying the motions. Motions for leave to file petitions for habeas corpus were then presented to this Court, and the merits of the applications were fully argued at the Special Term of Court convened on July 29, 1942. Counsel for petitioners subsequently filed a notice of appeal from the order of the District Court to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and they have perfected their appeals to that court. They have presented to this Court petitions for writs of certiorari before judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  347( a), 28 U.S.C.A.  347(a). The petitions are granted. In accordance with the stipulation between counsel for petitioners and for the respondent, the papers filed and argument had in connection with the applications for leave to file petitions for habeas corpus are made applicable to the certiorari proceedings.\n The Court has fully considered the questions raised in these cases and thoroughly argued at the bar, and has reached its conclusion upon them. It now announces its decision and enters its judgment in each case, in advance of the preparation of a full opinion which necessarily will require a considerable period of time for its preparation and which, when prepared, will be filed with the Clerk.\n The Court holds:\n\n\n (1)\n That the charges preferred against petitioners on which they are being tried by military commission appointed by the order of the President of July 2, 1942, allege an offense or offenses which the President is authorized to order tried before a military commission. (2) That the military commission was lawfully constituted. (3) That petitioners are held in lawful custody, for trial before the military commission, and have not shown cause for being discharged by writ of habeas corpus. The motions for leave to file petitions for writs of habeas corpus are denied. The orders of the District Court are affirmed. The mandates are directed to issue forthwith.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases. \n\n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases are brought here by petitioners' several applications for leave to file petitions for habeas corpus in this Court, and by their petitions for certiorari to review orders of the District Court for the District of Columbia, which denied their applications for leave to file petitions for habeas corpus in that court.\n The question for decision is whether the detention of petitioners by respondent for trial by Military Commission, appointed by Order of the President of July 2, 1942, \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n on charges preferred against them purporting to set out their violations of the law of war and of the Articles of War, is in conformity to the laws and Constitution of the United States.\n After denial of their applications by the District Court, 47 F.Supp. 431, petitioners asked leave to file petitions for habeas corpus in this Court. In view of the public importance of the questions raised by their petitions and of the duty which rests on the courts, in time of war as well as in time of peace, to preserve unimpaired the constitutional safeguards of civil liberty, and because in our opinion the public interest required that we consider and decide those questions without any avoidable delay, we directed that petitioners' applications be set down for full oral argument at a special term of this Court, convened on July 29, 1942. The applications for leave to file the petitions were presented in open court on that day and were heard on the petitions, the answers to them of respondent, a stipulation of facts by counsel, and the record of the testimony given before the Commission.\n While the argument was proceeding before us, petitioners perfected their appeals from the orders of the District Court to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and thereupon filed with this \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 20]\n\u00a0\n Court petitions for certiorari to the Court of Appeals before judgment, pursuant to Section 240(a) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  347(a), 28 U. S.C.A.  347(a). We granted certiorari before judgment for the reasons which moved us to convene the special term of Court. In accordance with the stipulation of counsel we treat the record, briefs and arguments in the habeas corpus proceedings in this Court as the record, briefs and arguments upon the writs of certiorari.\n On July 31, 1942, after hearing argument of counsel and after full consideration of all questions raised, this Court affirmed the orders of the District Court and denied petitioners' applications for leave to file petitions for habeas corpus. By per curiam opinion, \n317 \nU.S. 1\n, 63 S.Ct. 1, 87 L.Ed. --, we announced the decision of the Court, and that the full opinion in the causes would be prepared and filed with the Clerk.\n The following facts appear from the petitions or are stipulated. Except as noted they are undisputed.\n All the petitioners were born in Germany; all have lived in the United States. All returned to Germany between 1933 and 1941. All except petitioner Haupt are admittedly citizens of the German Reich, with which the United States is at war. Haupt came to this country with his parents when he was five years old; it is contended that he became a citizen of the United States by virtue of the naturalization of his parents during his minority and that he has not since lost his citizenship. The Government, however, takes the position that on attaining his majority he elected to maintain German allegiance and citizenship or in any case that he has by his conduct renounced or abandoned his United States citizenship. See Perkins v. Elg, \n307 \nU.S. 325, 334\n, 59 S.Ct. 884, 889; United States ex rel. Rojak v. Marshall, D.C., 34 F.2d 219; United States ex rel. Scimeca v. Husband, 2 Cir., 6 F.2d 957, 958; 8 U.S.C.  801, 8 U.S. C.A.  801, and compare 8 U.S.C.  808, 8 U.S.C.A.  808. For reasons presently to be stated we do not find it necessary to resolve these contentions. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 21]\n\u00a0\n After the declaration of war between the United States and the German Reich, petitioners received training at a sabotage school near Berlin, Germany, where they were instructed in the use of explosives and in methods of secret writing. Thereafter petitioners, with a German citizen, Dasch, proceeded from Germany to a seaport in Occupied France, where petitioners Burger, Heinck and Quirin, together with Dasch, boarded a German submarine which proceeded across the Atlantic to Amagansett Beach on Long Island, New York. The four were there landed from the submarine in the hours of darkness, on or about June 13, 1942, carrying with them a supply of explosives, fuses and incendiary and timing devices. While landing they wore German Marine Infantry uniforms or parts of uniforms. Immediately after landing they buried their uniforms and the other articles mentioned and proceeded in civilian dress to New York City.\n The remaining four petitioners at the same French port boarded another German submarine, which carried them across the Atlantic to Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. On or about June 17, 1942, they came ashore during the hours of darkness wearing caps of the German Marine Infantry and carrying with them a supply of explosives, fuses, and incendiary and timing devices. They immediately buried their caps and the other articles mentioned and proceeded in civilian dress to Jacksonville, Florida, and thence to various points in the United States. All were taken into custody in New York or Chicago by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. All had received instructions in Germany from an officer of the German High Command to destroy war industries and war facilities in the United States, for which they or their relatives in Germany were to receive salary payments from the German Government. They also had been paid by the German Government during their course of training at the sabotage school and had received substantial sums in \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 22]\n\u00a0\n United States currency, which were in their possession when arrested. The currency had been handed to them by an officer of the German High Command, who had instructed them to wear their German uniforms while landing in the United States. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The President, as President and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, by Order of July 2, 1942,2 appointed a Military Commission and directed it to try petitioners for offenses against the law of war and the Articles of War, and prescribed regulations for the procedure on the trial and for review of the record of the trial and of any judgment or sentence of the Commission. On the same day, by Proclamation,3 the President declared that 'all persons who are subjects, citizens or residents of any nation at war with the United States or who give obedience to or act under the direction of any such nation, \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 23]\n\u00a0\n and who during time of war enter or attempt to enter the United States ... through coastal or boundary defenses, and are charged with committing or attempting or preparing to commit sabotage, espionage, hostile or warlike acts, or violations of the law of war, shall be subject to the law of war and to the jurisdiction of military tribunals'.\n The Proclamation also stated in terms that all such persons were denied access to the courts.\n Pursuant to direction of the Attorney General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation surrendered custody of petitioners to respondent, Provost Marshal of the Military District of Washington, who was directed by the Secretary of War to receive and keep them in custody, and who thereafter held petitioners for trial before the Commission.\n On July 3, 1942, the Judge Advocate General's Department of the Army prepared and lodged with the Commission the following charges against petitioners, supported by specifications:\n\n 1. \nViolation of the law of war.\n\n 2. \nViolation of Article 81 of the Articles of War, defining the offense of relieving or attempting to relieve, or corresponding with or giving intelligence to, the enemy.\n\n 3. \nViolation of Article 82, defining the offense of spying.\n\n 4. \nConspiracy to commit the offenses alleged in charges 1, 2 and 3.\n The Commission met on July 8, 1942, and proceeded with the trial, which continued in progress while the causes were pending in this Court. On July 27th, before petitioners' applications to the District Court, all the evidence for the prosecution and the defense had been taken by the Commission and the case had been closed except for arguments of counsel. It is conceded that ever since petitioners' arrest the state and federal courts in Florida, New York, and the District of Columbia, and in \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 24]\n\u00a0\n the states in which each of the petitioners was arrested or detained, have been open and functioning normally.\n While it is the usual procedure on an application for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal courts for the court to issue the writ and on the return to hear and dispose of the case, it may without issuing the writ consider and determine whether the facts alleged by the petition, if proved, would warrant discharge of the prisoner. Walker v. Johnston, \n312 \nU.S. 275, 284\n, 61 S.Ct. 574, 578. Presentation of the petition for judicial action is the institution of a suit. Hence denial by the district court of leave to file the petitions in these causes was the judicial determination of a case or controversy, reviewable on appeal to the Court of Appeals and reviewable here by certiorari. See Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, 110, 113; Betts v. Brady, \n316 \nU.S. 455\n, 62 S.Ct. 1252, 1253.\n Petitioners' main contention is that the President is without any statutory or constitutional authority to order the petitioners to be tried by military tribunal for offenses with which they are charged; that in consequence they are entitled to be tried in the civil courts with the safeguards, including trial by jury, which the Fifth and Sixth Amendments guarantee to all persons charged in such courts with criminal offenses. In any case it is urged that the President's Order, in prescribing the procedure of the Commission and the method for review of its findings and sentence, and the proceedings of the Commission under the Order, conflict with Articles of War adopted by Congress-particularly Articles 38, 43, 46, 50 1\/2 and 70-and are illegal and void.\n The Government challenges each of these propositions. But regardless of their merits, it also insists that petitioners must be denied access to the courts, both because they are enemy aliens or have entered our territory as enemy belligerents, and because the President's Proclamation undertakes in terms to deny such access to the class of \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 25]\n\u00a0\n persons defined by the Proclamation, which aptly describes the character and conduct of petitioners. It is urged that if they are enemy aliens or if the Proclamation has force no court may afford the petitioners a hearing. But there is certainly nothing in the Proclamation to preclude access to the courts for determining its applicability to the particular case. And neither the Proclamation nor the fact that they are enemy aliens forecloses consideration by the courts of petitioners' contentions that the Constitution and laws of the United States constitutionally enacted forbid their trial by military commission. As announced in our per curiam opinion we have resolved those questions by our conclusion that the Commission has jurisdiction to try the charge preferred against petitioners. There is therefore no occasion to decide contentions of the parties unrelated to this issue. We pass at once to the consideration of the basis of the Commission's authority.\n We are not here concerned with any question of the guilt or innocence of petitioners. \n4\n Constitutional safeguards for the protection of all who are charged with offenses are not to be disregarded in order to inflict merited punishment on some who are guilty. Ex parte Milligan, supra, 4 Wall. 119, 132; Tumey v. Ohio, \n273 \nU.S. 510, 535\n, 47 S.Ct. 437, 445, 50 A.L.R. 1243; Hill v. Texas, \n316 \nU.S. 400\n, 62 S. Ct. 1159, 1161, 1162. But the detention and trial of petitioners-ordered by the President in the declared exercise of his powers as Commander in Chief of the Army in time of war and of grave public danger-are not to be set aside by the courts without the clear conviction that they are in conflict with the Constitution or laws of Congress constitutionally enacted.\n Congress and the President, like the courts, possess no power not derived from the Constitution. But one of \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 26]\n\u00a0\n the objects of the Constitution, as declared by its preamble, is to 'provide for the common defence'. As a means to that end the Constitution gives to Congress the power to 'provide for the common Defence', Art. I,  8, cl. 1; 'To raise and support Armies', 'To provide and maintain a Navy', Art. I,  8, cls. 12, 13; and 'To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces', Art. I,  8, cl. 14. Congress is given authority 'To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water', Art. I,  8, cl. 11; and 'To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offenses against the Law of Nations', Art. I,  8, cl. 10. And finally the Constitution authorizes Congress 'To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.' Art. I,  8, cl. 18.\n The Constitution confers on the President the 'executive Power', Art II,  1, cl. 1, and imposes on him the duty to 'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed'. Art. II,  3. It makes him the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, Art. II,  2, cl. 1, and empowers him to appoint and commission officers of the United States. Art. II,  3, cl. 1.\n The Constitution thus invests the President as Commander in Chief with the power to wage war which Congress has declared, and to carry into effect all laws passed by Congress for the conduct of war and for the government and regulation of the Armed Forces, and all laws defining and punishing offences against the law of nations, including those which pertain to the conduct of war.\n By the Articles of War, 10 U.S.C.  1471-1593, 10 U.S.C.A.  1471- 1593, Congress has provided rules for the government of the Army. It has provided for the trial and punishment, by courts \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 27]\n\u00a0\n martial, of violations of the Articles by members of the armed forces and by specified classes of persons associated or serving with the Army. Arts. 1, 2. But the Articles also recognize the 'military commission' appointed by military command as an appropriate tribunal for the trial and punishment of offenses against the law of war not ordinarily tried by court martial. See Arts. 12, 15. Articles 38 and 46 authorize the President, with certain limitations, to prescribe the procedure for military commissions. Articles 81 and 82 authorize trial, either by court martial or military commission, of those charged with relieving, harboring or corresponding with the enemy and those charged with spying. And Article 15 declares that 'the provisions of these articles conferring jurisdiction upon courts-martial shall not be construed as depriving military commissions ... or other military tribunals of concurrent jurisdiction in respect of offenders or offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be triable by such military commissions ... or other military tribunals'. Article 2 includes among those persons subject to military law the personnel of our own military establishment. But this, as Article 12 provides, does not exclude from that class 'any other person who by the law of war is subject to trial by military tribunals' and who under Article 12 may be tried by court martial or under Article 15 by military commission.\n Similarly the Espionage Act of 1917, which authorizes trial in the district courts of certain offenses that tend to interfere with the prosecution of war, provides that nothing contained in the act 'shall be deemed to limit the jurisdiction of the general courts-martial, military commissions, or naval courts-martial'. 50 U.S.C.  38, 50 U.S.C.A.  38.\n From the very beginning of its history this Court has recognized and applied the law of war as including that part of the law of nations which prescribes, for the conduct \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 28]\n\u00a0\n of war, the status, rights and duties of enemy nations as well as of enemy individuals. \n5\n By the Articles of War, and especially Article 15, Congress has explicitly provided, so far as it may constitutionally do so, that military tribunals shall have jurisdiction to try offenders or offenses against the law of war in appropriate cases. Congress, in addition to making rules for the government of our Armed Forces, has thus exercised its authority to define and punish offenses against the law of nations by sanctioning, within constitutional limitations, the jurisdiction of military commissions to try persons for offenses which, according to the rules and precepts of the law of nations, and more particularly the law of war, are cognizable by such tribunals. And the President, as Commander in Chief, by his Proclamation in time of war his invoked that law. By his Order creating the present Commission he has undertaken to exercise the authority conferred upon him by Congress, and also such authority as the Constitution itself gives the Commander in Chief, to direct the performance of those functions which may constitutionally be performed by the military arm of the nation in time of war.\n An important incident to the conduct of war is the adoption of measures by the military command not only to repel and defeat the enemy, but to seize and subject to disciplinary measures those enemies who in their attempt to thwart or impede our military effort have violated the law \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 29]\n\u00a0\n of war. It is unnecessary for present purposes to determine to what extent the President as Commander in Chief has constitutional power to create military commissions without the support of Congressional legislation. For here Congress has authorized trial of offenses against the law of war before such commissions. We are concerned only with the question whether it is within the constitutional power of the national government to place petitioners upon trial before a military commission for the offenses with which they are charged. We must therefore first inquire whether any of the acts charged is an offense against the law of war cognizable before a military tribunal, and if so whether the Constitution prohibits the trial. We may assume that there are acts regarded in other countries, or by some writers on international law, as offenses against the law of war which would not be triable by military tribunal here, either because they are not recognized by our courts as violations of the law of war or because they are of that class of offenses constitutionally triable only by a jury. It was upon such grounds that the Court denied the right to proceed by military tribunal in Ex parte Milligan, supra. But as we shall show, these petitioners were charged with an offense against the law of war which the Constitution does not require to be tried by jury.\n It is no objection that Congress in providing for the trial of such offenses has not itself undertaken to codify that branch of international law or to mark its precise boundaries, or to enumerate or define by statute all the acts which that law condemns. An Act of Congress punishing 'the crime of piracy as defined by the law of nations' is an appropriate exercise of its constitutional authority, Art. I,  8, cl. 10, 'to define and punish' the offense since it has adopted by reference the sufficiently precise definition of international law. United States v. Smith, 5 Wheat. 153; see The Marianna Flora, 11 Wheat. 1, 40, 41; \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 30]\n\u00a0\n United States v. The Malek Adhel, 2 How. 210, 232; The Ambrose Light, D.C., 25 F. 408; 423, 428; 18 U.S.C.  481, 18 U.S.C.A.  481.6 Similarly by the reference in the 15th Article of War to 'offenders or offenses that ... by the law of war may be triable by such military commissions', Congress has incorporated by reference, as within the jurisdiction of military commissions, all offenses which are defined as such by the law of war (compare Dynes v. Hoover, 20 How. 65, 82), and which may constitutionally be included within that jurisdiction. Congress had the choice of crystallizing in permanent form and in minute detail every offense against the law of war, or of adopting the system of common law applied by military tribunals so far as it should be recognized and deemed applicable by the courts. It chose the latter course.\n By universal agreement and practice the law of war draws a distinction between the armed forces and the peaceful populations of belligerent nations7 and also between \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 31]\n\u00a0\n those who are lawful and unlawful combatants. Lawful combatants are subject to capture and detention as prisoners of war by opposing military forces. Unlawful combatants are likewise subject to capture and detention, but in addition they are subject to trial and punishment by military tribunals for acts which render their belligerency unlawful. \n8\n The spy who secretly and without uniform passes the military lines of a belligerent in time of war, seeking to gather military information and communicate it to the enemy, or an enemy combatant who without uniform comes secretly through the lines for the purpose of waging war by destruction of life or property, are familiar examples of belligerents who are generally deemed not to be entitled to the status of prisoners of war, but to be offenders against the law of war subject to trial and punishment by military tribunals. See Winthrop, Military Law, 2d Ed., pp. 1196-1197, 1219-1221; Instructions for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field, approved by the President, General Order No. 100, April 24, 1863, sections IV and V.\n Such was the practice of our own military authorities before the adoption of the Constitution,9 and during the Mexican and Civil Wars. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 32]\n\u00a0\n Paragraph 83 of General Order No. 100 of April 24, 1863, directed that: 'Scouts or single soldiers, if disguised in the dress of the country, or in the uniform of the army hostile to their own, employed in obtaining information, if found within or lurking about the lines of the captor, are treated as spies, and suffer death.' And Paragraph \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 33]\n\u00a0\n 84, that 'Armed Prowlers, by whatever names they may be called, or persons of the enemy's territory, who steal within the lines of the hostile army for the purpose of robbing, killing, or of destroying bridges, roads, or canals, or of robbing or destroying the mail, or of cutting the telegraph wires, are not entitled to the privileges of the prisoner of war.' \n11\n These and related provisions have \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 34]\n\u00a0\n been continued in substance by the Rules of Land Warfare promulgated by the War Department for the guidance of the Army. Rules of 1914, Par. 369- 77; Rules of 1940, Par. 345-57. Paragraph 357 of the 1940 Rules provides that 'All war crimes are subject to the death penalty although a lesser penalty may be imposed'. Paragraph 8 (1940) divides the enemy population into 'armed forces' and 'peaceful population', and Paragraph 9 names as distinguishing characteristics of lawful belligerents that they 'carry arms openly' and 'have a fixed distinctive emblem'. Paragraph 348 declares that 'persons who take up arms and commit hostilities' without having the means of identification prescribed for belligerents are punishable as 'war criminals'. Paragraph 351 provides that 'men and bodies of men, who, without being lawful belligerents' 'nevertheless commit hostile acts of any kind' are not entitled to the privileges of prisoners of war if captured and may be tried by military commission and punished by death or lesser punishment. And Paragraph 352 provides that 'armed prowlers ... or persons of the enemy territory who steal within the lines of the hostile army for the purpose of robbing, killing, or of destroying bridges, roads or canals, of robbing or destroying the mail, or of cutting the telegraph wires, are not entitled to be treated as prisoners of war'. As is evident from reading these and related Paragraphs 345-347, the specified violations are intended to be only illustrative of the applicable principles of the common law of war, and not an exclusive enumeration of the punishable acts recognized as such by that law. The definition of lawful belligerents by Paragraph 9 is that adopted by Article 1, Annex to Hague Convention No. IV of October 18, 1907, to which the United States was a signatory and which was ratified by the Senate in 1909. 36 Stat. 2279, 2295. The preamble to the Convention declares: \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 35]\n\u00a0\n 'Until a more complete code of the laws of war has been issued, the High Contracting Parties deem it expedient to declare that, in cases not included in the Regulations adopted by them, the inhabitants and the belligerents remain under the protection and the rule of the principles of the law of nations, as they result from the usages established among civilized peoples, from the laws of humanity and the dictates of the public conscience.'\n Our Government, by thus defining lawful belligerents entitled to be treated as prisoners of war, has recognized that there is a class of unlawful belligerents not entitled to that privilege, including those who though combatants do not wear 'fixed and distinctive emblems'. And by Article 15 of the Articles of War Congress has made provision for their trial and punishment by military commission, according to 'the law of war'.\n By a long course of practical administrative construction by its military authorities, our Government has likewise recognized that those who during time of war pass surreptitiously from enemy territory into our own, discarding their uniforms upon entry, for the commission of hostile acts involving destruction of life or property, have the status of unlawful combatants punishable as such by military commission. This precept of the law of war has been so recognized in practice both here and abroad, and has so generally been accepted as valid by authorities on international law12 that we think it must be regarded as \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 36]\n\u00a0\n a rule or principle of the law of war recognized by this Government by its enactment of the Fifteenth Article of War.\n Specification 1 of the First charge is sufficient to charge all the petitioners with the offense of unlawful belligerency, trial of which is within the jurisdiction of the Commission, and the admitted facts affirmatively show that the charge is not merely colorable or without foundation.\n Specification 1 states that petitioners 'being enemies of the United States and acting for ... the German Reich, a belligerent enemy nation, secretly and covertly passed, in civilian dress, contrary to the law of war, through the military and naval lines and defenses of the United States ... and went behind such lines, contrary to the law of war, in civilian dress ... for the purpose of committing ... hostile acts, and, in particular, to destroy certain war industries, war utilities and war materials within the United States'.\n This specification so plainly alleges violation of the law of war as to require but brief discussion of petitioners' contentions. As we have seen, entry upon our territory \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 37]\n\u00a0\n in time of war by enemy belligerents, including those acting under the direction of the armed forces of the enemy, for the purpose of destroying property used or useful in prosecuting the war, is a hostile and war-like act. It subjects those who participate in it without uniform to the punishment prescribed by the law of war for unlawful belligerents. It is without significance that petitioners were not alleged to have borne conventional weapons or that their proposed hostile acts did not necessarily contemplate collision with the Armed Forces of the United States. Paragraphs 351 and 352 of the Rules of Land Warfare, already referred to, plainly contemplate that the hostile acts and purposes for which unlawful belligerents may be punished are not limited to assaults on the Armed Forces of the United States. Modern warfare is directed at the destruction of enemy war supplies and the implements of their production and transportation quite as much as at the armed forces. Every consideration which makes the unlawful belligerent punishable is equally applicable whether his objective is the one or the other. The law of war cannot rightly treat those agents of enemy armies who enter our territory, armed with explosives intended for the destruction of war industries and supplies, as any the less belligerent enemies than are agent similarly entering for the purpose of destroying fortified places or our Armed Forces. By passing our boundaries for such purposes without uniform or other emblem signifying their belligerent status, or by discarding that means of identification after entry, such enemies become unlawful belligerents subject to trial and punishment.\n Citizenship in the United States of an enemy belligerent does not relieve him from the consequences of a belligerency which is unlawful because in violation of the law of war. Citizens who associate themselves with the military arm of the enemy government, and with its aid, \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 38]\n\u00a0\n guidance and direction enter this country bent on hostile acts are enemy belligerents within the meaning of the Hague Convention and the law of war. Cf. Gates v. Goodloe, \n101 \nU.S. 612, 615\n, 617 S., 618. It is as an enemy belligerent that petitioner Haupt is charged with entering the United States, and unlawful belligerency is the gravamen of the offense of which he is accused.\n Nor are petitioners any the less belligerents if, as they argue, they have not actually committed or attempted to commit any act of depredation or entered the theatre or zone of active military operations. The argument leaves out of account the nature of the offense which the Government charges and which the Act of Congress, by incorporating the law of war, punishes. It is that each petitioner, in circumstances which gave him the status of an enemy belligerent, passed our military and naval lines and defenses or went behind those lines, in civilian dress and with hostile purpose. The offense was complete when with that purpose they entered-or, having so entered, they remained upon-our territory in time of war without uniform or other appropriate means of identification. For that reason, even when committed by a citizen, the offense is distinct from the crime of treason defined in Article III,  3 of the Constitution, since the absence of uniform essential to one is irrelevant to the other. Cf. Morgan v. Devine, \n237 \nU.S. 632\n, 35 S.Ct. 712; Albrecht v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 1, 11\n, 12 S., 47 S.Ct. 250, 253, 254.\n But petitioners insist that even if the offenses with which they are charged are offenses against the law of war, their trial is subject to the requirement of the Fifth Amendment that no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, and that such trials by Article III,  2, and the Sixth Amendment must be by jury in a civil court. Before the Amendments,  2 of Article \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 39]\n\u00a0\n III, the Judiciary Article, had provided: 'The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury', and had directed that 'such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed'.\n Presentment by a grand jury and trial by a jury of the vicinage where the crime was committed were at the time of the adoption of the Constitution familiar parts of the machinery for criminal trials in the civil courts. But they were procedures unknown to military tribunals, which are not courts in the sense of the Judiciary Article, Ex parte Vallandigham, 1 Wall. 243; In re Vidal, \n179 \nU.S. 126\n, 21 S. Ct. 48; cf. Williams v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 553\n, 53 S.Ct. 751, and which in the natural course of events are usually called upon to function under conditions precluding resort to such procedures. As this Court has often recognized, it was not the purpose or effect of  2 of Article III, read in the light of the common law, to enlarge the then existing right to a jury trial. The object was to preserve unimpaired trial by jury in all those cases in which it had been recognized by the common law and in all cases of a like nature as they might arise in the future, District of Columbia v. Colts, \n282 \nU.S. 63\n, 51 S.Ct. 52, but not to bring within the sweep of the guaranty those cases in which it was then well understood that a jury trial could not be demanded as of right.\n The Fifth and Sixth Amendments, while guaranteeing the continuance of certain incidents of trial by jury which Article III,  2 had left unmentioned, did not enlarge the right to jury trial as it had been established by that Article. Callan v. Wilson, \n127 \nU.S. 540, 549\n, 8 S.Ct. 1301, 1303. Hence petty offenses triable at common law without a jury may be tried without a jury in the federal courts, notwithstanding Article III,  2, and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Schick v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 65\n, 24 S.Ct. 826, 1 Ann.Cas. 585; District of Columbia \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 40]\n\u00a0\n v. Clawans, \n300 \nU.S. 617\n, 57 S.Ct. 660. Trial by jury of criminal contempts may constitutionally be dispensed with in the federal courts in those cases in which they could be tried without a jury at common law. Ex parte Terry, \n128 \nU.S. 289, 302\n, 304 S., 9 S.Ct. 77, 79; Savin, Petitioner, \n131 \nU.S. 267, 277\n, 9 S.Ct. 699, 701; In re Debs, \n158 \nU.S. 564\n, 594-596, 15 S.Ct. 900, 910, 911; United States v. Shipp, \n203 \nU.S. 563, 572\n, 27 S.Ct. 165, 166, 8 Ann.Cas. 265; Blackmer v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 421, 440\n, 52 S.Ct. 252, 255; Nye v. United States, \n313 \nU.S. 33, 48\n, 61 S. Ct. 810, 815; see United States v. Hudson and Goodwin, 7 Cranch 32, 34. Similarly, an action for debt to enforce a penalty inflicted by Congress is not subject to the constitutional restrictions upon criminal prosecutions. United States v. Zucker, \n161 \nU.S. 475\n, 16 S.Ct. 641; United States v. Regan, \n232 \nU.S. 37\n, 34 S. Ct. 213, and cases cited.\n All these are instances of offenses committed against the United States, for which a penalty is imposed, but they are not deemed to be within Article III,  2 or the provisions of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments relating to 'crimes' and 'criminal prosecutions'. In the light of this long-continued and consistent interpretation we must concluded that  2 of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments cannot be taken to have extended the right to demand a jury to trials by military commission, or to have required that offenses against the law of war not triable by jury at common law be tried only in the civil courts.\n The fact that 'cases arising in the land or naval forces' are excepted from the operation of the Amendments does not militate against this conclusion. Such cases are expressly excepted from the Fifth Amendment, and are deemed excepted by implication from the Sixth. Ex parte Milligan, supra, 4 Wall. 123, 138, 139. It is argued that the exception, which excludes from the Amendment cases arising in the armed forces, has also by implication extended its guaranty to all other cases; that since petitioners, not being members of the Armed Forces of the United States, are not within the exception, the Amendment operates to \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 41]\n\u00a0\n give to them the right to a jury trial. But we think this argument misconceives both the scope of the Amendment and the purpose of the exception.\n We may assume, without deciding, that a trial prosecuted before a military commission created by military authority is not one 'arising in the land ... forces', when the accused is not a member of or associated with those forces. But even so, the exception cannot be taken to affect those trials before military commissions which are neither within the exception nor within the provisions of Article III,  2, whose guaranty the Amendments did not enlarge. No exception is necessary to exclude from the operation of these provisions cases never deemed to be within their terms. An express exception from Article III,  2, and from the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, of trials of petty offenses and of criminal contempts has not been found necessary in order to preserve the traditional practice of trying those offenses without a jury. It is no more so in order to continue the practice of trying, before military tribunals without a jury, offenses committed by enemy belligerents against the law of war.\n Section 2 of the Act of Congress of April 10, 1806, 2 Stat. 371, derived from the Resolution of the Continental Congress of August 21, 1776, 13 imposed the death penalty on alien spies 'according to the law and usage of nations, by sentence of a general court martial'. This enactment must be regarded as a contemporary construction of both Article III,  2, and the Amendments as not foreclosing trial by military tribunals, without a jury, of offenses against the law of war committed by enemies not in or associated with our Armed Forces. It is a construction of the Constitution which has been followed since the founding of our government, and is now continued in the 82nd Article of War. Such a construction is entitled to \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 42]\n\u00a0\n the greatest respect. Stuart v. Laird, 1 Cranch, 299, 309; Field v. Clark, \n143 \nU.S. 649, 691\n, 12 S.Ct. 495, 504; United States v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., \n299 \nU.S. 304, 328\n, 57 S.Ct. 216, 224. It has not hitherto been challenged, and so far as we are advised it has never been suggested in the very extensive literature of the subject that an alien spy, in time of war, could not be tried by military tribunal without a jury. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 43]\n\u00a0\n The exception from the Amendments of 'cases arising in the land or naval forces' was not aimed at trials by military tribunals, without a jury, of such offenses against the law of war. Its objective was quite different-to authorize the trial by court martial of the members of our Armed Forces for all that class of crimes which under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments might otherwise have been deemed triable in the civil courts. The cases mentioned in the exception are not restricted to those involving offenses against the law of war alone, but extend to trial of all offenses, including crimes which were of the class traditionally triable by jury at common law. Ex parte Mason, \n105 \nU.S. 696\n; Kahn v. Anderson, \n255 \nU.S. 1, 8\n, 9 S., 41 S.Ct. 224, 225, 226; cf. Caldwell v. Parker, \n252 \nU.S. 376\n, 40 S.Ct. 388. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 44]\n\u00a0\n Since the Amendments, like  2 of Article III, do not preclude all trials of offenses against the law of war by military commission without a jury when the offenders are aliens not members of our Armed Forces, it is plain that they present no greater obstacle to the trial in like manner of citizen enemies who have violated the law of war applicable to enemies. Under the original statute authorizing trial of alien spies by military tribunals, the offenders were outside the constitutional guaranty of trial by jury, not because they were aliens but only because they had violated the law of war by committing offenses constitutionally triable by military tribunal.\n We cannot say that Congress in preparing the Fifth and Sixth Amendments intended to extend trial by jury to the cases of alien or citizen offenders against the law of war otherwise triable by military commission, while withholding it from members of our own armed forces charged with infractions of the Articles of War punishable by death. It is equally inadmissible to construe the Amendments- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 45]\n\u00a0\n whose primary purpose was to continue unimpaired presentment by grand jury and trial by petit jury in all those cases in which they had been customary-as either abolishing all trials by military tribunals, save those of the personnel of our own armed forces, or what in effect comes to the same thing, as imposing on all such tribunals the necessity of proceeding against unlawful enemy belligerents only on presentment and trial by jury. We conclude that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments did not restrict whatever authority was conferred by the Constitution to try offenses against the law of war by military commission, and that petitioners, charged with such an offense not required to be tried by jury at common law, were lawfully placed on trial by the Commission without a jury.\n Petitioners, and especially petitioner Haupt, stress the pronouncement of this Court in the Milligan case, 4 Wall. page 121, that the law of war 'can never be applied to citizens in states which have upheld the authority of the government, and where the courts are open and their process unobstructed'. Elsewhere in its opinion, 4 Wall. at pages 118, 121, 122, and 131, the Court was at pains to point out that Milligan, a citizen twenty years resident in Indiana, who had never been a resident of any of the states in rebellion, was not an enemy belligerent either entitled to the status of a prisoner of war or subject to the penalties imposed upon unlawful belligerents. We construe the Court's statement as to the inapplicability of the law of war to Milligan's case as having particular reference to the facts before it. From them the Court concluded that Milligan, not being a part of or associated with the armed forces of the enemy, was a non-belligerent, not subject to the law of war save as-in circumstances found not there to be present and not involved here-martial law might be constitutionally established.\n The Court's opinion is inapplicable to the case presented by the present record. We have no occasion now to define \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 46]\n\u00a0\n with meticulous care the ultimate boundaries of the jurisdiction of military tribunals to try persons according to the law of war. It is enough that petitioners here, upon the conceded facts, were plainly within those boundaries, and were held in good faith for trial by military commission, charged with being enemies who, with the purpose of destroying war materials and utilities, entered or after entry remained in our territory without uniform-an offense against the law of war. We hold only that those particular acts constitute an offense against the law of war which the Constitution authorizes to be tried by military commission.\n Since the first specification of Charge I set forth a violation of the law of war, we have no occasion to pass on the adequacy of the second specification of Charge I, or to construe the 81st and 82nd Articles of War for the purpose of ascertaining whether the specifications under Charges II and III allege violations of those Articles or whether if so construed they are constitutional. McNally v. Hill, \n293 \nU.S. 131\n, 55 S.Ct. 24.\n There remains the contention that the President's Order of July 2, 1942, so far as it lays down the procedure to be followed on the trial before the Commission and on the review of its findings and sentence, and the procedure in fact followed by the Commission, are in conflict with Articles of War 38, 43, 46, 50 1\/2 and 70. Petitioners argue that their trial by the Commission, for offenses against the law of war and the 81st and 82nd Articles of War, by a procedure which Congress has prohibited would invalidate any conviction which could be obtained against them and renders their detention for trial likewise unlawful (see McClaughry v. Deming, \n186 \nU.S. 49\n, 22 S.Ct. 786; United States v. Brown, \n206 \nU.S. 240, 244\n, 27 S.Ct. 620, 621; Runkle v. United States, \n122 \nU.S. 543, 555\n, 556 S., 7 S.Ct. 1141, 1146; Dynes v. Hoover, 20 How. 65, 80, 81); that the President's Order prescribes such an unlawful \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 47]\n\u00a0\n procedure; and that the secrecy surrounding the trial and all proceedings before the Commission, as well as any review of the decision, will preclude a later opportunity to test the lawfulness of the detention.\n Petitioners do not argue and we do not consider the question whether the President is compelled by the Articles of War to afford unlawful enemy belligerents a trial before subjecting them to disciplinary measures. Their contention is that, if Congress has authorized their trial by military commission upon the charges preferred-violations of the law of war and the 81st and 82nd Articles of War-it has by the Articles of War prescribed the procedure by which the trial is to be conducted; and that since the President has ordered their trial for such offenses by military commission, they are entitled to claim the protection of the procedure which Congress has commanded shall be controlling.\n We need not inquire whether Congress may restrict the power of the Commander in Chief to deal with enemy belligerents. For the Court is unanimous in its conclusion that the Articles in question could not at any stage of the proceedings afford any basis for issuing the writ. But a majority of the full Court are not agreed on the appropriate grounds for decision. Some members of the Court are of opinion that Congress did not intend the Articles of War to govern a Presidential military commission convened for the determination of questions relating to admitted enemy invaders and that the context of the Articles makes clear that they should not be construed to apply in that class of cases. Others are of the view that-even though this trial is subject to whatever provisions of the Articles of War Congress has in terms made applicable to 'commissions'-the particular Articles in question, rightly construed, do not foreclose the procedure prescribed by the President or that shown to have been employed \n\n[317 \nU.S. 1, 48]\n\u00a0\n by the Commission in a trial of offenses against the law of war and the 81st and 82nd Articles of War, by a military commission appointed by the President.\n Accordingly, we conclude that Charge I, on which petitioners were detained for trial by the Military Commission, alleged an offense which the President is authorized to order tried by military commission; that his Order convening the Commission was a lawful order and that the Commission was lawfully constituted; that the petitioners were held in lawful custody and did not show cause for their discharge. It follows that the orders of the District Court should be affirmed, and that leave to file petitions for habeas corpus in this Court should be denied.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\n Orders of District Court affirmed and leave to file petitions for habeas corpus in the Supreme Court denied. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] From June 12 to June 18, 1942, Amagansett Beach, New York, and Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, were within the area designated as the Eastern Defense Command of the United States Army, and subject to the provisions of a proclamation dated May 16, 1942, issued by Lieutenant General Hugh A.

The Board found that the facts charged were true, and that when captured Major Andre had in his possession papers containing intelligence, for the enemy, and reported their conclusion that 'Major Andre ... ought to be considered as a Spy from the enemy, and that agreeably to the law and usage of nations ... he ought to suffer death.'

See General Orders cited in 2 Winthrop, Military Law (2d Ed. 1896) p. 1298, note 1.\n During the Civil War the military commission was extensively used for the trial of offenses against the law of war. Among the more significant cases for present purposes are the following: \n On May 22, 1865, T. E. Hogg and others were tried by a Military Commission, for 'violations of the laws and usages of civilized war', the specifications charging that the accused 'being commissioned, enrolled, enlisted or engaged' by the Confederate Government, came on board a United States merchant steamer in the port of Panama 'in the guise of peaceful passengers' with the purpose of capturing the vessel and converting her into a Confederate cruiser. The Commission found the accused guilty and sentenced them to be hanged. The reviewing authority affirmed the judgments, writing an extensive opinion on the question whether violations of the law of war were alleged, but modified the sentences to imprisonment for life and for various periods of years. Dept. of the Pacific, G.O. No. 52, June 27, 1865.\n On January 17, 1865, John Y. Beall was tried by a military commission for 'violation of the laws of war'. The opinion by the reviewing authority reveals that Beall, holding a commission in the Confederate Navy, came on board a merchant vessel at a Canadian port in civilian dress and, with associates, took possession of the vessel in Lake Erie; that, also in disguise, he unsuccessfully attempted to derail a train in New York State, and to obtain military information. His conviction by the Commission was affirmed on the ground that he was both a spy \n and a 'guerrilla', and he was sentenced to be hanged. Dept. of the East, G. O. No. 14, Feb. 14, 1865.\n On January 17, 1865, Robert C. Kennedy, a Captain of the Confederate Army, who was shown to have attempted, while in disguise, to set fire to the City of New York, and to have been seen in disguise in various parts of New York State, was convicted on charges of acting as a spy and violation of the law of war 'in undertaking to carry on irregular and unlawful warfare'. He was sentenced to be hanged, and the sentence was confirmed by the reviewing authority. Dept. of the East, G.O. No. 24, March 20, 1865.\n On September 19, 1865, William Murphy, 'a rebel emissary in the employ of and colleagued with rebel enemies' was convicted by a military commission of 'violation of the laws and customs of war' for coming within the lines and burning a United States steamboat and other property.

Hart, of Austin, Tex., for petitioners.\n Mr. Charles L. Black, of Austin, Tex., for intervener, Lone Star Gas Co., by special leave of court.\n Messrs. James P. Alexander, John H. Sharp, and Richard Critz, Justices of the Supreme Court of Texas, all of Austin, Tex., pro se.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a motion by the Attorney General and Railroad Commission of the State of Texas for leave to file a petition for a writ of mandamus against the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of Texas to bring a judgment of that Court into conformity with the controlling mandate of this Court. The foundation of the motion is the claim that in the proceedings following the remand by this Court to the Texas courts of the litigation in Lone Star Gas Co. v. Texas, \n304 \nU.S. 224\n, 58 S.Ct. 883, the Supreme Court of Texas has misconceived the scope of our decision. The history of the litigation must therefore be summarized.\n In 1934 the Railroad Commission of Texas brought an action in the District Court of Travis County, under Article 6059 of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, to enforce its order of September 13, 1933, fixing the rate to be charged by the Lone Star Gas Company, a Texas corporation operating pipe lines located in Texas and Oklahoma, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 8, 10]\n\u00a0\n for gas delivered to distributing companies in Texas. The Commission's order treated the Company's properties in both states as an 'integrated' system. In its answer the Company attacked the order under the Commerce and Due Process Clauses. A trial was held before a jury, which found, from the evidence before it, that the Commission's order was 'unreasonable and unjust'. Accordingly, the District Court enjoined enforcement of the order. An appeal to the Court of Civil Appeals followed. That court sustained the Commission in treating the Company as an integrated enterprise and found against the Company upon the issue of confiscation. The burden was put upon the Company 'to show by clear and satisfactory evidence a proper segregation of interstate and intrastate properties and business, and to show the value of the property employed in intrastate business or commerce and the compensation it would receive under the rate complained of upon such valuation. Having failed to make a proper segregation of interstate and intrastate properties, appellee (i.e., the Company) did not adduce the quantum and character of proof necessary to establish the invalidity of the rate as being confiscatory, or unreasonable and unjust.' 86 S.W.2d 484, 502. The Court therefore dissolved the injunction of the District Court and declared the Commission's order to be 'just, reasonable, and valid in every particular.' 86 S.W.2d 484, 506. The Supreme Court of Texas refused a writ of error and the case then came here.\n We reversed the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals, and remanded the cause 'for further proceedings not inconsistent' with the opinion. \n304 \nU.S. 224, 242\n, 58 S.Ct. 883, 891. It was held: '(1) The Commission's order did not offend the Commerce Clause. The Commission was entitled to take into consideration the Company's producing properties in Oklahoma and its transmission lines to Texas, because 'the proved manner in which the gas from Okla- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 8, 11]\n\u00a0\n homa was treated and handled in Texas made it an integral part of the gas supplied to the Texas communities in appellant's intrastate business'. 304 U.S. at page 239, 58 S.Ct. at page 890. (2) On the issue of confiscation the Court of Civil Appeals had erred. The Company 'could not be denied the right to introduce evidence as to its property and business as an integrated system and to have the sufficiency of its evidence ascertained by the criterion which the Commission had properly used in the same manner in reaching its conclusion as to the Texas rate.' 304 U.S. at pages 241, 242, 58 S.Ct. at page 891\n\n\n When the case came back to the Court of Civil Appeals, it held that 'when viewed in the light of the over-all or unsegregated basis and evidence the legislative rate order is valid as a matter of law', and that the validity of the order was established 'factually from so overwhelming a weight and preponderance of the evidence as to require a reversal in the interest of justice.' And so it again dissolved the injunction and reinstated the Commission's order. 129 S.W.2d 1164, 1170, 1187. This time the Supreme Court of Texas granted a writ of error and sent the case back to the District Court for a new trial. 153 S.W.2d 681.\n In its extended opinion the Supreme Court of Texas reviewed these two rulings by the Court of Civil Appeals: (1) Since Article 6059 of the Revised Statutes of Texas1 governing judicial review of the Commission's orders, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 8, 12]\n\u00a0\n makes the Commission's findings of fact conclusive if supported by substantial evidence, and since the findings were supported by such evidence, the order was valid as a matter of law and left no question for the jury. (2) Even if Article 6059 required a trial de novo of all issues of fact, 'the Gas Company failed, as a matter of law, to offer evidence sufficient to justify holding this gas rate order confiscatory, or unreasonable and unjust.' 153 S.W.2d at page 687.\n The Supreme Court of Texas held that Article 6059 does require a trial de novo in the District Court. It added that 'there is no escape from the conclusion that the United States Supreme Court did consider and did pass upon the sufficiency of the Gas Company's evidence, when considered from the viewpoint of the Company's entire properties, and did hold such evidence legally sufficient to sustain the verdict of the jury finding this rate order confiscatory.' 153 S.W.2d at page 689. Later in its opinion the Texas Supreme Court stated 'that such opinion (of the Supreme Court of the United States) decides that the evidence contained in this record is sufficient, in law, to invoke the fact finding jurisdiction of the district court. It follows that such matter has been foreclosed by the United States Supreme Court, and it not open for decision by this Court, and was not open for decision by the Court of Civil Appeals.' 153 S. W.2d at page 695.\n It agreed with the Court of Civil Appeals that the trial court, to the prejudice of the Commission, had erroneously permitted the testimony of a Company witness and refused to exclude various Company exhibits. Immediately following this part of its opinion the Supreme Court of Texas wrote: 'It is evident from our holdings above that this case must be remanded to the district court for a new trial.' 153 S.W.2d at page 699.\n The petitioners read the opinion of the Supreme Court of Texas to mean the the claim of confiscation could no \n\n[315 \nU.S. 8, 13]\n\u00a0\n longer be contested in the Texas courts because this Court adjudicated that claim in the Company's favor. Such was not the ruling of this Court. The merits of the claim of confiscation were not reviewed. All that was decided here was that the Company was entitled to make proof of confiscation on the same basis-namely, that of services rendered by an integrated system-as that on which the Commission fixed the rates. On their reading of the opinion of the Supreme Court of Texas, the petitioners were naturally eager for a prompt correction of the decision of that Court, even though it was not final, without waiting for this rate controversy, already eight years old, again to wind its measured way through the Texas courts and then to be brought here on an indubitably federal question, to wit, the proper construction of a mandate of this Court.\n The petitioners claim that but for a misapplication of our mandate the Texas Supreme Court might have sustained the Court of Civil Appeals and the litigation could finally have come to an end. Since the opinion of the Texas Supreme Court on its face appeared to be susceptible of the construction given it by the petitioners, we issued a rule to show cause. \n314 \nU.S. 579\n, 62 S.Ct. 122, 86 L.Ed. --.\n In their return, the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of Texas state that that Court 'would have rendered the same judgment if it had based the same solely upon its construction of the State statute and not at all upon its construction of the opinion of this Court.' The return further showed that in remanding the cause to the District Court for a new trial the Supreme Court of Texas acted entirely pursuant to state law: 'The Court of Civil Appeals in this State has full power to set aside findings based on conflicting evidence and believed by it to be against the overwhelming weight and preponderance of the evidence and to remand the case for another trial; but it is without power to set aside findings based on \n\n[315 \nU.S. 8, 14]\n\u00a0\n conflicting evidence and then make its own findings and render judgment thereon.'\n We read this return as a disclaimer by the judges of the Supreme Court of Texas the construction placed upon their opinion by the petitioners insofar as it touches the scope of this Court's ruling in \n304 \nU.S. 224\n, 58 S.Ct. 883 and the effect of that decision upon the future course of this litigation. Specifically, we read the return as a disavowal by the Supreme Court of Texas that its action in reversing the Texas Court of Civil Appeals and ordering a new trial implied that our decision adjudicated the claim of confiscation or in any wise forecloses trial of that issue. Therefore, when the litigation goes back to the District Court, it will not be imprisoned within an adjudication to be attributed to this Court which this Court never made. We must accept the return of the Texas judges regarding the scope of judicial review of orders of the Texas Railroad Commission, as well as their showing regarding the distribution of judicial power within the Texas judicial system. These are matters of local law.\n The rule will therefore be discharged and the motion denied.\n So ordered.\n Rule discharged and motion denied.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS heard the argument and agreed to the above disposition of the case, but through absence was unable to join in the opinion.\n Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MURPHY concur in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Article 6059 provides: 'If any gas utility or other party at interest be dissatisfied with the decision of any rate, classification, rule, charge, order, act or regulation adopted by the Commission, such dissatisfied utility or party may file a petition setting forth the particular cause of objection thereto in a court of competent jurisdiction in Travis County against the Commission as defendant.

Sutherland, of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioners.\n Mr. Casper W. Ooms, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent began the present litigation as three separate suits against the respective petitioners for infringement of the Nelson Patent No. 2,109,678 of March 1, 1938, for a 'contact switch for ball rolling games.' The defenses were non-invention in view of the prior art, anticipation by prior publication, use and sale, non-in- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 126, 128]\n\u00a0\n fringement and a file wrapper estoppel. The three suits were consolidated and tried together. Upon full consideration of the issues the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held Claim 4 of the patent valid and infringed. 119 F.2d 349.\n We granted certiorari, \n314 \nU.S. 702\n, 62 S.Ct. 175, 86 L.Ed. --, on a petition which challenged only the decree of infringement below, on the ground that it enlarged the scope of the patent as defined by the claim, by resort to the doctrine of equivalents, and that Nelson, the patentee, by the amendment of his claims in the Patent Office, had surrendered Claim 4 so far as it would otherwise read upon the alleged infringing devices. Neither in their petition nor in their brief and argument in this Court have petitioners contended that the patent is invalid for want of invention. Although there is no conflict of decision, we were moved to grant the petition by the nature of the questions presented, together with a showing that the industry affected by the patent is located in the seventh circuit so that litigation in other circuits resulting in a conflict of decision would not be likely to occur.\n The patent relates to the structure of a resilient switch or circuit closer, so disposed on the board of a game table as to serve as a target which, when struck by a freely rolling ball, will momentarily close an electrical circuit. Specifications and drawings disclose a target or switch comprising a conductor standard mounted in the table and carrying a coil spring having a leg pendantly disposed in a conductor ring located in the table and slightly offset from the standard. The standard and ring are wired in a circuit with a relay coil and a source of electrical energy. When a ball rolling on the table bumps the coil spring from any direction, the leg of the spring is deflected momentarily bringing it into contact with the ring, so as to close the circuit for operating the relay coil and any connected auxiliary game device. Any de- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 126, 129]\n\u00a0\n sired number of targets may be placed on the board in a suitably spaced relationship; in pin ball games a single ball may successively bump and close a number of the switch devices. In describing his invention the patentee declared it to be his intention 'to cover all changes and modifications of the example of the invention herein chosen for purposes of the disclosure, which do not constitute departures from the spirit and scope of the invention.'\n The prior art as disclosed by the record shows no device in which the coil spring serves both as a target and a switch. The advantages of the device are said to be that the combination is peculiarly adapted to use in pin ball games; that the coil spring structure is so organized as to form both a switch for operating auxiliary recording or signalling devices and a target which is accessible from any direction.\n Claim 41 claims as the elements of the invention the conductor standard anchored in the table, the coil spring surrounding the standard which carries the spring pendantly from its top, with the spring spaced from the standard to enable the spring to be resiliently flexed, 'and conductor means in said circuit and embedded in \n\n[315 \nU.S. 126, 130]\n\u00a0\n the table at a point spaced from the standard and engageable by a portion of the spring when it is flexed to close the aforementioned circuit.' The drawings of the patent show the 'conductor means' last mentioned in the form of a ring or ferrule set in the table with its axis at right angles to the table and with its flange projecting slightly above the surface of the table. The leg pending from the coil spring is so disposed at the center of the annular ferrule that a ball striking the spring in any direction will bring the pendant leg into contact with the ring so as to close the circuit.\n The six devices alleged to infringe the patent differ from the particular claim of the invention described in the specifications, only in the specific form and method of supporting the 'conductor means' which is 'engageable by a portion of the spring when it is flexed'. In two of the accused devices, plaintiff's Exhibits 5 and 7, there is substituted for the ring conductor set in the table a nail or pin driven into the table and surrounded near its upper end by a ring attached to the end of the resilient coil spring, or formed there of the coil wire. When the spring is struck the circuit is closed by the contact of ring and nail at a point above the table. This arrangement contrasts with that of the conductors as shown in the patent drawings, in which a ring set in the table and the pendant leg of the coil form the contact at a point near or below the surface of the table. In the one case the ring conductor is supported by the table and the complementary conductor is attached to or is formed of the wire of the spring at its end. In the other the locations of the ring and of the complementary conductor are reversed.\n Two others of the accused devices, plaintiff's Exhibits 6 and 10, show a further alteration. In Exhibit 6, the nail or pin, instead of being driven directly into the table, is affixed to and supported by a metal plate resting \n\n[315 \nU.S. 126, 131]\n\u00a0\n on the upper surface of the table with the coil spring standard passing through it and holding it firmly on the table. The conductor extends to the wire connection through a hole in the table underneath the plate. In Exhibit 10 the conductor is insulated from the plate, which is rigidly anchored to the coil spring standard, which in turn is anchored to the table.\n In the remaining two accused devices, plaintiff's Exhibits 8 and 9, an insulating core or sleeve surrounds the coil standard and supports an annular or enveloping conductor wired in the circuit, spaced and insulated from the coil standard so that the circuit is closed by contact of the conductor and the coil when it is flexed. In Exhibit 8 the sleeve is electrically connected with a metal plate, held in position on the top of the table by the standard which passes through the plate. A wire leading from the plate passes through a hold in the table underneath the plate. In Exhibit 9 the annular conductor is located above the table top and a wire leading from it passes through a hole in the table.\n Comparison of the several accused devices shows that in all but Exhibits 5 and 7 the conductor means complementary to the coil spring is not embedded in the table, but is supported by an insulated plate resting on the table or an insulating core held in position by the standard. In Exhibits 6 and 10 the conductor means passes to its wire connection through a hole in the table underneath the plate. In Exhibit 8 the connecting wire passes through a hole in the table to a metal plate resting on its surface, and in Exhibit 9 to the conductor means located above the surface of the table.\n Petitioners insist that respondent is estopped to assert infringement by the file wrapper record in the Patent Office and in any event that estoppel can be avoided and infringement established only by resort to the doctrine of equivalents, which they assert is incompatible \n\n[315 \nU.S. 126, 132]\n\u00a0\n with the statutory requirements for the grant of a patent and with the doctrine that the patent claims measure the patented invention.\n The file wrapper history, so far as now relevant, relates to Claim 7 which, after amendment, was allowed as Claim 4 now in issue. The original Claim 7 with its amendments is set forth as follows:\n (Matter added by amendment in parenthesis; matter stricken in italics and underscored.)\n\n\n (4)\n 7. In a ball rolling game having a substantially horizontal table over which balls are rollable, the combination with said table of a substantially vertical standard anchored in said table with its lower\n end carrying on the underside of the table a lead for an\n A1 electric circuit and its upper end extending a substantial distance above the top surface of the table, a coil spring surrounding the standard, means carrying\n said spring pendantly from the upper portion of the\n per C standard (ABOVE THE TABLE) with the coils of the spring spaced from the\n per C standard and the lower end of the coil spring terminating\n per C at a distance above the top surface of the table to enable the spring to be resiliently flexed when bumped\n by a ball rolling on the table, said spring being in the\n aforementioned circuit and constituting a conductor, and\n per B other conductor means (IN SAID CIRCUIT AND EMBEDDED IN) carried by the table at a point spaced from the standard and engageable by a \n\n[315 \nU.S. 126, 133]\n\u00a0\n portion of the spring when it is flexed to close the aforementioned circuit.\n The original application contained six claims, all of which the examiner rejected because he thought no patentable significance had been shown. The inventor submitted certain amendments, and two new claims, 7 and 8, and induced the examiner to reconsider the patentability of the invention. Four of the claims were then allowed, but the examiner rejected Claim 7 as failing to claim the invention. He said: 'It is old in the art to make an electrical contact by flexing a coil spring as shown by the art already cited in the case. In order to distinguish over the references therefor, the applicant's particular type of contact structure, comprising an extension to the coil spring adapted to engage an annular contact embedded in the table, must appear in the claims. ...' Applicant rejected the examiner's suggestion that the 'contact structure' be adapted to engage 'an annular contact embedded in the table'. Instead he cancelled 'other' from the claim and substituted for 'carried by' the phrase, 'in said circuit and enbedded in', saying Claim 7 has been 'significantly amended' 'to define the complementary conductor contact as being embedded in the table'. He added that 'it is too far to go to state that the specific leg 19 must be defined', and 'the allowed claims can it seems, be very simply avoided by taking the leg 19, separating it from the spring 18 and embedding it as a pin in the table so that the spring when flexed would contact the pin. ... Claim 7 covers such alternative form and ... in justice to applicant ... should be allowed.'\n The examiner in reply recognized as 'true' applicant's suggestion that if the leg pendant from the spring 'were removed from the spring and embedded in the table an \n\n[315 \nU.S. 126, 134]\n\u00a0\n operative device would result', but pointed out that the device claimed by the amendment 'would be inoperative as the coil spring could not both terminate at a distance above the table and extend into a ferrule embedded therein.' Thereupon the applicant added to the claim the words 'above the table' and cancelled the phrase, 'and the lower end of the coil spring terminating at a distance above the top surface of the table.' The claim as amended was then allowed as Claim 4.\n The claim before amendment plainly read on plaintiff's Exhibits 5 and 7 in which the nail or pin conductor is driven into the table, since the nail or pin is a 'conductor means carried by the table' 'engageable by a portion of the spring when flexed'. The claim thus read is for an operative device since the nail or pin projects above the table and may be engaged by the coil spring similarly located. The claim, as amended and allowed as Claim 4, likewise reads on plaintiff's Exhibits 5 and 7 if the nail or pin conductor which is driven into the table is 'embedded in the table'.\n Petitioners do not seriously assert here that it is not so embedded. In fact their brief expressly states that 'we pass this contention'. They could not well do otherwise, for the pin or nail even though it protrudes above or below the table not only conforms to the dictionary definition of 'embed', 'To set solidly as in a bed', Webster; 'To fix firmly in a surrounding mass of some solid material', Oxford Dictionary, but examination of the drawings and specifications indicates clearly enough that the claim was not intended to be limited to a complementary conductor located wholly between the upper and nether surfaces of the table. The specifications and drawings express no such limitation, and it is clear that the use of the word 'embedded' in the claim as finally amended, when read in its context of claim and specifications, does not indicate such a limitation. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 126, 135]\n\u00a0\n The patent drawings show the embedded ring conductor extending slightly both above and below the table. The examiner in his second rejection of Claim 7, in saying that if the leg pendant from the spring were removed from the spring and 'embedded' in the table an operative device would result, could not have referred to the embedded leg or nail as being wholly located below the surface of the table, since the pin so disposed would not be 'engageable' 'by a portion of the spring when it is flexed' by a ball rolling in any direction. The term is to be read as used in a permissible sense which would conform to the drawings and the function which the conductor to which the term was applied was obviously intended to perform.\n We think that the word 'embedded' as applied in Claim 4, must be taken to embrace any conductor means solidly set or firmly fixed in the table, whether or not it protrudes above or below the surface. Claim 7 before amendment read on the accused devices, plaintiff's Exhibits 5 and 7, which exhibit the nail or pin embedded in the table but protruding above its surface. Consequently the patentee by amending the claim so as to define the conductor means as embedded in the table did not exclude from the amended claim devices exemplified by these exhibits and they must be deemed to be infringements.\n There remains the question whether respondent may rely upon the doctrine of equivalents to establish infringement by the four other accused devices. Respondent concedes that the conductor means in the four devices are not literally 'embedded in the table', but insists that the changes in structure which they exhibit over that of plaintiff's Exhibits 5 and 7 are but the mechanical equivalents of the 'conductor means embedded in the table' called for by the amended claim, and so are entitled to the protection afforded by the doctrine of equivalents. Petitioners do not seriously urge that the conductor means in the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 126, 136]\n\u00a0\n four accused devices are not mechanical equivalents of the conductor means embedded in the table which the patent claims. Instead they argue that the doctrine should be discarded because it does not satisfy the demands of the statute that the patent shall describe the invention. R.S.  4888, 35 U.S.C.  33, 35 U.S.C.A.  33.\n We do not find it necessary to resolve these contentions here. Whatever may be the appropriate scope and application of the doctrine of equivalents, where a claim is allowed without a restrictive amendment, it has long been settled that recourse may not be had to that doctrine to recapture claims which the patentee has surrendered by amendment.\n Assuming that the patentee would have been entitled to equivalents embracing the accused devices had he originally claimed a 'conductor means embedded in the table', a very different issue is presented when the applicant in order to meet objections in the Patent Office, based on references to the prior art, adopted the phrase as a substitute for the broader one 'carried by the table'. Had Claim 7 been allowed in its original form it would have read upon all the accused devices since in all the conductor means complementary to the coil spring are 'carried by the table'. By striking that phrase from the claim and substituting for it 'embedded in the table' the applicant restricted his claim to those combinations in which the conductor means, though carried on the table, is also embedded in it. By the amendment he recognized and emphasized the difference between the two phrases and proclaimed his abandonment of all that is embraced in that difference. Hubbell v. United States, \n179 \nU.S. 77, 83\n, 21 S.Ct. 24, 26; Weber Electric Co. v. E. H. Freeman Electric Co., \n256 \nU.S. 668, 677\n, 678 S., 41 S.Ct. 600, 603; I. T. S. Rubber Co. v.

American Tri-Ergon Corp., \n294 \nU.S. 477, 492\n, 493 S., 55 S. Ct. 455, 461, 462. The difference which he thus disclaimed must be regarded as material, and since the amendment operates as a disclaimer of that difference it must be strictly construed against him. Smith v. Magic City Kennel Club, supra, 282 U.S. page 790, 51 S.Ct. page 293; Shepard v. Carrigan, \n116 \nU.S. 593, 598\n, 6 S.Ct. 493, 495; Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Co. v. Davis, \n102 \nU.S. 222\n, 228. As the question is one of construction of the claim it is immaterial whether the examiner was right or wrong in rejecting the claim as filed. Hubbell v. United States, supra, 179 U.S. page 83, 21 S.Ct. page 26; I. T. S. Rubber Co. v. Essex Rubber Co., supra, 272 U.S. page 443, 47 S.Ct. page 141. It follows that what the patentee, by a strict construction of the claim, has disclaimed-conductors which are carried by the table but not embedded in it-cannot now be regained by recourse to the doctrine of equivalents, which at most operates, by liberal construction, to secure to the inventor the full benefits, not disclaimed, of the claims allowed.\n Plaintiff's Exhibits 5 and 7 do, and its Exhibits 6, 8, 9 and 10 do not, infringe. The judgments will be modified accordingly.\n So ordered.\n Judgments modified.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS concurs.\n I think the judgments below should be reversed in full.\n There can be no infringement of a void patent, and a patent which shows neither invention nor discovery is void. \n1\n The mere application of an old mechanical in- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 126, 138]\n\u00a0\n strument to a new use is not an invention and therefore not patentable. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The combination patented here contains not a single new element. The whole device is nothing more than an electric switch mounted on a table, which closes and opens with the flexing and reflexing of an ordinary coil spring when hit by a rolling ball. The spring, standing upright on the table, serves as a target in a pin ball game, its resiliency being utilized not only to make and break the circuit but to make the ball rebound.\n The Constitution authorizes the granting of patent privileges only to inventors who make 'discoveries.' And the statute provides for the granting of patents only to those who have 'invented or discovered' something 'new'. 35 U.S.C.A.  31. To call the device here an invention or discovery such as was contemplated by the Constitution or the statute is, in my judgment, to degrade the meaning of those terms.\n Patentees have rights given them by law. 'But the public has rights also. The rights of both should be upheld and enforced by an equally firm hand, wherever they come under judicial consideration.' \n3\n By failing to assign error on the issue of patentability, parties to an infringement suit should not be permitted to foreclose a court from protecting the public interest. And here, as in other cases where there is plain error, we should notice it. \n4\n\u00a0\n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] '4.

CITY OF ASBURY PARK, N.J.(1942)\nNo. 896\nArgued: April 28, 1942Decided: June 1, 1942\n\n\n\n\n[316 \nU.S. 502, 503]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Arthur T. Vanderbilt, of Newark, N.J., for appellants.\n Mr. Ward Kremer, of Asbury Park, N.J., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A New Jersey statute, adopted in 1931, N.J.S.A. 52:27-1 et seq., authorized state control over insolvent municipalities. By a supplementary law, N.J.S.A. 52:27-34 et seq., enacted in 1933, a plan for adjustment of the claims of creditors of such an insolvent municipality could be made binding upon all creditors. The question is whether an adjustment so authorized by a state impairs righs in violation of the Constitution of the United States.\n The City of Asbury Park is a seashore resort with a resident population of 15,000. It presents a familiar picture of optimistic and extravagant municipal expansion caught in the destructive grip of general economic depression: elaborate beachfront improvements, costs in excess of estimates, deficits not annually met by taxation, declining realestate values, inability to refinance a disproportionately heavy load of short- term obligations, and, inevitably, default. Accordingly, in January, 1935, availing themselves of the New Jersey Municipal Finance Act, creditors applied to the Supreme Court of New Jersey to place the state Municipal Finance Commission in control of the city's finances. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 502, 504]\n\u00a0\n The legislation was enacted 'to meet the public emergency arising from a default in the payment of municipal obligations, and the resulting impairment of public credit', Laws of New Jersey 1931, c. 340,  405, N.J. S.A. 52:27-65. In broad terms, the legislation, through combined administrative and judicial action, adapted the underlying principles of an equity receivership to the solution of the problem of insolvent municipalities. By a supplementing act, Laws of New Jersey 1933, c. 331, N. J.S.A. 52:27-34 to 52:27-39, a 'plan of adjustment or composition of the claims of all creditors' may be submitted on their behalf to the supreme court of the state. If approved by 85 per cent in amount of the creditors and by the municipality and the Commission, such plan of adjustment may be adopted 'if the court by its justice determines (1) that the municipality is unable to pay in full according to their terms the claims proposed to be adjusted or composed, and perform its public functions and preserve the value of property subject to taxation, (2) that the adjustment or composition is substantially measured by the capacity of the municipality to pay, (3) that it is in the interest of all the creditors affected thereby, and (4) that it is not detrimental to other creditors of the municipality.' The plan cannot be authorized, however, if it involves any reduction of the principal amount of any outstanding obligation. Any creditor is entitled to appear and to be heard, but a plan which is so authorized by the court is binding upon all creditors whether or not they appear, and the substitution of new obligations for old in carrying out the plan is made effective from the day fixed by judicial order. To effectuate such a plan, the Act provides further that the court shall retain jurisdiction and 'thereafter no creditor whose claim is included in such adjustment or composition shall be authorized to bring any action or proceeding of any kind or character for the enforcement of his claim except with the permission of the supreme \n\n[316 \nU.S. 502, 505]\n\u00a0\n court and then only to recover and enforce the rights given him by the adjustment or composition.' \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n Pursuant to this legislative scheme, the City of Asbury Park was on March 7, 1935, placed under the control of the Municipal Finance Commission; on February 1, 1936, a plan for the refunding of its bonded debt was filed in the state supreme court, and that court took jurisdiction of \n\n[316 \nU.S. 502, 506]\n\u00a0\n the proceedings; the plan, as amended, was approved by the court on July 21, 1937; on September 28, 1937, it was duly approved by the Municipal Finance Commission; on April 29, 1938, it was consented to by creditors representing '85 per cent in amount of the indebtedness affected' by the plan; and, on June 15, 1938, it was put into opera- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 502, 507]\n\u00a0\n tion. The plan provided for the refunding of $10,750,000 of outstanding bonds; these were to be exchanged by the consenting creditors for new bonds to be issued in accordance with the terms of the plan approved by the court.\n The appellants were holders of defaulted bonds and interest coupons issued by the City of Asbury Park in 1929 and 1930-prior, therefore, to the legislation which authorized the proceedings resulting in the challenged refunding scheme. The bonds of the appellants were part of the $ 10,750,000 of refunded bonds which, under the adjustment decreed by the court, could only be converted into new bonds maturing in 1966 and bearing a lower rate of interest than the original bonds. Deeming the arrangement authorized under the New Jersey statute to be violative of the Constitution of the United States, the appellants brought this suit for the face value of the old bonds and coupons. The Supreme Court of New Jersey dismissed the suit, 19 A.2d 445, 19 N.J.Misc. 322; the Court of Errors and Appeals affirmed the dismissal, 127 N.J.L. 239, 21 A.2d 796; and the case is here on appeal under  237(a) of the Judicial Code, as amended, 28 U.S.C.  344(a), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(a).\n If the New Jersey legislation which is the foundation of the refunding plan for the City of Asbury Park is valid, appellants' claim on the old bonds was barred by law, and the judgment below must stand. The validity of that legislation is assailed on two grounds. It is contended, first, that the New Jersey laws constitute municipal bankruptcy legislation, that that field of lawmaking has been preempted by Congress, and that the New Jersey legislation is therefore inoperative. To this argument a few dates furnish a short answer. The present court proceedings began on February 1, 1936. The first federal Municipal Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  301 et seq. was declared unconstitutional on May 25, 1936. Ashton v. Cameron County Water Imp. Dist., \n298 \nU.S. 513\n, 56 S.Ct. 892. The refunding plan now assailed was approved, as we have seen, on July 21, 1937. It was thus authorized \n\n[316 \nU.S. 502, 508]\n\u00a0\n more than a year before the enactment of the only relevant federal statute, the Act of August 16, 1937, 50 Stat. 653, amending the Bankruptcy Act 11 U. S.C.A.  401 et seq. to provide for the composition of indebtedness of taxing agencies. Assuming Congress had power to do so, this Act did not profess to terminate a pending state court proceeding like that now in question. It would offend the most settled habits in the relationship between the States and the nation to imply such a retroactive nullification of state authority over its subordinate organs of government.\n We prefer, however, to dispose of this objection on a broader ground. Not until April 25, 1938, was the power of Congress to afford relief similar to that given by New Jersey for its municipalities clearly established, United States v. Bekins, \n304 \nU.S. 27\n, 58 S.Ct. 811, and then only because Congress had been 'especially solicitous to afford no ground' for the 'objection' that an exercise of federal bankruptcy over political subdivisions of the State 'might materially restrict (its) control over its fiscal affairs' whereby states would no longer be 'free to manage their own affairs'. The statute was 'carefully drawn so as not to impinge on the sovereignty of the State. The State retains control of its fiscal affairs. The bankruptcy power is exercised ... only in a case where the action of the taxing agency in carrying out a plan of composition approved by the bankruptcy court is authorized by state law.' 304 U.S. at pages 50, 51, 58 S.Ct. at page 815. New Jersey expressly prohibits any municipality to avail itself of a federal bankruptcy act 'unless the approval of the municipal finance commission ... be first had and obtained'. Revised Statutes of New Jersey (1937), 52:27-40, N.J.S.A. 52:27-40. The City of Asbury Park has never attempted to resort to a federal bankruptcy court, and the New Jersey Municipal Finance Commission has not authorized it to do so. Can it be that a power that was not recognized until 1938, and when so recognized, was carefully circumscribed to reserve full freedom \n\n[316 \nU.S. 502, 509]\n\u00a0\n to the states, has now been completely absorbed by the federal government- that a state which, as in the case of New Jersey, has after long study devised elaborate machinery for the autonomous regulation of problems as peculiarly local as the fiscal management of its own household, is powerless in this field? We think not.\n This brings us to the second and main contention, namely, that the appellants' claims in the form of the bonds and coupons issued by the City of Asbury Park, constituted contracts, the obligation of which is impaired by the denial of their right to recover thereon and by their transmutation, without their consent, into the securities authorized by the plan of adjustment.\n The principal asset of a municipality is its taxing power and that, unlike an asset of a private corporation, can not be available for distribution. An unsecured municipal security is therefore merely a draft on the good faith of a municipality in exercising its taxing power. The notion that a city has unlimited taxing power is, of course, an illusion. A city cannot be taken over and operated for the benefit of its creditors, nor can its creditors take over the taxing power. Indeed, so far as the federal Constitution is concerned, the taxing power of a municipality is not even within its own control-it i wholly subordinate to the unrestrained power of the state over political subdivisions of its own creation. 'A municipal corporation ... is a representative not only of the State, but is a portion of its governmental power. ... The State may withdraw these local powers of government at pleasure, and may, through its legislature or other appointed channels, govern the local territory as it governs the State at large. It may enlarge or contract its powers or destroy its existence.' United States v. Railroad Company, 17 Wall. 322, 329. And see Hunter v. Pittsburgh, \n207 \nU.S. 161\n, 28 S.Ct. 40.\n In effect, therefore, the practical value of an unsecured claim against the city is inseparable from reliance upon \n\n[316 \nU.S. 502, 510]\n\u00a0\n the effectiveness of the city's taxing power. The only remedy for the enforcement of such a claim is a mandamus to compel the levying of authorized taxes. The experience of the two modern periods of municipal defaults, after the depressions of '73 and '93, shows that the right to enforce claims against the city through mandamus is the empty right to litigate. See Hillhouse, Lessons from Previous Eras of Default (chap. IV in Chatters, Municipal Debt Defaults); Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission on the Study and Investigation of the Work, Activities, Personnel and Functions of Protective and Reorganization Committees (1936), Pt. IV: Committees of the Holders of Municipal and Quasi-Municipal Obligations, passim; Dimock, Legal Problems of Financially Embarrassed Municipalities, contained in Summary of Proceedings, American Bar Ass'n., 1st Annual Meeting (1935), Section of Municipal Law, p. 12.\n How, then, can claims against a financially embarrassed city be enforced? Experience shows that three conditions are essential if the municipality is to be kept going as a political community and, at the same time, the utmost for the benefit of the creditors is to be realized: impartial, outside control over the finances of the city; concerted action by all the creditors to avoid destructive action by individuals; and rateable distribution. In short, what is needed is a temporary scheme of public receivership over a subdivision of the state. A policy of every man for himself is destructive of the potential resources upon which rests the taxing power which in actual fact constitutes the security for unsecured obligations outstanding against a city.\n To deny a state the means of giving substance to the taxing power which alone gives meaning to unsecured municipal obligations, is to hold in effect that the right to pursue a sterile litigation is an 'obligation' protected by \n\n[316 \nU.S. 502, 511]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution of the United States. For there is no remedy when resort is had to 'devices and contrivances' to nullify the taxing power which can be carried out only through authorized officials. See Rees v. City of Watertown, 19 Wall. 107, 124. And so we have had the spectacle of taxing officials resigning from office in order to frustrate tax levies through mandamus, and officials running on a platform of willingness to go to jail rather than to enforce a tax levy (see Raymond, State and Municipal Bonds, 342-43), and evasion of service by tax collectors, thus making impotent a court's mandate. Yost v. Dallas County, \n236 \nU.S. 50, 57\n, 35 S.Ct. 235, 236. But if taxes can only be protected by the authority of the state and the state can withdraw that authority, the authority to levy a tax is imported into an obligation to pay an unsecured municipal claim, and there is also imported the power of the state to modify the means for exercising the taxing power effectively in order to discharge such obligation, in view of conditions not contemplated when the claims arose. Impairment of an obligation means refusal to pay an honest debt; it does not mean contriving ways and means for paying it. The necessity compelled by unexpected financial conditions to modify an original arrangement for discharging a city's debt is implied in every such obligation for the very reason that thereby the obligation is discharged, not impaired.\n More than fifty years ago, Lord Bryce pointed out that the debt and taxation of American cities had reached 'an alarming figure'. Bryce, The American Commonwealth, p. 607. Beginning with 1915, the evil consequences of the unhealthy financial conditions of New Jersey municipalities began to occupy the attention of its legislature. Investigations by expert bodies led to a series of enactments tightening state control over municipal finances. See Reports of New Jersey Legislative Commission for the Survey of Municipal Financing, 1915, 1916, 1917; Reports \n\n[316 \nU.S. 502, 512]\n\u00a0\n of New Jersey Commission on Municipal Taxation and Finance, particularly Report No. 2 (Municipal and County Debt, 1931). The depression intensified the need for state control, and the establishment of the Municipal Finance Commission with the powers outlined above were designed, as stated by the legislature, to meet 'the public emergency arising from a default in the payment of municipal obligations, and the resulting impairment of public credit.' But this emergency, as the decisions in this Court during the last ten years amply testify, did not evaporate. Students of the subject have pointed out that in the depression of 1893 as in that of 1873 'the worst financial difficulties for municipalities came in the fourth year of the depression'. See Hillhouse, supra, at 14. History repeated itself, certainly as to New Jersey municipalities. See Report of New Jersey Municipal Finance Commission, 1937, and Second Annual Report of the Local Government Board (to which the functions of the Municipal Finance Commission were transferred in 1939), 1940, p. 11. The whole history of New Jersey legislation leaves no doubt that the state was bent on holding the municipalities to their obligations by utilizing the most widely approved means for making them effective. The intervention of the state in the fiscal affairs of its cities is plainly an exercise of its essential reserve power to protect the vital interests of its people by sustaining the public credit and maintaining local government. The payment of the creditors was the end to be obtained, but it could be maintained only by saving the resources of the municipality-the goose which lays its golden eggs, namely, the taxes which alone can meet the outstanding claims.\n The real constitutional question is whether the Contract Clause of the Constitution Art. 1,  10, bars the only proven way for assuring payment of unsecured municipal obligations. For, in the light of history, and more particularly on the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 502, 513]\n\u00a0\n basis of the recommendations of its expert advisers, the New Jersey legislature was entitled to find that in order to keep its insolvent municipalities going, and at the same time fructify their languishing sources of revenue and thus avoid repudiation, fair and just arrangements by way of compositions, scrutinized and authorized by a court, might be necessary, and that to be efficacious such a composition must bind all, after 85 per cent of the creditors assent, in order to prevent unreasonable minority obstruction. As the court below pointed out, in view of the slump of the credit of the City of Asbury Park before the adoption of the plan now assailed, appellants' bonds had little value; the new bonds issued under the plan, however, are not in default and there is a very substantial market for them. The refunding scheme, as part of a comprehensive plan for salvaging Asbury Park, both governmentally and financially, was so successful that the refunding bonds were selling at around 69 at the time of refunding, while at about the time the present suit was brought commanded a market at better than 90. See Second Annual Report of the New Jersey Local Government Board, 1940, p. 39.\n From time to time, ever since Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122, 199, it has been stated that a state insolvency act is limited by the Contract Clause of the Constitution in authorizing composition of preexisting debts. So it is, but it all depends on what is affected by such a composition and what state power it brings into play. The dictum from Sturges v. Crowninshield is one of those inaccurate generalizations that has gained momentum from uncritical repetition.\n If a state retains police power with respect to building and loan associations, Veix v. Sixth Ward Building & Loan Ass'n, \n310 \nU.S. 32, 38\n, 60 S.Ct. 792, 794, because of their relation to the financial wellbeing of the state, and if it may authorize the reorganization of an insolvent bank upon the approval of a state superin- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 502, 514]\n\u00a0\n tendent of banks and a court, but over the dissent of one-fourth of the depositors (except preferred or secured claimants), Doty v. Love, \n295 \nU.S. 64\n, 55 S.Ct. 558, 96 A.L.R. 1438, a state should certainly not be denied a like power for the maintenance of its political subdivisions and for the protection not only of their credit but of all the creditors by an adjustment assented to by at least 85 per cent of the creditors, approved by the commission of the state having oversight of its municipalities, and found wise and just after due hearing by a court.\n The Constitution is 'intended to preserve practical and substantial rights, not to maintain theories.' Davis v. Mills. \n194 \nU.S. 451, 457\n, 24 S. Ct. 692, 695. Particularly in a case like this are we in the realm of actualities and not of abstractions and paper rights, of what things are worth in dollars and cents, and in what is proposed to realize paper values. 'The question whether the remedy on this contract was impaired materially is affected not only by the precarious character of the plaintiff's right, but by considerations of fact,-of what the remedy amounted to in practice.' Pittsburgh Steel Co. v. Baltimore Eq. Soc., \n226 \nU.S. 455, 459\n, 33 S.Ct. 167, 168. This was said of the claim of a creditor of a private corporation. How much more pertinent is it to claims of these appellants against the municipality of Asbury Park in the circumstances before us. \n2\n To say that the right of \n\n[316 \nU.S. 502, 515]\n\u00a0\n the Asbury Park bondholders in 1935 was a precarious character is pure understatement. And we have already seen how empty was the remedy with which to enforce that right.\n'In the books there is much talk about distinctions between changes of the substance of the contract and changes of the remedy. ... The dividing line is at times obscure.' Worthen Co. v. Kavanaugh, \n295 \nU.S. 56, 60\n, 55 S.Ct. 555, 556, 97 A.L.R. 905. The dividing line will remain obscure if we deal with empty abstract rights instead of worldly gains and losses, if we indulge in doctrinaire talk about 'rights' and 'remedies', instead of giving these concepts a content that carries meaning to the understanding of men. Here we have no such action as that disclosed in Worthen Co. v. Kavanaugh, supra, where with 'studied indifference to the interests of the mortgagee or to his appropriate protection', legislation was found to 'have taken from the mortgage the quality of an acceptable investment for a rational investor,' and the challenged changes of remedy were found to be 'an oppressive and unnecessary destruction of nearly all the incidents that give attractiveness and value to collateral security'. Here we have just the opposite-no security whatever except the effective taxing power of the municipality; the effective taxing power of the municipality prostrate without state intervention to revive the famished finances of the city; state intervention, carefully devised, worked out with scrupulous detail and with due regard to the interests of all the creditors, and scrutinized to that end by the state judiciary with the result that that which was \n\n[316 \nU.S. 502, 516]\n\u00a0\n a most depreciated claim of little value has, by the very scheme complained of, been saved and transmuted into substantial value. To call a law so beneficent in its consequences on behalf of the creditor who, having had so much restored to him, now insists on standing on the paper rights that were merely paper before this resuscitating scheme, an impairment of the obligation of contract is indeed to make of the Constitution a code of lifeless forms instead of an enduring framework of government for a dynamic society.\n\n We do not go beyond the case before us. Different considerations may come into play in different situations. Thus we are not here concerned with legislative changes touching secured claims. The New Jersey courts have held that under this very statute tax anticipations and revenue notes stand on an entirely different footing from other municipal obligations and in relation to them no claim is affected by the Municipal Finance Commission Act of 1931. State v. Fort Lee, 188 A. 689, 14 N.J.Misc. 895. The differentiation thus made by New Jersey regarding various obligations in itself indicates the detailed care with which the legislation of the State proceeded in readjusting outstanding municipal obligations.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice REED concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The text of the legislation as incorporated in N.J.Revised Statutes ( 1937), tit. 52, c. 27, indicates the careful character of the legislation:\n'52:27-34. Petition by creditors; plan of adjustment or composition; parties; notice. Upon the verified petition of any creditors of a municipality in which the commission shall function, made on behalf of themselves and all other creditors of the municipality, for the approval of a plan of adjustment or composition of the claims of all creditors or of a class or classes of them similarly situated, which plan shall be submitted with and made a part of the petition, the supreme court by a justice thereof may take jurisdiction of the subject matter and order the filing of the petition in the office of the clerk of the supreme court.\n\n'The municipality and the commission shall be made parties to such proceeding. All creditors of the municipality shall be made parties thereto by notice to be published and given in such manner as the supreme court by its justice may direct. Any creditor of the municipality may appear and assert his rights.\n\n'52:27-35. Allegations in petition. In the petition the creditors shall allege that the municipality is or will be unable to pay in full according to their terms the claims proposed to be adjusted or composed and perform its public functions and preserve the value of property subject to taxation, that the adjustment or composition proposed in the plan is substantially measured by the capacity of the municipality to pay, is in the interests of all the creditors affected thereby, and is not detrimental to other creditors of the municipality.\n\n'52:27-36. Approval by supreme court justice of plan of adjustment or composition; findings. In any such proceeding, after hearing on the plan proposed or on the plan as modified by order and if such plan as proposed or modified is approved in writing by creditors representing eighty-five per cent in amount of the indebtedness affected thereby and by the municipality and the commission, the supreme court by a justice thereof may by order authorize and approve such adjustment or composition if the court by its justice determines (1) that the municipality is unable to pay in full according to their terms the claims proposed to be adjusted or composed, and perform its public functions and preserve the value of property subject to taxation, (2) that the adjustment or composition is substantially measured by the capacity of the municipality to pay, (3) that it is in the interest of all the creditors affected thereby, and (4) that it is not detrimental to other creditors of the municipality. \n\n'52:27-37. Approved plan binding on all creditors; substituted obligations. The plan of adjustment so authorized and approved shall forthwith and without any further action of any kind be binding upon all the creditors included in the plan, whether or not they appear in the proceeding. In so far as said plan provides for the substitution of any new bonds, notes or other obligations of the municipality in place of any outstanding bonds, notes or other obligations, or claims then outstanding, such substitution shall be effectual from and after such date as may be fixed in such order.\n\n'52:27-38. Continuance of stay of proceedings against municipality; action by creditor to enforce claim restricted. After the institution of any proceeding provided for by this article and pending the determination thereof, the supreme court by a justice thereof may by order continue the stay provided by sections 52:27-32.1 and 52:27-33 of this title.\n\n'In the event that a plan shall be authorized and approved pursuant to this article the court shall retain jurisdiction of such proceeding and thereafter no creditor whose claim is included in such adjustment or composition shall be authorized to bring any action or proceeding of any kind or character for the enforcement of his claim except with the permission of the supreme court and then only to recover and enforce the rights given him by the adjustment or composition.\n\n'52:27-39. Reduction in principal of outstanding notes or bonds prohibited. Notwithstanding any provisions of this article the commission shall not approve any adjustment or composition, or plan presented pursuant to this article, which provides for the reduction in the principal amount of any outstanding notes or bonds of the municipality.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Compare Chicago, etc., Railroad Co. v. Nebraska, \n170 \nU.S. 57, 72\n, 18 S.Ct. 513, 519. 'Usually, where a contract, not contrary to public policy, has been entered into between parties competent to contract, it is not within the power of either party to withdraw from its terms, without the consent of the other; and the obligation of such a contract is constitutionally protected from hostile legislation. Where, however, the respective parties are not private persons, dealing with matters and things in which the public has no concern, but are persons or corporations whose rights and powers were created for public purposes, by legislative acts, and where the subject-matter of the contract is one which affects the safety and welfare of the public, other principles apply. Contracts of the latter description are held to be within the supervising power and control of the legislature when exercised to protect the public safety, health, and morals, and that clause of the federal constitution which protects contracts from legislative action cannot in every case be successfully invoked. The presumption is that, when such contracts are entered into, it is with the knowledge that parties cannot, by making agreements on subjects involving the rights of the public, withdraw such subjects from the police power of the legislature.' \n\n\n\n\n","36":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFEDERAL POWER COMMISSION v. NATURAL GAS PIPELINE CO.(1942)\nNo. 265\nArgued: Decided: March 16, 1942\n\n\n Pipeline Co. \n315 \nU.S. 575\n (1942) ]\n\n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 577]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George I. Haight, of Chicago, Ill., S. A. L. Morgan, of Amarillo, Tex., and J. J. Hedrick, of Chicago, Ill., for Natural Gas Pipeline Co. et al.\n Messrs. Francis Biddle, Atty. Gen., Charles Fahy, Sol. Gen., and Richard H. Demuth, of Washington, D.C., for Federal Power Commission.\n Mr. Albert E. Hallett, Jr., of Chicago, Ill., for Illinois Commerce Commission. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 578]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a rate case involving numerous questions which arise out of the Federal Power Commission's regulation, under  5(a) and 13 of the Natural Gas Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 821, 15 U.S.C.  717 et seq., 15 U.S.C.A .  717 et seq., of the rates to be charged for the sale of natural gas by cross-petitioners, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America and Texoma Natural Gas Company.\n The two companies are engaged in business as a single enterprise. They produce natural gas from their own reserves in the Panhandle gas fields in Texas, and purchase gas produced there by others. They transport the gas by their own pipeline in interstate commerce to Illinois, where they sell the bulk of it at wholesale to utilities, which distribute and sell it for domestic, commercial and industrial uses.\n The companies began operations in 1932 with a capital structure of $ 60,000,000 of six per cent bonds, later increased by $999,000, and $3,500, 000 of common stock, of which $500,000 is stock of the Texoma Company, a non-profit corporation paying no dividends on its stock. During the first seven years of operation, beginning January 1, 1932, and extending through 1938, the companies charged against gross income various depreciation and depletion deductions aggregating $13,077,488,1 and in addition \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 579]\n\u00a0\n charged $6,481,322 for 'retirements' of property. In that period they paid dividends amounting in all to $9,150,000. Although there were book deficits in earnings for the first two years, the total 'net profit' available for dividends and surplus after payment of interest on the bonds was $8,224,436,2 or an annual average of $1,174,919, which is 33.6% per annum on the $3,500,000 stock. The earnings available during the period for return on the capital investment of both stockholders and bondholders- after taking out of income $19,558,810 for depreciation, depletion and retirements-totalled $34,040,883; this makes an average of $4,862,983 annually, which is about 8% on the book figures for investment undepreciated, or 8.8% after deducting from investment the average depreciation and depletion reserves actually charged to earnings by the companies. \n3\n At the time of the hearing, over one-fourth of the bonds issued had been retired out of earnings.\n On complaint of the Illinois Commerce Commission, and on its own motion, the Power Commission began separate investigations of the companies' rates. These proceedings were consolidated and after extensive hearings the Commission, for the purpose of issuing an interim order, accepted the companies' statement that the book cost of their property existing at the end of 1938 was $60,172,843, including working capital of $ 975,000. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 580]\n\u00a0\n Likewise for the purpose of the order, it accepted the companies' estimate that the value of all physical property-calculated at reproduction cost new (except for gas reserves taken on the companies' statement to have a present value of $13,334,775)-was $74,420,424, which the Commission adopted as the rate base. It took the companies' own estimate of twenty- three years ending in 1954 as the life of the business, and for the amortization base used their cost figure of $78,284,009 for the total past and estimated future investment after deduction of estimated salvage. It calculated the 'annual amortization expense' on that amount for the twenty- three year period, at a 6 1\/2% sinking fund interest rate, as $1,557,852, which it allowed.\n The Commission also accepted, for the purpose of its interim order, the companies' estimate of prospective income available for amortization and return for the period 1939 to 1942, inclusive, as averaging $9,511,454 per annum. But making allowance for higher income tax rates under the Revenue Act of 1940, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Acts, it found that the income available for amortization and return would be decreased to $9,362,032. It concluded that the companies' estimate of return, less the amortization allowance ($9,362,032 less $1,557,852),-or $7,804,180-exceeded the fair return, $4,837,328 (which is 6 1\/2% of the rate base of $74,420,424), by $ 2,966,852, which amount was available for reduction of net revenues. Taking into account the decrease of $783,909 in federal income taxes which would result from such a decline in revenues, the Commission decided there was a total of $3,750,000 annually available for reduction of rates. It found the existing rates were 'unjust, unreasonable and excessive', and made its interim order directing the companies to file a new schedule of rates and charges effective after September 1, 1940, which would bring about an annual reduction of $3,750,000 in operating revenues. The \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 581]\n\u00a0\n order also provided that the record should 'remain open' for such further proceedings as the Commission may deem necessary or desirable.\n On the companies' petition for review of the order pursuant to  19(b) of the Act, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, 120 F.2d 625, 635, upheld the validity of the rate regulation provisions of the Act, and the Commission's authority under the statute to issue the interim order directing reduction of the rates and requiring respondents to file new schedules reflecting that reduction. But the court vacated the Commission's order on the sole grounds that 'going concern value' to the extent of $8,500,000 should have been included in the rate base, and that the amortization period for the entire property, instead of the full twenty-three year estimated life of the business taken by the Commission, should have been dated from the passage of the Act or the time of the Commission's order.\n We granted certiorari, \n314 \nU.S. 593\n, 62 S.Ct. 91, 86 L.Ed. --, because of the novelty and importance of the questions presented upon the Commission's petition challenging the grounds of reversal below, and on the companies' cross petition assailing the constitutionality of the Act, the authority of the Commission to make the interim order the prescribed 6 1\/2% return, the computation of the amortization allowance on the same rate of interest as the fair rate of return, and other features of the Commission's order presently to be discussed.\n The Natural Gas Act declares that 'the business of transporting and selling natural gas for ultimate distribution to the public is affected with a public interest', and that federal regulation of interstate commerce in natural gas 'is necessary in the public interest'.  1(a). The Act directs that all rates and charges in connection with the transportation or sale of natural gas, subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, shall be 'just and rea- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 582]\n\u00a0\n sonable' and declares to be unlawful any rate or charge which is not just and reasonable.  4(a). By  5 the Commission, on its own motion or the complaint of a state, municipality, state commission or gas distributing company, is empowered to investigate the rates charged by any natural gas company in connection with any transportation or sale of any natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, and after a hearing to determine just and reasonable rates.\n Constitutionality of the Act. The argument that the provisions of the statute applied in this case are unconstitutional on their face is without merit. The sale of natural gas originating in one state and its transportation and delivery to distributors in any other state constitutes interstate commerce, which is subject to regulation by Congress. Illinois Natural Gas Co. v. Central Illinois Pub. Serv. Co., \n314 \nU.S. 498\n, 62 S.Ct. 384, 86 L.Ed. --. It is no objection to the exercise of the power of Congress that it is attended by the same incidents which attend the exercise of the police power of a state. The authority of Congress to regulate the prices of commodities in interstate commerce is at least as great under the Fifth Amendment as is that of the states under the Fourteenth to regulate the prices of commodities in intrastate commerce. Compare United States v. Carolene Products Co., \n304 \nU.S. 144\n, 58 S.Ct. 778; United States v. Rock Royal Co-op., \n307 \nU.S. 533, 569\n, 59 S. Ct. 993, 1010; Sunshine Coal Co. v.

Nebraska, \n313 \nU.S. 236\n, 61 S.Ct. 862, 133 A.L.R. 1500\n\n\n The price of gas distributed through pipelines for public consumption has been too long and consistently recognized as a proper subject of regulation under the Fourteenth Amendment to admit of doubts concerning the propriety of like regulation under the Fifth.

And the fact that the distribution here involved is by wholesale rather than retail sales presents no differences of significance to the protection of the public interest which is the object of price regulation. Cf. Illinois Nat. Gas Co. v. Central Illinois Pub. Serv. Co., supra. The business of cross-petitioners is not any the less subject to regulation now because the Government has not seen fit to regulate it in the past. Cf. Nebbia v. People of New York, supra, 291 U.S. pages 538, 539, 54 S.Ct. page 516, 89 A.L.R. 1469.\n Validity of the Interim Order. The companies contend that the Federal Power Commission has no authority under the Act to enter the type of order now under review, and that the order is invalid because the Commission did not itself fix reasonable rates as required by the Act but instead merely directed the companies to file a new rate schedule which would result in the prescribed reduction in operating revenues. Section 5(a) of the Act provides: 'Whenever the Commission, after a hearing ..., shall find that any rate ... is unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory, or preferential, the Commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate ... and shall fix the same by order'. It also contains a proviso that the Commission shall not have power to order an increase of rates on file unless in accordance with a new schedule filed by the company. But without mention of new rate schedules the proviso adds that the Commission 'may order a decrease where existing rates are unjust ... or are not the lowest reasonable rates'. And  16 gives the Commission 'power to ... issue ... such orders ... as it may find necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this Act (chapter)'.\n The first prerequisite to an order by the Commission is that it shall be preceded by a hearing and findings. In this case, while the proceedings were not ended by the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 584]\n\u00a0\n interim order, the companies had full opportunity to offer all their evidence both direct and in rebuttal, and full opportunity to cross- examine every witness offered by both the Federal Power Commission and the Illinois Commerce Commission. All the evidence tendered was received and considered by the Commission, and before the interim order was entered counsel for the companies stated to the Commission that they had concluded the direct testimony in support of their case. So far as the order is supported by the evidence the companies cannot complain that they were denied a full hearing because they had not been able to examine on redirect their own witnesses who had not been cross-examined, or because they had no opportunity to cross-examine or rebut witnesses who were not offered by the Commission. The right to a full hearing before any tribunal does not include the right to challenge or rely on evidence not offered or considered. See New England Divisions Case (Akron, C. & Y.R. Co. v. United States), \n261 \nU.S. 184, 201\n, 43 S.Ct. 270, 277.\n The establishment of a rate for a regulated industry often involves two steps of different character, one of which may appropriately precede the other. The first is the adjustment of the general revenue level to the demands of a fair return. The second is the adjustment of a rate schedule conforming to that level so as to eliminate discriminations and unfairness from its details. Such an orderly procedure for establishing the rates prescribed by the Act would seem to be an appropriate means of carrying out its provisions. Section 5 of the Act was modelled on the provisions of the Transportation Act, 49 U.S.C.  13, 15, 49 U.S.C.A.  13, 15, which have been interpreted as giving to the Interstate Commerce Commission authority to establish a general level of rates and divisions in advance of a schedule to be filed by the carriers. See New England Divisions Case, supra, 261 U.S. page 201, 202, 203, n. 21, 43 S.Ct. pages 277, 278. Cf. Sharfman, The Interstate Commerce \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 585]\n\u00a0\n Commission, vol. 2, pp. 381, 382; Driscoll v. Edison Co., \n307 \nU.S. 104\n, 59 S.Ct. 715.\n We think that the proviso of  5 already quoted contemplates that, when existing rates are found to be unjust and unreasonable, an order decreasing revenues may be filed without establishing a specific schedule of rates. Since such an order may be in the interests of the public, as well as the regulated company, and is in harmony with the purposes of the Act, it is one which the Commission has discretion to make under  16 as appropriate to carry out the provisions of the Act.\n The Scope of Judicial Review of Rates Prescribed by the Commission. The ultimate question for our decision is whether the rate prescribed by the Commission is too low. The statute declares,  4(a), that the rates of natural gas companies subject to the Act 'shall be just and reasonable, and any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared to be unlawful'. Section 5(a) directs the Commission to 'determine the just and reasonable rate' to be observed and requires the Commission to 'fix the same by order'. It also provides that 'the Commission may order a decrease where existing rates are unjust ... unlawful, or are not the lowest reasonable rates'. On review of the Commission's orders by a Circuit Court of Appeals as authorized by  19(b), the Commission's findings of fact 'if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive'.\n By long standing usage in the field of rate regulation the 'lowest reasonable rate' is one which is not confiscatory in the constitutional sense. Los Angeles Gas Corp. v. Railroad Commission, \n289 \nU.S. 287, 305\n, 53 S.Ct. 637, 643; Railroad Commission v. Pacific Gas Co., supra, 302 U.S. pages 394, 395, 58 S.Ct. page 338; Denver Stock Yard Co. v. United States, \n304 \nU.S. 470, 475\n, 58 S.Ct. 990, 994. Assuming that there is a zone of reasonableness within which the Commission is free to fix a rate varying in amount and higher than a confiscatory rate, see Banton v. Belt \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 586]\n\u00a0\n Line Ry., \n268 \nU.S. 413, 422\n, 423 S., 45 S.Ct. 534, 537; Columbus Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n292 \nU.S. 398, 414\n, 54 S. Ct. 763, 770; Denver Stock Yard Co. v. United States, supra, 304 U.S. page 483, 58 S.Ct. page 998, the Commission is also free under  5(a) to decrease any rate which is not the 'lowest reasonable rate'. It follows that the Congressional standard prescribed by this statute coincides with that of the Constitution, and that the courts are without authority under the statute to set aside as too low any 'reasonable rate' adopted by the Commission which is consistent with constitutional requirements.\n The Constitution does not bind rate-making bodies to the service of any single formula or combination of formulas. Agencies to whom this legislative power has been delegated are free, within the ambit of their statutory authority, to make the pragmatic adjustments which may be called for by particular circumstances. Once a fair hearing has been given, proper findings made and other statutory requirements satisfied, the courts cannot intervene in the absence of a clear showing that the limits of due process have been overstepped. If the Commission's order, as applied to the facts before it and viewed in its entirety, produces no arbitrary result, our inquiry is at an end.\n Going Concern Value. The companies insist that their business has a going concern value of $8,500,000 which the Commission did not include in the rate base and on which they are entitled to earn a return. In establishing the rate base for the purposes of the interim order the Commission 'reluctantly' accepted the estimates of value, presented by the companies' own witnesses, as follows:\n Reproduction Cost New of Physical Properties (exclusive of Gas Reserves) $56,302,250 4 Value of Gas Reserves as of June 1, 1939 13,334,775 Capital Additions from June 1, 1939, to December 31, 1942 3,808,399 5 Working Capital 975,000 ___\n Total Rate Base $74,420,424 \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 587]\n\u00a0\n While no item for going concern value is separately stated in the rate base, the computation of cost new of physical equipment included-in addition to labor and cost of materials-large amounts for overhead, interest, taxes, administration, legal and supervisory charges, and expenses paid or incurred in assembling the plant as that of a going concern.\n The Commission spoke of the rate base thus arrived at as 'liberal' and as a 'generous allowance'. That the estimate of reproduction costs new is liberal is indicated by the circumstances that the companies' structures other than gas reserves were built in 1930-1931 at a time, as the record shows, of relatively high prices, and that their reproduction cost depreciated is greater than actual cost, which was about $50,000,000. And the allowed 'present value' of leases as of June 1, 1939, $13,334,775, is approximately $4,000,000 more than book cost, even without taking into account a substantial reduction for depletion reserves of $1,152,854, which the companies had accrued on \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 588]\n\u00a0\n their own books by the end of 1938. The Commission declined to include going concern value as an additional item in the rate base.\n The companies urge, as the Court of Appeals held, that there are items of cost or expense incurred in the establishment and development of the business during the seven-year period prior to regulation which were not included in the companies' estimate of value accepted by the Commission and which, in view of the special characteristics of the business, should be capitalized and added to the rate base to the extent of $8,500,000 for going concern value. They include, in amounts not now material, the following: expenditures for securing new business; interest on money invested in non-productive plant capacity; taxes paid on non- productive capacity; fixed operating expenses attributable to non- productive capacity, and depreciation on non-productive capacity. \n6\n The companies' contentions with respect to all these items are predicated upon the limited life of the business, twenty-three years, and on testimony that in anticipation of its growth larger gas mains and facilities were constructed than were required during the earlier years of the business. The reproduction cost new of this excess of equipment is admittedly included in the rate base.\n None of these items appears in the companies' capital account. With the possible exception of expenditures for securing new business, they are synthetic figures arrived at by estimating the amount of expense attributable to the current cost of maintenance of the excess capacity of the plant during periods when the excess capacity was not \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 589]\n\u00a0\n used. But the interest charges, taxes and other costs of maintaining this excess capacity during the period when not in use have not been capitalized by the companies on their books and so far as appears were paid from current earnings. The same is true of the expenditure for advertising and other expenses of acquiring new business.\n The novel question is thus presented whether confiscation, prescribed by Congress as well as the Constitution, results from the exclusion from the rate base of the previous costs of maintaining excess plant capacity and of getting new business. The Commission gave full consideration to this contention. It said: 'The companies' claim for $8,500,000 for going concern value must be disallowed. The amount obviously is an arbitrary claim, not supported by substantial evidence warranting its allowance. Its allowance would mean the acceptance of a deceptive fiction, resulting in an unfair imposition upon consumers. We are convinced that we are allowing in our rate base more than an adequate amount to cover all elements of value.'\n There is no constitutional requirement that going concern value, even when it is an appropriate element to be included in a rate base, must be separately stated and appraised as such. This Court has often sustained valuations for rate purposes of a business assembled as a whole without separate appraisal of the going concern element. Columbus Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n292 \nU.S. 398, 411\n, 54 S.Ct. 763, 769; Dayton P. & L. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n292 \nU.S. 290, 309\n, 54 S.Ct. 647, 656; Denver Stock Yard Co. v. United States, supra, 304 U.S. pages 478-480, 58 S.Ct. pages 995, 996; Driscoll v. Edison Co., supra, 307 U.S. page 117, 59 S.Ct. page 721. When that has been done the burden rests on the regulated company to show that this item has neither been adequately covered in the rate base nor recouped from prior earnings of the business. Des Moines Gas Co. v. City of Des Moines, \n238 \nU.S. 153, 166\n, 35 S.Ct. 811, 815. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 590]\n\u00a0\n The total value of the companies' plant, including equipment in excess of immediate needs when beginning business, has been included in the rate base adopted. If rightly included, as the Commission has assumed for purposes of the order, the companies would have been entitled to earn a fair return upon its value, had the business been regulated from the start. But it does not follow that the companies' property would be confiscated by denying to them the privilege of capitalizing the maintenance cost of excess plant capacity, which would allow them to earn a return and amortization allowance upon such costs during the entire life of the business. It is only on the assumption that excess capacity is a part of the utility's equipment used and useful in the regulated business, that it can be included as a part of the rate base on which a return may be earned. When so included the utility gets its return not from capitalizing the maintenance cost, but from current earnings by rates sufficient, having in view the character of the business, to secure a fair return upon the rate base provided the business is capable of earning it. But regulation does not insure that the business shall produce net revenues, nor does the Constitution require that the losses of the business in one year shall be restored from future earnings by the device of capitalizing the losses and adding them to the rate base on which a fair return and depreciation allowance is to be earned. Galveston Electric Co. v. City of Galveston, \n258 \nU.S. 388\n, 42 S.Ct. 351; San Diego Land & Town Co. v. Jasper, \n189 \nU.S. 439, 446\n, 447 S., 23 S.Ct. 571, 573, 574. The deficency may not be thus added to the rate base for the obvious reason that the hazard that the property will not earn a profit remains on the company in the case of a regulated, as well as an unregulated business.\n Here the companies, though unregulated, always treated their entire original investment, together with subsequent additions, as capital on which profit was to be earned. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 591]\n\u00a0\n They charged the out-of-pocket cost of maintenance of plant, whether used to capacity or not, as operating expenses deductible from earnings before arriving at net profits. They have thus treated the items now sought to be capitalized in the rate base as operating expenses to be compensated from earnings, as in the case of regulated companies. The history of the first seven years of operation before regulation shows an average annual return, 7 after deduction of operating expenses, of approximately 8% on the undepreciated investment. This high return was earned during a period which included the severest depression in our history.\n Whether there is going concern value in any case depends upon the financial history of the business. City of Houston v. Southwestern Tel. Co ., \n259 \nU.S. 318, 325\n, 42 S.Ct. 486, 489. This is peculiarly true of a business which derives its estimates of going concern value from a financial history preceding regulation. That history here discloses no basis for going concern value, both because the elements relied upon for that purpose could rightly be rejected as capital investment in the case of a regulated company, and because in the present case it does not appear that the items, which have never been treated as capital investment, have not been recouped during the unregulated period.\n We cannot say that the Commission has deprived the companies of their property by refusing to permit them to earn for the future a fair return and amortization on the costs of maintenance of initial excess capacity- costs which the companies fail to show have not already been recouped from earnings before computing the substantial 'net profits' earned during the first seven years. The items for advertising and acquiring new business have been treated in the same way by the companies and do \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 592]\n\u00a0\n not in the circumstances of this case stand on any different footing. Cf. West Ohio Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n294 \nU.S. 63, 72\n, 55 S.Ct. 316, 321.\n The Amortization Base. The Commission took as the amortization base the sum of $78,284,009. This was made up of the companies' total investment, at the end of 1938, of $67,173,761 (without deduction of property retirements already made), plus estimated future capital additions through 1954, including replacements, amounting to $12,159,380,8 less estimated salvage at the predicted end of the project in 1954. It is not questioned that the Commission's annual amortization allowance of $1, 557,852, accumulated at the sinking fund interest rate of 6 1\/2% adopted by the order, will be sufficient in 1954 to restore the capital investment so computed.\n The companies argue that the amortization base, computed on a basis of reproduction cost, should be $84,341,2189 rather than cost plus estimated future capital additions. But the purpose of the amortization allowance and its justification is that it is a means of restoring from current earnings the amount of service capacity of the business consumed in each year. Lindheimer v. Illinois \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 593]\n\u00a0\n Tel. Co., \n292 \nU.S. 151, 167\n, 54 S.Ct. 658, 664. When the property is devoted to a business which can exist for only a limited term, any scheme of amortization which will restore the capital investment at the end of the term involves no deprivation of property. Even though the reproduction cost of the property during the period may be more than its actual cost, this theoretical accretion to value represents no profit to the owner since the property dedicated to the business, save for its salvage value, is destined for the scrap-heap when the business ends. The Constitution does not require that the owner who embarks in a wasting- asset business of limited life shall receive at the end more than he has put into it. We need not now consider whether, as the Government urges, there can in no circumstances be a constitutional requirement that the amortization base be the reproduction value rather than the actual cost of the property devoted to a regulated business. Cf. United Railways v. West, \n280 \nU.S. 234, 265\n, 50 S.Ct. 123, 130. It is enough that here the business by hypothesis will end in 1954, and that the amortization base, computed at cost and including property already retired, will be completely restored by 1954 by the annual amortization allowances. As the Commission declared: 'The amounts of amortization are recognized and treated as operating expenses. Operating expenses are stated on the basis of cost. ... We refuse to make an allowance of amortization in excess of costs. To do so would not be the computation of a proper expense, but instead the allowance of additional profit over and above a fair return. Manifestly such an additional return would unjustly penalize consumers.'\n The Amortization Period. The court below held that, since the business was unregulated for the first seven years, the adoption by the Commission of the estimated twenty-three year life of the business as the amortization period involved a denial of due process. In view of the estimate by the Commission and the companies that the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 594]\n\u00a0\n gas properties would be exhausted in about sixteen years from the date of the Act, the court thought, as the companies argue, that a rate of return would be confiscatory which would not provide, in addition to a fair return, an annual amortization allowance sufficient to restore the total investment over the final sixteen-year period. But this argument overlooks the fact that the depreciation of physical property attributed to use, and the obsolescence of the entire property attributable to lapse of time in the case of a business having a limited life, had been taking place during the seven years before regulation and that those items must be recouped if at all from earnings. Capital investment loss at the end of the life of a business can only be avoided by restoration of the investment from earnings, and is avoidable so far as is humanly possible only by an appropriate charge of amortization to earnings as they accrue.\n Here there is no question but that the Commission's annual amortization allowance, if applied over the entire twenty-three year life of the business, is sufficient to restore the total capital investment at the end, or that earnings of the past and those estimated for the future together are sufficient to provide for the amortization allowance and a fair return, given an appropriate rate base and rate of return. Making that assumption we cannot say that adequate provision has not been made for restoration of the companies' investment from earnings and a fair return on the investment. Even though the companies were unregulated for seven years, earnings during that period were available and adequate for amortization. In fact the companies' charges to earnings, for depreciation, depletion and retirements, totalled $19,558,810, or an average of $2,794, 115 per annum. This was in conformity with the established business practice, in the case of unregulated as well as regulated businesses, to make such a depreciation or amortization \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 595]\n\u00a0\n allowance chargeable annually to earnings as an operating expense in order to provide adequately for annual consumption of capital in the business. Lindheimer v. Illinois Tel. Co., supra.\n The companies are not deprived of property by a requirement that they credit in the amortization account so much of the earnings received during the prior period as are appropriately allocable to it for amortization. Only by that method is it possible to determine the amount of earnings which may justly be required for amortization during the remaining life of the business.\n Amortization Interest Rate. The annual amortization allowances of $1, 557,852, if accumulated at a 6 1\/2% compound interest rate until the assumed exhaustion of the gas reserves in 1954, will be sufficient to restore the undepreciated total investment less the salvage value of the property. The companies urge that the interest rate should have been lower, say 2%, on the assumption that only some such lower rate would be earned by a hypothetical sinking fund to be created from the annual amortization allowances. But the argument ignores the fact that the amortization method adopted by the Commission contemplates not a sinking fund of segregated securities purchased with cash withdrawn from the business, but merely a sinking fund reserve charged to earnings and not distributable as ordinary dividends. Under this method there is no deduction of the amortization allowances from the rate base on which a fair return-6 1\/2% under the current interim order-is to be allowed during the life of the business.\n The companies are thus allowed to earn in each year, in addition to the amortization allowance, 6 1\/2% on both the amortized and the unamortized portions of the base. If the amortization interest were computed at a 2% rate without deducting the amortized portion from the rate base, the companies would continue to receive a 6 1\/2% \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 596]\n\u00a0\n instead of only a 2% return on that portion of the investment. True, the method of amortization adopted means that the companies look to the earnings of the business for the hypothetical interest on amortization reserve. This it is argued may involve more business risk than a method of amortization contemplating the actual withdrawal from the business of the amortization allowances and their investment in segregated securities bearing a lower rate of interest. But here the 6 1\/2% rate of return allowed on the amortized portion of the rate base includes compensation for the business risk, and the risk is an incident of the business in which the companies have hazarded their capital and in which they propose to invest additional capital. The Commission declared it adopted this method to avoid the inequitable result which would follow if the companies were permitted to include in their charges to the public 6 1\/2% on the amortized portion of the base, while treating it as earning only 2%. The Commission's conclusion that this is an appropriate method is supported by the evidence, and in any case it does not appear that it has deprived or will deprive the companies of property.\n Fair Rate of Return. The Commission found that '6 1\/2 per cent is a fair annual rate of return upon the rate base allowed', which it had characterized as 'a generous allowance'. The courts are required to accept the Commission's findings if they are supported by substantial evidence.  19(b). We cannot say on this record that the Commission was bound to allow a higher rate.\n The evidence shows that profits earned by individual industrial corporations declined from 11.3% on invested capital in 1929 to 5.1% in 1938. The profits of utility corporations declined during the same period from 7.2% to 5.1%. For railroad corporations the decline was from 6.4% to 2.3%. Interest rates were at a low level on all forms of investment and among the lowest that have \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 597]\n\u00a0\n ever existed. The securities of natural gas companies were sold at rates of return of from 3% to 6% with yields on most of their bond issues between 3% and 4%. The interest on large loans ranged from 2% to 3.25%.\n The regulated business here seems exceptionally free from hazards which might otherwise call for special consideration in determining the fair rate of return. Substantially all its product is distributed in the metropolitan area of Chicago, a stable and growing market, through distributing companies which own 26% of the investment of the Natural Gas Pipeline Company. Ninety per cent of its gas is taken under contract by the Chicago District Pipeline Company. The contract runs until 1946 or until 1951, at the option of the companies. Under it the District Company is bound to take, or at least pay for, 66 2\/3% of the companies' gas, and performance is guaranteed by the three companies distributing the gas in Chicago.\n The danger of early exhaustion of the gas field was fully taken into account in the estimate of its life and the companies' estimate was accepted. Provision for the complete amortization of the investment within that period affords a security to the investment which is lacking to those industries whose capital investments must be continued for an indefinite period. The companies' affiliation with the six large corporations which directly or indirectly own all the stock places them in a strong position for their future financing. The business is in the same position as other similar businesses with respect to increased taxation, inflation and costs of operation. Other factors such as credit risks, risks of technological changes, varying demands for product, relatively small labor requirements, and conversion of inventory into cash compare more favorably. After a full consideration of all of these factors and of expert testimony, the Commission concluded that the prescribed reduction in \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 598]\n\u00a0\n revenues was just and reasonable, and that the 6 1\/2% was a fair rate of return.\n Disposition of Excess Charges Collected Since the Commission's Order. The Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the Commission's order pending appeal. The companies state that as a condition of the stay the court required them to give a bond in the sum of $1,000,000 conditioned upon their refund of excess charges to customers, in the event that the Commission's order should be sustained. The bond is not in the record and its precise terms are not before us.\n The companies point out that substantially all the gas affected by the reduction in revenues is sold to wholesalers who distribute it for ultimate consumption. They argue that the purpose of the rate regulation is the protection of consumers, and that the purposes of the Act will not be effectuated by the refunds to wholesalers. They insist that such refunds, being the wholesalers' profits from past business, cannot be resorted to for reducing future rates to the consumers. Cf. City of Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co., \n212 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 29 S.Ct. 148, 152; Galveston Electric Co. v. City of Galveston supra, 258 U.S. page 395, 42 S.Ct. page 354.\n Of this contention it is enough to say that the question of the disposition of the excess charges is not before us for determination on the present record. Cf. Morgan v. United States, \n304 \nU.S. 1, 26\n, 58 S.Ct. 999, 1001. Amounts collected in excess of the Commission's order are declared to be unlawful by  4(a) of the Act. If there is any basis, either in the bond or the circumstances relied upon by the companies, for not compelling the companies to surrender these illegal exactions, it does not appear from the record.\n We have considered but find it unnecessary to discuss other objections of lesser moment to the Commission's order. We sustain the validity of the order and reverse the judgment below.\n Reversed. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 599]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, and Mr. Justice MURPHY, concurring.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n We concur with the Court's judgment that the rate order of the Federal Power Commission, issued after a fair hearing upon findings of fact supported by substantial evidence, should have been sustained by the court below. But insofar as the Court assumes that, regardless of the terms of the statute, the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment grants it power to invalidate an order as unconstitutional because it finds the charges to be unreasonable, we are unable to join in the opinion just announced.\n Rate making is a species of price fixing. In a recent series of cases, this Court has held that legislative price fixing is not prohibited by the due process clause. \n1\n We believe that in so holding, it has returned in part at least to the constitutional principles which prevailed for the first hundred years of our history. Munn v. Illinois, \n94 \nU.S. 113\n; Peik v. Chicago, etc., Railway Co., \n94 \nU.S. 164\n. Cf. McCart v. Indianapolis Water Co., \n302 \nU.S. 419\n, 427, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 600]\n\u00a0\n 428, 58 S.Ct. 324, 327, 328. The Munn and Peik cases, decided in 1877, Justices Field and Strong dissenting, emphatically declared price fixing to be a constitutional prerogative of the legislative branch, not subject to judicial review or revision.\n In 1886, four of the Justices who had voted with him in the Munn and Peik cases no longer being on the Court, Chief Justice Waite expressed views in an opinion of the Court which indicated a yielding in part to the doctrines previously set forth in Mr. Justice Field's dissenting opinions, although the decision, upholding a state regulatory statute, did not require him to reach this issue. See Railroad Commission Cases, \n116 \nU.S. 307, 331\n, 6 S.Ct. 334, 344, 388, 1191. For an interesting discussion of the evolution of this change of position, see Swisher, Stephen J. Field, 372-392. By 1890, six Justices of the 1877 Court, including Chief Justice Waite, had been replaced by others. The new Court then clearly repudiated the opinion expressed for the Court by Chief Justice Waite in the Munn and Peik cases, in a holding which accorded with the views of Mr. Justice Field. Chicago, etc., Railway Co. v. Minnesota, \n134 \nU.S. 418\n, 10 S.Ct. 462, 702. Under those views, first embodied in a holding of this Court in 1890, 'due process' means no less than 'reasonableness judicially determined'.2 In accordance with this elastic meaning which, in the words of Mr. Justice Holmes, makes the sky the limit3 of judicial power to declare legislative acts unconstitutional. The conclusions of judges, substituted for those of legislatures, become a broad and varying standard of constitutionality. \n4\n We \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 601]\n\u00a0\n shall not attempt now to set out at length the reasons for our belief that acceptance of such a meaning is historically unjustified and that it transfers to courts powers which, under the Constitution, belong to the legislative branch of government. But we feel that we must record our disagreement from an opinion which, although upholding the action of the Commission on these particular facts, nevertheless gives renewed vitality to a 'constitutional' doctrine which we are convinced has no support in the Constitution.\n The doctrine which makes of 'due process' an unlimited grant to courts to approve or reject policies selected by legislatures in accordance with the judges' notion of reasonableness had its origin in connection with legislative attempts to fix the prices charged by public utilities. And in no field has it had more paralyzing effects. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n II.\n\n\n We have here, to be sure, a statute which expressly provides for judicial review. Congress has provided in  5 of the Natural Gas Act that the rates fixed by the Commission shall be 'just and reasonable'. The provision for judicial review states that the 'finding of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.'  19(b). But we are not satisfied that the opinion of the Court properly delimits the scope of that review under this Act. Furthermore, since this case starts \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 602]\n\u00a0\n a new chapter in the regulation of utility rates, we think it important to indicate more explicitly than has been done the freedom which the Commission has both under the Constitution and under this new statute. While the opinion of the Court erases much which has been written in rate cases during the last half century, we think this is an appropriate occasion to lay the ghost of Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466\n, 18 S.Ct. 418, which has haunted utility regulation since 1898. That is especially desirable lest the reference by the majority to 'constitutional requirements' and to 'the limits of due process' be deemed to perpetuate the fallacious 'fair-value' theory of rate making in the limited judicial review provided by the Act.\n Smyth v. Ames held (169 U.S. pages 546, 547, 18 S.Ct. pages 433, 434) that 'the basis of all calculations as to the reasonableness of rates to be charged by a corporation maintaining a highway under legislative sanction must be the fair value of the property being used by it for the convenience of the public. And, in order to ascertain that value, the original cost of construction, the amount expended in permanent improvements, the amount and market value of its bonds and stock, the present as compared with the original cost of construction, the probable earning capacity of the property under particular rates prescribed by statute, and the sum required to meet operating expenses, are all matters for consideration, and are to be given such weight as may be just and right in each case. We do not say that there may not be other matters to be regarded in estimating the value of the property. What the company is entitled to ask is a fair return upon the value of that which it employs for the public convenience. On the other hand, what the public is entitled to demand is that no more be exacted from it for the use of a public highway than the services rendered by it are reasonably worth.'\n\n\n (1)\n This theory derives from principles of eminent domain. See Mr. Justice Brewer, Ames v. Union Pacific Ry. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 603]\n\u00a0\n Co., C.C., 64 F. 165, 177; West v. Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co., \n295 \nU.S. 662, 671\n, 55 S.Ct. 894, 897; Hale, Conflicting Judicial Criteria of Utility Rates, 38 Col.L.Rev. 959. In condemnation cases the 'value of property, generally speaking, is determined by its productiveness,-the profits which its use brings to the owner.' Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 312, 328\n, 329 S., 13 S. Ct. 622, 627. Cf. Consolidated Rock Products Co. v. Du Bois, \n312 \nU.S. 510, 525\n, 526 S., 61 S.Ct. 675, 684, 685. But those principles have no place in rate regulation. In the first place, the value of a going concern in fact depends on earnings under whatever rates may be anticipated. The present fair value rule creates but offers no solution to the dilemma that value depends upon the rates fixed and the rates upon value. See Mr. Justice Brandeis, State of Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 276, 292\n, 43 S. Ct. 544, 548, 31 A.L.R. 807; Hale, The Fair Value Merry-Co- Round, 33 Ill.L.Rev. 517; 2 Bonbright, Valuation of Property, pp. 1094 et seq. In the second place, when property is taken under the power of eminent domain the owner is 'entitled to the full money equivalent of the property taken, and thereby to be put in as good position pecuniarily as it would have occupied, if its property had not been taken.' United States v. New River Collieries Co., \n262 \nU.S. 341, 343\n, 43 S.Ct. 565, 566, 567. But in rate-making the owner does not have any such protection. We know without attempting any valuation that if earnings are reduced the value will be less. But that does not stay the hand of the legislature or its administrative agency in making rate reductions. As we have said, rate- making is one species of price-fixing. Price-fixing, like other forms of social legislation, may well diminish the value of the property which is regulated. But that is no obstacle to its validity. As stated by Mr. Justice Holmes in Block v. Hirsh, \n256 \nU.S. 135, 155\n, 41 S.Ct. 458, 459, 16 A.L.R. 165: 'The fact that tangible property is also visible tends to give rigidity to our conception of our rights in it that we do not attach to others less con- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 604]\n\u00a0\n cretely clothed. But the notion that the former are exempt from the legislative modification required from time to time in civilized life is contradicted not only by the doctrine of eminent domain, under which what is taken is paid for, but by that of the police power in its proper sense, under which property rights may be cut down, and to that extent taken, without pay.' Somewhat the same view was expressed in Nebbia v. People of New York, \n291 \nU.S. 502, 532\n, 54 S.Ct. 505, 514, 89 A.L.R. 1469, where this Court said: 'The due process clause makes no mention of sales or of prices any more than it speaks of business or contracts or buildings or other incidents of property. The thought seems nevertheless to have persisted that there is something peculiarly sacrosanct about the price one may charge for what he makes or sells, and that, however able to regulate other elements of manufacture or trade, with incidental effect upon price, the state is incapable of directly controlling the price itself. This view was negatived many years ago. Munn v. Illinois, \n94 \nU.S. 113\n.' Explicit recognition of these principles will place the problems of rate-making in their proper setting under this statute.\n\n\n (2)\n The rule of Smyth v. Ames, as construed and applied, directs the rate-making body in forming its judgment as to 'fair-value' to take into consideration various elements-capitalization, book cost, actual cost, prudent investment, reproduction cost. See Mr. Justice Brandeis, State of Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission, supra, 262 U.S. pages 294, 295, 43 S.Ct. pages 548, 549, 31 A.L.R. 807. But as stated by Mr. Justice Brandeis: 'Obviously 'value' cannot be a composite of all these elements. Nor can it be arrived at on all these bases. They are very different, and must, when applied in a particular case, lead to widely different results. The rule of Smyth v. Ames, as interpreted and applied, means merely that all must be considered. What, if any, weight shall be given to any one, must practically rest in the judicial discretion of the tribunal which makes the deter- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 605]\n\u00a0\n mination. Whether a desired result is reached may depend upon how any one of many elements is treated.' Id., 262 U.S. pages 295, 296, 43 S.Ct. page 549, 31 A.L.R. 807. The risks of not giving weight to reproduction cost have been great. State of Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission, supra; St. Louis & O'Fallon Ry. Co. v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 461\n, 49 S.Ct. 384. The havoc raised by insistence on reproduction cost is now a matter of historical record. Mr. Justice Brandeis in the Southwestern Bell Telephone case demonstrated how the rule of Smyth v. Ames has seriously impaired the power of rate-regulation and how the 'fair value' rule has proved to be unworkable by reason of the time required to make the valuations, the heavy expense involved, and the unreliability of the results obtained. \n6\n And see Mr. Justice Brandeis concurring, St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 38, 73\n, 56 S.Ct. 720, 735; dissenting opinion, McCart v. Indianapolis Water Co., \n302 \nU.S. 419\n, 423 et seq., 58 S.Ct. 324, 326; Mr. Justice Stone dissenting, West v. Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co., supra. The result of this Court's rulings in rate cases since Smyth v. Ames has recently been summarized as follows: 'Under the influence of these precedents, commission regulation has become so cumbersome and so ineffective that it may be said, with only slight exaggeration, to have broken down. Even the investor,7 on whose behalf the constitutional safeguards have \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 606]\n\u00a0\n been developed, has received no protection against the rebounds from the inflated stock-market prices that are stimulated by the 'fair-value' doctrine.' Bonbright, op. cit., p. 1154.\n As we read the opinion of the Court, the Commission is now freed from the compulsion of admitting evidence on reproduction cost or of giving any weight to that element of 'fair value'. The Commission may now adopt, if it chooses, prudent investment as a rate base-the base long advocated by Mr. Justice Brandeis. And for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Brandeis in the Southwestern Bell Telephone case there could be no constitutional objection if the Commission adhered to that formula and rejected all others.\n Yet it is important to note, as we have indicated, that Congress has merely provided in  5 of the Natural Gas Act that the rates fixed by the Commission shall be 'just and reasonable'. It has provided no standard beyond that. Congress, to be sure, has provided for judicial review. But  19(b) states that the 'finding of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.' In view of these provisions we do not think it is permissible for the courts to concern themselves with any issues as to the economic merits of a rate base. The Commission has a broad area of discretion for selection of an appropriate rate base. The requirements of 'just and reasonable' embrace among other factors two phases of the public interest: (1) the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 607]\n\u00a0\n investor interest; (2) the consumer interest. The investor interest is adequately served if the utility is allowed the opportunity to earn the cost of the service. That cost has been defined by Mr. Justice Brandeis as follows: 'Cost includes, not only operating expenses, but also capital charges. Capital charges cover the allowance, by way of interest, for the use of the capital, whatever the nature of the security issued therefor, the allowance for risk incurred, and enough more to attract capital.' State of Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission, supra, 262 U.S. page 291, 43 S.Ct. page 547, 31 A.L.R. 807. Irrespective of what the return may be on 'fair value', if the rate permits the company to operate successfully and to attract capital all questions as to 'just and reasonable' are at an end so far as the investor interest is concerned. Various routes to that end may be worked out by the expert administrators charged with the duty of regulation. It is not the function of the courts to prescribe what formula should be used. The fact that one may be fair to investors does not mean that another would be unfair. The decision in each case must turn on considerations of justness and fairness which cannot be cast into a legalistic formula. The rate of return to be allowed in any given case calls for a highly expert judgment. That judgment has been entrusted to the Commission. There it should rest.\n One caveat however should be entered. The consumer interest cannot be disregarded in determining what is a 'just and reasonable' rate. Conceivably a return to the company of the cost of the service might not be 'just and reasonable' to the public. The correct principle was announced by this Court in Covington & Lexington Turnpike Co. v. Sandford, \n164 \nU.S. 578, 596\n, 17 S.Ct. 198, 205:\n'It cannot be said that a corporation ... is entitled as of right, and without reference to the interests of the pub- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 608]\n\u00a0\n lic, to realize a given per cent. upon its capital stock. When the question arises whether the legislature has exceeded its constitutional power in prescribing rates to be charged by a corporation controlling a public highway, stockholders are not the only persons whose rights or interests are to be considered. The rights of the public are not to be ignored. It is alleged here that the rates prescribed are unreasonable and unjust to the company and its stockholders. But that involves an inquiry as to what is reasonable and just for the public. If the establishing of new lines of transportation should cause a diminution in the number of those who need to use a turnpike road, and, consequently, a diminution in the tolls collected, that is not, in itself, a sufficient reason why the corporation operating the road should be allowed to maintain rates that would be unjust to those who must or do use its property. The public cannot property be subjected to unreasonable rates in order simply that stockholders may earn dividends.' Cf. Chicago & Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Wellman, \n143 \nU.S. 339, 345\n, 346 S., 12 S.Ct. 400, 402; United Gas Co. v. Texas, \n303 \nU.S. 123, 150\n, 151 S., 625, 58 S.Ct. 483, 496.\n\n This problem carries into a field not necessary to develop here. It reemphasizes however that the investor interest is not the sole interest for protection. The investor and consumer interests may so collide as to warrant the rate-making body in concluding that a return on historical cost or prudent investment though fair to investors would be grossly unfair to the consumers. The possibility of that collision reinforces the view that the problem of rate-making is for the administrative experts not the courts and that the ex post facto function previously performed by the courts should be reduced to the barest minimum which is consistent with the statutory mandate for judicial review. That review should be as confined and restricted as the review, under similar statutes, of orders of other administrative agencies. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 609]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, concurring.\n I wholly agree with the opinion of the CHIEF JUSTICE.\n Congress has in the Natural Gas Act specifically cast upon courts the duty to review orders of the Federal Power Commission fixing 'just and reasonable' rates. The constitutional scope of judicial review of rate orders where Congress has denied judicial review is therefore not in issue in this case. Discussion of the problem is academic, especially since we all concur in the CHIEF JUSTICE'S conclusions on the rate order here made by the Commission. But since the issue has been stirred, I add a few words because legal history still has its claims.\n While the doctrine of 'confiscation', as a limitation to be enforced by the judiciary upon the legislative power to fix utility rates, was first applied in Chicago, etc., Railway Co. v. Minnesota, \n134 \nU.S. 418\n, 10 S.Ct. 462, 702, that decision followed principles expounded in Stone v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n116 \nU.S. 307\n, especially at page 331, 6 S.Ct. 334, 344, 388, 1191. See 134 U.S. at pages 455, 456, 10 S.Ct. at page 466. Mr. Chief Justice Waite, who delivered the opinion in the Stone case as well as in the earlier decision in Munn v. Illinois, \n94 \nU.S. 113\n, was therefore the author of the doctrine of 'confiscation' and its corollary, 'judicial review'. His view was shared by such stout respecters of legislative power over utilities as Mr. Justice Miller (see Fairman, Mr. Justice Miller and the Supreme Court, passim), Mr. Justice Bradley (see his dissent in Chicago, etc., Railway Co. v. Minnesota, \n134 \nU.S. 418, 461\n, 10 S.Ct. 462, 702, 703), and Mr. Justice Harlan. The latter, indeed, agreed with Mr. Justice Field that the regulatory power exercised in the Railroad Commission Cases (Stone v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.) \n116 \nU.S. 307\n, 6 S.Ct. 334, 388, 1191, constituted an impairment of the obligation of contract. By no one was the doctrine of judicial review more emphatically accepted, and applied in favor of a public utility, than by Mr. Justice Harlan in the decision and opinion in Covington, etc., Turnpike Co. v. Sandford, \n164 \nU.S. 578\n, especially at pages 591-595, 17 S. Ct. 198, 203, 204. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 575, 610]\n\u00a0\n But while this historic controversy over the constitutional limitations upon the power of courts in rate cases is not presented here, if it be deemed that courts have nothing to do with rate-making because that task was committed exclusively to the Commission, surely it is a usurpation of the Commission's function to tell it how it should discharge this task and how it should protect the various interests that are deemed to be in its and not in our keeping. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] These charges against income are slightly in excess of the accumulated reserves for depreciation and depletion-$12,557,892-shown by the books at the end of 1938. The excess of $519,596 is apparently due to the fact that during the period $7,000,918 of property, on the basis of book cost, was retired, while the annual retirement charges had aggregated only $6,481,322. The balance of the retirements, $519,596, apparently had been charged to the depreciation and depletion accounts. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] This includes a negligible item, 'non-operating income', which for the seven-year period came to only $194,600. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] The book figures (which are on a cost basis) for invested capital average slightly under $61,000,000 if working capital is included. The depreciation and depletion reserves are taken from the accounts for which the aggregate figure, $12,557,892, is given in note 1, supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The estimates submitted by the companies stated that there should be deducted from this figure for \"viewed depreciation\" $2,866,758. However, in setting a rate base for the interim order, the Commission did not make this conceded deduction- perhaps because it held, contrary to the companies' contention, that the properties should be amortized over the entire life of the business.\n5 The companies estimated that the cost of additional property, not including property, not including \n replacements, during the future life of the enterprise, subsequent to June 1, 1939, would be $9,145.083. On this basis, they claimed that there should be included in the rate base $6,046,286, which they said would be the estimated average investment. The Commission included in the rate base only $3,808,399 which was the companies' estimated outlay for capital additions through the end of 1942. This reduction does not appear to be challenged. In any event, the refusal to include in the rate base capital expenditures not yet made can not involve confiscation. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The item for depreciation on non-productive capacity amounting to $ 382,833 is obviously provided for in the Commission's allowance for depreciation. The value of the companies' entire plant, whether fully productive or not, is included in the rate base and, as will presently appear, provision was made by the Commission's order for its amortization on a cost basis from earnings. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Besides $8,244,435 of 'net profits', the companies paid out of gross income $23,994,030 as interest on the bonds. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] We do not intimate any approval of the inclusion in the amortization base of all the estimated future capital additions. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] The companies' proposed amortization base was made up of the following items:\n Reproduction cost new, excluding gas reserves $56,302,250 Viewed depreciation (deduct) 2,866,758 Value of gas reserves 13,334,775 Cost of additional property 9,145,083 Going concern value 8,500,000 Working capital 975,000 ___\n $85,390,350 Less salvage 1,049,132 ___\n $84,341,218\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Some of these cases arose under the Fifth, some under the Fourteenth Amendment.

Florida, supra, confers a broad judicial power to invalidate all legislation which seems 'unreasonable' to courts. In the one instance, courts proceeding within clearly marked constitutional boundaries seek to execute policies written into the Constitution; in the other they roam at will in the limitless area of their own beliefs as to reasonableness and actually select policies, a responsibility which the Constitution entrusts to the legislative representatives of the people. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] McCart v.

The refusal of the court to enforce the Commission's order rested in part upon an interpreta- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 149, 150]\n\u00a0\n tion of this Court's decision in a prior controversy between the same parties. Federal Trade Comm. v. Raladam Co., \n283 \nU.S. 643\n, 51 S.Ct. 587, 79 A.L.R. 1191. Because of the importance of questions raised, we granted certiorari. \n315 \nU.S. 790\n, 62 S.Ct. 631, 86 L.Ed. --.\n Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 38 Stat. 719, 15 U.S.C .  45, 15 U.S.C.A.  45, declares unfair methods of competition in commerce to be unlawful; empowers the Commission to prevent such methods; and authorizes the Commission after hearings and findings of fact to issue orders requiring violators 'to cease and desist from using such method of competition.' In 1929, the Commission, after hearings, found that the Raladam Company had used unfair methods of competition in selling a preparation called Marmola by making misleading and deceptive statements concerning its qualities as a remedy for overweight. The Commission issued a cease and desist order which the Circuit Court of Appeals vacated. 6 Cir ., 42 F.2d 430. This Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' judgment saying that there was 'neither finding nor evidence from which the conclusion legitimately can be drawn that these advertisements substantially injured, or tended ... to injure, the business of any competitor or of competitors generally, whether legitimate or not. ... It is impossible to say whether, as a result of respondent's advertisements, any business was diverted, or was likely to be diverted, from others engaged in like trade, or whether competitors, identified or unidentified, were injured in their business, or were likely to be injured, or, indeed, whether any other anti-obesity remedies were sold or offered for sale in competition, or were of such a character as naturally to come into any real competition, with respondent's preparation in the interstate market.' Federal Trade Comm. v. Raladam Co., supra, 283 U.S. pages 652, 653, 51 S.Ct. pages 591, 592, 79 A.L.R. 1191. It is clear that the reasons for refusing to enforce the Commission's order are grounded upon the inadequacy of the findings and proof as revealed in the particular record \n\n[316 \nU.S. 149, 151]\n\u00a0\n then before this Court. Hence, these reasons are not controlling in this case, arising as it does out of different proceedings and presenting different facts and a different record for our consideration.\n In 1935, the Commission instituted the present proceedings against Raladam, charging unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Hearings were held and much evidence was heard concerning Raladam's trade methods since the date of the earlier cease and desist order. This time the Commission found with meticulous particularity that Raladam had made many misleading and deceptive statements to further sales of Marmola; that Marmola had many active rivals for the trade of those who were interested in fat-reducing remedies; that Raladam's misleading statements had the 'tendency and capacity' to induce people 'to purchase and use respondent's ... preparation or medicine for reducing purposes ... in preference to and to the exclusion of the products of competitors, ... and to divert trade to respondent from such competitors engaged in the sale in interstate commerce of medicines, preparations, systems, methods, books of instruction, and other articles and means designed, intended and used for the purpose of reducing weight.'\n These findings were an adequate basis for the Commission's order. The court below, however, was of the opinion that there was no substantial evidence to support the finding that the alleged unfair methods 'substantially injured or tended to injure the business of any competitor.' The evidence shows that sales of Marmola to the consuming public are made at retail drug stores throughout the country; that Raladam distributes Marmola both to wholesalers and retailers; that the wholesalers and retailers who sell Marmola also sell numerous other remedies for taking off fat; that the essential fat-reducing element in Marmola is desiccated thyroid, which is also an \n\n[316 \nU.S. 149, 152]\n\u00a0\n element in some of the other remedies sold to the public with or without doctors' prescriptions; that many books of instruction on methods of reducing weight are sold in interstate commerce; and that the gross sales of Marmola were from $350,000 to $400,000 a year. From this and other evidence the Commission concluded that numerous antifat remedies were offered for sale in the same market as Marmola, and that Marmola was in active competition with them for the favor of the remedy purchasing public.\n It is not necessary that the evidence show specifically that losses to any particular trader or traders arise from Raladam's success in capturing part of the market. One of the objects of the Act creating the Federal Trade Commission was to prevent potential injury by stopping unfair methods of competition in their incipiency. Fashion Guild v. Federal Trade Comm., \n213 \nU.S. 457, 466\n, 668 S., 61 S.Ct. 703, 707. And when the Commission finds as it did here that misleading and deceptive statements were made with reference to the quality of merchandise in active competition with other merchandise it is also authorized to infer that trade will be diverted from competitors who do not engage in such 'unfair methods.' Federal Trade Comm. v. Winsted Co., \n258 \nU.S. 483, 493\n, 42 S.Ct. 384, 385. The findings of the Commission in this case should have been sustained against the attack made upon them.\n Raladam contends here as it did before the Commission and the Circuit Court of Appeals that the judgment of this Court in the first case makes the issues here in controversy res judicata, and therefore bars these proceedings. It also contends that the denial by this Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals in the earlier proceedings of the Commission's motion to offer additional evidence with respect to competitors and injury to competition should have a like effect. We think there contentions are without merit, and therefore agree with the court below in \n\n[316 \nU.S. 149, 153]\n\u00a0\n its determination that a decision on the merits was appropriate.\n The respondent has not sought in this Court to sustain the judgment of the court below on any other ground. Accordingly, the judgment is reversed with directions that the order of the Federal Trade Commission be affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed with directions. \n\n\n\n","38":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFISCHER v.

Bradford, \n297 \nU.S. 613\n, 56 S.Ct. 600, which were disregarded by the court below, would probably lead to a different result. \n314 \nU.S. 589\n, 62 S.Ct. 60, 86 L.Ed. --.\n The Iowa receiver brought the suit pursuant to the authority and direction of the Iowa court. It is based upon diversity of citizenship, Judicial Code,  24, 28 U.S.C.  41, 28 U.S.C.A.  41, and seeks to enforce against nonresident defendants, as authorized by  57 of the Judicial Code, \n\n[314 \nU.S. 549, 552]\n\u00a0\n 28 U.S.C.  118, 28 U.S.C.A.  118, a 'legal or equitable lien upon or claim to' personal property within the district where the suit is brought and to remove an 'incumbrance or lien or cloud upon the title' to such property. The bill in substance alleged and the District Court found that the Iowa receiver was in possession of securities of a face amount in excess of $3,000,000; that those securities had been deposited with the Insurance Commissioner of Iowa, pursuant to statutes of Iowa and certain reinsurance agreements between American Life Insurance Co. and its Iowa predecessor, for protection of the policy holders of the latter company on its insolvency; that Iowa had title to those funds and the Iowa receiver had the sole and exclusive right to administer them. The District Court held that although the action was in rem it had not only jurisdiction over the subject matter but also over the defendants since they all answered and since two of them filed counterclaims asking that the securities in possession of the Iowa receiver be delivered to them and since the other asked for general equitable relief. Accordingly, it ordered, inter alia, that the Michigan and Texas receivers account for certain collections2 which they had made on the securities in the Iowa fund; that they deliver to the Iowa receiver certain records pertaining to those securities; that the Michigan receiver deliver to the Iowa receiver certain records pertaining to the policies protected by that fund; and that the Michigan and Texas receivers be enjoined from making collections on those securities and from interfering in any way with the Iowa receiver's administration of them. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 549, 553]\n\u00a0\n We express no opinion on the merits of the controversy. Nor do we pass on the contention that Ladew v. Tennessee Copper Co., \n218 \nU.S. 357\n, 31 S.Ct. 81, prevents the entry of an in personam judgment in the circumstances of this case. For the sole question passed upon by the court below was the power and propriety of the action of the District Court in taking jurisdiction of the cause under  57 of the Judicial Code.\n It is immaterial to this inquiry whether the Michigan receiver acquired no interest in or power over assets outside of Michigan (Booth v. Clark, 17 How. 322), or, as held by the court below, was the statutory successor under Michigan law of American Life Insurance Co. and as such had title to all of its assets wherever situated. Relfe v. Rundle, \n103 \nU.S. 222\n, 225; Clark v. Williard, \n292 \nU.S. 112, 120\n, 54 S.Ct. 615, 618. Cf. Converse v. Hamilton, \n224 \nU.S. 243\n, 32 S.Ct. 415, Ann.Cas.1913D, 1292. Even though the latter were true, claimants entitled to the benefits of the fund in Iowa might pursue their suits and remedies against it in derogation of the claim of the Michigan receiver, if that were Iowa's policy. Clark v. Williard, \n294 \nU.S. 211\n, 55 S.Ct. 356, 98 A.L.R. 347. That is the asserted Iowa policy here. The Iowa receiver is in possession of the securities in question. He seeks, with the approval of the Iowa court, an authoritative determination by the federal court of the question whether under Iowa law those securities and the collections thereon should not be held for the special class of claimants for whom the fund was allegedly established. The federal court has the power to resolve the controversy. And there is no consideration of judicial administration based on appropriate deference to the state courts why it should not exercise it.\n Lion Bonding & Surety Co. v. Karatz, supra, does not stand in the way. There the federal court through its receivers assumed command over property which was in the possession of the state court. That action was taken in violation of the well-settled principle (262 U.S. at pages 88, 89, 43 S.Ct. at page 484) that \n\n[314 \nU.S. 549, 554]\n\u00a0\n 'Where a court of competent jurisdiction has, by appropriate proceedings, taken property into its possession through its officers, the property is thereby withdrawn from the jurisdiction of all other courts.' Such possession of the res by the state court disenabled the federal court from exercising any control over it. But a determination of the issues in this controversy does not necessarily involve a disturbance of the possession or control of the Michigan and Texas courts over the property in their possession. It would indeed have no such necessary consequence even though the securities in question were in their possession. As held in United States v. Klein, supra, 303 U.S. at page 281, 58 S.Ct. at page 538, a state court may properly adjudicate rights in property in possession of a federal court3 and render any judgment 'not in conflict with that court's authority to decide questions within its jurisdiction and to make effective such decisions by its control of the property.' And see Riehle v. Margolies, \n279 \nU.S. 218\n, 224-226, 49 S.Ct. 310, 312, 313. The same procedure may be followed by a federal court with respect to property in the possession of a state court. General Banking Co. v. Harr, \n300 \nU.S. 433\n, 57 S.Ct. 540; Commonwealth Trust Co. v. Bradford, supra; Waterman v. Canal-Louisiana Bank & Trust Co., \n215 \nU.S. 33\n, 30 S.Ct. 10; Ingersoll v. Coram, \n211 \nU.S. 335\n, 29 S.Ct. 92; Byers v. McAuley, \n149 \nU.S. 608, 620\n, 13 S.Ct. 906, 910. The appropriate exercise of the discretion of a federal court of equity may require it to refuse even to adjudicate rights in specific property if the state court has already undertaken such a determination. Kelleam v. Maryland Casualty Co., \n312 \nU.S. 377, 382\n, 61 S. Ct. 595, 598. Furthermore, the federal court may not 'seize and control the property which is in the possession of the state court' nor interfere with the state court or its functions. Waterman v. Canal- Louisiana Bank & Trust Co., supra, 215 U.S. at pages 44, 45, 30 S.Ct. at pages 12, 13; Princess Lida v. Thompson, \n305 \nU.S. 456\n, 59 S. Ct. 275. Short of that, how- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 549, 555]\n\u00a0\n ever, the federal court may go. Cf. Oakes v. Lake, \n290 \nU.S. 59\n, 54 S.Ct. 13.\n Tested by those standards, assumption of jurisdiction by the federal court was wholly proper. A determination by it of the rights of the parties in the res could be had 'with proper regard for the rightful independence of state governments in carrying out their domestic policy' ( Pennsylvania v. Williams, \n294 \nU.S. 176, 185\n, 55 S.Ct. 380, 385, 96 A.L.R. 1166) and in full recognition of the necessity for 'harmonious cooperation of federal and state tribunals.' Princess Lida v. Thompson, supra, 305 U.S. at page 466, 59 S.Ct. at page 281. We repeat that neither Michigan nor Texas is entitled to the securities if such a disposition of them would contravene Iowa law. A determination of the nature and the extent of the rights of Iowa and its receiver in the securities clearly would not constitute an interference with the jurisdiction of the Michigan and Texas courts. For even if those courts were in possession of the fund, their jurisdiction would not be so exclusive as to bar an adjudication by the federal court of the rights of a claimant to the res or the quantum of his interest in it. United States v. Klein, supra. It follows a fortiori that where as here they are not in possession of the res, such a decree of the federal court is proper. Though binding on the parties, both as respects their rights to the fund and the collections thereon, it is not disruptive of orderly administration by the state courts nor conducive to unseemly collisions between the state and federal authorities. For unlike the situation in Kelleam v. Maryland Casualty Co., supra, the state court which has command over the res has not only not undertaken an adjudication of the controversy; it has referred the matter to the federal court.\n Whether the scope of the decree entered by the District Court was proper we do not decide. We only hold that the District Court had jurisdiction to resolve the controversy under  57 of the Judicial Code. The Circuit Court of Appeals should have decided what rights under Iowa \n\n[314 \nU.S. 549, 556]\n\u00a0\n law Iowa and its receiver had to the securities and the collections thereon and whether the decree entered by the District Court was kept within the appropriate limits. Since the Circuit Court of Appeals did not decide those questions, we reverse its judgment and remand the cause to it for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS did not participate in the decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Iowa receiver also sought relief against respondent American United Life Insurance Co. which, after institution of the receivership proceedings and the appointment of receivers for American Life Insurance Co., entered into a written agreement for the reinsurance of the business of American Life Insurance Co. and issued a certificate of assumption for all insurance policies outstanding of American Life Insurance Co. We mention the fact without more, because the presence of that respondent is not material to the jurisdictional aspects of the case with which we are here solely concerned. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Michigan receiver had been collecting in Michigan and the Texas receiver in Texas principal and income on the securities deposited in Iowa from obligors residing in their respective states. Certain remittances have been made by the Michigan receiver to the Iowa receiver pursuant to an agreement between them.

Bartow Strang, of Chattanooga, Tenn., and George P. Barse, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Joe Frassrand, of Chattanooga, Tenn., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In Rawlings v. Ray, \n312 \nU.S. 96\n, 61 S.Ct. 473, we decided that state statutes of limitations govern the time within which to enforce the liability imposed upon stockholders of insolvent national banks by assessments levied by the Comptroller of the Currency; that the question as to the time when a complete and present cause of action arises in the receiver to enforce that liability by suit is a federal question; that nothing in the applicable statutes, 12 U.S.C.  63, 64, 191, 192, 12 U.S.C.A.  63, 64, 191, 192, prevents the Comptroller in making an assessment from fixing a later date for payment; and, that suit cannot be instituted prior to the date fixed for payment and a state statute of limitations does not begin to run until that date. In this case the Comptroller extended the time for payment beyond the date originally set and we must decide whether time runs from the first or the final date fixed for payment.\n Petitioner is the successor to the original receiver for the insolvent First National Bank of Chattanooga. On April 19, 1934, the Comptroller of the Currency levied an assessment against the Bank's stockholders for 100% of the par value of their shares, payable on May 26, 1934.1 By successive orders entered on May 17, 1934, June 19, 1934, June 22, 1934, and March 11, 1935, the original maturity date of May 26, 1934, was extended to make the assess- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 217, 219]\n\u00a0\n ment payable on April 15, 1935. Notice of the assessment was given to all stockholders on March 13, 1935\n\n\n Respondent, as successor to the original executrix, represents the estate of C. C. Nottingham which held stock of the Bank to the extent of $ 138,000 par value at the time of the assessment. No steps were taken to enforce against the estate the liability imposed by the assessment until August 2, 1935, when petitioner's predecessor filed an answer and a cross- bill in an action commenced on July 24, 1935, in the Chancery Court for Hamilton County, Tennessee, by the original executrix to require all creditors to appear and establish their claims.\n The Chancery Court held that petitioner's assessment claim accrued on the date first fixed for payment, May 23, 1934,2 and that the claim was barred by  8225 of the Tennessee Code3 fixing a period of 'six months from the date the cause of action thereon accrued' within which to enforce previously unmatured claims against decedents. The Court of Appeals affirmed, relying upon  8604 of the Code4 as well as  8225. Nottingham v. Kent, 155 S.W.2d 882. The Supreme Court of the State denied a petition for writ of certiorari. The importance of the question in the administration of insolvent national banks5 and a conflict with the decision in Strasburger v. Schram, 68 App.D.C. 87, 93 F.2d 246, caused us to grant certiorari. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 217, 220]\n\u00a0\n Our starting point, of course, is Rawlings v. Ray, supra. That case adequately disposes of respondent's contention that no federal question is presented by this case; whether petitioner's cause of action was complete on May 26, 1934, or April 15, 1935, is a federal question, 312 U.S. at page 98, 61 S.Ct. at page 474, which was duly raised and preserved by appropriate exceptions and assignments of error. And, even as we found nothing in the applicable statutes to question 'the authority of the Comptroller in making an assessment to fix a later date for its payment', 312 U.S. at page 99, 61 S.Ct. at page 474, we see nothing in the pertinent legislation, 12 U.S.C.  63, 64, 66, 191, 192, 12 U.S.C.A.  63, 64, 66, 191, 192, forbidding the Comptroller to extend the date fixed for payment within reasonable limits from time to time. Such extensions seem to be in accord with a long established practice designed to achieve the desirable result of avoiding excessive and unnecessary assessments. \n6\n See Strasburger v. Schram, 68 App.D.C. 87, 93 F. 2d 246, 248. Compare Korbly v. Springfield Inst. for Savings, \n245 \nU.S. 330\n, 38 S.Ct. 88, where, in upholding the power of the Comptroller to withdraw one assessment and levy a later one, we emphasized the desirability of a large measure of administrative discretion and flexibility in the adjustment of assessments to the 'exigencies of each case.' 245 U.S., at page 333, 38 S.Ct. at page 90.\n Since the Comptroller has power to extend the time for payment, respondent was not required to pay until April 15, 1935, and prior to that time suit could not be instituted against her. Rawlings v. Ray, supra, 312 U.S. at page 98, 61 S.Ct. at page 474. While the receiver enforces the liability created by the assessment, 12 U.S.C.  191, 192, 12 U.S.C.A.  191, 192, he does so subject to the direction of the Comptroller, Kennedy v. Gibson, 8 Wall. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 217, 221]\n\u00a0\n 498, 505. So petitioner did not have a complete and present cause of action until April 15, 1935. Since the words 'from the date the cause of action thereon accrued' as used in  8225 of the Tennessee Code seem to have their usual meaning and refer to the time when suit may be instituted,7 it follows that petitioner's claim, filed on August 2, 1935, was in time.\n Respondent stresses  8604 of the Code. \n8\n But, as pointed out above, petitioner had no right to demand payment before April 15, 1935, so even if  8604 applies, it does not bar petitioner's claim.\n Respondent mistakenly relies upon Pufahl v. Parks' Estate, \n299 \nU.S. 217\n, 57 S.Ct. 151, which has no application because in that case 'we were not considering or deciding the question of the application of a statute of limitations to a suit against a stockholder upon an assessment made by the Comptroller where payment was not required before a specified date, prior to which no suit could be maintained.' Rawlings v. Ray, supra, 312 U.S. at page 99, 61 S.Ct. at page 474.\n We are not unmindful that it is desirable to close decedents' estates speedily but there is no warrant in the federal legislation for allowing that consideration to limit the power of the Comptroller to extend the time for payment of an assessment.\n The judgment below is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This is the date given in the pleadings. However, the opinions of the courts below refer to May 23, 1934, as the first date fixed for payment. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Note 1, supra. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Michie's Tennessee Code of 1938, Annotated. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] ' 8604. Time runs from accrual of right, not demand.-When a right exists, but a demand is necessary to entitle the party to an action, the limitation commences from the time the plaintiff's right to make the demand was completed, and not from the date of the demand.' \n[\nFootnote 5\n] The double liability feature of national bank stock has been eliminated where there has been compliance with the provisions of the statute, but this does not apply to banks in difficulty prior to July 1, 1937, except as to stock issued after June 16, 1933. 12 U.S.C.  64a, 12 U. S.C.A.  64a. 64a. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The record does not disclose the reason for the extensions of time here, but it appears that they were made at the request of a stockholders' committee which protested the necessity of a 100% assessment and asked for a reappraisal of the Bank's assets.

MOORE-MCCORMACK CO.(1942)\nNo. 67\nArgued: November 16, 1942Decided: December 14, 1942\n\n\n\n\n[317 \nU.S. 239, 240]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Abraham E. Freedman, of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioner.\n Mr. Rowland C. Evans, Jr., of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner was injured while working as a seaman for respondent on a vessel traveling between the United States and European ports and spent a number of months in hospitals in Gdynia, Poland, and in the United States. He brought this suit in a Pennsylvania State Court for damages pursuant to Section 33 of the Merchant Marine (Jones) Act,1 and for maintenance and cure. \n2\n The Pennsylvania courts, as this litigation evidences, are apparently quite willing to make themselves available for the enforcement of these rights.\n Petitioner attributed his condition to a blow by a hatch cover which allegedly fell on him through respondent's \n\n[317 \nU.S. 239, 241]\n\u00a0\n negligence. Respondent joined issue generally, contested the extent of any injuries received and further contended that if serious injuries did exist they were caused by a fight in Copenhagen or by accidents prior to the voyage. As an additional defense the respondent also alleged that for a consideration of $100 petitioner had executed a full release. Denying that he had any knowledge of having signed such an instrument the petitioner asserted that if his name appeared on it, his signature was obtained through fraud and misrepresentation, and without 'legal, binding and valid consideration.'\n The petitioner did execute a release for $100 several days after his return to this country. His testimony was that his discussion with respondent's claim agent took place while he was under the influence of drugs taken to allay the pain of his injury, that he was threatened with imprisonment if he did not sign as directed, and that he considered the $ 100 a payment of wages. \n3\n The respondent's evidence was that the $100 was paid not for wages but to settle all claims growing out of the petitioner's injuries, that the petitioner had not appeared to be under the influence of drugs, and that no threats of any kind were made.\n Upon this and much other evidence relating to the cause and extent of the injuries, the jury rendered a verdict for the petitioner for $3000 under the Jones Act, and $1000 for maintenance and cure.\n Respondent made a motion for a new trial and judgment non obstante veredicto which under the Pennsylvania \n\n[317 \nU.S. 239, 242]\n\u00a0\n practice was submitted to the trial court enbanc. 4 That court gave judgment to the defendant non obstante veredicto, not upon an appraisal of disputed questions of fact concerning the accident, but because of a conclusion that petitioner had failed to sustain the burden of proof required under Pennsylvania law to invalidate the release. It conceded that 'in Admiralty cases, the responsibility is on the defendant to sustain a release rather than on a plaintiff to overcome it', but concluded that since petitioner had chosen to bring his action in a state rather than in an admiralty court, his case must be governed by local, rather than admiralty principles. Under the Pennsylvania rule one who attacks the validity of a written release has the burden of sustaining his allegation by 'clear, precise, and indubitable' evidence; meaning evidence 'that is not only found to be credible but of such weight and directness as to make out the facts alleged beyond a reasonable doubt.' Witnesses who testify against the release must not only be credible, but 'distinctly remember the facts to which they testify and narrate the details exactly.' The court held that since the petitioner had not sustained this burden of proof, the trial judge should have withdrawn the case from the jury.\n The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania took a somewhat different view. It held that in an action of this sort the Pennsylvania court was obligated 'to apply the federal law creating the right of action in the same sense in which it would have been applied in the federal courts.' (344 Pa. 69, 23 A.2d 503, 506.) However, it affirmed the judgment in the belief that the rule as to burden of proof on releases does not affect the substantive rights of the parties, but is merely procedural, and is therefore controlled by state law. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 239, 243]\n\u00a0\n I. Respondent's argument that the Pennsylvania court should have applied state rather than admiralty law in measuring the rights of parties cannot be sustained.\n We do not have in this case an effort of the state court to enforce rights claimed to be rooted in state law. The petitioner's suit rested on asserted rights granted by federal law and the state courts so treated it. Jurisdiction of the state court to try this case rests solely upon Sec. 33 of the Jones Act and upon statutes traceable to the Judiciary Act of 1789 which in 'all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction' saves to suitors 'the right of a common-law remedy where the common law is competent to give it.' \n5\n These statutes authorize Pennsylvania courts to try cases coming within the defined category. \n6\n Whether Pennsylvania was required by the acts to make its courts available for those federal remedies, or whether it could create its own remedy as to maintenance and cure based on local law, we need not decide;7 for having voluntarily opened its courts to petitioner, the questions are whether Pennsylvania was thereupon required to give to petitioner the full benefit of federal law and if so whether it failed to afford that benefit.\n There is no dearth of example of the obligation on law courts which attempt to enforce substantive rights arising from admiralty law to do so in a manner conforming to admiralty practice. Contributory negligence is not a barrier to a proceeding in admiralty or under the Jones Act, and the state courts are required to apply this rule in Jones \n\n[317 \nU.S. 239, 244]\n\u00a0\n Act actions. Beadle v. Spencer, \n298 \nU.S. 124\n, 56 S.Ct. 712. Similarly state courts may not apply their doctrines of assumption of risk in actions arising under the Act. The Arizona, \n298 \nU.S. 110\n, 56 S.Ct. 707; Socony-Vacuum Co. v. Smith, \n305 \nU.S. 424\n, 59 S.Ct. 262. State courts, whether or not applying the Jones Act to actions arising from maritime torts, have usually attempted, although not always with complete success, to apply admiralty principles. \n8\n The federal courts when treating maritime torts in actions at law rather than as suits in admiralty have also sought to preserve admiralty principles whenever consonant with the necessities of common law procedure. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n This Court has specifically held that the Jones Act is to have a uniform application throughout the country unaffected by 'local views of common law rules.' Panama R. Co. v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375, 392\n, 44 S.Ct. 391, 396. The Act is based upon and incorporates by reference the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U.S.C.A.  51 et seq., which also requires uniform interpretation. Second Employers Liability Cases (Mondou v. New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad Co.), \n223 \nU.S. 1\n, 55 et seq., 32 S.Ct. 169, 177, 38 L.R.A.,N.S., 44. This uniformity requirement extends to the type of proof necessary for judgment. New Orleans & N.E.R. Co. v. Harris, \n247 \nU.S. 367\n, 38 S.Ct. 535\n\n\n In many other cases this Court has declared the necessary dominance of admiralty principles in actions in vindication of rights arising from admiralty law. \n10\n Belden v. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 239, 245]\n\u00a0\n Chase, \n150 \nU.S. 674\n, 14 S.Ct. 264, an 1893 decision which respondent relies upon as establishing a contrary rule, has never been thus considered in any of the later cases cited.\n It must be remembered that the state courts have concurrent jurisdiction with the federal courts to try actions either under the Merchant Marine Act or in personam such as maintenance and cure. The source of the governing law applied is in the national, not the state, governments. \n11\n If by its practice the state court were permitted substantially to alter the rights of either litigant, as those rights were established in federal law, the remedy afforded by the state would not enforce, but would actually deny, federal rights which Congress, by providing alternative remedies, intended to make not less, but more secure. The constant objective of legislation and jurisprudence is to assure litigants full protection for all substantive rights intended to be afforded them by the jurisdiction in which the right itself originates. Not so long ago we sought to achieve this result with respect to enforcement in the federal courts of rights created or governed by state law. \n12\n And admiralty courts, when invoked to protect rights rooted in state law, endeavor to determine the issues in accordance with the substantive law of the State. \n13\n So here, in trying this case the state court was bound to proceed in such manner that all the substantial rights of the parties under controlling federal law would be protected. Whether it did so, raises a federal question reviewable \n\n[317 \nU.S. 239, 246]\n\u00a0\n here under  237(b) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  344(b), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(b).14\n II. A seaman in admiralty who attacks a release has no such burden imposed upon him as that to which the Pennsylvania rule subjects him. Our historic national policy, both legislative and judicial, points the other way. Congress has generally sought to safeguard seamen's rights. The first Congress, on July 20, 1790, passed a protective act for seamen in the merchant marine service, safeguarding wage contracts, providing summary remedies for their breach, and requiring shipowners to keep on board fresh medicines in condition for use. 1 Stat. 131. The fifth Congress, July 16, 1798, 1 Stat. 605, originated our present system of marine hospitals for disabled seamen. The language of Justice Story, sitting on Circuit in 1823, described the solicitude with which admiralty has traditionally viewed seamen's contracts:\n'They are emphatically the wards of the admiralty; and though not technically incapable of entering into a valid contract, they are treated in the same manner, as courts of equity are accustomed to treat young heirs, dealing with their expectancies, wards with their guardians, and cestuis que trust with their trustees. ... If there is any undue inequality in the terms, any disproportion in the bargain, any sacrifice of rights on one side, which are not compensated by extraordinary benefits on the other, the judicial interpretation of the transaction, is that the bargain is unjust and unreasonable, that advantage has been taken of the situation of the weaker party, and that protanto the bargain ought to be set aside as inequitable. ... And on every occasion the court expects to be satisfied, that the compensation for every material alteration is entirely adequate to the diminution \n\n[317 \nU.S. 239, 247]\n\u00a0\n of right or privilege on the part of the seamen.' Harden v. Gordon, 11 Fed. Cas. at pages 480, 485, No.6,047.\n\n In keeping with this policy, Congress has itself acted concerning seamen's releases in respect to wages by providing that a release for wages must be signed by a seaman in the presence of a shipping commissioner, and that even then 'any court having jurisdiction may upon good cause shown set aside such release and take such action as justice shall require.' \n15\n General Congressional policy is further shown in the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.  915, 916, 33 U.S.C.A.  915, 916, in which all releases not made under the express terms of the Act are declared invalid.\n The analogy suggested by Justice Story in the paragraph quoted above between seamen's contracts and those of fiduciaries and beneficiaries remains, under the prevailing rule treating seamen as wards of admiralty, a close one. Whether the transaction under consideration is a contract, sale, or gift between guardian and ward or between trustee and cestui, the burden of proving its validity is on the fiduciary. He must affirmatively show that no advantage has been taken; and his burden is particularly heavy where there has been inadequacy of consideration. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n The wardship theory has, as was recognized by the courts below, marked consequence on the treatment \n\n[317 \nU.S. 239, 248]\n\u00a0\n given seamen's releases. Such releases are subject to careful scrutiny. 'One who claims that a seaman has signed away his rights to what in law is due him must be prepared to take the burden of sustaining the release as fairly made with and fully comprehended by the seaman.' Harmon v. United States, 5 Cir., 59 F.2d 372, 373. We hold, therefore, that the burden is upon one who sets up a seaman's release to show that it was executed freely, without deception or coercion, and that it was made by the seaman with full understanding of his rights. The adequacy of the consideration and the nature of the medical and legal advice available to the seaman at the time of signing the release are relevant to an appraisal of this understanding. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n This general admiralty rule applies not only to actions for maintenance and cure but also to actions under Section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act. That law is to be liberally construed to carry out its full purpose, which was to enlarge admiralty's protection to its wards. Warner v. Goltra, \n293 \nU.S. 155, 156\n, 162 S., 55 S.Ct. 46, 49; The Arizona, \n298 \nU.S. 110, 123\n, 56 S.Ct. 707, 711. Being an integral part of the maritime law, rights fashioned by it are to be implemented by admiralty rules not inconsistent with the Act. Socony Vacuum Co. v. Smith, \n305 \nU.S. 424, 430\n, 59 S.Ct. 262, 266.\n III. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has concluded that in solving problems of procedural, as distinguished from substantive, law, the law court may apply its own doctrine; and that the locus of burden of proof presents a procedural rather than a substantive question. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 239, 249]\n\u00a0\n Much of what we have said above concerning the necessity of preserving all of the substantial admiralty rights in an action at law is incompatible with the conclusion of the court below. The right of the petitioner to be free from the burden of proof imposed by the Pennsylvania local rule inhered in his cause of action. Deeply rooted in admiralty as that right is, it was a part of the very substance of his claim and cannot be considered a mere incident of a form of procedure. Central Vermont R. v. White, \n238 \nU.S. 507, 511\n, 512 S., 35 S.Ct. 865, 866, Ann.Cas. 1916B, 252; Cities Service Oil Co. v. Dunlap, \n308 \nU.S. 208, 212\n, 60 S.Ct. 201, 202; and cf. Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. Cornell Steamboat Co., \n218 \nU.S. 264, 270\n, 31 S.Ct. 17, 18, 20 Ann.Cas. 1235. Pennsylvania having opened its courts to petitioner to enforce federally created rights, the petitioner was entitled to the benefit of the full scope of these rights. The cause is reversed for action not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 46 U.S.C.  688, 46 U.S.C.A.  688. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The right of a seaman to recover damages for negligent injury arises under the Jones Act and the right to maintenance and cure irrespective of negligence arises under the law of admiralty.

He was paid only up to the time he left the vessel. There is clear authority to support a claim for wages to the end of the voyage for which petitioner had been signed.

Homer Cummings, of Washington, D.C., Ralph M. Snyder, of Chicago, Ill., and William D. Donnelly, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner Glasser.\n Mr. Edward M. Keating, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner Kretske.\n Mr. Alfred E. Roth, of Chicago, Ill., pro se.\n Mr. Edwin D. Dickinson, of Washington, D.C., for respondent. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 63]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John Elliott Byrne, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner Glasser as amicus curiae.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners, together with Anthony Horton and Louis Kaplan, were found guilty upon an indictment charging them with a conspiracy to defraud the United States under Section 37 of the Criminal Code, R.S.  5440, 18 U. S.C.  88, 18 U.S.C.A.  88.1 Judgment was entered on the verdict and Glasser, Kretske, and Kaplan were sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 14 months. Roth was ordered to pay a fine or $500 and Horton was placed on probation. On appeal the convictions of Glasser, Kretske and Roth were affirmed. \n2\n We brought the case here because of the important constitutional issues involved. \n313 \nU.S. 551\n, 61 S.Ct. 835.\n Glasser was the assistant United States attorney in charge of liquor cases in the Northern District of Illinois from about March 1935 to April 1939. Kretske was an assistant United States attorney in the same district from October 1934 until April 1937. He assisted Glasser in the prosecution of liquor cases. After his resignation be entered private practice in Chicago. Roth was an attorney in private practice. Kaplan was an automobile dealer reputed to be engaged in the illicit alcohol traffic around Chicago. Horton was a professional bondsman.\n The indictment was originally in two counts but only the second survives here as the Government elected to \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 64]\n\u00a0\n proceed on that count alone at the close of its case. That count, after alleging that during certain periods Glasser and Kretske were assistant United States attorneys for the Northern District of Illinois, employed to prosecute all delinquents for crimes and offenses cognizable under the authority of the United States, and more particularly violations of the federal internal revenue laws relating to liquor, charged in substance that the defendants conspired to 'defraud the United States of and concerning its governmental function to be honestly, faithfully and dutifully represented in the courts of the United States' in such matters 'free from corruption, improper influence, dishonesty, or fraud.' The means by which the conspiracy was to be accomplished was alleged to be by the defendants' soliciting certain persons charged, or about to be charged, with violating the laws of the United States, to promise or cause to be promised certain sums to be paid or pledged to the defendants to be used to corrupt and influence the defendants Glasser and Kretske, and the defendant Glasser alone in the performance of their and his official duties.\n All the defendants filed a motion to quash the indictment on the ground (a) that the grand jury was illegally constituted because women were excluded therefrom and (b) that the indictment was not properly returned in open court. Glasser, Kretske and Roth also filed demurrers to the indictment. The motion to quash and the demurrers were overruled and petitioners here renew their objections.\n On July 1, 1939 two acts of the State of Illinois providing for women jurors became effective. \n3\n Section 275 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  411, 28 U.S.C.A.  411, provides in substance that jurors in a federal court are to have the qualifications of jurors in the highest court of the State. Petitioners \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 65]\n\u00a0\n contend that the grand jury, composed entirely of men, and summoned on August 25, 1939, was illegally constituted because at the time it was drawn Illinois law required state jury lists to contain the names of women. However, in 17 of the 18 counties comprising the Northern District of Illinois the county boards could wait until September, 1939, to include women on their jury lists. \n4\n Of course, for women to serve as federal jurors in Illinois it is not necessary that their names appear on a county list, but we are of opinion that, in view of the short time elapsing between the effective date of the Illinois acts and the summoning of the grand jury, it was not error to omit the names of women from federal jury lists where it was not shown that women's names had yet appeared on the state jury lists.\n The record here adequately disposes of petitioners' contention that there is no showing that the indictment was returned in open court by the grand jury. It contains a placita in regular form which recities the convening of a regular term of the District Court for the Eastern Division of the Northern District of Illinois, 'on the first Monday of September ( 1939) (it being the twenty-ninth day of September the indictment was filed)' , and discloses the presence of the judges of that court, the marshal and the clerk. The indictment bears the notation: 'A true bill, George A. Hancock, Foreman' and the endorsement: 'Filed in open court this 29th day of Sept., \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 66]\n\u00a0\n A.D. 1939, Hoyt King, Clerk.' Immediately following the indictment in the record is the motion-slip discharging the September grand jury, dated September 29, 1939, initialled by Judge Wilkerson and containing: 'The Grand Jury return 4 Indictments in open Court. Added 10\/30\/39'. The presence of this notation in the record is meaningless unless the indictment in this case is one of the four mentioned. The addition was obviously made to clarify the indorsement of the clerk so as to show clearly the return by the grand jury and thus avert the technical argument here advanced. While a formal nunc pro tunc order would have been the more correct procedure, especially since a new term of court had begun, we do not think that this informal clarification of the record amounts to such error as requires reversal. Cf. Breese v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 1\n, 33 S. Ct. 1.\n The demurrers to the indictment were properly overruled. The indictment is sufficiently definite to inform petitioners of the charges against them. It shows 'certainty, to a common intent'. Williamson v. United States, \n207 \nU.S. 425, 447\n, 28 S.Ct. 163, 170, 171. The particularity of time, place, circumstances, causes, etc., in stating the manner and means of effecting the object or a conspiracy for which petitioners contend is not essential to an indictment. Crawford v. United States, \n212 \nU.S. 183\n, 29 S.Ct. 260, 15 Ann.Cas. 392; Dealy v. United States, \n152 \nU.S. 539\n, 14 S.Ct. 680. Such specificity of detail falls rather within the scope of a bill of particulars, which petitioners requested and received.\n The indictment charges that the United States was defrauded by depriving it of its lawful governmental functions by dishonest means; it is settled that this is a 'defrauding' within the meaning of Section 37 of the Criminal Code. Hammerschmidt v. United States, \n265 \nU.S. 182\n, 44 S.Ct. 511.\n It is unnecessary to explore the merits of the argument that the indictment is defective on the ground that it \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 67]\n\u00a0\n charges a conspiracy to commit a substantive offense requiring concerted action namely, bribery, because, 'The indictment does not charge as a substantive offense the giving or receiving of bribes; nor does it charge a conspiracy to give or accept bribes. It charges 'a conspiracy to ... defraud the United States, the scheme of resorting to bribery being averred only to be a way of consummating the conspiracy and which, like the use of a gun to effect a conspiracy to murder, is purely ancillary to the substantive offense.' United States v. Manton, 2 Cir., 107 F.2d 834, 839.\n Petitioners Glasser and Roth claim that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. Kretske makes no such argument but merely contends that the government's testimony was largely that of accomplices 'to emphasize the inescapable conclusion that the evidence against petitioner ( Kretske) was of a borderline character.' Since we are of opinion that a new trial must be ordered as to Glasser, we do not at this time feel that it is proper to comment on the sufficiency of the evidence against Glasser.\n Admittedly the case against Glasser is not a strong one. The Government frankly concedes that the case with respect to Glasser 'depends in large part ... upon a development and collocation of circumstances tending to sustain the inferences necessary to support the verdict'. This is significant in relation to Glasser's contention that he was deprived of the assistance of counsel contrary to the Sixth Amendment. In all cases the constitutional safeguards are to be jealously preserved for the benefit of the accused, but especially is this true where the scales of justice may be delicately poised between guilt and innocence. Then error, which under some circumstances would not be ground for reversal, cannot be brushed aside as immaterial since there is a real chance that it might have provided the slight impetus which swung the scales toward guilt. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 68]\n\u00a0\n On November 1, 1939 George Callaghan entered the appearance of himself and Glasser as attorneys for Glasser. On January 29, 1940 William Scott Stewart entered his appearance as associate counsel for Glasser. 'Harrington & McDonnell' had entered an appearance for Kretske. On February 5, 1940, the day set for trial, Harrington asked for a continuance. The motion was overruled and McDonnell was appointed Kretske's attorney. On February 6 McDonnell informed the court that Kretske did not wish to be represented by him. The court then asked if Stewart could act as Kretske's attorney. The following discussion then took place:\n'Mr. Stewart: May I make this statement about that, judge? We were talking about it-we were all trying to get along together. I filed an affidavit, or I did on the behalf of Mr. Glasser pointing out some little inconsistency in the defense, and the main part of it is this: There will be conversations here where Mr. Glasser wasn't present, where people have been Mr. Kretske and they have talked about, that they gave money to take care of Glasser, that is not binding on Mr. Glasser, and there is a divergency there, and Mr. Glasser feels that if I would represent Mr. Kretske the jury would get an idea that they are together, and all the evidence-\n\n'The Court: How would it be if I appointed you as attorney for Kretske?\n\n'Mr. Stewart: That would be for your Honor to decide.\n\n'The Court: I know you are looking out for every possible legitimate defense there is. Now, if the jury understood that while you were retained by Mr. Glasser the Court appointed you at this late hour to represent Kretske, what would be the effect of the jury on that?\n\n'Mr. Stewart: Your Honor could judge that as well as I could. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 69]\n\u00a0\n 'The Court: I think it would be favorable to the defendant Kretske.\n\n'Mr. Glasser: I think it would be too, if he had Mr. Stewart. That's the reason I got Mr. Stewart, but if a defendant who has a lawyer representing him is allowed to enter an objection, I would like to enter my objection. I would like to have my own lawyer representing me.\n\n'The Court: Mr. McDonnell, you will have to stay in it until Mr. Kretske gets another lawyer, if he isn't satisfied with you.\n\n'(To Mr. Kretske) Mr. Kretske, if you are not satisfied with Mr. McDonnell, you will have to hire another lawyer. We will proceed with the selection of the jury now.'\n\n A colloquy then ensued between the court, McDonnell and Kretske when the following occurred:\n'Mr. Kretske: I can end this. I just spoke to Mr. Stewart and he said if your Honor wishes to appoint him I think we can accept the appointment.\n\n'Mr. Stewart: As long as the Court knows the situation. I think there is something to the fact that the jury knows that we can't control that.\n\n'Mr. McDonnell: Then the order is vacated?\n\n'The Court: The order appointing Mr. McDonnell is vacated and Mr. Stewart is appointed attorney for Mr. Kretske.'\n\n Glasser remained silent. Stewart thereafter represented Glasser and Kretske throughout the trial and was the most active of the array of defense counsel.\n The guarantees of the Bill of Rights are the protecting bulwarks against the reach of arbitrary power. Among those guarantees is the right granted by the Sixth Amendment to an accused in a criminal proceeding in a federal court 'to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence'. 'This is one of the safeguards ... deemed necessary to insure fundamental human rights of life and liberty' and a \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 70]\n\u00a0\n federal court cannot constitutionally deprive an accused whose life or liberty is at stake of the assistance of counsel. Johnson v. Zerbst, \n304 \nU.S. 458, 462\n, 463 S., 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1022. Even as we have held that the right to the assistance of counsel is so fundamental that the denial by a state court of a reasonable time to allow the selection of counsel of one's own choosing, and the failure of that court to make an effective appointment of counsel, may so offend our concept of the basic requirements of a fair hearing as to amount to a denial of due process of law contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment, Powell v. Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45\n, 53 S.Ct. 55, 84 A.L.R. 527, so are we clear that the 'Assistance of Counsel' guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment contemplates that such assistance be untrammeled and unimpaired by a court order requiring that one lawyer shall simultaneously represent conflicting interests. If the right to the assistance of counsel means less than this, a valued constitutional safeguard is substantially impaired.\n To preserve the protection of the Bill of Rights for hard-pressed defendants, we indulge every reasonable presumption against the waiver of fundamental rights. Aetna Insurance Co. v. Kennedy, \n301 \nU.S. 389\n, 57 S.Ct. 809; Ohio Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n301 \nU.S. 292\n, 57 S.Ct. 724. Glasser never affirmatively waived the objection which he initially advanced when the trial court suggested the appointment of Stewart. We are told that since Glasser was an experienced attorney, he tacitly acquiesced in Stewart's appointment because he failed to renew vigorously his objection at the instant the appointment was made. The fact that Glasser is an attorney is, of course, immaterial to a consideration of his right to the protection of the Sixth Amendment. His professional experience may be a factor in determining whether he actually waived his right to the assistance of counsel. Johnson v. Zerbst, \n304 \nU.S. 458, 464\n, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023. But it is by no means conclusive. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 71]\n\u00a0\n Upon the trial judge rests the duty of seeing that the trial is conducted with solicitude for the essential rights of the accused. Speaking of the obligation of the trial court to preserve the right to jury trial for an accused Mr. Justice Sutherland said that such duty 'is not to be discharged as a mere matter of rote, but with sound and advised discretion, with an eye to avoid unreasonable or undue departures from that mode of trial or from any of the essential elements thereof, and with a caution increasing in degree as the offenses dealt with increase in gravity.' Patton v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 276, 312\n, 313 S., 50 S.Ct. 253, 263, 70 A.L.R. 263. The trial court should protect the right of an accused to have the assistance of counsel. 'This protecting duty imposes the serious and weighty responsibility upon the trial judge of determining whether there is an intelligent and competent waiver by the accused. While an accused may waive the right to counsel, whether there is a proper waiver should be clearly determined by the trial court, and it would be fitting and appropriate for that determination to appear upon the record.' Johnson v. Zerbst, \n304 \nU.S. 458, 465\n, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023.\n No such concern on the part of the trial court for the basic rights of Glasser is disclosed by the record before us. The possibility of the inconsistent interests of Glasser and Kretske was brought home to the court, but instead of jealously guarding Glasser's rights, the court may fairly be said to be responsible for creating a situation which resulted in the impairment of those rights. For the manner in which the parties accepted the appointment indicates that they thought they were acceding to the wishes of the court. Kretske said the appointment could be accepted 'if your Honor wishes to appoint him (Stewart)', and Stewart immediately replied: 'As long as the Court knows the situation. I think there is something in the fact that the jury knows we can't control that.' The court made no effort to reascertain Glasser's attitude or \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 72]\n\u00a0\n wishes. Under these circumstances to hold that Glasser freely, albeit tacitly, acquiesced in the appointment of Stewart is to do violence to reality and to condone a dangerous laxity on the part of the trial court in the discharge of its duty to preserve the fundamental rights of an accused.\n Glasser urges that the court's appointment of Stewart as counsel for Kretske embarrassed and inhibited Stewart's conduct of his defense in that it prevented Stewart from adequately safeguarding Glasser's right to have incompetent evidence excluded and from fully cross-examining the witnesses for the prosecution.\n One Brantman, an accountant known to Kretske and recommended professionally by him to a client, testified that he gave Kretske $300 on behalf of one Abosketes. He further testified that he did not know Glasser. Stewart secured a postponement of cross-examination for 'In view of the fact that your Honor appointed me for Mr. Kretske, I am not prepared to cross-examine.'\n Abosketes took the stand immediately after Brantman and testified that Brantman told him that he was about to be indicted and offered to 'fix' the case with someone in the Federal Building for $5000. About the time of this meeting Glasser and investigator Bailey were questioning one Brown, who had been convicted for operating a still, to determine whether Abosketes was connected with that still. Abosketes referred frequently to Glasser in his testimony and indicated that Glasser and Brantman were linked together. Thus he testified that Brantman told him 'They have got the goods on you, Mr. Glasser has got in out of Brown.' When questioned as to his knowledge of Brantman's connections, Abosketes replied: 'There was more than a fix, if indictment was stopped. He (Brantman) knows Mr. Glasser and that was all there was to it.' And, later: 'He had connections to stop things like that, he had connections in the Federal Build- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 73]\n\u00a0\n ing.' And, again: 'I could not be sure that this man (Brantman) was not putting a shake on me and be honest about it. I could not go over and ask Mr. Glasser if Mr. Brantman was able to fix him. I thought Brantman could, though. I was kind of hoping he could. If I did not think he could, I would not have given him the money.'\n Brantman was re-called three days later. Stewart declined cross- examination. That this decision was influenced by a desire to protect Kretske can reasonably be inferred from the colloquy between the court and Stewart before sentence was imposed. At that time Stewart told the court that, lest his failure to cross-examine Brantman reflect on Kretske, the reason for his forbearance was that he feared that Brantman would tell worse lies. But, especially after the intervening testimony of Abosketes, a thorough cross-examination was indicated in Glasser's interest to fully develop Brantman's lack of reference to, or knowledge of Glasser. Stewart's failure to undertake such a cross-examination luminates the cross-purposes under which he was laboring.\n Glasser also argues that certain testimony, inadmissible as to him was allowed without objection by Stewart on his behalf because of Stewart's desire to avoid prejudice to Kretske. The testimony complained of is that Elmer Swanson, Frank Hodorowicz, Edward Dewes, and Stanley Wasielewski as to statements made by Kretske, not in the presence of Glasser, and heard by them which implicated Glasser. Glasser has red hair, and the statements made by Kretske were that he would have to see 'Red', or send the money over to the 'red-head', etc., in connection with 'fixing' cases. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Glasser contends that such statements constituted inadmissible hearsay as to him and that Stewart forewent \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 74]\n\u00a0\n this obvious objection lest an objection on behalf of Glasser alone leave with the jury the impression that the testimony was true as to Kretske. The Government attacks this argument as unsound, and, relying on the doctrine that the declarations of one conspirator in furtherance of the objects of the conspiracy made to a third party are admissible against his co-conspirators, Logan v. United States, \n144 \nU.S. 263\n, 12 S.Ct. 617, contends that the declarations of Kretske were admissible against Glasser and hence no prejudice could arise from Stewart's failure to object. However, such declarations are admissible over the objection of an alleged co-conspirator, who was not present when they were made, only if there is proof aliunde that he is connected with the conspiracy. Minner v. United States, 10 Cir., 57 F.2d 506; and see Nudd v. Burrows, \n91 \nU.S. 426\n. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 75]\n\u00a0\n Otherwise hearsay would lift itself by its own bootstraps to the level of competent evidence.\n Glasser urges that independent of the statements complained of there is no proof connecting him with the conspiracy. Clearly the statements were damaging. Other evidence tending to connect Glasser with the conspiracy is rather meagre by comparison. Frank Hodorowicz testified that Glasser apologized to him after his indictment because he, Glasser, could do nothing for Hodorowicz. Hodorowicz also testified that he sent a case of whiskey to Glasser for Christmas, 1937. Victor Raubunas testified that he saw Glasser, Kretske and Kaplan meet on three occasions. An alcohol agent, Dowd, testified that Glasser expelled him from the court-room during the trial of a libel case in which Roth represented the successful claimant. Glasser released Raubunas and one Joppek, who were picked up on different occasions for suspected liquor violations, without extensive questioning. Whether testimony such as this was sufficient to establish the participation of Glasser in the conspiracy we need not decide. That is beside the point. The important fact is that no objection was offered by Stewart on Glasser's behalf to the statements complained of, and this despite the fact that, when the court broached the possibility of Stewart's appointment, Stewart told the court that statements of this nature were not binding on Glasser. That this is indicative of Stewart's struggle to serve two masters cannot seriously be doubted.\n There is yet another consideration. Glasser wished the benefit of the undivided assistance of counsel of his own choice. We think that such a desire on the part of an accused should be respected. Irrespective of any conflict of interest the additional burden of representing another party may conceivably impair counsel's effectiveness.\n To determine the precise degree of prejudice sustained by Glasser as a result of the court's appointment of \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 76]\n\u00a0\n Stewart as counsel for Kretske is at once difficult and unnecessary. The right to have the assistance of counsel is too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to indulge in nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice arising from its denial. Cf. Snyder v. Massachusetts, \n291 \nU.S. 97, 116\n, 54 S.Ct. 330, 336, 90 A.L.R. 575; Tumey v. Ohio, \n273 \nU.S. 510, 535\n, 47 S.Ct. 437, 445, 50 A.L.R. 1243; Patton v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 276, 292\n, 50 S.Ct. 253, 256, 70 A.L.R. 263. And see McCandless v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 342, 347\n, 56 S.Ct. 764, 766. Of equal importance with the duty of the court to see that an accused has the assistance of counsel is its duty to refrain from embarrassing counsel in the defense of an accused by insisting, or indeed, even suggesting that counsel undertake to concurrently represent interests which might diverge from those of his first client, when the possibility of that divergence is brought home to the court. In conspiracy cases, where the liberal rules of evidence and the wide latitude accorded the prosecution may, and sometimes do, operate unfairly against an individual defendant, it is especially important that he be given the benefit of the undivided assistance of his counsel without the court's becoming a party to encumbering that assistance. Here the court was advised of the possibility that conflicting interests might arise which would diminish Stewart's usefulness to Glasser. Nevertheless Stewart was appointed as Kretske's counsel. Our examination of the record leads to the conclusion that Stewart's representation of Glasser was not as effective as it might have been if the appointment had not been made. We hold that the court thereby denied Glasser his right to have the effective assistance of counsel, guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. This error requires that the verdict be set aside and a new trial ordered as to Glasser.\n But this error does not require that the convictions of the other petitioners be set aside. To secure a new trial they must show that the denial of Glasser's constitutional rights prejudiced them in some manner, for where error \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 77]\n\u00a0\n as to one defendant in a conspiracy case requires that a new trial be granted him, the rights of his co-defendants to a new trial depend upon whether that error prejudiced them. Agnello v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 20\n, 46 S.Ct. 4; United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., \n310 \nU.S. 150\n, 60 S.Ct. 811; Rossi v. United States, 9 Cir., 278 F. 349; Belfi v. United States, 3 Cir., 259 F. 822; Browne v. United States, 2 Cir., 145 F. 1; Dufour v. United States, 37 App.D.C. 497. Kretske does not contend that he was prejudiced by the appointment, and we are clear from the record that no prejudice is disclosed as to him. Roth argues the point, but he was represented throughout the case by his own attorney. We fail to see that the denial of Glasser's right to have the assistance of counsel affected Roth.\n Turning now to the contentions of Kretske and Roth, we are clear that substantial evidence supports the verdict against both. As noted before, Kretske does not raise the point other than to mention that the testimony against him was largely that of accomplices and unsavory characters. The short answer to this is that the credibility of witness is a question for the jury.\n The evidence against Roth discloses the following salient facts. Elmer Swanson, Clem Dowiat and Anthony Hodorowicz were arrested in connection with a still on Stony Island Avenue. Frank Hodorowicz, the head of the Hodorowicz crowd, arranged a meeting with Kretske at his hardware store to 'take care' of the case. Horton was present and Kretske told the group that there 'was a lot of heat' on the case but that it could be arranged so that nobody 'would go to jail' for $1200, part of which 'Red' was to get. A down payment of $500 was made. When a lawyer was sought, Kretske referred the prospective defendants to Roth. He represented them at the hearing before the Commissioner which was continued at the request of Glasser. After an indictment was returned, Roth appeared for trial to find that the case had \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 78]\n\u00a0\n been stricken from the docket with leave to reinstate it. The defendants were never brought to trial. None of the Hodorowiczes or their associates paid Roth for his services. Roth testified that he received his fee from Kretske.\n In June 1938 Glasser secured two indictments, one against Frank, Mike, and Peter Hodorowicz and Clem Dowiat, and the other against Frank, and Peter Hodorowicz and Dowiat for the sale of illicit alcohol. Frank paid Kretske $250 after the indictments. Kretske later told him that nothing could be done as investigator Bailey was pressing Glasser. Frank then went to see Roth, who with Kretske went to see Glasser. Roth later told Frank that nothing could be done and suggested that he get an attorney and prepare to defend himself. Roth's explanation of this was that he went to Glasser to learn the latter's attitude toward clemency for Frank, and that he suggested the retention of two lawyers, one to defend Frank, and the other to represent the remaining defendants. Frank dispensed with Roth's services and was represented at the trial by one Hess. Frank paid Roth $50, but this was in connection with substituting some securities on his bond.\n Edward Dewes had been associated with the defendant Kaplan in a still at Spring Grove. That case was twice presented to a grand jury by Glasser but withdrawn on each occasion. Two days before it was presented a third time the defendant Horton told Dewes that Kretske wished to see him. Dewes went to Kretske's office and paid him $100 so that he would not be indicted. Dewes was no-billed in that case. Dewes was also involved in a still on the farm of one Beisner. It was raided and several were arrested. Dewes, Victor Raubunas and Edward Farber asked Horton to 'fix' that case, but when his price was thought too high, Farber, who had known Kretske for some time, took Dewes and Raubunas to Kretske's \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 79]\n\u00a0\n office. Kretske offered to take care of the case for $1200. Raubunas paid $ 300 and they were told they would need no lawyer at the preliminary hearing. Eventually Raubunas, Dewes and Beisner were indicted. Dewes thereafter paid Kretske $275 to 'fix' his case. Kretske referred the matter to Roth who represented Dewes throughout his trial. Dewes testified that he neither retained nor paid Roth.\n Paul Svec, and associate of one Yarrio, was arrested in 1937 for a liquor violation. Horton arranged his bond. In Svec's presence Horton picked up Kretske and Yarrio. They told Svec not to worry. He was thereafter indicted and convicted. While at liberty pending an appeal he was again arrested. This time he called Glasser, and according to the latter, offered him money. The following morning Glasser interrogated Svec in the hearing of a secreted agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and secured admissions that Svec had never paid Glasser money or received any promises from him, and that the call had been at the instigation of the arresting investigators. Svec testified that Roth told him that he 'stood up o.k.' under Glasser's questioning. Svec was discharged at the Commissioner's hearing.\n Glasser prosecuted Leo Vitale for the operation of a still. He was convicted and received a sentence of one hour in the custody of the marshal. Vitale's wife, Rose, was the claimant in a subsequent libel action against a car allegedly used to transport illicit liquor. The case was referred to Roth by Kretske. Roth informed the court that Vitale was 'o.k.' and that the car was not used for illegal purposes. As was the custom, the case was tried on the agent's report. It was dismissed. Investigator Dowd later informed Glasser that he had heard that Vitale had boasted that 'he got out of this for nine hundred dollars'.\n In April 1938 Edward and William Wroblewski were indicted in the Northern District of Indiana. They en- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 80]\n\u00a0\n gaged Roth as their counsel. They did not remember how they met Roth. When asked by the court if anyone recommended Roth to him, Edward answered: 'No, sir, I don't remember whether it was a rumor about his name.' According to Alexander Campbell, an assistant United States attorney in that district, Roth appeared in his office in September 1938 and asked if the Wroblewskis had been indicted. Campbell replied that he did not know off-hand but would check the files. Roth then asked, if the files showed no indictment, whether some arrangement could be made so that no indictment would be returned. He offered Campbell $500 or $1000. When Campbell refused, Roth said: 'Well, that is the way we handle cases in Chicago sometimes'. The Wroblewskis were convicted. Subsequently Roth asked Campbell to use his influence to stop the investigation in Chicago by Bailey which resulted in the instant case.\n It is not for us to weigh the evidence or to determine the credibility of witnesses. The verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it. United States v. Manton, 2 Cir., 107 F.2d 834, 839, and cases cited. Participation in a criminal conspiracy need not be proved by direct evidence; a common purpose and plan may be inferred from a 'development and collocation of circumstances'. United States v. Manton, supra. We are clear that from the circumstances outlined above the jury could infer the existence of a conspiracy and the participation of Roth in it. Roth's statements to Campbell in the Wroblewski matter, his suggestion to Frank Hodorowicz that he should get a lawyer and prepare to defend himself when the case could not be 'fixed', the fact that he received no fees from the Hodorowiczes with the exception of $50 in connection with Frank's bond, Dewes' testimony that he neither retained nor paid Roth, Roth's commendation of Svec's bearing under Glasser's \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 81]\n\u00a0\n interrogation, all furnish the necessary support for the jury's verdict.\n The objections of Kretske and Roth with regard to the admission of certain evidence are without merit. The reports of investigators of the Alcohol Tax Unit on stills at Western Avenue and at Spring Grove, operated by the defendant Kaplan and his associates, were admitted as Government exhibits 81A and 113. Each contained statements taken from prospective witnesses by the investigators, and each gave a description of the prospective defendants. Kaplan was referred to as of Jewish descent, a bootlegger by reputation, and mention was made of the arrest of Kaplan and Edward Dewes in connection with the killing of one Pinna. At the time each report was admitted the trial judge informed the jury that it was admitted only against Glasser and continued: 'At some further stage of the proceedings I may advise you with reference to its competency as to the other defendants, but for the time being it will be admissible only against the defendant Glasser'. The record before us contains no indication that the jury was later informed that the exhibits were evidence against the defendants other than Glasser. The claim of Kretske and Roth that the admission of these reports was prejudicial to Kaplan and that they are entitled to take advantage of that error ignores the fact that they were admitted against Glasser alone.\n No reversible error was committed by overruling objections to the testimony of Alexander Campbell with relation to his dealings with Roth. Trial judges have a measure of discretion in allowing testimony which discloses the purpose, knowledge, or design of a particular person. Butler v. United States, 10 Cir., 53 F.2d 800; Simpkins v. United States, 4 Cir., 78 F.2d 594, 598. We do not think the bounds of that discretion were exceeded here. The statements of Roth were not in furtherance of the conspiracy, but they \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 82]\n\u00a0\n did tend to connect Roth with it by explaining his state of mind.\n The judge conducting a jury trial in a federal court is 'not a mere moderator, but is the governor of the trial for the purpose of assuring its proper conduct'. Quercia v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 466, 469\n, 53 S.Ct. 698. Upon him rests the responsibility of striving for that atmosphere of perfect impartiality which is so much to be desired in a judicial proceeding. Petitioners contend that the trial judge made remarks prejudicial to them, committed acts of advocacy, questioned them in a hostile manner, unduly limited cross-examination, and in general failed to maintain an impartial attitude. Various incidents in support of those contentions are brought to our attention.\n The court did interrogate several witnesses, but in the main such interrogation was within its power to elicit the truth by an examination of the witnesses. United States v. Gross, 7 Cir., 103 F.2d 11; United States v. Breen, 2 Cir., 96 F.2d 782. In asking Anthony Hodorowicz whether there had been a full disclosure of his connection with the Stony Island still when he appeared before Judge Woodward the court obviously was under a misapprehension of the nature of the appearance. It was simply for the purpose of arraignment, and of course no testimony was offered. Much is made of this, but at the time no one attempted to explain to the court the nature of the appearance. Stewart later brought out on cross-examination that it was only an arraignment and that there was no necessity for testimony on that day.\n After the testimony of Abosketes the court read into the record the fact that Abosketes was indicted in Wisconsin in 1936 and 1938, and that he pleaded guilty to one indictment and that the other was dismissed. It is, of course, improper for a judge to assume the role of a witness, but we cannot here conclude that prejudicial error \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 83]\n\u00a0\n resulted. Abosketes had briefly referred to his troubles in Wisconsin in his testimony.\n The alleged undue limitation of cross-examination merits scant attention. The extent of such examination rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. Alford v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 687\n, 51 S.Ct. 218. We find no abuse of that discretion.\n Perhaps the court did not attain at all times that thoroughgoing impartiality which is the ideal, but our examination of the record as a whole leads to the conclusion that the substantial rights of the petitioners were not affected. The trial was long and the incidents relied on by petitioners few. We must guard against the magnification on appeal of instances which were of little importance in their setting. Cf. United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., \n310 \nU.S. 150, 240\n, 60 S.Ct. 811, 852; Goldstein v. United States, 8 Cir., 63 F.2d 609; United States v. Warren, 2 Cir., 120 F.2d 211.\n Separate consideration of the numerous instances of alleged prejudicial misconduct on the part of the prosecuting attorney would unduly extend this opinion. Suffice it to say that after due consideration we conclude that no one instance, nor the combination of them all constitutes reversible error.\n All the petitioners contend that they were denied an impartial trial because of the alleged exclusion from the petit jury panel of all women not members of the Illinois League of Women Voters. In support of their motions for a new trial Glasser and Roth filed affidavits which are the basis of petitioners' present contentions. Kretske did not file an affidavit, but he urges the point here.\n Glasser swore on information and belief that all the names of women placed in the box from which the panel was drawn were taken from a list furnished the clerk of the court by the Illinois League of Women Voters, and pre- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 84]\n\u00a0\n pared exclusively from its membership, that the women on that list had attended 'jury classes whose lecturers presented the views of the prosecution', and that women not members of the League, but otherwise qualified, were systematically excluded, by reason of which affiant 'did not have a trial by a jury free from bias, prejudice, and prior instructions, and as a result thereof the jury was disqualified and this affiant's rights were prejudiced in that he was deprived of a trial by jury guaranteed to him by the laws and the constitution of the United States of America, and particularly the 5th and 6th amendment, all of which he offers to prove.' The source of Glasser's information was stated to be a then current article, 'Women and the Law', in the American Bar Association Journal for April 1940 (Vol. 26, No. 4). Roth's affidavit merely gave Glasser as his source of information and made no offer of proof. The court overruled the motions for a new trial. The record discloses that the jury was composed of six men and six women.\n Since it was first recognized in Magna Carta, trial by jury has been a prized shield against oppression, but while proclaiming trial by jury as 'the glory of the English law', Blackstone was careful to note that it was but a 'privilege'. Commentaries, Book 3, p. 379. Our Constitution transforms that privilege into a right in criminal proceedings in a federal court. This was recognized by Justice Story: 'When our more immediate ancestors removed to America, they brought this great privilege ( trial by jury in criminal cases) with them, as their birthright and inheritance, as a part of that admirable common law which had fenced round and interposed barriers on every side against the approaches of arbitrary power. It is now incorporated into all our state constitutions as a fundamental right, and the Constitution of the United States would have been justly obnoxious to the most conclusive \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 85]\n\u00a0\n objection if it had not recognized and confirmed it in the most solemn terms.' 2 Story, Const. sec. 1779.\n Lest the right of trial by jury be nullified by the improper constitution of juries, the notion of what a proper jury is has become inextricably intertwined with the idea of jury trial. When the original Constitution provided only that 'The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury;' 6 the people and their representatives, leaving nothing to chance, were quick to implement that guarantee by the adoption of the Sixth Amendment which provides that the jury must be impartial.\n For the mechanics of trial by jury we revert to the common law as it existed in this country and in England when the Constitution was adopted. Patton v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 276\n, 50 S.Ct. 253, 70 A.L. R. 263. But even as jury trial, which was a privilege at common law, has become a right with us, so also, whatever limitations were inherent in the historical common law concept of the jury as a body of one's peers do not prevail in this country. Our notions of what a proper jury is have developed in harmony with our basic concepts of a democratic society and a representative government. For 'It is part of the established tradition in the use of juries as instruments of public justice that the jury be a body truly representative of the community.' Smith v. Texas, \n311 \nU.S. 128, 130\n, 61 S.Ct. 164, 165.\n Jurors in a federal court are to have the qualifications of those in the highest court of the State, and they are to be selected by the clerk of the court and a jury commissioner. Secs. 275, 276, Jud.Code, 28 U.S.C. secs. 411, 412, 28 U.S.C.A.  411, 412. This duty of selection may not be delegated. United States v. Murphy, D.C., 224 F. 554; In re Petition for Special Grand Jury, D.C., 50 F.2d 973. And, its exercise must always \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 86]\n\u00a0\n accord with the fact that the proper functioning of the jury system, and, indeed, our democracy itself, requires that the jury be a truly representative of the community', and not the organ of any special group or class. If that requirement is observed, the officials charged with choosing federal jurors may exercise some discretion to the end that competent jurors may be called. But they must not allow the desire for competent jurors to lead them into selections which do not comport with the concept of the jury as a cross-section of the community. Tendencies, no matter how slight, toward the selection of jurors by any method other than a process which will insure a trial by a representative group are undermining processes weakening the institution of jury trial, and should be sturdily resisted. That the motives influencing such tendencies may be of the best must not blind us to the dangers of allowing any encroachment whatsoever on this essential right. Steps innocently taken may one by one lead to the irretrievable impairment of substantial liberties.\n The deliberate selection of jurors from the membership of particular private organizations definitely does not conform to the traditional requirements of jury trial. No matter how high principled and imbued with a desire to inculcate public virtue such organizations may be, the dangers inherent in such a method of selection are the more real when the members of those organizations from training or otherwise acquire a bias in favor of the prosecution. The jury selected from the membership of such an organization is then not only the organ of a special class, but, in addition, it is also openly partisan. If such practices are to be countenanced, the hard won right of trial by jury becomes a thing of doubtful value, lacking one of the essential characteristics that have made it a cherished feature of our institutions. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 87]\n\u00a0\n So, if the picture in this case actually is as alleged in Glasser's affidavit, we would be compelled to set aside the trial court's denial of the motion for a new trial as a clear abuse of discretion, and order a new trial for all the petitioners. But from the record before us we must conclude that petitioners' showing is insufficient. The Government did not controvert the affidavits by counter-affidavits or formal denial, and it does not appear from the record that any argument was heard on them. From this petitioners argue that the allegations of the affidavits are to be taken as true for the purpose of the motion. However, this is not a case where the prosecution has impliedly, Neal v. Delaware, \n103 \nU.S. 370\n, or actually, Hale v. Kentucky, \n303 \nU.S. 613\n, 58 S.Ct. 753, stipulated that affidavits in support of a motion alleging the improper constitution of a jury may be accepted as proof. In the absence of such a stipulation, it is incumbent on the moving party to introduce, or to offer, distinct evidence in support of the motion; the formal affidavit alone, even though uncontroverted, is not enough. Smith v. Mississippi, \n162 \nU.S. 592\n, 16 S.Ct. 900; Tarrance v. Florida, \n188 \nU.S. 519\n, 23 S.Ct. 402; cf. Brownfield v. South Carolina, \n189 \nU.S. 426\n, 23 S.Ct. 513. Glasser, in his affidavit, offered to prove the allegations contained therein, but the record is barren of any actual tender of proof on his part. Furthermore, there is no indication that the court refused to entertain such an offer, if it were in fact made. Roth did not even make an offer of proof in his affidavit, and Kretske did not file one. While it is error to refuse to hear evidence offered in support of allegations that a jury was improperly constituted, Carter v. Texas, \n177 \nU.S. 442\n, 20 S.Ct. 687, there is, and, on the state of this record, can be no assertion that such error was here committed. The failure of petitioners to prove their contention is fatal.\n We conclude that the conviction of Glasser must be set aside and the cause as to him remanded to the District \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 88]\n\u00a0\n Court for the Eastern Division of the Northern District of Illinois for a new trial. The convictions of petitioners Kretske and Roth are in all respects upheld. It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded in part and affirmed in part.\n Mr. Justice JACKSON took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and I are of opinion that the conviction of Glasser, as well as that of his co-defendants, should stand.\n It is a commonplace in the administration of criminal justice that the actualities of a long trial are too often given a meretricious appearance on appeal; the perspective of the living trial is lost in the search for error in a dead record. To set aside the conviction of Glasser ( a lawyer who served as an Assistant United States Attorney for more than four years) after a trial lasting longer than a month on the ground that he was denied the basic constitutional right 'to have the assistance of counsel for his defence' is to give fresh point to this regrettably familiar phenomenon. For Glasser himself made no such claim at any of the critical occasions throughout the proceedings. Neither when the judge appointed Stewart to act as counsel for both Kretske and Glasser, nor at any time during the long trial, nor in his motions to set aside the verdict and to arrest judgment, nor in his plea to the court before sentence was passed, nor in setting forth his grounds for appeal, did Glasser assert, or manifest in any way a belief, that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. Not until twenty weeks after Stewart had become counsel for the co-defendant Kretske, and fifteen weeks after the trial had ended, did Glasser discover that he had been \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 89]\n\u00a0\n deprived of his constitutional rights. This was obviously a lawyer's afterthought. It does not promote respect for the Bill of Rights to turn such an afterthought into an imaginary injury that is reflected nowhere in the contemporaneous record of the trial and make it the basis for reversal.\n The guarantees of the Bill of Rights are not abstractions. Whether their safeguards of liberty and dignity have been infringed in a particular case depends upon the particular circumstances. The fact that Glasser is an attorney of course does not mean that he is not entitled to the protection which is afforded all persons by the Sixth Amendment. But the fact that he is an attorney with special experience in criminal cases, and not a helpless illiterate, may be-as we believe it to be here- extremely relevant in determining whether he was denied such protection.\n In this light, what does the record show? Before the trial got under way the trial judge was presented with a problem created by the inability of one of Kretske's lawyers to try the case in his behalf. Kretske was dissatisfied with his other lawyer, who professed to be unfamiliar with the many details of the case. Upon Kretske's motion for a continuance, the judge was faced with the difficulty of avoiding either delay of the trial or an undesirable severance as to Kretske. All the defendants, including Glasser, and their counsel were present in court. The judge asked whether Stewart, who had been retained by Glasser, would be prepared to act also for Kretske. The record gives no possible ground for any inference other than that this suggestion came from the judge as a fair and disinterested proposal to solve a not unfamiliar trial problem. It is not, and indeed could not be, contended that the judge's suggestion, addressed to the consideration of the defendants, was not wholly proper. And so, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 90]\n\u00a0\n when Stewart raised the question of a possible conflict of interest, and Glasser himself objected, saying 'I would like to have my own lawyer representing me', the judge neither remonstrated nor argued. He promptly dropped his suggestion and directed Kretske's other lawyer, who was present but with whom Kretske was dissatisfied, to stay in the case until Kretske could hire someone to his satisfaction. The footnote sets forth the full text of this episode. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n There ensued a long discussion relating to the representation of Kretske. During this discussion the judge never \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 91]\n\u00a0\n again adverted to his original suggestion that Stewart also represent Kretske. Kretske interrupted, and there then occurred in Glasser's presence what is now made the basis for reversal:\n'Mr. Kretske: I can end this. I just spoke to Mr. Stewart and he said if your Honor wishes to appoint him I think we can accept the appointment.\n\n'Mr. Stewart: As long as the Court knows the situation. I think there is something to the fact that the jury knows we can't control that.\n\n'Mr. McDonnell: Then the order is vacated?\n\n'The Court: The order appointing Mr. McDonnell is vacated and Mr. Stewart is appointed attorney for Mr. Kretske.'\n\n It is clear, therefore, that this arrangement was voluntarily assumed by the parties, and was not pressed upon them by the judge. Glasser, who was present, raised no objection and made no comment.\n The requirement that timely objections be made to prejudicial rulings of a trial judge often has the semblance of traps for the unwary and uninformed. But Glasser was neither unwary nor uninformed. His experience in the prosecution of criminal cases makes his silence here most significant. Nor was this the last opportunity he had to indicate that embarrassment was being caused him by Stewart's representation of Kretske, let alone that he deemed it a denial of his constitutional rights. If he were laboring under a handicap, he would have made it known at the times when he felt it most-during the long course of the trial, in his motions for new trial and in arrest of judgment, in his extended plea to the court before sentence was passed, and finally when, on April 26, 1940, over his own signature he gave twenty grounds for appeal but did not mention this one. The long period of uninterrupted silence concerning his after- discovered injury negatives its existence. We find it difficult to know what acquies- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 92]\n\u00a0\n cence in a judge's ruling could be, if this record does not show it. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n A fair reading of the record thus precludes the inference that the judge forced upon Glasser a situation which hobbled him in his defense. To be sure, he did say at first that he would like his lawyer to represent him alone. But he plainly acquiesced in the arrangement which, after consultation at the defense table, was proposed to the trial judge and which the judge accepted. A conspiracy trial presents complicated questions of strategy for the defense. There are advantages and disadvantages in having separate counsel for each defendant or a single counsel for more than one. Joint representation is a means of insuring against reciprocal recrimination. A common defense often gives strength against a common attack. These considerations could not have escaped a lawyer of Glasser's experience. His thorough acquiescence in the proceedings cannot be reconciled with a denial of his constitutional rights.\n A belated showing that Glasser was actually prejudiced by the judge's action is now attempted. This has two aspects: (1) Stewart's failure to cross-examine the witness Brantman, and (2) his failure to make objections on behalf of Glasser to the admission of certain evidence. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 60, 93]\n\u00a0\n (1) The Brantman episode evaporates upon examination. His only testimony relating to Glasser was that he did not know him. This was brought out fully and distinctly on direct examination. \n3\n That it had been amply established, Glasser himself recognized in his address to the court before sentence. It is difficult to understand how cross-examination would have been of any further benefit to Glasser. In any event, the record shows that Stewart abstained from cross-examining Brantman not because he felt himself inhibited by any conflict of interest but because, as he told the judge after verdict, he thought that on cross-examination Brantman 'would be telling worse lies'.\n\n\n (2)\n It is said that Stewart's failure to object, on behalf of Glasser, to certain evidence in itself proves that Stewart felt himself restricted- wholly regardless of the admissibility of such evidence. No evidence inadmissible against Glasser is avouched. Indeed we are told that it is 'beside the point' that the evidence is admissible. Can it be that a lawyer who fails to make frivolous objections to admissible evidence is thereby denying his client the constitutional right to the assistance of counsel? \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such parties do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each of the parties to such conspiracy shall be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 7 Cir., 116 F.2d 690. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Ill.Rev.Stat., 1939, c. 78,  1 and 25. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Section 1 of Chapter 78 of the Illinois Revised Statutes, 1939, applies to counties not having jury commissioners (into which class the 17 counties fall) and provides:\n'The county board of each county shall, at or before the time of its meeting, in September, in each year, or at any time thereafter, when necessary for the purpose of this Act, make a list of sufficient number, not less than one-tenth of the legal voters of each sex of each town or precinct in the county, giving the place of residence of each name on the list, to be known as a jury list.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Elmer Swanson testified that when money was paid to Kretske in connection with the Stony Island still case Kretske said that part of it would go to 'Red or Dan'. The witness understood this to refer to Glasser.\n Frank Hodorowicz testified that he gave $800 in currency to Kretske to secure favorable action with regard to a still at 124 East 118th Place. Kretske told Frank he 'had to deliver the money to Red'. Hodorowicz knew this meant Glasser. Frank attempted to 'fix' a case for Albina Zarrattini through Kretske who declined after 'he talked to Red' because Zarrattini talked too much. \n After Frank Hodorowicz was himself indicted he went to Kretske to 'fix' his case. Kretske told him there was 'a lot of heat' on the case and 'They got Glasser over a barrel, he can't do anything. He has to put you in jail.'\n When Edward Dewes gave Kretske $100 so that he would not be indicted in connection with a still at Spring Grove, Kretske told him 'he would send it over to the red-head in the Federal Building.' The witness knew this meant Glasser. Dewes also testified that Kretske told him that he, Kretske, had resigned from the United States attorney's office under pressure, and that 'for holding the bag', he was to receive favors from the 'red-head'.\n Stanley Wasielewski testified that he heard Kretske tell Stanley Slesur that 'I will take care of everything between me and the red-head.' Both Wasielewski and Slesur were involved in a still at Downers Grove. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Const., Art. III,  2, cl. 3. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Mr. Stewart: May I make this statement about that, judge? We were talking about it-we were all trying to get along together. I filed an affidavit, or I did on the behalf of Mr. Glasser pointing out some little inconsistency in the defense, and the main part of it is this: There will be conversations here where Mr. Glasser wasn't present, where people have seen Mr. Kretske and they have talked about, that they gave money to take care of Glasser, that is not binding on Mr. Glasser, and there is a divergency there, and Mr. Glasser feels that if I would represent Mr. Kretske the jury would get an idea that they are together, and all the evidence-\n'The Court: How would it be if I appointed you as attorney for Mr. Kretske?\n\n'Mr. Stewart: That would be for your Honor to decide.\n\n'The Court: I know you are looking out for every possible legitimate defense there is.

The jury brought in its verdict on March 8. The motions for new trial and in arrest of judgment were denied on April 23, and on the same day the defendants were sentenced. On April 26, Glasser filed a notice setting forth twenty grounds of appeal without suggesting that he had been denied his right to the assistance of counsel. On June 27, Glasser and the two other petitioners filed a 'joint and several assignment of errors', for the first time asserting that: 'The court erred in appointing the employed counsel of defendant Daniel D.

UNITED STATES(1942)\nNo. 962\nArgued: Decided: April 27, 1942\n\n\n\n\n[316 \nU.S. 129, 130]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Osmond K. Fraenkel, of New York City, for petitioner shulman.\n Mr. Jacob W. Friedman, of New York City for petitioners Goldman.\n Mr. Charles Fahy, Sol. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioners and another were indicted for conspiracy1 to violate  29, sub. b(5) of the Bankruptcy Act2 by receiving, or attempting to obtain, money for acting, or forbearing to act, in a bankruptcy proceeding. They were convicted and sentenced and the judgments were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. \n3\n The facts are fully stated in the opinion below and we shall advert only to those essential to an understanding of the questions open in this court.\n The petitioners were lawyers. One of them, Martin Goldman, approached Hoffman, the attorney representing \n\n[316 \nU.S. 129, 131]\n\u00a0\n an assignee for the benefit of creditors, with the proposition that the assignee sell the assets in bulk for an ostensible price which would net the creditors a certain dividend, but in fact at a secret greater price, and that Hoffman and the petitioners should divide the difference between them. Hoffman refused. Shulman, one of the petitioners, then filed an involuntary petition in bankruptcy against the assignor in such form that it could be dismissed on motion and without notice, and obtained a stay of the assignee's sale. 'The bankruptcy court refused to revoke the stay and Shulman again approached Hoffman stating that, if he agreed to the proposed arrangement, the bankruptcy petition could be dismissed and the plan consummated. Hoffman said he would agree, but he went at once to the referee and disclosed the scheme. A federal investigator was consulted and it was arranged that Hoffman should continue to negotiate with the petitioners. He did so. Numerous conferences were had and the necessary papers drawn and steps taken. Success was frustrated only by the refusal of a creditor to release for the offered percentage of his claim.\n Meantime, two federal agents, with the assistance of the building superintendent, obtained access at night to Shulman's office and to the adjoining one and installed a listening apparatus in a small aperture in the partition wall with a wire to be attached to earphones extending into the adjoining office. This was for the purpose of overhearing a conference with Hoffman set for the following afternoon. The next afternoon, one of the agents returned to the adjoining room with two others and a stenographer. They connected the earphones to the apparatus but it would not work. They had with them another device, a detectaphone having a receiver so delicate as, when placed against the partition wall, to pick up sound waves originating in Shulman's office, and means for amplifying and hearing them. With this \n\n[316 \nU.S. 129, 132]\n\u00a0\n the agents overheard, and the stenographer transcribed, portions of conversations between Hoffman, Shulman, and Martin Goldman on several occasions, and also heard what Shulman said when talking over the telephone from his office.\n Before the trial Shulman learned the facts and made a motion, in which the other petitioners joined, to suppress the evidence thus obtained. A preliminary hearing was had and the motion was denied. At the trial the evidence was admitted over objection that its receipt violated the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution and, as respects Shulman's talk into the telephone receiver, violated also  605 of the Federal Communications Act. \n 4\n\u00a0\n\n At the preliminary hearing, and at the trial, counsel for petitioners demanded that they be permitted to inspect the notes and memoranda made by the agents during the investigation, the agents having admitted they had refreshed their recollection from these papers prior to testifying. The trial judge ruled that the papers need not be exhibited by the witnesses.\n\n 1. \nWe hold there was no error in denying the inspection of the witnesses' memoranda. The judge was clearly right in his ruling at the preliminary hearing, as the petitioners should not have had access, prior to trial, to material constituting a substantial portion of the Government's case.\n We think it the better rule that where a witness does not use his notes or memoranda in court, a party has no absolute right to have them produced and to inspect them. Where, as here, they are not only the witness' notes but are also part of the Government's files, a large discretion must be allowed the trial judge. We are unwilling to hold that the discretion was abused in this case. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 129, 133]\n\u00a0\n 2. We hold that the overhearing and divulgence of what Shulman said into a telephone receiver was not a violation of Section 605.\n The petitioners contend that a communication falls within the protection of the statute once a speaker has uttered words with the intent that they constitute a transmission of a telephone conversation. The validity of the contention must be tested by the terms of the Act fairly construed. So considered, there was neither a 'communication' nor an 'interception' within the meaning of the Act. The protection intended and afforded by the statute is of the means of communication and not of the secrecy of the conversation. Section 3 embodies the following definition:5\n'(a) 'Wire communication' or 'communication by wire' means the transmission of writing, signs, signals, pictures, and sounds of all kinds by aid of wire, cable, or other like connection between the points of origin and reception of such transmission, including all instrumentalities, facilities, apparatus, and services (among other things, the receipt, forwarding, and delivery of communications) incidental to such transmission.'\n\n What is protected is the message itself throughout the course of its transmission by the instrumentality or agency of transmission. \n6\n Words written by a person and intended ultimately to be carried as so written to a telegraph office do not constitute a communication within the terms of the Act until they are handed to an agent of the telegraph company. Words spoken in a room in the presence of another into a telephone receiver do not constitute a communication by wire within the meaning of the section. Letters deposited in the Post Office are \n\n[316 \nU.S. 129, 134]\n\u00a0\n protected from examination by federal statute,7 but it could not rightly be claimed that the office carbon of such letter, or indeed the letter itself before it has left the office of the sender, comes within the protection of the statute. The same view of the scope of the Communications Act follows from the natural meaning of the term 'intercept'. As has rightly been held, this word indicates the taking or seizure by the way or before arrival at the destined place. It does not ordinarily connote the obtaining of what is to be sent before, or at the moment, it leaves the possession of the proposed sender, or after, or at the moment, it comes into the possession of the intended receiver. \n8\n The listening in the next room to the words of Shulman as he talked into the telephone receiver was no more the interception of a wire communication, within the meaning of the Act, than would have been the overhearing of the conversation by one sitting in the same room.\n\n 3. \nWe hold that what was heard by the use of the detectaphone was not made illegal by trespass or unlawful entry.\n The petitioners contend that the trespass committed in Shulman's office when the listening apparatus was there installed, and what was learned as the result of that trespass, was of some assistance on the following day in locating the receiver of the detectaphone in the adjoining office and this connection between the trespass and the listening resulted in a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Whatever trespass was committed was connected with the installation of the listening apparatus. As respects it, the trespass might be said to be continuing and, if the apparatus had been used it might, with reason, be claimed that the continuing trespass was the concomi- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 129, 135]\n\u00a0\n tant of its use. On the other hand, the relation between the trespass and the use of the detectaphone was that of antecedent and consequent. Both courts below have found that the trespass did not aid materially in the use of the detectaphone. Since we accept these concurrent findings, we need not consider a contention based on a denial of their verity.\n\n 4. \nWe hold that the use of the detectaphone by Government agents was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n In asking us to hold that the information obtained was obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and that its use at the trial was, therefore, banned by the Amendment, the petitioners recognize that they must reckon with our decision in Olmstead v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 438\n, 48 S.Ct. 564, 66 A.L.R. 376. They argue that the case may be distinguished. The suggested ground of distinction is that the Olmstead case dealt with the tapping of telephone wires, and the court adverted to the fact that, in using a telephone, the speaker projects his voice beyond the confines of his home or office and, therefore, assumes the risk that his message may be intercepted. It is urged that where, as in the present case, one talks in his own office, and intends his conversation to be confined within the four walls of the room, he does not intend his voice shall go beyond those walls and it is not to be assumed he takes the risk of someone's use of a delicate detector in the next room. We think, however, the distinction is too nice for practical application of the Constitutional guarantee and no reasonable or logical distinction can be drawn between what federal agents did in the present case and state officers did in the Olmstead case.\n The petitioners ask us, if we are unable to distinguish Olmstead v. United States, to overrule it. This we are unwilling to do. That case was the subject of prolonged consideration by this court. The views of the court, and \n\n[316 \nU.S. 129, 136]\n\u00a0\n of the dissenting justices, were expressed clearly and at length. To rehearse and reappraise the arguments pro and con, and the conflicting views exhibited in the opinions, would serve no good purpose. Nothing now can be profitably added to what was there said. It suffices to say that we adhere to the opinion there expressed.\n The judgments are affirmed.\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE and Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER:\n Had a majority of the Court been willing at this time to overrule the Olmstead case, we should have been happy to join them. But as they have declined to do so, and as we think this case is indistinguishable in principle from Olmstead's, we have no occasion to repeat here the dissenting views in that case with which we agree.\n Mr. Justice JACKSON took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY, dissenting.\n I cannot agree for to me it is clear that the use of the detectaphone under the circumstances revealed by this record was an unreasonable search and seizure within the clear intendment of the Fourth Amendment.\n One of the great boons secured to the inhabitants of this country by the Bill of Rights is the right of personal privacy guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment. In numerous ways the law protects the individual against unwarranted intrusions by others into his private affairs. \n1\n It compensates him for trespass on his property or against his person. It prohibits the publication against his will \n\n[316 \nU.S. 129, 137]\n\u00a0\n of his thoughts, sentiments, and emotions regardless of whether those are expressed in words, painting, sculpture, music, or in other modes. \n2\n It may prohibit the use of his photograph for commercial purposes without his consent. 3 These are restrictions on the activities of private persons. But the Fourth Amendment puts a restraint on the arm of the Government itself and prevents it from invading the sanctity of a man's home or his private quarters in a chase for a suspect except under safeguards calculated to prevent oppression and abuse of authority.\n On the value of the right to privacy, as dear as any to free men, little can or need be added to what was said in Entick v. Carrington, 19 How.St.Tr. 1030, Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616\n, 6 S.Ct. 524, and Justice Brandeis' memorable dissent in Olmstead v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 438, 471\n, 48 S.Ct. 564, 570, 66 A.L.R. 376. Suffice it to say that the spiritual freedom of the individual depends in no small measure upon the preservation of that right. Insistence on its retention does not mean that a person has anything to conceal, but means rather that the choice should be his as to what he wishes to reveal, saving only to the Government the right to seek out crime under a procedure with suitable safeguards for the protection of individual rights, such as the warrant whose requisites are set forth in the Fourth Amendment. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 129, 138]\n\u00a0\n It will be conceded that if the language of the Amendment were given only a literal construction, it might not fit the case now presented for review. The petitioners were not physically searched. Their homes were not entered. Their files were not ransacked. Their papers and effects were not disturbed. But it has not been the rule or practice of this Court to permit the scope and operation of broad principles ordained by the Constitution to be restricted, by a literal reading of its provisions, to those evils and phenomena that were contemporary with its framing. Cf. Weems v. United States, \n217 \nU.S. 349, 373\n, 30 S.Ct. 544, 551, 19 Ann.Cas. 705; United States v. Classic, \n313 \nU.S. 299, 316\n, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 1038\n\n\n The conditions of modern life have greatly expanded the range and character of those activities which require protection from intrusive action by Government officials if men and women are to enjoy the full benefit of that privacy which the Fourth Amendment was intended to provide. It is our duty to see that this historic provision receives a construction sufficiently liberal and elastic to make it serve the needs and manners of each succeeding generation. Cf. Grau v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 124, 128\n, 53 S.Ct. 38, 40, and cases cited. Otherwise it may become obsolete, incapable of providing the people of this land adequate protection. To this end we must give mind not merely to the exact words of the Amendment but also to its historic purpose, its high political character, and its modern social and legal implications.\n With the passing of the years since 1787 marked changes have ensued in the ways of conducting business and personal affairs. Many transactions of a business or personal character that in the eighteenth century were conducted at home are now carried on in business offices away from the home. If the method and habits of the people in 1787 with respect to the conduct of their private business had been what they are today, is it possible to think that the framers of the Bill of Rights would have been \n\n[316 \nU.S. 129, 139]\n\u00a0\n any less solicitous of the privacy of transactions conducted in the office of a lawyer, a doctor, or a man of business, than they were of a person's papers and effects?4\n There was no physical entry in this case. But the search of one's home or office no longer requires physical entry, for science has brought forth far more effective devices for the invasion of a person's privacy than the direct and obvious methods of oppression which were detested by our forebears and which inspired the Fourth Amendment. \n5\n Surely the spirit motivating the framers of that Amendment would abhor these new devices no less. Physical entry may be wholly immaterial. \n6\n Whether the search of private quarters is accomplished by placing on the outer walls of the sanctum a detectaphone that transmits to the outside listener the intimate details of a private conversation, or by new methods of photography that penetrate walls or overcome distances, the privacy of the citizen is equally invaded by agents of the Government and intimate personal matters are laid bare to view. Such \n\n[316 \nU.S. 129, 140]\n\u00a0\n invasions of privacy, unless they are authorized by a warrant issued in the manner and form prescribed by the Amendment or otherwise conducted under adequate safeguards defined by statute, are at one with the evils which have heretofore been held to be within the Fourth Amendment and equally call for remedial action. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n On the basis of the narrow, literal construction of the search and seizure clause of the Fourth Amendment adopted in Olmstead v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 438\n, 48 S.Ct. 564, 66 A.L.R. 376,8 Gov- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 129, 141]\n\u00a0\n ernment officials could well believe that activities of the character here involved did not contravene the Constitutional mandate. But for my part, I think that the Olmstead case was wrong. The error of the stultifying construction there adopted is best shown by the results to which it leads. It is strange doctrine that keeps inviolate the most mundane observations entrusted to the permanence of paper but allows the revelation of thoughts uttered within the sanctity of private quarters, thoughts perhaps too intimate to be set down even in a secret diary, or indeed, utterances about which the common law drew the cloak of privilege-the most confidential revelations between husband and wife, client and lawyer, patient and physician, and penitent and spiritual adviser. Nor can I see any rational basis for denying to the modern means of communication the same protection that is extended by the Amendment to the sealed letter in the mails. See Ex parte Jackson, \n96 \nU.S. 727\n. Officers conducting an unreasonable search are seeking evidence as such; the form it takes is of no concern to them.\n But even if Olmstead's case is to stand, it does not govern the present case. It was not the intention of petitioners to project their conversations beyond the walls of petitioner Shulman's private office. \n9\n Whatever may be said of a wire-tapping device that permits an outside telephone conversation to be overheard, it can hardly be doubted that the application of a detectaphone to the walls of a home or a private office constitutes a direct invasion of the privacy of the occupant, and a search of his private quarters. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 129, 142]\n\u00a0\n The circumstance that petitioners were obviously guilty of gross fraud is immaterial. The Amendment provides no exception in its guaranty of protection. Its great purpose was to protect the citizen against oppressive tactics. Its benefits are illusory indeed if they are denied to persons who may have been convicted with evidence gathered by the very means which the Amendment forbids. Cf. Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383\n, 34 S.Ct. 341. Its protecting arm extends to all alike, worthy and unworthy, without distinction. Rights intended to protect all must be extended to all, lest they so fall into desuetude in the course of denying them to the worst of men as to afford no aid to the best of men in time of need.\n The benefits that accrue from this and other articles of the Bill of Rights are characteristic of democratic rule. They are among the amenities that distinguish a free society from one in which the rights and comforts of the individual are wholly subordinated to the interests of the state. We cherish and uphold them as necessary and salutary checks on the authority of government. They provide a standard of official conduct which the courts must enforce. At a time when the nation is called upon to give freely of life and treasure to defend and preserve the institutions of democracy and freedom, we should not permit any of the essentials of freedom to lose vitality through legal interpretations that are restrictive and inadequate for the period in which we live. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Criminal Code  37, 18 U.S.C.  88, 18 U.S.C.A.  88. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 11 U.S.C.  52, sub. b (5), 11 U.S.C.A.  52, sub. b(5). \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 2 Cir., 118 F.2d 310. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Act of June 19, 1934, 48 Stat. 1064, 1103, 47 U.S.C.  605, 47 U.S. C.A.  605. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] 47 U.S.C.  153, 47 U.S.C.A.  153. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Compare Diamond v.

UNITED STATES(1942)\nNo. 256\nArgued: Decided: April 27, 1942\n\n\n\n Mr. Theodore Kiendl, of New York City, for petitioner Maximillian goldstein.\n Mr. Osmond K. Fraenkel, of New York City, for petitioner Benjamin Schwartz.\n Charles Fahy, Sol. Gen., for respondent.\n Messrs. Herman Rubin and Irving Elentuch, pro se.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the alleged violation of  605 of the Federal Communications Act1 by the admission of testimony in a federal criminal trial. The importance of the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 114, 115]\n\u00a0\n questions presented, and a claimed conflict with our decisions, moved us to grant certiorari. \n314 \nU.S. 588\n, 62 S.Ct. 89, 86 L.Ed. --.\n The petitioners and others were indicted under the mail fraud2 and conspiracy3 statutes. The alleged scheme was to defraud insurance companies by presenting false claims for disability benefits.\n At the opening of the trial the petitioners moved that the court suppress all records and transcripts of intercepted telephone messages; suppress all evidence the Government obtained by the use of such messages; suppress the testimony of any witness obtained in the first instance by the use of such messages, and that of any witness whose recollection had been refreshed or aided by such messages.\n A preliminary hearing was conducted by the trial judge in accordance with the practice established in Nardone v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 338\n, 60 S.Ct. 266. The principal subject of contention was the prospective testimony of Messman and Garrow, alleged co-conspirators who, the petitioners asserted, had confessed and turned state's evidence because they had been confronted with intercepted telephone messages. Messman and Garrow were parties to these messages, or some of them, but the petitioners were not. \n4\n The judge ordered all records and transcripts of intercepted messages suppressed as well as all evidence obtained as a result of such messages, but he refused to order suppression of the testimony of witnesses whose memories had been refreshed or aided thereby. He reserved to the trial final decision on so much of the motion \n\n[316 \nU.S. 114, 116]\n\u00a0\n as requested the suppression of testimony alleged to be the result of information derived from the messages.\n At the trial government witnesses testified that wire tapping had not furnished clues used in preparing the case. Messman and Garrow were permitted to testify to the facts of which they claimed to have knowledge, over the objection of petitioners. They did not refer to any intercepted messages or to their contents.\n The petitioners were convicted and the judgments were affirmed on appeal. \n5\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the convictions ought not to stand if either Messman or Garrow should not have been allowed to testify. It thought that the petitioners having proved divulgence by federal officers of the messages to the witnesses, the burden was upon the Government to prove that their testimony was not induced thereby; that the trial judge failed to find the wire tapping had not been a means of inducing them to testify, but found only that the petitioners had failed to prove it had been the means. In this situation the court was of opinion that if the admission of testimony induced by use of the messages was prohibited by the Communications Act, the judgments should be reversed. The court ruled, however, that, as the petitioners were not parties to any of the intercepted communications, they had no standing to object to their divulgence. In the alternative, it ruled that the testimony was not a divulgence within the meaning of  605, but, at most, the presentation in court of evidence procured through past divulgences. The court also overruled petitioners' contentions that they had been denied their full right of cross-examination at the preliminary hearing and that the charge to the jury was improper.\n We have considered all the assignments of error but find no substance in any of them save those which go to the admission of Messman's and Garrow's testimony. In \n\n[316 \nU.S. 114, 117]\n\u00a0\n briefs and oral argument the parties have labored the subject of the burden of proof at the preliminary hearing. The petitioners say it lay with the Government after a showing of wire tapping and divulgence; the respondent says it lay with the petitioners throughout. Each asserts the other failed to carry it. In our view, a decision upon the point is unnecessary.\n We come to the capital and pivotal question: Assuming the witnesses' testimony was induced by divulging to them the contents of intercepted telephone messages, was the admission of this testimony erroneous? We hold that it was not.\n The petitioners assert that  605 of the Federal Communications Act forbids the admission of evidence obtained by the use in advance of the trial of unlawfully intercepted telephone conversations, and that one who was not a party to such communications has standing to object to the admission of such evidence. They insist that the decisions of this court in Weiss v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 321\n, 60 S.Ct. 269, and Nardone v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 338\n, 60 S.Ct. 266, require us so to hold and that the court below, in ruling to the contrary, failed to follow those decisions.\n It may be helpful in the consideration of these contentions to quote the relevant portions of the statute and to recapitulate this court's decisions in cases involving the admission of evidence in alleged violation of its terms. The relevant provisions of the section declare that '... no person not being authorized by the sender shall intercept any communication and divulge or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of such intercepted communication to any person', and that 'no person having received such intercepted communication or having become acquainted with the contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of the same or any part thereof, knowing that such information was so obtained, shall divulge or publish the existence, con- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 114, 118]\n\u00a0\n tents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of the same or any part thereof, or use the same or any information therein contained for his own benefit or for the benefit of another not entitled thereto ....'\n In Nardone v. United States, \n302 \nU.S. 379\n, 58 S.Ct. 275, we held that the Government's introduction of transcripts and recordings of intercepted interstate messages in the trial of a criminal case constituted a divulgence of such messages contrary to the express terms of the statute.\n In Weiss v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 321\n, 60 S.Ct. 269, intrastate telephone communications were intercepted by federal agents, their contents were divulged to certain of the defendants, and, as a result these defendants confessed and agreed to turn state's evidence. They were permitted to testify to the contents of the messages. We held that the interdiction of the statute extended to the interception and divulgence of intrastate as well as interstate messages. In the light of the facts we denied the Government's claim that the witnesses' testifying to the contents of the messages amounted to an authorization by them, as senders, of the divulgence of the communications within the meaning of the statute.\n In Nardone v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 338\n, 60 S.Ct. 266, it was claimed that unlawfully intercepted messages had been used to obtain evidence against the senders, and that such use, and the introduction of the evidence so obtained, over the objection of the senders, who were defendants, constituted a violation of the purpose and policy of the statute. We held that if the facts sustained the claim the evidence should have been excluded, and we formulated a procedure for ascertaining the facts.\n In none of these cases did this court pass upon you question now presented. In the instant case, the witnesses who confessed and turned state's evidence did not testify either to the existence of the communications or to their contents. The contents of messages to some of \n\n[316 \nU.S. 114, 119]\n\u00a0\n which they were parties, but to which the petitioners were not parties, were used by the Government, as we assume, to persuade the witnesses to testify. We further assume that the interception and divulgence of the messages to these witnesses was unlawful because not authorized by the sender.\n The petitioners urge that our decision in Weiss v. United States, supra, necessarily involved the ruling that one who was not a party to the intercepted messages has standing to object to their divulgence at the trial, and, in view of our application of the statute in Nardone v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 338\n, 60 S.Ct. 266, he has standing to object to testimony induced as a result of unlawful interception and use of the messages.\n The question now presented was not decided in Weiss v. United States, supra. The charge was conspiracy. Goldstein, who was not a participant, and other defendants who were participants, in the intercepted conversations, were tried together. All objected to testimony respecting the conversations. We held the evidence inadmissible. The fact that Goldstein was not a party to the communications, was not overlooked. In the opinion rendered by the Circuit Court of Appeals it was held that the fact could not sustain his conviction if the messages were erroneously introduced. \n6\n This court assumed, in deciding the case, that the Circuit Court of Appeals was right in holding that, if the admission of the evidence was wrong as to the other defendants, the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 114, 120]\n\u00a0\n judgment ought to be reversed as to all. And the Circuit Court of Appeals was of opinion in the present case that, in the circumstances, the messages could not have been used in the Weiss case against one of the defendants and excluded as to the others with any reasonable expectation that prejudice would not have resulted to the defendants as to whom the admission of the messages would have been error. \n7\n In this view we concur.\n None of the petitioners was a party to the communications used in obtaining the evidence in this case. No prejudice, therefore, could result by reason of the difficulty of nullifying the effect upon some defendants of evidence incompetent as to them but competent as against other defendants.\n It has long been settled that evidence obtained in violation of the prohibition of the Fourth Amendment cannot be used in a prosecution against the victim of the unlawful search and seizure if he makes timely objection. \n8\n This, for the reason that otherwise the policy and purpose of the amendment might be thwarted. And we have further held that the policy underlying the amendment cannot be circumvented by the direct use against the victim of evidence so obtained. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n Although the unlawful interception of a telephone communication does not amount to a search or seizure prohibited by the Fourth Amendment,10 we have applied the same policy in respect of the prohibitions of the Federal Communications Act at the instance of the sender of the message against whom evidence derived from its unlawful interception is sought to be introduced. Nardone v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 338\n, 60 S.Ct. 266. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 114, 121]\n\u00a0\n The question now to be decided is whether we shall extend the sanction for violation of the Communications Act so as to make available to one not a party to the intercepted communication the objection that its use outside the courtroom, and prior to the trial, induced evidence which, except for that use, would be admissible.\n No court has ever gone so far in applying the implied sanction for violation of the Fourth Amendment. While this court has never been called upon to decide the point,11 the federal courts in numerous cases, and with unanimity, have denied standing to one not the victim of an unconstitutional search and seizure to object to the introduction in evidence of that which was seized. \n12\n A fortiori the same rule should apply to the introduction of evidence induced by the use or disclosure thereof to a witness other than the victim of the seizure. We think no broader sanction should be imposed upon the Government in respect of violations of the Communications Act. The court below was of the view that a divulgence of the intercepted messages might lawfully be made with the consent of the sender, and we agree. The court further thought that, as the sender might make such divulgence lawful by his consent, none but he was intended to be protected against divulgence by the statute. \n13\n Again we agree. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 114, 122]\n\u00a0\n The petitioners, however, point out that the statute also forbids the use of an unlawfully intercepted message, or any information therein contained, by any person for his own benefit or the benefit of another not entitled thereto; and they say that the Government officials violated the Act by using the messages and the information they contained, to induce the senders' confessions and testimony. They urge that such use is forbidden by the Act and that they have standing to object to the introduction of the evidence thus obtained. The Government answers that this provision of the Act was not intended to reach the use of the contents of the messages by federal officers for obtaining evidence but was meant to prevent use for the personal advantage or benefit of the user. We have no occasion to determine the soundness of the Government's argument.\n We are of opinion that even though the use made of the communications by the prosecuting officers to induce the parties to them to testify were held a violation of the statute, this would not render the testimony so procured inadmissible against a person not a party to the message. This is the settled common law rule. \n14\n There was no use at the trial of the intercepted communications, or of any information they contained as such. If such use as occurred here is a violation of the Act, the statute itself imposes a sanction. \n 15\n\u00a0\n\n The judgments are\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice JACKSON took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY, dissenting.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, and I cannot agree with the opinion of the Court. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 114, 123]\n\u00a0\n Messman and Garrow were the chief witnesses for the Government, and the testimony of each was vital. It is not disputed that Messman turned state's evidence after he was confronted with the contents of telephone messages which implicated him in the offense but which had been obtained by wire-tapping in violation of  605 of the Federal Communications Act. The extent of the unlawful 'tapping' and the keen desire of the Government officials to use the 'taps' to secure other testimony are graphically illustrated by the following statement made by an assistant United States attorney to Messman after his arrest: 'I am telling you before we go any further that there is no use of us kidding each other. We have watched your telephone; we have watched all these lawyers' telephones; we have had rooms tapped. We know what is going on. We are not stabbing in the dark. If you want to hear your voice on a record we will be glad to play it. In your instance, Doctor, there is so much to cover. You have been in this for so many years that we feel that in order for you to help yourself, since you are considered one of the principals here, it would be wise for you to indicate to us whether you intend to tell us everything and come clean, or whether you intend to play ball with the Garrows and the rest of the crowd. We feel that you can be of great value and you want to help yourself. That is straight talk.' And Garrow knew of the existence of records of damaging conversations made by illegal 'taps' on his lines before his decision to testify for the Government.\n Neither the intercepted messages nor their purport were placed in evidence, and, so far as the record shows, petitioners were not parties to them. It is evident, nevertheless, that the evidence adduced by the Government against petitioners through the testimony of Messman and Gar- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 114, 124]\n\u00a0\n row was obtained by the use of information gathered by wire-tapping in violation of law. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The main question presented for decision is whether evidence so obtained is vitiated and rendered inadmissible by  605, the relevant part of which reads:\n'... and no person not being authorized by the sender shall intercept any communication and divulge or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of such intercepted communication to any person; ... and no person having received such intercepted communi- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 114, 125]\n\u00a0\n cation or having become acquainted with the contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of the same or any part thereof, knowing that such information was so obtained, shall divulge or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of the same or any part thereof, or use the same or any information therein contained for his own benefit or for the benefit of another not entitled thereto ....'2\n\n The statute expresses a rule of public policy. In enacting  605 Congress sought to protect society at large against the evils of wire- tapping and kindred unauthorized intrusions into private intercourse conducted by means of the modern media of communication, telephone, telegraph, and radio. To that end the statute prohibits not only the interception and the divulgence of private messages without the consent of the sender, but also the use of information so acquired by any person not entitled to it. The protection of the statute would have been illusory indeed if, while interception and divulgence were penalized, one was free, nevertheless, to use information so obtained. Unless the language of the 'use for benefit' prohibition does not mean what it says, the actions of the Government agents in securing the benefit of the crucial testimony of Messman and Garrow by the use of illegal 'taps' were clear violations of that prohibition. There is no merit in the Government's contention that the unequivocal language of the 'use for benefit' clause should be construed as condemning only such uses as are designed to result in some monetary or other similar benefit of a private nature, for the prohibitions of  605 are applicable to the Government and its officers, as well as to private persons. Nardone v. United States, \n302 \nU.S. 379\n, 58 S.Ct. 275. The prohibition in this last clause of  605 by Congress of the 'use' of outlawed evidence is so unequivocal \n\n[316 \nU.S. 114, 126]\n\u00a0\n and controlling that failure of the court below even to refer to this clause can only be explained on the assumption that it was overlooked.\n On the issue of admissibility the second Nardone case, \n308 \nU.S. 338\n, 60 S.Ct. 266, the logical extension of the principles of Nardone v. United States, \n302 \nU.S. 379\n, 58 S.Ct. 275, and Weiss v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 321\n, 60 S.Ct. 269, should control our decision. In that case, as in this, the evidence in dispute was not the messages themselves or their purport, but the claim was made that other evidence against the defendants was obtained by the use of information gained by unlawful wire-tapping. We held that the policy of $ 605 required the exclusion not merely of the intercepted messages but also of the other evidence acquired through their unlawful use. Otherwise the broad purpose of the statute to outlaw practices 'inconsistent with ethical standards and destructive of personal liberty'3 would have been largely defeated. We also suggested the preliminary hearing as a procedure for determining what evidence was the 'fruit of the poisonous tree' and hence inadmissible. Since the preliminary hearing in this case leaves no doubt that the testimony of Messman and Garrow was the forbidden fruit, it should not have been admitted.\n The only possible differentiation between this case and the second Nardone case is that here petitioners were not parties to the illegally intercepted messages, but that calls for no difference in legal result. While the sender can render interception, divulgence, or use lawful by his consent, it is a complete non-sequitur to conclude that he alone has standing to object to the admission of evidence obtained in violation of  605. To say that petitioners have no standing to object to the testimony of Messman and Garrow because they were not parties to the inter- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 114, 127]\n\u00a0\n cepted messages used to secure that testimony, is to ignore the governing factor that controlled our decision in the second Nardone case, namely, that to permit the use of evidence so obtained would defeat or substantially impair the underlying policy and purpose of  605. It is immaterial, for the object to be served by that section, whether objection is made by the one sending the communication or by another who is prejudiced by its use. The rule that evidence obtained by a violation of  605 is inadmissible is not a remedy for the sender; it is the obedient answer to the Congressional command that society shall not be plagued with such practices as wire-tapping.\n Lower federal court cases to the effect that only the victim of a search and seizure contravening the Fourth Amendment can object to the evidence thereby obtained do not offer a proper analogy. Not only are those decisions hard to square with statements by Mr. Justice Holmes in Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 385, 392\n, 40 S.Ct. 182, 183,4 but, even assuming their soundness, sufficient difference in scope exists between  605 and the Fourth Amendment to render analogy unsafe. Thus  605 forbids all interception, divulgence, or use by any \n\n[316 \nU.S. 114, 128]\n\u00a0\n person without the consent of the sender, while the Fourth Amendment bans only unreasonable searches and seizures.\n The holding in the opinion of the Court that evidence obtained in violation of  605 is not rendered inadmissible because  501 of the Act provides specific sanctions for violations of  605, is a direct repudiation of both Nardone cases and the Weiss case. In each of those cases evidence secured by violation of  605 was declared to be inadmissible, despite the existence of  501. This is so because, as we held in the first Nardone case, 'the act forbids such testimony.' \n302 \nU.S. 379, 382\n, 58 S.Ct. 275. That evidence procured in violation of federal law by agents of the Government is inadmissible in federal prosecutions has been established and enforced by an unbroken series of decisions in this Court beginning with Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383\n, 34 S.Ct. 341. By these decisions this Court has refused to make itself a participant in lawless conduct by sanctioning the use in open court of evidence illegally secured. That principle was forcibly put in a separate opinion in Sorrells v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 435, 453\n, 53 S.Ct. 210, 216, 217, 86 A.L.R. 249. After referring to 'the inherent right of the court not to be made the instrument of wrong', the opinion continues: 'The doctrine (the defense of entrapment) rests, rather, on a fundamental rule of public policy. The protection of its own functions and the preservation of the purity of its own temple belongs only to the court. It is the province of the court and the court alone to protect itself and the government from such prostitution of the criminal law.' \n287 \nU.S. 435, 456\n, 457 S., 53 S.Ct. 210, 218, 86 A.L.R. 249. When Congress condemned the 'use' of lawlessly intercepted communications, the last thing it intended to sanction was the use of such interceptions in a court of justice. There can be no reason to ignore or silently overrule our considered decisions in both Nardone cases and the Weiss case, especially in view of the fact that Congress has had several opportunities since the first Nardone case to amend  605 \n\n[316 \nU.S. 114, 129]\n\u00a0\n to obviate the result of that case if it were not a true interpretation of Congressional policy and intent. \n5\n\u00a0\n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of June 19, 1934, c. 652, 48 Stat. 1064, 1103, 47 U.S.C.  605, 47 U.S.C.A.  605. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Criminal Code  215, 18 U.S.C.  338, 18 U.S.C.A.  338. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Criminal Code  37, 18 U.S.C.  88, 18 U.S.C.A.  88. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] It is said that petitioners have now discovered that Goldstein was a participant in twelve of the intercepted telephone conversations, but it is admitted that the record does not disclose this fact and there is no allegation that any of the twelve communications were used in obtaining the confessions. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] 2 Cir., 120 F.2d 485. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] 'It may be said with some plausibility that the defendant Goldstein was not prejudiced since he was neither a party to, nor mentioned in, the conversations obtained through wire tapping.

We do not understand that the trial judge, in ruling that the testimony of Messman and Garrow was admissible, meant to find that the Government proved that the 'taps' did not contribute to their breakdown. On the contrary, it is clear that he meant to find only that petitioners failed to carry the burden of proving that the Government secured the testimony of Messman and Garrow by use of the 'taps', a burden which he erroneously put upon petitioners. For after an accused sustains the initial burden, imposed by Nardone v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 338\n, 60 S.Ct. 266, of proving to the satisfaction of the trial judge in the preliminary hearing that wire-tapping was unlawfully employed, as petitioners did here, it is only fair that the burden should then shift to the Government to convince the trial judge that its proof had an independent origin. As the court below said: '... this should be the rule in analogy to the well settled doctrine in civil cases that a wrongdoer who has mingled the consequences of lawful and unlawful conduct, has the burden of disentangling them and must bear the prejudice of his failure to do so; that is, that it is unfair to throw upon the innocent party the duty of unravelling the skein which the guilty party has snarled. To impose the duty upon the prosecution is particularly appropriate here, for it necessarily has full knowledge of just how its case has been prepared; given a prima facie case against it, i.e., 'taps' and some use of them, it should do the rest.' 2 Cir., 120 F.2d 485, 488. Since the trial judge did not shift the burden to the Government after petitioners' initial showing as he should have done, there can be no contention on this record that the testimony of Messman and Garrow was untainted by 'taps'. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Emphasis added. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Nardone v.

Grau v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 124, 128\n, 53 S.Ct. 38, 40, and cases cited.\n It is evident that to allow the Government to use evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment against parties not victims of the unconstitutional search and seizure is to allow the Government to profit by its wrong and to reduce in large measure the protection of the Amendment. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Several attempts to amend  605 since the first Nardone case have failed of enactment.

WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY(1942)\nNo. 711\nArgued: April 2, 1942Decided: April 27, 1942\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied May 25, 1942\n\n\n See \n316 \nU.S. 711\n, 62 S.Ct. 1272, 86 L.Ed. --.\n Mr. William E. Kemp, of Kansas City, Mo., for petitioners.\n Mr. George Wharton Pepper, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent brought this suit in the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri, to restrain the assessment and collection of a tax upon its real estate. The validity of the provisions of the state constitution and statutes under which the tax was laid was assailed on the ground that \n\n[316 \nU.S. 98, 99]\n\u00a0\n they violate the tax-exemption provision of respondent's charter and therefore conflict with the contract clause of the Constitution, Article I ,  10. The Supreme Court of Missouri affirmed the judgment of the trial court enjoining collection of the tax. 153 S.W.2d 35. Both courts held that the Missouri constitution and statutes as applied violate respondent's charter provisions for tax exemption, and infringe the contract clause of the Constitution. Cf. Washington University v. Rouse, 8 Wall. 439; Washington University v. Baumann, 341 Mo. 708, 108 S.W.2d 403. We granted a writ of certiorari, \n314 \nU.S. 604\n, 62 S.Ct. 301, 86 L.Ed. --, to review the constitutional question decided by the state court.\n Upon examination of the record it appears that the decision and judgment brought here for review were rendered by Division One of the Supreme Court of Missouri, which consists of four of the seven judges of the court. It does not appear that the judgment thus rendered has been reviewed by the Supreme Court sitting en banc or that petitioners have made application, as they could have done under  4 of the 1890 amendments to Article VI of the state constitution, to transfer the cause to the full court for review. The question thus arises whether we have jurisdiction under  237(b) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  344(b), which restricts our authority to review decisions of state courts to those causes wherein a judgment has been rendered 'by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had'.\n Section 1 of the 1890 amendments to Article VI of the Missouri constitution provides that the Supreme Court shall consist of seven judges and 'shall be divided into two divisions', one of four and the other of three judges. It directs that a division shall sit separately for the hearing and disposition of causes and shall have concurrent jurisdiction of all matters and causes in the Supreme Court, except that Division Two shall have exclusive cog- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 98, 100]\n\u00a0\n nizance of criminal causes, and that the 'judgments and decrees of either division, as to causes and matters pending before it, shall have the force and effect of those of the court'.\n But  1 also contains a proviso that a cause pending in a division may be transferred to the court as provided in  4. Section 4 reads as follows:\n'When the judges of a division are equally divided in opinion in a cause, or when a judge of a division dissents from the opinion therein, or when a federal question is involved, the cause, on the application of the losing party, shall be transferred to the court for its decision; ....'\n\n And Rule 24 of the Rules of The Supreme Court of Missouri authorizes the transfer by motion of a cause pursuant to the provisions of the constitution, 'from either division to Court En Banc' 'after final disposition of the cause by the division'.\n Under these provisions Division One of the Supreme Court of Missouri, sitting in the present cause, in which 'a federal question is involved', was not the last state court in which a decision of that question could be had. Such a case is one which 'after final disposition of the cause by the division' could on petitioners' application be transferred to the full court for review, and the decision and judgment rendered by Division One could be set aside by the court sitting en banc. Since the constitution of Missouri has thus provided in this class of cases for review of the judgment of a division, the judgment here of Division One is not that of the 'highest court of a State in which a decision could be had' within the meaning of  237(b) of the Judicial Code.\n It was the purpose of the Judiciary Act of February 13, 1925, as well as that of all its predecessors, that no decision of a state court should be brought here for review either by appeal or certiorari until the possibilities afforded by state procedure for its review by all state tribunals have \n\n[316 \nU.S. 98, 101]\n\u00a0\n been exhausted. Fisher v. Perkins, \n122 \nU.S. 522\n, 7 S.Ct. 1227; McComb v. County Commissioners, \n91 \nU.S. 1\n, 2; McMaster v. Gould, \n276 \nU.S. 284\n, 48 S.Ct. 299; Southern Electric Co. v.

Burnham, \n162 \nU.S. 339\n, 16 S.Ct. 850. Hence it is the last state tribunal-here the court en banc-to which the cause could be brought for review which is the 'highest court of a State in which a decision could be had' within the meaning of the jurisdictional statute, regardless of the particular description or designation which may be applied to it by state statutes.\n Upon application to this Court for review of the judgment of a state court it is the petitioner's burden to show affirmatively that we have jurisdiction. Memphis Natural Gas Co. v. Beeler, \n315 \nU.S. 649\n, 62 S.Ct. 857, 86 L.Ed. --. As the record fails to disclose that the judgment, review of which is now sought, is that of the highest court of the state in which a decision could be had, we are without jurisdiction and the writ must be\n Dismissed. \n\n\n\n","45":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGRAVES v. SCHMIDLAPP(1942)\nNo. 604\nArgued: March 12, 1942Decided: March 30, 1942\n\n\n\n\n[315 \nU.S. 657, 658]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Mortimer M. Kassell, of Albany, N.Y., for petitioners.\n Mr. Thomas A. Ryan, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We are asked to say whether the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment precludes New York from taxing the exercise, by a domiciled resident, of a general testamentary power of appointment of which he was the donee under the will of a resident of Massachusetts, the property appointed being intangibles held by trustees under the donor's will.\n Respondents' decedent died a resident of New York, where his will was probated and letters testamentary were issued. Decedent's father had previously died a resident of Massachusetts, where his will had been probated. By his will the father bequeathed his residuary estate in trust to divide the trust fund into as many shares as he should leave children surviving. To his son, the New York decedent, he gave a life estate in one share and a general power to dispose of that share 'by will'.\n The son was also one of the three testamentary trustees. For some years they managed the trust property as a single trust fund, but in 1911 his one-third share was seg- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 657, 659]\n\u00a0\n regated and he was permitted by the other trustees to manage it as a separate trust, although all continued as trustees and as such accounted to the Massachusetts Probate Court for the administration of his share of the fund. From 1918 to 1929 the New York decedent resided in New York; from then until 1934 he resided in Illinois, when he returned to New York where he resided until his death in 1937. Throughout he kept in the state of his residence the paper evidences of the intangibles comprising his share of the trust. At the time of his death it consisted wholly of receivables and corporate stocks and bonds. By his will decedent appointed his share of the trust fund to his widow, and the New York tax authorities in computing the tax included in the decedent's gross estate the intangibles bequeathed to her under the power.\n Article 10-C of the New York Tax Law, Consol.Laws N.Y. c. 60, by  249-n, imposes an estate tax 'upon the transfer of the net estate' of resident decedents. Under this statute the net taxable estate is arrived at by deducting from the gross estate, as defined by  249-r, the specified deductions allowed by  249-s. Section 249-r, so far as relevant, provides:\n'The value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time of his death of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated ...\n\n'7. To the extent of any property passing under a general power of appointment exercised by the decedent (a) by will ....'\n\n An order of the New York Surrogate's Court, In re Thayer's Estate, 172 Misc. 426, 15 N.Y.S.2d 208, reduced the estate tax assessed against the decedent's estate by excluding from his gross estate the share of the trust fund passing to the widow by the exercise of the power, on the ground that the state was without constitutional authority to tax the exercise by a resident donee of a power of appointment created by a \n\n[315 \nU.S. 657, 660]\n\u00a0\n non-resident donor, citing Wachovia Bank & Trust Co. v. Doughton, \n272 \nU.S. 567\n, 47 S.Ct. 202. The New York Court of Appeals affirmed the order without opinion, In re Thayer's Estate, 286 N.Y. 596, 35 N.E.2d 937, but certified by its remittitur that it held that the taxing statute as sought to be applied in this proceeding violates the Fourteenth Amendment. We granted certiorari, \n314 \nU.S. 601\n, 62 S.Ct. 135, 86 L.Ed. --, because of the importance of the question presented.\n For purposes of estate and inheritance taxation the power to dispose of property at death is the equivalent of ownership. Bullen v. Wisconsin, \n240 \nU.S. 625\n, 36 S.Ct. 473; Whitney v. State Tax Comm. of New York, \n309 \nU.S. 530, 538\n, 60 S.Ct. 635, 638; see Gray, Rule Against Perpetuities, 3d ed. 1916,  524. It is a potential source of wealth to the appointee. The disposition of wealth effected by its exercise or relinquishment at death is one form of the enjoyment of wealth and is an appropriate subject of taxation. The power to tax 'is an incident of sovereignty, and is co-extensive with that to which it is an incident. All subjects over which the sovereign power of a State extends, are objects of taxation'. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 429. Intangibles, which are legal relationships between persons and which in fact have no geographical location, are so associated with the owner that they and their transfer at death are taxable at the place of his domicile where his person and the exercise of his property rights are subject to the control of the sovereign power. His transfer of interests in intangibles, by virtue of the exercise of a donated power instead of that derived from ownership, stands on the same footing. In both cases the sovereign's control over his person and estate at the place of his domicile and his duty to contribute to the financial support of government there, afford adequate constitutional basis for the imposition of a tax. Curry v. McCanless, \n307 \nU.S. 357\n, 59 S.Ct. 900, 123 A.L.R. 162; cf. Graves v. Elliott, \n307 \nU.S. 383\n, 59 S.Ct. 913. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 657, 661]\n\u00a0\n These were not novel propositions, when they were restated in the McCanless and Elliott cases,1 and they were challenged then, though unsuccessfully, only on the ground that the transfer of the intangibles was subject to taxation in another state where they were held in trust. But the contention that the due process clause forecloses taxation of an interest in intangibles by the state of its owner when they are held in trust in another state was rejected in Bullen v. Wisconsin, supra. In that case a fund had been given in trust reserving to the donor a general power of revocation and the disposition of the trust income during life. This Court held that upon his death an inheritance tax could be levied by the state of his domicile although the trustee and the trust fund were outside the state.\n In numerous other cases the jurisdiction to tax the use and enjoyment of interests in intangibles regardless of the location of the paper evidences of them, has been thought to depend on no factor other than the domicile of the owner within the taxing state. And it has been held that they may be constitutionally taxed there even though in some instances they may be subject to taxation in other jurisdictions, to whose control they are subject and whose legal protection they enjoy. \n2\n And such interests taxable \n\n[315 \nU.S. 657, 662]\n\u00a0\n at the domicile of the owner have been deemed to include the exercise or relinquishment of a power to dispose of intangibles. Chanler v. Kelsey, \n205 \nU.S. 466\n, 27 S.Ct. 550; Bullen v. Wisconsin, supra; cf. Orr v. Gilman, \n183 \nU.S. 278\n, 22 S.Ct. 213; Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, \n276 \nU.S. 260\n, 48 S.Ct. 225.\n Decedent's complete and exclusive power to dispose of the intangibles at death was property in his hands in New York, where he was domiciled. Graves v. Elliott, supra. He there made effective use of the power to bestow his bounty on the widow. Its exercise by his will to make a gift was as much an enjoyment of a property right as would have been a like bequest to his widow from his own securities. See Helvering v. Horst, \n311 \nU.S. 112, 117\n, 61 S.Ct. 144, 147, 131 A.L.R. 655. For such enjoyment of property rights, through resort to New York law, decedent was under the highest obligation to contribute to the support of the government whose protection he enjoyed in common with other residents. Taxation of such enjoyment of the power to dispose of property is as much within the constitutional power of the state of his domicile as is the taxation of the transfer at death of intangibles which he owns.\n Since it is the exercise of the power to dispose of the intangibles which is the taxable event, the mere fact that the power was acquired as a donation from another is without significance. We can perceive no ground for saying that its exercise by the donee is for that reason any the less the enjoyment of a property right, or any the less subject to taxation at his domicile. The source of the power by gift no more takes its exercise by the donee out of the taxing power than the like disposition of a chose in action \n\n[315 \nU.S. 657, 663]\n\u00a0\n or a share of stock, ownership of which is acquired by gift.\n But respondents argue that because here the power was bequeathed by a Massachusetts will, which placed the intangibles subject to the power in a Massachusetts trust, there was nothing within the jurisdiction or control of New York which could be deemed subject to its taxing power. If by this is meant that the power was ineffective because its exercise by the New York will did not conform to the requirements of the will creating the power and defining the manner of its exercise, or to the laws of Massachusetts governing the disposition of intangibles, no such question is before us. We must take it that the New York courts assumed, as we do, that the power had been so exercised by the New York will as to confer on the widow the right to demand the property of the trustees in Massachusetts, and that even upon that assumption they held that the exercise of the power in New York could not constitutionally be taxed.\n Whether the New York tax statute would apply if the New York will were ineffective to transfer the intangibles because it failed to comply with the requirements of the Massachusetts will or statutes, is for the New York courts to decide. Whether in such a case the statute could be constitutionally so applied is a question not presented by the record. But if, as is assumed, the power has been effectively exercised, the New York will is the implement of its exercise, made effective as a will by New York law whose aid the decedent invoked for the exercise and enjoyment of the property right conferred on him by the Massachusetts will. Its exercise is a subject over which the sovereign power of taxation extends.\n Admittedly, under prevailing notions of choice of law in the courts of these two states, the law of the doner's domicile, here Massachusetts, may be looked to in New \n\n[315 \nU.S. 657, 664]\n\u00a0\n York in determining whether, in some respects at least, there has been a valid and effective execution of the power of appointment. Sewall v. Wilmer, 132 Mass. 131; Hogarth-Swann v. Weed, 274 Mass. 125, 130, 174 N.E. 314; Hillen v. Iselin, 144 N.Y. 365, 378, 39 N.E. 368; In re New York Life Ins. & Trust Co., 209 N.Y. 585, 103 N.E. 315. But a transfer which has in fact been effected by recourse in part to the law of New York is not free of taxation there because the power might have been exercised elsewhere or by some other mode, or because it may be necessary for the transferee to invoke the laws of Massachusetts in order to acquire control of the property. A transfer in one state of a chose in action or a share of stock may be taxed there even though the transferee in order to enjoy its benefits must depend in part upon the law of the state of the debtor or of the corporation. Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1\n, 10-17, 48 S.Ct. 410, 413-416. Here the relationship of the power to Massachusetts does not leave New York without sufficient control over the donee and his exercise of the power to support its constitutional authority to tax. For the fact remains that he as a resident, enjoying the protection of New York's laws and owing to it the duty of financial support, has disposed of wealth by a will executed and probated in New York with the same result as if he had owned the property. This transmission of wealth at death by a resident is not a forbidden source of revenue to the state.\n Wachovia Bank & Trust Co. v. Doughton, supra, on which respondents rely, denied the constitutional power of a state to tax the effective exercise of a testamentary power in circumstances like the present. The only grounds for the decision were that the intangibles held in trust in another state, which were the subject of the power, had no situs in the state where the domiciled testator had exercised the power by his will; that its exercise was subject to the laws \n\n[315 \nU.S. 657, 665]\n\u00a0\n of Massachusetts where the will donating the power and establishing the trust had been probated, and that no 'right' exercised by the donee was conferred by the state of his domicile where it was exercised.\n The conclusion there reached and the reasons advanced in its support cannot be reconciled with the decision and the reasoning of the Bullen, the McCanless and the Elliott cases. It is plain that if appropriate emphasis be placed on the orderly administration of justice rather than blind adherence to conflicting precedents, the Wachovia case must be overruled. There is no reason why the state should continue to be deprived of revenue from a subject which from the beginning has been within the reach of its taxing power; a subject over which we cannot say the state's control has been curtailed by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. No interest which could be served by so rigid an adherence to stare decisis is superior to the demands of a system of justice based on a considered and a consistent application of the Constitution. See Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., \n285 \nU.S. 393\n, 406, footnote 1, 52 S.Ct. 443, 447; and cf. Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corporation, \n303 \nU.S. 376, 387\n, 58 S.Ct. 623, 628. The Wachovia case should be and now is overruled and the constitutional power of New York to levy the present tax is sustained.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS concurs in the result only because he considers himself bound by the decisions in Curry v. McCanless, \n307 \nU.S. 357\n, 59 S. Ct. 900, 123 A.L.R. 162 and Graves v. Elliott, \n307 \nU.S. 383\n, 59 S.Ct. 913. Otherwise he would vote to affirm. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Orr v.

Dorety, of St. Paul, Minn., for petitioner.[ Great Northern R. Co. v. U. S. \n315 \nU.S. 262\n (1942) ]\n\n\n[315 \nU.S. 262, 266]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Vernon L. Wilkinson, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[315 \nU.S. 262, 270]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We are asked to decide whether petitioner has any right to the oil and minerals underlying its right of way acquired under the general right of way statute, Act of March 3, 1875, c. 152, 18 Stat. 482, 43 U.S.C.A.  934-939.\n The United States instituted this suit to enjoin petitioner from drilling for or removing gas, oil and other minerals so situated, and alleged in its complaint substantially that petitioner, in 1907, acquired from the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway all of the latter's property, including rights of way granted it under the Act of March 3, 1875, a portion of which crosses Glacier County, Montana; that petitioner acquired neither the right to use any portion of such right of way for the purpose of drilling for or removing subsurface oil and minerals, nor any right, title or interest in or to the deposits underlying the right of way, but that the oil and minerals remained the property of the United States; and, that although no lease had been issued to petitioner under the Act of May 21, 1930, 46 Stat. 373, 30 U.S.C.A.  301-306, petitioner claimed ownership of the oil and minerals underlying its right of way and threatened to use the right of way to drill for and remove subsurface oil.\n Petitioner admitted certain allegations of fact, denied the allegation that title to the oil and minerals was in the United States, and asserted that it proposed to drill three separate oil wells-the oil from the first to be sold commercially, that from the second to be refined, the more volatile parts to be sold and the residue to be used on petitioner's locomotives, and that from the third to be used in its entirety by petitioner as fuel.\n Pursuant to a motion therefor by the United States, judgment was rendered on the pleadings and petitioner was enjoined from 'using the right of way granted under \n\n[315 \nU.S. 262, 271]\n\u00a0\n the Act of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. 482, for the purpose of drilling for or removing oil, gas and minerals underlying the right of way'. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 9 Cir., 119 F.2d 821. The importance of the question and an asserted conflict with Rio Grande Western R. Co. v. Stringham, \n239 \nU.S. 44\n, 36 S.Ct. 5, moved us to grant certiorari. \n314 \nU.S. 596\n, 62 S.Ct. 69, 86 L.Ed. --.\n The Act of March 3, 1875, from which petitioner's rights stem, clearly grants only an easement, and not a fee. Section 1 indicates that the right is one of passage since it grants 'the', not a, 'right of way through the public lands of the United States'. Section 2 adds to the conclusion that the right granted is one of use and occupancy only, rather than the land itself, for it declares that any railroad whose right of way passes through a canyon, pass or defile 'shall not prevent any other railroad company from the use and occupancy of said cayon, pass, or defile, for the purposes of its road, in common with the road first located'.1\n Section 4 is especially persuasive. It requires the location of each right of way to be noted on the plats in the local land office, and 'thereafter all such lands over which such right of way shall pass shall be disposed of subject to such right of way'.2 This reserved right to dispose of the lands subject to the right of way is wholly inconsistent with the grant of a fee. As the court below pointed out, 'Apter words to indicate the intent to convey an easement would be difficult to find' (119 F.2d 825). That this was the precise intent of Section 4 is clear from its legislative history. \n3\n While Section 4 pro- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 262, 272]\n\u00a0\n vides a method for securing the benefits of the Act in advance of construction,4 no adequate reason is advanced for believing that it does not illumine the nature of the right granted. The Act is to be interpreted as a harmonious whole.\n The Act is to be liberally construed to carry out its purposes. United States v. Denver, etc., Railway Co., \n150 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 14 S.Ct. 11, 15; Nadeau v. Union Pacific R. Co., \n253 \nU.S. 442\n, 40 S.Ct. 570; Great Northern R. Co. v. Steinke, \n261 \nU.S. 119\n, 43 S. Ct. 316. But the Act is also subject to the general rule of construction that any ambiguity in a grant is to be resolved favorably to a sovereign grantor-' nothing passes but what is conveyed in clear and explicit language'-Caldwell v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 14, 20\n, 21 S., 39 S.Ct. 397, 398, and cases cited. Cf. Great Northern R. Co. v. Steinke, supra. Plainly there is nothing in the Act which may be characterized as a 'clear and explicit' conveyance of the underlying oil and minerals. The Act was designed to permit the construction of railroads through the public lands and thus enhance their value and hasten their settlement. The achievement of that purpose does not compel a construction of the right of way grant as conveying a fee title to the land and the underlying minerals; a railroad may be operated though its right of way be but an easement. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[315 \nU.S. 262, 273]\n\u00a0\n But were are not limited to the lifeless words of the statute and formalistic canons of construction in our search for the intent of Congress. The Act was the product of a period, and, 'courts, in construing a statute, may with propriety recur to the history of the times when it was passed'. United States v. Union Pacific R. Co., \n91 \nU.S. 72\n, 79. And see Winona & St. Peter R. Co. v. Barney, \n113 \nU.S. 618, 625\n, 5 S.Ct. 606, 609; Smith v. Townsend, \n148 \nU.S. 490, 494\n, 13 S. Ct. 634, 635; United States v. Denver, etc., Railway Co., \n150 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 14 S.Ct. 11, 15.\n Beginning in 1850 Congress embarked on a policy of subsidizing railroad construction by lavish grants from the public domain. \n6\n This policy incurred great public disfavor7 which was crystallized in the following resolution adopted by the House of Representatives on March 11, 1872:\n'Resolved, that in the judgment of this House the policy of granting subsidies in public lands to railroads and \n\n[315 \nU.S. 262, 274]\n\u00a0\n other corporations ought to be discontinued, and that every consideration of public policy and equal justice to the whole people requires that the public lands should be held for the purpose of securing homesteads to actual settlers, and for educational purposes, as may be provided by law.' Cong.Globe, 42d Cong., 2d Sess., 1585 (1872).\n\n After 1871 outright grants of public lands to private railroad companies seem to have been discontinued. \n8\n But, to encourage development of the Western vastnesses, Congress had to grant rights to lay track across the public domain, rights which could not be secured against the sovereign by eminent domain proceedings or adverse user. For a time special acts were passed granting to designated railroads simply 'the right of way' through the public lands of the United States. \n9\n That those acts were not intended to convey and land is inferable from remarks in Congress by those sponsoring the measures. For example, in reporting a bill granting a right of way to the Dakota Grand Trunk Railway (17 Stat. 202), the committee chairman said: 'This is merely a grant of the right of way'.10 Likewise, in reporting a right of way bill for the New Mexico and Gulf Railway Company (17 Stat. 343), Mr. Townsend of Pennsylvania, the same Congressman who sponsored the Act of 1875, observed: 'It is nothing but a grant of the right of way.' \n11\n\u00a0\n\n[315 \nU.S. 262, 275]\n\u00a0\n The burden of this special legislation moved Congress to adopt the general right of way statute now before this Court. Since it was a product of the sharp change in Congressional policy with respect to railroad grants after 1871, it is improbable that Congress intended by it to grant more than a right of passage, let alone mineral riches. The presence in the Act of Section 4, which, as has been pointed out above, is so inconsistent with the grant of a fee, strongly indicates that Congress was carrying into effect its changed policy regarding railroad grants. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n Also pertinent to the construction of the Act is the contemporaneous administrative interpretation placed on it by those charged with its execution. Cf. United States v. Johnston, \n124 \nU.S. 236, 253\n, 8 S.Ct. 446, 454; United States v. Moore, \n95 \nU.S. 760\n, 763; Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co. v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 294, 315\n, 53 S. Ct. 350, 358. The first such interpretation, the general right of way circular of January 13, 1888, was that the Act granted an easement, not a fee. \n13\n The same position was taken in the regulations of March 21, 1892, 14 L.D. 338, and those of November 4, 1898, 27 L.D. 663. While the first of these circulars followed the Act by 13 years, the weight to be accorded them is not dependent on strict contemporaneity. Cf. Swendig v. Washington Water Power Co., \n265 \nU.S. 322\n, 44 S.Ct. 496. This early administrative gloss received indirect Congressional approval when Congress repeated the language of the Act in granting canal and reservoir companies rights of way by the Act of March 3, 1891, c. 561, 26 Stat. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 262, 276]\n\u00a0\n 1101, 43 U.S.C.A.  946, and when Congress made the Act of 1875 partially applicable to the Colville Indian Reservation by Act of March 6, 1896, c. 42, 29 Stat. 44. Cf. National Lead Co. v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 140, 146\n, 40 S.Ct. 237, 239.\n The circular of February 11, 1904, 32 L.D. 481, described the right as a 'base or qualified fee'. This shift in interpretation was probably due to the description in Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Townsend, \n190 \nU.S. 267\n, 23 S.Ct. 671, 672, of a right of way conveyed in a land-grant act (13 Stat. 365) as a 'limited fee, made on an implied condition of reverter'.14 But the earlier view was reasserted in the departmental regulations of May 21, 1909, 37 L.D. 787.15 After 1915 administrative construction bowed to the case of Rio Grande Western R. Co. v. Stringham, \n239 \nU.S. 44\n, 36 S.Ct. 5, which applied the language of the Townsend case to a right of way acquired under the Act of 1875. We do not regard this subsequent interpretation as binding on the Department of the Interior since it was impelled by what we regard as inaccurate statements in the Stringham case. Cf. Helvering v. Hallock, \n309 \nU.S. 106, 121\n, 60 S.Ct. 444, 452, 125 A.L.R. 1368\n\n\n Congress itself in later legislation has interpreted the Act of 1875 as conveying but an easement. The Act of June 26, 1906, c. 3550, 34 Stat. 482, 43 U.S.C.A.  940 declaring a forfeiture of unused rights of way, provides in part that: 'the United States hereby resumes the full title to the lands covered thereby (by the right of way) freed and discharged from such easement'. This language is repeated in the forfeiture act of February 25, 1909, c. 191, 35 Stat. 647, 43 U.S.C.A.  940. Also on June 26, 1906, an act16 was passed confirming the rights of way which certain railroads had acquired under \n\n[315 \nU.S. 262, 277]\n\u00a0\n the 1875 Act in the Territories of Oklahoma and Arizona. The House committee report on this bill said: 'The right as originally conferred and as proposed to be protected by this bill simply grants an easement or use for railroad purposes. Under the present law whenever the railroad passes through a tract of public land the entire tract is patented to the settler or entryman, subject only to this easement'.17 It is settled that 'subsequent legislation may be considered to assist in the interpretation of prior legislation upon the same subject.' Tiger v. Western Investment Co., \n221 \nU.S. 286, 309\n, 31 S.Ct. 578, 583, 584. See also Cope v. Cope, \n137 \nU.S. 682\n, 11 S.Ct. 222; United States v. Freeman, 3 How. 556. These statutes were approximately contemporaneous with petitioner's acquisition of the rights of way of the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway.\n That petitioner has only an easement in its rights of way acquired under the Act of 1875 is therefore clear from the language of the Act, its legislative history, its early administrative interpretation and the construction placed upon it by Congress in subsequent enactments.\n Petitioner, seeking to obviate this result, relies on several cases in this Court stating that railroads have a 'limited', 'base', or 'qualified' fee in their rights of way. \n18\n All of those cases, except Rio Grande Western R. Co. v. Stringham, \n239 \nU.S. 44\n, 36 S.Ct. 5; Choctaw, O. & G.R.R. Co. v. Mackey, \n256 \nU.S. 531\n, 41 S.Ct. 582; and Noble v. Oklahoma City, 297 \n\n[315 \nU.S. 262, 278]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 481, 56 S.Ct. 562, deal with rights of way conveyed by land-grant acts before the shift in Congressional policy occurred in 1871. For that reason they are not controlling here. \n19\n When Congress made outright grants to a railroad of alternate sections of public lands along the right of way, there is little reason to suppose that it intended to give only an easement in the right of way granted in the same act. And, in none of those acts was there any provision comparable to that of Section 4 of the 1875 Act that 'lands over which such right of way shall pass shall be disposed of subject to such right of way'. None of the cases involved the problem of rights to subsurface oil and minerals.\n In the Stringham case (\n239 \nU.S. 44\n, 36 S.Ct. 6) it was said that a right of way under the Act of 1875 is 'neither a mere easement, nor a fee simple absolute, but a limited fee, made on an implied condition of reverter in the event that the company ceases to use or retain the land for the purposes for which it is granted, and carries with it the incidents and remedies usually attending the fee'. The railroad had brought suit to quiet title to a portion of its right of way. Stringham asserted title to that portion by virtue of a purported purchase of surface rights from a placer mine claimant. The Supreme Court of Utah reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case, directing the entry of 'a judgment awarding to the plaintiff title to a right of way over the lands in question'. 38 Utah 113, 110 P. 868, 872. The railroad again appealed, asserting that it should have been adjudged 'owner in fee simple of the right of way over the premises'. The Supreme Court of Utah affirmed the judgment of the trial court on the ground that the railroad's proper remedy was by petition for rehearing of the first appeal. 39 Utah 236, 115 P. 967. Both judgments were brought to this Court by writ of \n\n[315 \nU.S. 262, 279]\n\u00a0\n error. It was held that the second judgment presented nothing reviewable. The first judgment was affirmed since it 'describes the right of way in the exact terms of the right-of-way act, and evidently uses those terms with the same meaning they have in the act.'\n The conclusion that the railroad was the owner of a 'limited fee' was based on cases arising under the land-grant acts passed prior to 1871 and it does not appear that Congress' change of policy after 1871 was brought to the Court's attention. \n20\n That conclusion is inconsistent with the language of the Act, its legislative history, its early administrative interpretation and the construction placed on it by Congress in subsequent legislation. We therefore do not regard it as controlling. Statements in Choctaw, O. & G.R. Co. v. Mackey, \n256 \nU.S. 531\n, 41 S.Ct. 582, and Noble v. Oklahoma City, \n297 \nU.S. 481\n, 56 S.Ct. 562, that the 1875 Act conveyed a limited fee are dicta based on the Stringham case and entitled to no more weight than the statements in that case . Far more persuasive are two cases involving special acts granting rights of way passed after 1871 and rather similar to the general act of 1875.21 Denver & R.G. Railway Co. v. Alling, \n99 \nU.S. 463\n, 475, characterized the right so granted as 'a present beneficial easement' and Smith v. Townsend, \n148 \nU.S. 490\n, 13 S.Ct. 634, 636, referred to it as 'simply an easement, not a fee'. We think that the Act of 1875 is to be similarly construed.\n Since petitioner's right of way is but an easement, it has no right to the underlying oil and minerals. This result does not freeze the oil and minerals in place. Petitioner is free to develop them under a lease executed pursuant to the Act of May 21, 1930, 46 Stat. 373, 30 U.S.C.A.  301-306.\n During the argument before this Court it was fully developed that the judgment was rendered on the plead- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 262, 280]\n\u00a0\n ings in which petitioner denied the allegation of title in the United States, and there was no proof or stipulation that the United States had any title. On this state of the record the United States was not entitled to any judgment below. However, we permitted the parties to cure this defect by a stipulation showing that the United States has retained title to certain tracts of land over which petitioner's right of way passes, in a limited area,22 and that petitioner intended to drill for and remove the oil underlying its right of way over each of those tracts. Accordingly the judgment will be modified and limited to the areas described in the stipulation. As so modified, it is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS and Mr. Justice JACKSON took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Emphasis added. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Emphasis added. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] This clause first appeared in a special right of way statute, Portland, Dalles, and Salt Lake Act of April 12, 1872, 17 Stat. 52. Congressman Slater reported that bill for the Public Lands Committee, and, in discussing the reason for the clause, said:\n Mr. Slater: The point (of this clause) is simply this: the land over which this right of way passes is to be sold subject to the right of way. It simply provides that this right of way shall be an incumbrance upon the land for one hundred feet upon each side of the line of the road; that those who may afterward make locations for settlement shall not interfere with this right of way.\n Mr. Speer of Pennsylvania: It grants no land to any railroad company?\n Mr. Slater: No, sir.

And, it has been held that railroads do not have a fee in those portions of their rights of way acquired by eminent domain proceedings. See East Alabama Railway Company v. Doe, \n114 \nU.S. 340\n, 5 S.Ct. 869; Quick v. Taylor, 113 Ind. 540, 16 N.E. 588; Railroad Co. v. Schmuck, 69 Kan. 272, 76 P. 836; Keown v. Brandon, 206 Ky. 93, 266 S.W. 889; Hall v.

This last grant was the largest, involving an estimated 40,000,000 acres.

UNITED STATES(1942)\nNo. 535\nArgued: March 4, 1942Decided: April 13, 1942\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Ohio. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 74, 75]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Howell Leuck, of Cleveland, Ohio, H. Russell Bishop, of Washington, D.C., for appellants.\n Mr. James C. Wilson, of Washington, D.C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal is from a judgment of a statutory three-judge court denying appellants' petition to set aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission refusing the Gregg Cartage & Storage Company a certificate of public convenience and necessity under the so-called grandfather clause of  206(a) of the Motor Carrier Act, 1935, 49 U.S.C.  306(a), 49 U.S.C.A.  306(a). \n\n[316 \nU.S. 74, 76]\n\u00a0\n The Gregg Company, an Ohio corporation, operated in 1935 and earlier as a common carrier of general freight between points in several northeastern states. In a number of important cities it maintained terminals at which freight was assembled. It performed no over-the-road carrier service with its own vehicles, but provided such service entirely by the use of so-called owner-operator vehicles. Such vehicles as it owned and operated directly were used in cartage in and about Cleveland.\n On February 12, 1936, the Gregg Company filed an application with the Interstate Commerce Commission for a certificate of public convenience and necessity as a common carrier under the grandfather clause of  206(a) of the Motor Carrier Act. A hearing was held on June 8 and 9, 1937, before an examiner who, on December 17, 1937, recommended that the certificate be granted.\n Meanwhile, the Gregg Company had failed and ceased to operate. It had arranged the filing on October 4, 1937, of a creditor's bill in a state court of Ohio, which on the following day appointed the company's counsel to be its receiver with authority to continue the business. On the day of this receiver's appointment other creditors filed a petiton in bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, which on October 27 adjudicated the company a bankrupt, and on October 30 appointed a receiver to preserve the assets of the estate pending the election and qualification of a trustee. \n1\n In operating the business, the state court receiver confined himself to the completion of shipments en route, and did not solicit or accept new business. On October 14, he filed with the Commission a petition for permission to suspend operations without prejudice to rights under the grandfather clause. The \n\n[316 \nU.S. 74, 77]\n\u00a0\n Commission, of the opinion that it lacked power to authorize such a suspension, denied this petition on November 30, 1937. The receiver in bankruptcy took over the business on the day of his appointment, and conducted no operations at any time. Pursuant to a order of the bankruptcy court, on December 6, 1937, he sold the trade names and good will of the bankrupt estate, together with its rights under the grandfather clause application, to appellant Northeastern Transportation Company, for $850 at public auction.\n On January 7, 1938, Northeastern and the receiver in bankruptcy filed a joint application with the Commision asking that Northeastern be substituted as applicant in lieu of Gregg. The Commission withheld action until it had determined Gregg's rights. Northeastern considered a resumption of operations, but decided against it on the advice of field representatives of the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n A further hearing before another examiner, confined to the circumstances of the interruption of Gregg's service, resulted in another recommendation of the issuance of a certificate under the grandfather clause. The Commission, however, denied the application December 12, 1939, after a rehearing following the report of Division 5, a majority of which had held similarly on November 14, 1938. 10 M.C.C. 255, 21 M.C.C. 17. The Commission ruled that an interruption of service within the control of the applicant had occurred, that the purchase by Northeastern had conferred no operating rights, and that therefore neither corporation was entitled to a certificate under the grandfather clause. Five commissioners dissented. Gregg and its trustee in bankruptcy then filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, praying that the order of the Commission denying Gregg's application be annulled and set aside and that the Commission be directed \n\n[316 \nU.S. 74, 78]\n\u00a0\n to issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity to Gregg. A statutory court of three judges was convened, Northeastern was allowed to intervene, and judgment went against the complainants, who appealed to this Court, 62 S.Ct. 113, 86 L.Ed. --, which noted probable jurisdiction. \n2\n D.C., 42 F.Supp. 266.\n Appellants contend that the Commission and the court below erroneously construed  206(a)3 of the Motor Carrier Act in holding that, excepting the specified interruptions of service, the statute required continuous operation from June 1, 1935, until the hearing by the Commission on the application. We have, however, held to the contrary. United States v. Maher, \n307 \nU.S. 148\n, 59 S.Ct. 768, petition for limited hearing denied \n307 \nU.S. 649\n, 59 S.Ct. 831; Hoey v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 510\n, 60 S.Ct. 132; Lubetich v. United States, \n315 \nU.S. 57\n, 62 S.Ct. 449, 86 L.Ed. --.\n Appellants contend alternatively that the Commission should be reversed for refusing to hold that the applicant 'had no control' over the cessation of operations.\n From October 15, 1935 to December 31, 1936, Gregg was insured against public liability and property damage by an insurance company which in 1936 failed either to disprove or settle certain claims against Gregg and was rumored to be insolvent. For these reasons Gregg cancelled its contract with this company and obtained similar insurance with another company, paying the premiums in advance. The failing insurance company was adjudged a bankrupt in January of 1937, and ceased to pay any \n\n[316 \nU.S. 74, 79]\n\u00a0\n claims. Gregg, thereby left with the burden of satisfying claims for personal injury and property damage arising during the period when it had carried insurance in the bankrupt company, paid some of them in the later months of 1937; but approximately 175, estimated to aggregate in their face amount about $200,000, remained unpaid. It also paid about $15,000 on claims for cargo loss and damage, which two other insurers, relying upon 'technical' insurers' defenses, refused to pay. All policies of insurance taken out by Gregg had the required approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Solvent on June 30, 1937, Gregg had become insolvent by October 30, 1937. When it appeared impossible to satisfy all demands, in full, resort was had to the friendly receivership in the state court. This precipitated the involuntary bankruptcy in the federal court, which in turn brought operations to a halt.\n The Commission based its refusal to find that the applicant 'had no control' over the interruption of service upon the fact that such interruption followed upon an adjudication of bankruptcy resulting from the unsuccessful conduct of its business affairs, and did not go back of the adjudication to find and give detailed consideration to the particular causes of the failure. Appellants contend that this was error, and for a rule requiring that in every case of this sort the Commission must trace out the chain of causation and weigh the bankrupt's judgment against the pressures of circumstance. We sustain the Commission in construing the statute as not requiring it to go back of the bankruptcy adjudication to search for ultimate causes.\n How far one by an exercise of free will may determine his general destiny or his course in a particular matter and how far he is the toy of circumstance has been debated through the ages by theologians, philosophers, and scientists. Whatever doubts they have entertained as to the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 74, 80]\n\u00a0\n matter, the practical business of government and administration of the law is obliged to proceed on more or less rough and ready judgments based on the assumption that mature and rational persons are in control of their own conduct. Certainly that assumption must be made in reference to a corporation such as the applicant. Society, in creating a corporation, vesting its management in a board of directors, granting it large powers and not inconsiderable immunities, can hardly allow that its business affairs are at any time out of the control of those whose duty it is to conduct them. The Bankruptcy Act states that even an involuntary adjudication results only from some 'act of bankruptcy,' defined upon the clear assumption that it is within the bankrupt's control. \n4\n Whether or not this assumption squares with philosophical doctrine, or even with reality, 5 is not for our determination. The Commission, and the courts too, must get on with the application of the federal statutes without waiting to settle the verity of the philosophical assumptions on which they rest.\n The Commission was warranted in holding as matter of law that the interruption because of bankruptcy was not one over which the applicant had no control within the meaning of the Motor Carrier Act. The complexity of the chain of causation shown in this case makes it an apt illustration of the impracticability of any other rule. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 74, 81]\n\u00a0\n When it found itself unable to meet its obligations, Gregg arranged a receivership in the state court, securing the appointment of its own counsel as receiver. Only the one creditor which filed the bill appears to have been consulted. Thus, the petitioner not only arranged deliberately to commit an act of bankruptcy, but it managed the affair in a manner not unlikely to provoke the unconsulted creditors to file a petiton in bankruptcy-presumably considered their best or only means of obtaining the disinterestedness in the administration of the estate to which they were entitled.\n The claims which, together with the advance payment of premiums for new insurance, constituted the immediate cause of Gregg's financial difficulties, were, as we have said, of various sorts. Bulking largest were those for personal injuries and property damage, which numbered approximately 175 and in their face amount aggregated approximately $200, 000. Their precise nature is not disclosed by the record, and conjecture in this regard is made particularly difficult by Gregg's method of doing business-which was to avail itself entirely of 'owner-operator' vehicles for its 'over-the-road' services. Doubtless these claims were founded almost entirely upon the negligent operation of vehicles for which Gregg was in some way held legally responsible. We are not informed whether such responsibility rested upon the principle of respondeat superior, express contractual assumption, or both. The rest of the claims, upon which about $ 15,000 were paid, were for cargo loss and damage. The record does not show whether payment was made solely to retain the good will of shippers, or also the satisfy the applicant's legal liability-which would have rested upon its legal control of the cargo.\n It is true that Gregg would not have had to bear the burden of most, if not all, of the claims, had it not been for \n\n[316 \nU.S. 74, 82]\n\u00a0\n some unfortunate experiences with insurance companies. Its major misfortune was the failure of the company in which it carried its insurance against liability for personal injury and property damage. What consideration actuated the choice of the particular insurance company and what caution, if any, was observed in selecting it, do not appear. It either misunderstood the coverage of its other policies or purchased policies not specifically comprehensive, and found itself taking care of very substantial claims for cargo loss because of 'technical' insurers' defenses which seem to have been sufficient under the Ohio law.\n In any event, the choices of insurers, as well of its servants and operators, were Gregg's own-as was the judgment which was exercised with regard to the numerous other phases of its business bearing upon its solvency-and the final product could not have been a matter over which it had no control.\n Furthermore, the interruption of service was the deliberate act of those who for the time being stood in the position of applicant and owned its rights. During the interval between receivership and sale of these rights to Northeastern, we take it that the beneficial interest therein vested in the creditors and the legal title in the receiver or trustee. The federal receiver or trustee could have been authorized to conduct the business of the bankrupt for a limited period, if in the best interests of the estate.  2 of the Act of July 1, 1898, as amended, 11 U.S.C.  11, 11 U.S.C.A.  11. The creditors and their representatives, however, failed to seek such authority, evidently regarding the rights, which later sold for $ 850, not worth the expense and risk of continuing business. It is the purchaser Northeastern, organized to acquire the 'grandfather' rights, and to an undetermined extent identified with the management of the bankrupt,6 which, having bought these rights in this \n\n[316 \nU.S. 74, 83]\n\u00a0\n state of voluntarily suspended animation, seeks to revive them. But it cannot say that it takes the rights free of any impairment by the voluntary suspension of operation by the then owner from whom it derives title.\n The applicant for a certificate under the grandfather clause seeks to exempt his further operations from scrutiny as to public convenience and necessity. If he is able to meet those tests, he may be authorized to operate, even if he never had grandfather rights, or if those he once had have been lost. As the Motor Carrier Act is remedial, and the grandfather clause confers a special privilege, the proviso defining exemptions is to be held to extend only to carriers plainly within its terms. McDonald v. Thompson, \n305 \nU.S. 263, 266\n, 59 S.Ct. 176, 178.\n In its opinion the Commission stated that 'it is useless to speculate upon the question whether the 'grandfather' right expired before or after the sale.' This we understand to mean that, having determined that the cessation of operations was not a matter over which Gregg 'had no control,' the Commission was of opinion that by the time of the sale the cessation of operations was of sufficient duration-at least 69 days-to establish that Gregg had not been 'in ... operation since' June 1, 1935, within the meaning of  206(a). This was a reasonable conclusion, especially since any substantial interruption of one carrier's service tends to result in expansion of other facilities to meet the continuing needs of shippers, and thus to cause overcrowding if the suspended service is resumed.\n Finally, appellants claim to be entitled to relief from prejudice said to have resulted from delay of the Commission in acting on Gregg's application made under  206( \n\n[316 \nU.S. 74, 84]\n\u00a0\n a) on February 12, 1936. They point out that had the Commission acted at once a certificate would have issued, thus conferring the benefits of  212(a).7 But by its terms  212(a) is applicable only where a certificate has already issued; and, being a section of general applicability, at least for present purposes, it has no analogical bearing upon the construction of the specific provision relating to interruptions of service made in  206(a). The delay in passing upon the application was considerable and regrettable, as the Commission acknowledged, but it does not seem to have been arbitrary or the result of any deliberate discrimination, nor, in view of the magnitude of the Commission's task, unreasonable. The Commission had nearly 90,000 applications to pass upon under  206(a), and of course could not have been expected to pass upon them simultaneously. It is not within our province to remedy inequalities necessarily incident to the administration of the statute.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n I cannot believe that experts of the subject-say, referees charged with the duties of administering the bankruptcy law-would conclude that every bankruptcy arose without exception from conditions which were with- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 74, 85]\n\u00a0\n in the 'control' of the bankrupt in any accepted meaning of the word. Nor do I think that that view would be taken in case of receiverships. Yet that is the irrebuttable presumption which the Commission has created in this type of case. Congress did not create it. Congress merely provided that this class of carrier had a right to the statutory grant on a showing, inter alia, that it was in 'bona fide operation as a common carrier by motor vehicle on June 1, 1935' and 'has so operated since that time' except as to 'interruptions of service over which the applicant or its predecessor in interest had no control.' Motor Carrier Act of 1935,  206( a), 49 U.S.C.  306(a), 49 U.S.C.A.  306(a). I would have supposed that the question of 'control' was 'an issue of fact to be determined by the special circumstances of each case.' Rechester Telephone Corp. v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 125, 145\n, 59 S.Ct. 754, 764. That would mean that 'So long as there is warrant in the record for the judgment of the expert body it must stand.' Id., 307 U.S. pages 145, 146, 59 S.Ct. page 764. But that is quite different from giving the word 'control' a construction which prevents a person from showing under any circumstances that the events which led to his business disaster were not subject to his 'control'. On the one hand, the Commission rules that interruptions of service owing to floods,1 snow,2 unsafe3 or impassable4 roads, highway construction,5 droughts which destroy a carrier's chief source of business,6 ill health,7 strikes,8 or the illegal action of govern- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 74, 86]\n\u00a0\n mental authorities9 constitute grounds for holding that an interruption of service is beyond an applicant's 'control'. But similar misfortunes of a purely accidental character which affect financial stability and end in bankruptcy or receivership are held as a matter of law to be subject to the carrier's 'contol'.\n The distortion which that interpretation involves is well illustrated by this case. There was evidence tending to show the following: During the year 1936 the applicant was insured against public liability and property damage by the Central mutual Insurance Co. Hearing rumors that Central Mutual was in financial difficulties and was not paying claims, applicant dropped its policy in December 1936 and placed its insurance with another company. On January 11, 1937, Central Mutual was adjudged a bankrupt and ceased payment of all claims. In the fall of 1937 applicant was forced to pay several substantial damage claims arising from accidents during the period when its insurance policy was in effect with Central Mutual. These payments seriously impaired its working capital. Furthermore, applicant was confronted with approximately 175 additional claims for personal injury and property damage. These were estimated at about $200,000 and arose during the period when applicant was insured by Central Mutual. Applicant settled some of these claims. It was impossible, however, to satisfy the demands of all of these claimants. Receivership followed and on its heels came bankruptcy. There is not the slightest evidence in this record of any negligence, dereliction, or mismanagement on the part of applicant. It is undisputed that its failure was due to the failure of its insurer. And there is no evidence in this record that it did not exercise due care in the selection of that insurer. It would indeed be ironical to cast a \n\n[316 \nU.S. 74, 87]\n\u00a0\n presumption against the applicant on that score when the insurance policy presumably was accepted by the Commission and under its regulations promulgated pursuant to  211(c) and 215 of the Act, 49 U.S.C.  311(c) and 315, 49 U.S.C.A.  311(c), 315, had to be 'approved' by it. 10 Federal Fegister (1936) Vol. 1, p. 1163, Rule 1. And see 49 Code of Federal Regulations, Pt. 174,  174.1.\n An applicant carries the burden of establishing his right to the statutory grant which is contained in the 'grandfather' clause. Alton Railroad Co. v. United States, \n315 \nU.S. 15\n, 62 S.Ct. 432, 86 L.Ed. --. But he should not be met at the threshold with a conclusive presumption against him unless Congress has clearly indicated that in the circumstances of his case he has no right even to undertake the burden of proof. If Congress had desired to eliminate all applicants whose continuous service was interrupted by bankruptcy or receivership, I believe it would have said so. As stated by Commissioner Lee in his dissenting opinion (10 M.C.C. p. 263): 'If such interruptions in service are to be construed as putting an end to 'grandfather' rights of carriers, whose applications therefor have not been determined, then, where such a carrier goes into receivership or bankruptcy, and such an interruption occurs, it would be impossible for the carrier to come out of receivership and resume operations; it could not effect a composition or an arrangement with its creditors and resume operations; if a corporation, it could not be reorganized under the corporate reorganization provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, and creditors could realize nothing from 'grandfather' rights, however valuable.' Such a wholesale destruction of operating rights should not be readily or lightly inferred. Operating rights are the very life of any business. Without them this business certainly has no more than scrap value. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 74, 88]\n\u00a0\n Great deference is owed a commission's interpretation of the law which it enforces, especially where the meaning of the statutory language, generally or in specific application, gains body and flavor from the content of the highly specialized field in which the expert body works. See Shields v. Utah Idaho Central Railroad Co., \n305 \nU.S. 177\n, 59 S.Ct. 160; Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, \n310 \nU.S. 381\n, 60 S. Ct. 907; Gray v. Powell, \n314 \nU.S. 402\n, 62 S.Ct. 326, 86 L. Ed. --; Alton Railroad Co. v. United States, supra. But that is quite different from acceding to the suggestion that the non-technical word 'control' may be interpreted in a way which goes against all human experience and which does violence to its ordinary and accepted meaning. In this connection it should be noted that if the misfortune which ended in bankruptcy or receivership was not subject to the carrier's 'control', then an interruption of service made by the trustee or receiver cannot be attributed to him. Once the court acquires jurisdiction over the estate, the affairs of the business are in its hands, not the debtor's.\n Congress has provided that those who attained a position in the competitive transportation system should be allowed to retain the fruits of their struggle. Whether that policy was wise or unwise is not for us to appraise. But we should not permit those statutory grants to be whittled away on the basis of technical and legalistic grounds which find no expression in the statute however much the administrative chore may be alleviated. If the services of a carrier have been interrupted by bankruptcy or receivership, his burden of proving that that default was not subject to his 'control' may be onerous. Perhaps in most cases he could not maintain it. But he should be given the opportunity to do so. It is hard for me to imagine a clearer case where he probably could succeed than this one.

UNITED STATES(1942)\nNo. 101\nArgued: January 5, 1942Decided: January 19, 1942\n\n\n\n Messrs. Warren E. Miller, of Washington, D.C., and R. K. Wise, of Columbia, S.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Wilbur C. Pickett, of Washington, D.C., for respondent. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 94, 95]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BYRNES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by the petitioner through his Committee on a $ 10,000 War Risk Insurance policy. The complaint alleged that petitioner had become permanently and totally disabled by April 2, 1919, the date on which he was honorably discharged by the Army. The insurance contract was in effect on that date and remained in effect until October 31, 1920. At the close of all the evidence the government's motion for a directed verdict was denied. The jury returned a verdict for petitioner and found that he had become permanently and totally disabled by April 2, 1919. The government moved for a new trial, the motion was denied, and judgment was entered on the verdict. On appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 116 F.2d 812. It held that there was insufficient evidence to go to the jury and it remanded the case to the District Court with directions to set aside the verdict and to enter judgment in favor of the government.\n Petitioner sought certiorari on two grounds: that the Circuit Court of Appeals had erred in holding that there was insufficient evidence for the jury; and that, even if the evidence was insufficient, under Rule 50(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c,1 the Circuit Court was without \n\n[315 \nU.S. 94, 96]\n\u00a0\n power to direct entry of judgment for the government without a new trial. We granted certiorari, as we had in Berry v. United States2 and Conway v. O'Brien,3 because of the importance of the question concerning Rule 50(b). However, as in those cases, we do not reach that problem since we are of the opinion that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict.\n The insurance contract, the Act of Congress which authorized it,4 and the regulations issued pursuant to that Act5 obliged petitioner to prove that he was permanently and totally disabled on or before October 31, 1920, the date of expiration of the contract. We think there was evidence from which, if believed, the jury could have drawn this conclusion.\n Period prior to October 31, 1920. Petitioner appeared to his friends and neighbors as a normal and healthy young man before his induction into the Army on June 23, 1918. In August he sailed for France, and in September he injured his back and was admitted to a camp hospital. From that time until his discharge, he was examined on several occasions by Army physicians. Their reports reveal that he was 'very nervous' and that he gave 'impressions of neurasthenia'.\n While much of the testimony was not specific as to time, several of the witnesses described the appearance and \n\n[315 \nU.S. 94, 97]\n\u00a0\n behavior of the petitioner immediately following his discharge in April, 1919. The jury was clearly warranted in regarding their testimony as applicable to the period during which the insurance policy remained in force.\n Dr. J. N. Land, a general practitioner who had been 'the family physician of the Halliday family' and who had known petitioner from infancy, testified that from 1919 on, petitioner was the victim of psychoneurosis and hypochrondria. These ills caused him to talk about himself constantly, to imagine the existence of symptoms, and to become very unfriendly and suspicious. The witness 'would not have advised him to do any work since he has been out of the Army,' and was of the opinion that work 'would have been harmful to him' and would have resulted in 'a complete collapse'. At the time of his discharge from the Army, the doctor 'didn't hold any hope for his recovery'. The Circuit Court of Appeals considered this testimony of 'little probative force', chiefly because of Dr. Land's admission that he had not examined petitioner professionally until about 1932. But the doctor testified that he had seen petitioner 'on the streets or in a drugstore' 'at least two or three times a year, possibly more ... all the way from 1919.' Petitioner talked to him 'every chance he has got since 1919'. In the course of these conversations petitioner would describe his condition at length and ask the witness to do something for him. While the Circuit Court may have regarded the probative force of this evidence as 'little', it was clearly proper for the jury to conclude from it and from their understanding of small town life that these encounters and his earlier intimacy with the Halliday family afforded Dr. Land an opportunity to form a reliable estimate of petitioner's condition.\n Other witnesses, including his wife and brothers and neighbors, testified that when he returned from the war petitioner 'was suspicious of everybody,' 'didn't seem to \n\n[315 \nU.S. 94, 98]\n\u00a0\n be the same man,' 'seemed to be a man that didn't have a grip on himself,' 'didn't have the best control of himself.' They described him as 'a physical wreck,' 'nervous,' 'not right,' 'a complete physical and mental wreck, very badly torn up physically and mentally.' And one brother testified that petitioner's condition upon his return was 'practically the same as it is today.'\n Period following October 31, 1920. While it is true that total and permanent disability prior to the expiration of the insurance contract must be established, evidence as to petitioner's conduct and condition during the ensuing years is certainly relevant. It is a commonplace that one's state of mind is not always discernible in immediate events and appearances, and that its measurement must often await a slow unfolding. This difficulty of diagnosis and the essential charity of ordinary men may frequently combine to delay the frank recognition of a diseased mind. Moreover, the totality and particularly the permanence of the disability as of 1920 are susceptible of no better proof than that to be found in petitioner's personal history for the ensuing 15 years. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Petitioner's wife testified that during this period he was unable to do a full day's work, that he threatened to commit suicide and to kill her and their children, and that he feared attempts to poison him. She stated that although they rented one farm and later bought but never paid for another, they hadn't 'done any farming much' and had 'just had little patches,' and that she and hired hands had been responsible even for this limited enterprise. Dr. Land testified that the mental disorder had gradually progressed since the war. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 94, 99]\n\u00a0\n The reports of government medical examiners and the records of government hospitals reveal a diagnosis of hypochondria on February 14, 1921. And on November 24, 1925 petitioner was found to be psychoneurotic and neurasthenic. On that date he informed the medical examiner that he was unable to work, that he lacked confidence, and that he was often depressed and seized by fear. He complained of 'a great many things which physical examination fails to reveal.' Reports of subsequent examinations up to and including April 11, 1935, contain similar information and diagnoses. Finally, on December 9, 1935, at the instance of Dr. Land, petitioner was adjudged incompetent by a county Probate Court and his wife was appointed as a committee to handle his affairs.\n In support of its conclusion the Circuit Court of Appeals [116 F.2d 814], observed that 'insured's failure to secure adequate hospitalization' leaves it 'highly speculative whether insured's ailments, whatever these may have been, would not have been cured by the medical treatment which was in his potential grasp.' There can be no doubt that evidence of the failure of attempted treatment would have been highly persuasive of the permanence of petitioner's disability. And the jury was entitled to draw inferences unfavorable to his claim from the absence of such evidence. However, this was but one of the many factors which the jury was free to consider in reaching its verdict. In the face of evidence of a mental disorder of more than 15 years duration, it can hardly be said that the absence of this single element of proof was fatal to petitioner's claim. Moreover, inferences from failure to seek hospitalization and treatment must be drawn with the utmost caution in cases of mental disorder, where, as here, there is reason to believe that one of the manifestations of the very sickness itself is fear and suspicion of hospitals and institutions.\n Although it was unnecessary to its disposition of the case, the Circuit Court of Appeals considered and noted \n\n[315 \nU.S. 94, 100]\n\u00a0\n its agreement with the government's objection to the District Court's refusal to admit evidence of petitioner's condition subsequent to December 9, 1935, the date on which petitioner was adjudged incompetent by the county probate court. \n7\n We think that the District Court's ruling was erroneous, but there is nothing to show that it was seriously prejudicial to the government. Neither in the District Court nor in this Court has the government suggested its ability to produce evidence from the period subsequent to 1935 which would substantially alter the state of the record.\n The case is remanded to permit the reinstatement of the judgment of the District Court.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS and Mr. Justice JACKSON took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Whenever a motion for a directed verdict made at the close of all the evidence is denied or for any reason is not granted, the court is deemed to have submitted the action to the jury subject to a later determination of the legal questions raised by the motion.

Palm Springs Holding Corp., 119 F.2d 846, decided by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and Helvering v. New President Corp., 122 F. 2d 92, decided by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.\n The answer to the question3 turns on the meaning of that part of  112(i) (1) of the Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 791, 818, 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev.Acts, page 379, which provides: 'The term 'reorganization' means (A) a merger or consolidation (including the acquisition by one corporation of ... substantially all the properties of another corporation) ....'\n The essential facts can be stated briefly. The old corporation was a subsidiary of a corporation which was in receivership in 1929. Stockholders of the parent had financed the old corporation taking unsecured notes for their advances. Maturity of the notes was approaching and not all of the noteholders would agree to take stock for their claims. Accordingly a creditors' committee was formed late in 1929 and a plan of reorganization was proposed to which all the noteholders, except two, assented. The plan provided that a new corporation would be formed which would acquire all the assets of the old corporation. The stock of the new corporation, preferred and common, would be issued to the creditors in satisfaction of their claims. Pursuant to the plan involuntary bankruptcy proceedings were instituted in 1930. The appraised value of the bankrupt corporation's assets was about $155,000. Its obligations were about $838, 000, the unsecured notes with accrued interest aggregating somewhat over $ 793,000. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 179, 182]\n\u00a0\n The bankruptcy trustee offered the assets for sale at public auction. They were bid in by the creditors' committee for $150,000. The price was paid by $15,000 in cash, by agreements of creditors to accept stock of a new corporation in full discharge of their claims, and by an offer of the committee to meet the various costs of administration, etc. Thereafter respondent was formed and acquired all the assets of the bankrupt corporation. It does not appear whether the acquisition was directly from the old corporation on assignment of the bid or from the committee. Pursuant to the plan respondent issued its stock to the creditors of the old corporation-over 95% to the noteholders and the balance to small creditors. Nonassenting creditors were paid in cash. Operations were not interrupted by the reorganization and were carried on subsequently by substantially the same persons as before.\n From the Pinellas case, Pinellas Ice & Cold Storage Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, \n287 \nU.S. 462\n, 53 S.Ct. 257 to the Le Tulle case, Le Tulle v, Scofield, \n308 \nU.S. 415\n, 60 S.Ct. 313 it has been recognized that a transaction may not qualify as a 'reorganization' under the various revenue acts though the literal language of the statute is satisfied. See Paul, Studies in Federal Taxation (3d Series) p. 91 et seq. The Pinellas case introduced the continuity of interest theory to eliminate those transactions which had 'no real semblance to a merger or consolidation' (287 U.S. page 470, 53 S. Ct. page 260) and to avoid a construction which 'would make evasion of taxation very easy.' Id., 287 U.S. page 469, 53 S.Ct. page 260. In that case the transferor received in exchange for its property cash and short term notes. This Court said (Id., 287 U.S. page 470, 53 S.Ct. page 260), 'Certainly, we think that to be within the exemption the seller must acquire an interest in the affairs of the purchasing company more definite than that incident to ownership of its short-term purchase-money notes.' In the Le Tulle case, we held that the term of the obligation received by the seller was immaterial. 'Where the consideration is wholly in the transferee's bonds, or \n\n[315 \nU.S. 179, 183]\n\u00a0\n part cash and part such bonds, we think it cannot be said that the transferor retains any proprietary interest in the enterprise.' 308 U.S. pages 420, 421, 60 S.Ct. page 316. On the basis of the continuity of interest theory as explained in the Le Tulle case it is now earnestly contended that a substantial ownership interest in the transferee company must be retained by the holders of the ownership interest in the transferor. That view has been followed by some courts. Commissioner v. Palm Springs Holding Corp., supra; Helvering v. New President Corp., supra. Under that test there was 'no reorganization' in this case since the old stockholders were eliminated by the plan, no portion whatever of their proprietary interest being preserved for them in the new corporation. And it is clear that the fact that the creditors were for the most part stockholders of the parent company does not bridge the gap. The equity interest in the parent is one step removed from the equity interest in the subsidiary. In any event, the stockholders of the parent were not granted participation in the plan qua stockholders.\n We conclude, however, that it is immaterial that the transfer shifted the ownership of the equity in the property from the stockholders to the creditors of the old corporation. Plainly the old continuity of interest was broken. Technically that did not occur in this proceeding until the judicial sale took place. For practical purposes, however, it took place not later than the time when the creditors took steps to enforce their demands against their insolvent debtor. In this case, that was the date of the institution of bankruptcy proceedings. From that time on they had effective command over the disposition of the property. The full priority rule of Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Boyd, \n228 \nU.S. 482\n, 33 S.Ct. 554, applies to proceedings in bankruptcy as well as to equity receiverships. Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., \n308 \nU.S. 106\n, 60 S. Ct. 1. It gives creditors, whether secured or unsecured, the right to ex- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 179, 184]\n\u00a0\n clude stockholders entirely from the reorganization plan when the debtor is insolvent. See In re 620 Church St. Bldg. Corp., \n299 \nU.S. 24\n, 57 S.Ct. 88. When the equity owners are excluded and the old creditors become the stockholders of the new corporation, it conforms to realities to date their equity ownership from the time when they invoked the processes of the law to enforce their rights of full priority. At that time they stepped into the shoes of the old stockholders. The sale 'did nothing but recognize officially what had before been true in fact.' Helvering v. New Haven & S.L.R. Co., 2 Cir., 121 F.2d 985, 987.\n That conclusion involves no conflict with the principle of the Le Tulle case. A bondholder interest in a solvent company plainly is not the equivalent of a proprietary interest, even though upon default the bondholders could retake the property transferred. The mere possibility of a proprietary interest is of course not its equivalent. But the determinative and controlling factors of the debtor's insolvency and an effective command by the creditors over the property were absent in the Le Tulle case.\n Nor are there any other considerations which prevent this transaction from qualifying as a 'reorganization' within the meaning of the Act. The Pinellas case makes plain that 'merger' and 'consolidation' as used in the Act includes transactions which 'are beyond the ordinary and commonly accepted meaning of those words'. 287 U.S. page 470, 53 S.Ct. page 260. Insolvency reorganizations are within the family of financial readjustments embraced in those terms as used in this particular statute. Some contention, however, is made that this transaction did not meet the statutory standard because the properties acquired by the new corporation belonged at that time to the committee and not to the old corporation. That is true. Yet the separate steps were integrated parts of a single scheme. Transitory phases of an arrangement frequently are dis- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 179, 185]\n\u00a0\n regarded under these sections of the revenue acts where they add nothing of substance to the completed affair. Gregory v. Helvering, \n293 \nU.S. 465\n, 55 S.Ct. 266, 97 A.L.R. 1355; Helvering v. Bashford, \n302 \nU.S. 454\n, 58 S.Ct. 307. Here they were no more than intermediate procedural devices utilized to enable the new corporation to acquire all the assets of the old one pursuant to a single reorganization plan.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Petitioner now takes the position that the new basis should be measured by the market value of the assets rather than the bid price.

Int.Rev.Acts, page 855, the gain of the taxpayers from the tranactions in question should be recognized.\n The taxpayers owned first mortgage bonds of Colorado Industrial Co. which was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Colorado Fuel and Iron Co. The bonds were guaranteed both as to principal and interest by the parent company. After defaults on these bonds and on other bonds issued by the parent company each company filed a petition under  77B of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  207. A plan of reorganization was formulated by committees of the security holders. It provided for the formation of a new company to which all the assets of the two debtor companies would be transferred. The new company would assume the obligations of the bonds of the old parent company, Colorado Fuel and Iron Co., and issue income bonds and common stock in exchange for the bonds of the old subsidiary company, Colorado Industrial Co. The stockholders of the debtor companies would receive no interest in the new company; but in exchange for their stock they would receive warrants for the purchase of shares of the new company. Approval of the plan by the requisite percentage of security holders was obtained. The plan was confirmed by the court in April, 1936 and was duly consummated as follows: The debtor companies, the bankruptcy trustee, and the trustee under the indenture securing the bonds of the old subsidiary company conveyed the assets of the debtors to the new company. The new securities were issuable to or on the order of the reorganization managers who were acting, as stated in the plan, as 'agents' of the security holders. The reorganization managers effected an exchange of the old securities for the new on or about September 1, 1936. Immediately after the consummation of the plan all of the issued shares of the new company ( 552,660 shares of common out of an authorized issue of 1,000,000 shares) belonged to the former holders of the bonds of the old subsidiary company. No stock was issued \n\n[316 \nU.S. 527, 530]\n\u00a0\n by the new company to other parties until October, 1936 when 37 shares were issued on exercise of the warrants. By June, 1938 only 465 shares had been issued to holders of the warrants.\n Each of the taxpayers in these cases exchanged his Colorado Industrial Co. bonds for income bonds and common stock of the new company. In each case the fair market value of the new securities exceeded the basis of the old. The Commissioner determined deficiencies on the ground that the profit from the exchange was a taxable gain. The Board of Tax Appeals held for the taxpayers. See Newton Trust v. Commissioner, 42 B.T.A. 473. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed (Commissioner v. Cement Investors, 10 Cir., 122 F.2d 380, Commissioner v. Newton, 10 Cir., 122 F. 2d 416) holding, inter alia, that the exchange met the requirements of  112(b)(5). We granted the petitions for certiorari because the application of  112(b)(5) to receivership or bankruptcy reorganizations raised important problems in the administration of the income tax law.\n It is plain from Helvering v. Southwest Consolidated Corp., \n315 \nU.S. 194\n, 62 S.Ct. 546, 86 L.Ed. --, which involved identical definitions of the term 'reorganization' as are involved here, that this transaction does not meet the requirements of  112(g)(1)(B) of the 1936 Act,1 The assets of the old companies were not acquired in exchange 'solely' for voting stock of the new company, since income bonds and warrants were also issued. It is also clear that the requirements of  112(g)(1)(C) were not satisfied since clause C 'contemplates that the old corporation or its stockholders, rather than its creditors, shall be in the dominant position of \n\n[316 \nU.S. 527, 531]\n\u00a0\n 'control' immediately after the transfer and not excluded or relegated to a minority position.' Id., 315 U.S. at page 202, 62 S.Ct. at page 552, 86 L.Ed. --. But it does not necessarily follow that  112(b)(5) is inapplicable.\n Sec. 112(b)(5) provides: 'No gain or loss shall be recognized if property is transferred to a corporation by one or more persons solely in exchange for stock or securities in such corporation, and immediately after the exchange such person or persons are in control of the corporation; but in the case of an exchange by two or more persons this paragraph shall apply only if the amount of the stock and securities received by each is substantially in proportion to his interest in the property prior to the exchange.'\n'Control' is defined in  112(h) to mean 'the ownership of stock possessing at least 80 per centum of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80 per centum of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of the corporation.'\n\n If it may be said that property was transferred by the bondholders to the new corporation, then the other requirements of  112(b)(5) were satisfied. For the bondholders, as owners of all of the outstanding shares of the new corporation were in 'control' of it 'immediately after the exchange.' And it has not been disputed that the stock and income bonds acquired by each bondholder were substantially in proportion to his interest in the assets of the debtor companies prior to the exchange. Petitioner, however, maintains that the only transfer within the meaning of  112(b)(5) was effected by the debtor companies, the bankruptcy trustee, and the indenture trustee; and that the exchange of the bonds for the new securities was merely part of the mechanics for consummation of the plan and not an exchange by which 'property' was \n\n[316 \nU.S. 527, 532]\n\u00a0\n transferred to the new corporation. Though we agreed with the latter proposition, it would not necessarily follow that the requirements of  112(b) (5) were not met.\n In case of reorganizations of insolvent corporations the creditors have the right to exclude the stockholders entirely from the reorganization plan. When the stockholders are excluded and the creditors of the old company become the stockholders of the new, 'it conforms to realities to date their equity ownership' from the time when the processes of the law were invoked 'to enforce their rights of full priority'. Helvering v. Albama Asphaltic Limestone Co., \n315 \nU.S. 179\n, 62 S.Ct. 540, 543, 86 L.Ed. --. Under that approach the ownership of the equity in these debtor companies effectively passed to these creditors at least when  77B proceedings were instituted. But however their interest in the property may be described, it clearly was an equitable claim in or to it. It was that equitable interest with which the plan dealt. The transfer of the properties of the debtor companies to the new corporation was made pursuant to that plan. The plan was approved by the requisite percentage of these creditors, as required by  77B, sub. e(1) of the Bankruptcy Act. Thus it is fair to say that the property transferred was property in which the creditors had an equitable interest and that the transfer was made with their authority and on their behalf. Certainly 'property' as used in  112(b)(5) includes such an interest in property. And we see no reason to conclude that a beneficial owner of, or equitable claimant to, property is precluded from consummating an exchange which qualifies under  112(b)(5) merely because the actual conveyance is made by his trustee or title holder. In situations comparable to this one the Board of Tax Appeals has held that  112(b)(5) is applicable. Leckie v. Commissioner, 37 B.T.A. 252; Miller & Paine v. Commissioner, 42 B.T.A. 586. Cf. Rockford Brick & Tile Co. v. Commissioner, 31 B.T.A. 537. We accept its view. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 527, 533]\n\u00a0\n The legislative history of  112(b)(5) supports that conclusion. Sec. 112(b) (5) and the 'reorganization' provisions are rather closely related. See Miller, Hendricks, and Everett, Reorganizations and Other Exchanges in Income Taxation (1931), ch. 6. While the 'reorganization' provisions are restricted to intercorporate transactions,  112(b)(5) is not so confined, since the phrase 'one or more persons' includes 'individuals, trusts or estates, partnerships and corporations'. Treasury Reg. 94, Art. 112(b)(5)- 1. But there is no indication that the 'reorganization' provisions were designed as the exclusive method of deferring recognition of gain or loss in all cases of corporate readjustments or reorganizations. The history of  112(b)(5) makes clear that it too was designed to function in that field (American Compress & Warehouse Co. v. Bender, 5 Cir., 70 F.2d 655, 657, 658) and to permit deferment of gains or losses where 'there has been a mere change in the form of ownership' or where the taxpayer has not 'closed out a losing venture.' Portland Oil Co. v. Commissioner, 1 Cir., 109 F.2d 479, 488, Sec. 112(b)(5) derives from  202(c) (3) of the 1921 Act, 42 Stat. 229, 230. Its legislative history shows that it was designed to permit 'readjustments'2 without present recognition of gain or loss by allowing property to be transferred to a controlled corporation by an individual, a partnership, a corporation, or others. \n3\n See Hearings, Senate Committee on Finance, Proposed Revenue Act of 1921, 67th Cong., 1st Sess., May 9-27, 1921, pp. 536-537, 546, 557-558; Magill, Taxable Income (1936), pp. 123-131. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 527, 534]\n\u00a0\n If a transaction meets the requirements of  112(b)(5), the basis of the property in the hands of the acquiring corporation is the same as it would be in the hands of the transferor.  113(a)(8). See P. A. Birren & Son, Inc., v. Commissioner, 7 Cir., 116 F.2d 718. A similar result obtains in case of a transaction which qualifies as a 'reorganization'. See  113(a) ( 7)(B). And the theory underlying the two basic provisions is the same. Miller, Hendricks, and Everett, op. cit., pp. 304, 404; S.Rep.No. 398, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., Committee Reports on the Revenue Acts, 1913-1938, Int.Rev.Bull., pp. 278-279. The close relationship between  112(b)(5) and the 'reorganization' provisions is further evidenced by the fact that they overlap to a degree. Thus a transaction which meets the requirements of clause B or clause C of  112(g)(1) may also qualify under  112(b)(5). In short, the 'reorganization' provisions do not furnish the exclusive methods for securing a deferment of gains or losses arising out of transactions popularly known as corporate readjustments or reorganizations. The instant transaction comes fairly within the family of business readjustments for which  112(b)(5) was designed. Hence the fact that it cannot meet the statutory standards of a 'reorganization' does not necessarily mean that it cannot qualify as an 'exchange', any more than the failure to satisfy one clause of the 'reorganization' provisions means that none can be satisfied.\n But the argument seems to be that even though there was an 'exchange' which met the requirements of  112(b)(5), there was nevertheless a gain which is taxable. That gain, it is suggested, arose from the acquisition by the taxpayers of their equitable interest in the properties in substitution for their old bonds. And it is argued that unlike the situation which obtains under the 'reorganization' provisions (Helvering v. Alabama Asphaltic Limestone Co., supra),  112(b)(5) covers only the exchange itself \n\n[316 \nU.S. 527, 535]\n\u00a0\n and not the antecedent steps in connection with a plan of reorganization. Thus the contention seems to be that since a gain arose from a transaction which was separate and distinct from and anterior to the exchange of property for the new securities, it must be recognized under the general rule of  112(a). We express no view on that contention. The deficiencies were not assessed on that transaction but only upon the exchange of stock and securities in the new corporation for bonds of the old. We will not consider here for the first time the question whether a tax liability may have been incurred under  112(a) by reason of the earlier transaction, a question not fairly within the issues as framed by the Commissioner and hence not decided below.

Southwest Consolidated Corp., supra, no question as to the applicability of  112(b)(5) was involved. The only question raised or considered by the Board or the Circuit Court of Appeals or passed on by this Court was whether or not the transaction in question qualified as a 'reorganization' under  112(g)(1) of the 1934 Act, 26 U.S.C.A.

CREDIT ALLIANCE CORPORATION(1942)\nNo. 708\nArgued: April 7, 1942Decided: April 27, 1942\n\n\n\n\n[316 \nU.S. 107, 108]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. Louis Monarch, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Newell W. Ellison, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Commercial Credit Company, a Delaware corporation, acquired and owned over 99% of the capital stock of the respondent, a New York corporation actively engaged in business. In 1936 the respondent's stockholders and directors resolved to liquidate the corporation and to make distribution to its stockholders in liquidation. Part of the distribution so made in 1936 was of cash and property constituting surplus earned after Feb- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 107, 109]\n\u00a0\n ruary 28, 1913, of the value of $950,734. Of this Commercial Credit Company's share was $947,228. Further distributions were made in 1937 and final distribution in 1938, and the corporation was legally dissolved. The liquidation complied with the provisions of  112(b)(6) of the Revenue Act of 1936,1 under which no gain or loss for tax purposes was attributable to Commercial Credit Company as a result of the distribution. That corporation did not, in 1936, distribute to its stockholders any of the distribution received by it from the respondent and did not apportion or allocate any part thereof to the respondent.\n The question is, to what dividends paid credit is the respondent entitled under the applicable sections of the Revenue Act of 1936.2\n By  14 there was imposed for the first time a tax upon 'undistributed net income'. In order to compute the base for this levy the dividends paid credit is to deducted from adjusted net income.\n Section 27 deals with the credit for dividends paid. Subsection (a) provides that, for the purposes of Title I of the Act, the dividends paid credit shall be the amount of dividends paid during the taxable year. Each of the additional subsections deals with a separate topic relating to the computation and allowance of the credit. The only ones here of importance are (f) and (h).\n'(f) Distributions in Liquidation. In the case of amounts distributed in liquidation the part of such distribution which is properly chargeable to the earnings or profits accumulated after February 28, 1913, shall, for the purposes of computing the dividends paid credit under this section, be treated as a taxable dividend paid.'\n\n'(h) Nontaxable Distributions. If any part of a distribution ( including stock dividends and stock rights) \n\n[316 \nU.S. 107, 110]\n\u00a0\n is not a taxable dividend in the hands of such of the shareholders as are subject to taxation under this title for the period in which the distribution is made, no dividends paid credit shall be allowed with respect to such part.'\n\n The taxpayer insists that the distribution in question is governed by the provisions of (f). The Government asserts that it is not, for these reasons: that the phrase 'which is properly chargeable to the earnings or profits accumulated after February 28, 1913' takes the distribution out of the purview of the section; that (h) denies the benefit of (f) to the taxpayer if the money or property transferred is not taxable to the distributee; that the policy of the Act, and the purpose underlying provisions other than  27, require that (f) be not construed as permitting the credit where the distribution gives rise to no tax upon the distributee, and that an applicable regulation precludes the credit.\n The Government's second contention has been sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit,3 but both the first and the second have been overruled by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, 4 and by the Board of Tax Appeals and the court below in the instant case. 5 In view of the conflict we granted certiorari. \n314 \nU.S. 604\n, 62 S.Ct. 301, 86 L.Ed. --.\n\n 1. \nAlthough a distribution in liquidation of earnings which accrued subsequently to February 28, 1913, does not constitute a dividend in the proper sense of the term,6 subsection (f) categorically declares that a liquidating distribution, to the extent it is composed of such earnings, shall, for the purposes of computing the dividends paid credit 'be treated as a taxable dividend paid.' \n\n[316 \nU.S. 107, 111]\n\u00a0\n Plainly the section intends that a distribution of such earnings shall be considered a dividend. Further it provides that the distributing corporation may use the amount in computing its credit for dividends paid. And, to put the matter beyond cavil, the section also says that the distribution shall be treated as the payment to the distributee of a taxable dividend.\n The Government, however, contends that the clause 'properly chargeable to the earnings or profits accumulated after February 28, 1913,' means properly chargeable to the distributee as such earnings or profits. The argument has, we think, rightly been rejected by all the courts which have considered it. The line drawn in all of the revenue acts between profits accumulated before the enactment of the first income tax act and after that date for distinguishing capital and income furnishes the reason for the insertion of the clause in subsection (f). Section 27 deals with a credit to the distributing corporation and the phrase finds its proper office in limiting the amount of the distribution in liquidation which may be considered a dividend from earnings or profits as distinguished from one composed of capital. We, therefore, conclude that (f), standing alone, justifies the deduction claimed by the respondent.\n\n 2. \nIt is urged that the sweeping provision of (h) precludes the application of (f) in the circumstances disclosed, because (h) denies the credit unless the amount distributed is taxable to the distributee. By concession the distribution here does not result in gain or loss to the parent company. The argument is in effect that (h) creates an exception to the rule formulated by (f).\n As above said, each of the subsections of  27 deals with a specific and particular topic. Subsection (f) deals with 'distributions in liquidation' while subsection (h) deals with 'nontaxable distributions'. If (f) applies in this case, (h) is left to cover a substantial field of other sorts \n\n[316 \nU.S. 107, 112]\n\u00a0\n of distributions. We should, of course, read the two sections as consistent rather than conflicting, if that be possible. Here it is not only possible but begets no absurd or impractical result. We hold that (h) is not applicable to the facts of this case and that (f) is.\n\n 3. \nThe petitioner points out that the Revenue Act of 1936 introduced a new policy,-to tax undistributed earnings in order to prevent a taxpayer from accumulating untaxed surplus by forcing the payment of dividends which become taxable in the hands of the distributee. This is true, but it is also true that the Act made distributions to parent corporations nontaxable in order to encourage the simplification of corporate structures. It was avowedly for this reason that  112(b)(6) provided that no gain or loss to the parent company should in such case be recognized, and it may well be that subsection (f) of  27 was inserted with the same purpose. The Government insists that as  115(h) 7 provides that a distribution of the taxpayer's stock or securities, or those of another corporation, shall not be considered a distribution of earnings or profits of the taxpayer if no gain to the distributee from the receipt of such stock or securities is recognized by the law, subsection (f) must be read in the light of the policy thus declared by  115(h). The latter section is irrelevant to this controversy because the distribution here was in property and money and not in stock or securities. Section 115(h) was amended in 1938, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 1058, subsequent to the consummation of the transaction here in question to include money or property, but we cannot, as the Government suggests, read into the section, as it stood when the transaction took place, an intent derived from the policy disclosed by the subsequent amendment.\n We shall not burden this opinion by extended reference to the legislative history of the Act of 1936. It is enough \n\n[316 \nU.S. 107, 113]\n\u00a0\n to say that it is inconclusive and, to some extent, supports the arguments of both parties. But whatever may be said of the policy behind the statute's provisions, we are not at liberty to disregard the direct and unambiguous language of subsection (f).\n\n 4. \nTreasury Regulations 94, Art. 27(f), declare that one making a liquidating distribution of earnings accumulated since February 28, 1913, must be denied the dividends credit in respect of such distribution unless the amount distributed is taxable in the same year to the distributee, but further provides that if the distributee, in that year, makes a distribution which entitles it to a dividends credit it may allocate a property proportion thereof to the distributor of the liquidating dividend. It is insisted that the situation presented to the Treasury by the various provisions of the Revenue Act of 1936 was confused and complex and the adoption of the regulation was proper in the circumstances and should control.\n In view of what we have said as to the plain meaning of subsection (f ), we think that no complexity or confusion is discoverable and that the regulation not only was contradictory of the plain terms of the subsection but attempted to add a supplementary legislative provision, which could only have been enacted by Congress. We hold, therefore, that the court below was right in refusing to give effect to the regulation.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice REED and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS dissent. They are of the opinion that since Art. 27(f) of Treasury Regulations 94 resolves the ambiguities between  27(f) and  27(h) of the Revenue Act of 1936 \n\n[316 \nU.S. 107, 114]\n\u00a0\n it is a valid interpretative regulation and a proper exercise of the rule- making authority. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 49 Stat. 1648, 1679, 26 U.S.C.A.

Int.Rev.Acts, page 836.2\n In each of these cases the taxpayer corporation contracted prior to May 1, 1936, by a written agreement to apply a percentage of its net earnings of a particular calendar year to an indebtedness of the corporation; in each case the agreement expressly provided only that the payment of the specified percentage was to be made on or before a certain date-April 1 in the case of The Ohio Leather Company and Warren Tool Corporation and April 15 in the case of The Strong Manufacturing Company- in the year following the calendar year during \n\n[317 \nU.S. 102, 105]\n\u00a0\n which the net earnings arose. \n3\n However, the specified percentage was actually paid during the taxable year in each case. By reason of these contracts and payments, taxpayers have sought to avail themselves of the credit authorized by  26(c)(2), which relieves from the tax on undistributed profits, imposed by  14 of the 1936 Act, 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev.Acts, page 823, any profits which may not be distributed because of a contract requiring that a portion of earnings of the taxable year be paid or irrevocably set aside within the taxable year for the discharge of a debt. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that the credits claimed should not be allowed, and assessed deficiencies in each case. The Board of Tax Appeals overruled the Commis- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 102, 106]\n\u00a0\n sioner, and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. \n4\n We granted certiorari, \n316 \nU.S. 651\n, 62 S.Ct. 945, because of an asserted conflict with Antietam Hotel Corp. v. Commissioner, 4 Cir., 123 F.2d 274.5\n Since  26(c)(2) grants a special credit in the nature of a deduction, the taxpayer must sustain the burden of showing compliance with its exact terms. Helvering v. Northwest Steel Rolling Mills, \n311 \nU.S. 46, 49\n, 61 S. Ct. 109, 111; White v. United States, \n305 \nU.S. 281, 292\n, 59 S. Ct. 179, 184; New Colonial Ice Co. v. Helvering, \n292 \nU.S. 435, 440\n, 54 S.Ct. 788, 790. We agree with the Commissioner that taxpayers have not carried that burden.\n Section 26(c)(2) expressly sets up three specific conditions precedent with which a corporation devoting part of its earnings to the payment of debts rather than the payment of dividends must comply before it is entitled to relief from the tax on undistributed profits-(1) there must be a written contract executed by the corporation \n\n[317 \nU.S. 102, 107]\n\u00a0\n prior to May 1, 1936; (2) this contract must contain a provision expressly dealing with the disposition of earnings and profits of the taxable year; and, (3) this contract must contain a provision requiring that a portion of such earnings and profits either (a) 'be paid within the taxable year in discharge of a debt' or (b) 'be irrevocably set aside within the taxable year for the discharge of a debt'. A taxpayer whose contract satisfies each of these three requirements is entitled to a credit to the extent of the amount which has been so paid or irrevocably set aside.\n While taxpayers have met the first two statutory requirements-the written contracts antedate May 1, 1936, and contain provisions expressly dealing with the disposition of earnings for the taxable year-, they have not met the third one. \n6\n The contracts clearly contain no provision requiring the payment of earnings 'within the taxable year in discharge of a debt'. Nor do they, contrary to taxpayers' assertion, require the irrevocable setting aside of earnings 'within the taxable year for the discharge of a debt' within the meaning of  26(c)(2). The contracts are wholly silent in respect of any setting aside; they do not in terms require taxpayers to set aside the amount due, nor do they direct any segregation or physical retention whatsoever. The only requirement is that taxpayers pay on or before a date after the close of the taxable year. This is not enough. Until that date taxpayers were free to use the specified percentages as they pleased, so far as the agreements were concerned. That prudent business judgment, or the possibility of fiduciary liability imposed by operation of law might have con- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 102, 108]\n\u00a0\n strained taxpayers to refrain from using these percentages and actually to set them aside is immaterial; such setting aside was not required by the terms of the written contracts, and therefore did not satisfy  26(c)(2). Cf. Helvering v. Northwest Steel Rolling Mills, \n311 \nU.S. 46, 52\n, 61 S.Ct. 109, 113. Likewise the fact that taxpayers actually irrevocably set the funds aside by anticipatory payments within the taxable year is of no moment, because these payments were voluntary and not pursuant to the command of the agreements.\n That Congress did not intend that the statutory condition of an irrevocable setting aside would be satisfied by a contract which, without more, merely requires that a percentage of earnings of the taxable year be paid in some future year for the discharge of a debt, is evident because such a construction reduces the alternative condition of  26(c)(2) relating to actual payment within the taxable year to a meaningless superfluity. The date specified for payment would become immaterial for all purposes if the mere requirement by contract of future payment out of earnings in a given year automatically entails an 'irrevocable setting aside' within that year.\n Taxpayers here place great emphasis upon the different prepositions used in the alternative phrases-'to be paid within the taxable year in discharge of a debt, or to be irrevocably set aside within the taxable year for the discharge of a debt'-to show that payment may be made after the taxable year compatibly with  26(c)(2). True enough, payment can be postponed to a future year and a credit allowed if, but only if, the contract directing such future payments requires in terms the irrevocable setting aside within the taxable year of those future payments. The instant contracts do not so provide.\n Respondents, The Ohio Leather Company and Warren Tool Corporation, contend that because they were on an accrual basis of accounting, they were entitled to the \n\n[317 \nU.S. 102, 109]\n\u00a0\n credit by virtue of  43, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 839,7 which states that it is to be disregarded in computing the credit provided by  27, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 837, and makes no statement with regard to  26. The contention is without merit because principles of accrual accounting have no bearing on the question of whether a contract in terms requires a payment or an irrevocable setting aside within the taxable year. The question here is not whether taxpayers made payment, either on a cash or an accrual basis, within the taxable year, but whether their contracts required them to pay or irrevocably set aside within the taxable year.\n Taxpayers insist that it would be unreasonable to hold that only contracts expressly requiring payment or an irrevocable setting aside of a percentage of earnings within the taxable year satisfy  26(c)(2) because many corporations are unable to determine their earnings until after the close of their fiscal year, and consequently their contracts disposing of a percentage of earnings in satisfaction of debt customarily allow some short period after the close of the year before payment is required. The legislative history of the 1936 Act reveals that Congress was conversant with the problem of computing earnings before the end of the taxable year, in connection with dividend payments, but declined to act. \n8\n Corporations \n\n[317 \nU.S. 102, 110]\n\u00a0\n with oral contracts, or written contracts executed after May 1, 1936, dealing with the disposition of profits in satisfaction of debts also probably think  26(c)(2) is a most unreasonable statute. But arguments urging the broadening of a tax deduction statute beyond its plain meaning to avoid harsh results are more properly addressed to Congress than to the courts. White v. United States, \n305 \nU.S. 281, 292\n, 59 S.Ct. 179, 184.9\n Finally taxpayers contend that the legislative history of  26(c)(2) supports the view that their contracts are covered by that section. An examination of the entire legislative background of the undistributed profits tax demonstrates, contrary to taxpayers' contentions, that Congress intended the tax to be imposed primarily upon income not distributed in the form of dividends, rather than only upon corporate income which was not distributed at all and accordingly meant to limit severely credits for a corporation's payment of debts and precisely to define the area in which taxpayers were to be entitled to the credit. Thus, while the original House bill contained complicated provisions affording some relief to corporations with deficits, or contractually obligated either to pay debts or not to pay dividends, the Senate Finance \n\n[317 \nU.S. 102, 111]\n\u00a0\n Committee struck them all out, substituting only a provision dealing with a credit for contractual prohibitions against the payment of dividends. 10 An amendment offered from the Senate floor giving a broad credit for all portions of adjusted net income used to purchase or replace machinery, equipment, etc., or 'expended or applied during the taxable year for the liquidation, payment, or reduction of the principal of any bona-fide indebtedness outstanding at the date of enactment of this Act' was rejected. 11 The much narrower amendment which became  26(c)(2) was then offered with little explanation other than that it was intended to supplement the credit for contractual prohibition against dividend payments, the provision which became  26(c)(1).12\n We conclude that the judgments below were erroneous. Accordingly they are reversed, and the causes remanded with directions to uphold the determination of the Commissioner.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Taxpayer in No. 42 is also claiming a credit for the 1937 taxable year. \n[\nFootnote 2\n]  26. Credits of Corporations\n'In the case of a corporation the following credits shall be allowed to the extent provided in the various sections imposing tax-\n\n'(c) Contracts Restricting Payment of Dividends.\n\n'(2) Disposition of profits of taxable year. An amount equal to the portion of the earnings and profits of the taxable year which is required ( by a provision of a written contract executed by the corporation prior to May 1, 1936, which provision expressly deals with the disposition of earnings and profits of the taxable year) to be paid within the taxable year in discharge of a debt, or to be irrevocably set aside within the taxable year for the discharge of a debt; to the extent that such amount has been so paid or set aside. For the purposes of this paragraph, a requirement to pay or set aside an amount equal to a percentage of earnings and profits shall be considered a requirement to pay or set aside such percentage of earnings and profits. As used in this paragraph, the word 'debt' does not include a debt incurred after April 30, 1936.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The relevant contractual provisions in each case are as follows:\n No. 40. By an indenture entered into on April 17, 1936, The Ohio Leather Company covenanted to pay $25,000 annually to a trustee to create a sinking fund for the security of its debentures, and further covenanted that it would 'on or before the next succeeding first day of April, pay an amount equal to ten per cent (10%) of the net earnings earned by the Company during the fiscal year ending on the thirty-first day of the next preceding December, as such net earnings are defined hereinafter in the Article, which sums and amounts shall by held by the Trustee for the security of all outstanding Debentures until paid out as hereinafter provided.'\n No. 41. By a note and mortgage agreement executed April 15, 1932, The Strong Manufacturing Company bound itself to apply forty per centum of its net earnings upon its unpaid obligation. The mortgage provided:\n'The Company covenants and agrees that until the principal and interest of the note hereby secured shall have been fully paid and beginning on January 1st, One Thousand nine hundred thirty four, the Company will apply forty per centum (40%) per annum of its net earnings for any calendar year in payment of the interest accruing and becoming payable upon such note in such year, and the balance of the principal amount of such note unpaid prior to April 15th in such year; provided, however, that the covenant herein made shall not be construed to relieve the Company from the payment on April 15th in such year of the installment specified for payment by the terms of said note nor of the regular interest payments in such year, likewise as specified in said note.\n\n'Settlement for all amounts becoming payable under this provision in excess of the principal and interest payments absolutely required in the calendar year as of which such net earnings are determined shall be made by the Company to the Bank not later than April 15th of the succeeding year.'\n\n No. 42. On November 1, 1932, the Warren Tool Corporation executed a first mortgage and deed of trust to secure a bond issue. The mortgage contained a sinking fund provision which required the Corporation on and after April 1, 1935, to pay to the trustee 'on or before the 1st day of April of each year thereafter to and including April 1, 1942, a sum of money equal to Twenty-five Per Cent (25%) of its net earnings for the calendar year next preceding.' \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] An opinion was written only in Commissioner v. Strong Mfg. Co., 6 Cir., 124 F.2d 360. The other two cases were per curiam affirmances on the authority of that opinion. 124 F.2d 397. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Compare Helvering v. Moloney Electric Co., 8 Cir., 120 F.2d 617, 621. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] This holding makes it unnecessary to consider the Commissioner's contention that The Strong Manufacturing Company did not meet the second requirement as to $5,000 of the $46,500 paid in 1936, because it was obligated to pay that sum by April 15, 1937, even in the event that there were no earnings in 1936. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] ' 43.

Section 27 defined 'dividend year' as the period beginning on the 15th day of the third month after the day before the beginning of the taxable year and ending on the 14th day of the third month after the close of the taxable year. Thus, where the calendar year and the taxable year coincided, the 'dividend year' would cover the period from March 15 of the taxable year to March 14 of the following year. Congressman Hill, chairman of the subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, explained that the 'dividend year' was designed to allow corporations time to cast up their accounts after the close of the taxable year and then determine what dividends should be distributed. 80 Cong.Rec. 6005. Nevertheless, Congressman Hill later offered, and the House adopted, a committee amendment substituting the 'taxable year' for the 'dividend year'. 80 Cong. Rec. 6308.

Gen., \n\n[316 \nU.S. 56, 57]\n\u00a0\n for petitioner.\n Mr. Charles McH. Howard, of Baltimore, Md., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Because of the importance in the administration of the Federal Estate Tax of the questions involved, we granted certiorari to review the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, 4 Cir., 121 F.2d 307, affirming a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, 42 B.T.A. 145.\n Zachary Smith Reynolds, age 20, died on July 6, 1932. At the time he was beneficiary of three trusts: one created by his father's will in 1918, one by deed executed by his mother in 1923, and one created by his mother's will in 1924. From his father's trust, the decedent was to receive only a portion of the income prior to his twenty-eighth birthday, at which time, if living he was to become the outright owner of the trust property and all accumulated income. His mother's trusts directed that he enjoy the income for life, subject to certain restrictions before he reached the age of 28. Each of the trusts gave the decedent a general testamentary power of appointment over the trust property; in default of exercise of the power the properties were to go to his descendants, or if he had none, to his brother and sisters and their issue per stirpes.\n The Commissioner included all the trust property within the decedent's gross estate for the purpose of computing the Federal Estate Tax. The Board of Tax Appeals and the Circuit Court of Appeals, however, held that no part of the trust property should have been included.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n The case presents two questions, the first of which is whether the decedent at the time of his death had by virtue of his general powers of appointment, even if never exer- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 56, 58]\n\u00a0\n cised, such an interest in the trust property as to require its inclusion in his gross estate under Section 302(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 9, 70, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts page 227. This section provides:\n'The value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time of his death of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated-\n\n'(a) To the extent of the interest therein of the decedent at the time of his death;'\n\n The government argues that at the time of his death the decedent had an 'interest' in the trust properties that should have been included in his gross estate, because he, to the exclusion of all other persons, could enjoy the income from them; would have received the corpus of one trust upon reaching the age of 28; and could alone decide to whom the benefits of all the trusts would pass at his death. These rights, it is said, were attributes of ownership substantially equivalent to a fee simple title, subject only to specified restrictions on alienation and the use of income. The respondents deny that the rights of the decedent with respect to any of the three trusts were substantially equivalent to ownership in fee, emphasizing the practical importance of the restrictions on alienation and the use of income, and arguing further that the decedent never actually had the capacity to make an effective testamentary disposition of the property because he died before reaching his majority.\n We find it unnecessary to decide between these conflicting contentions on the economic equivalence of the decedent's rights and complete ownership. \n1\n For even if we as- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 56, 59]\n\u00a0\n sume with the government that the restrictions upon the decedent's use and enjoyment of the trust properties may be dismissed as negligible and that he had the capacity to exercise a testamentary power of appointment, the question still remains: Did the decedent have 'at the time of his death' such an 'interest' as Congress intended to be included in a decedent's gross estate under Section 302(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926? It is not contended that the benefits during life which the trusts provided for the decedent, terminating as they did at his death, made the trust properties part of his gross estate under the statute. And viewing Section 302(a) in its background of legislative, judicial, and administrative history, we cannot reach the conclusion that the words 'interest ... of the decedent at the time of his death' were intended by Congress to include property subject to a general testamentary power of appointment unexercised by the decedent.\n The forerunner of Section 302(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926 was Section 202(a) of the Revenue Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 777. In United States v. Field, \n255 \nU.S. 257\n, 41 S.Ct. 256, 257, 18 A.L.R. 1461, this Court held that property passing under a general power of appointment exercised by a decedent was not such an 'interest' of the decedent as the 1916 Act brought within the decedent's gross estate. While the holding was limited to exercised powers of appointment, the approach of the Court, the authorities cited, and certain explicit statements2 in the opinion left little doubt that the Court \n\n[316 \nU.S. 56, 60]\n\u00a0\n regarded property subject to unexercised general powers of appointment as similarly beyond the scope of the statutory phrase 'interest of the decedent.' \n 3\n\u00a0\n\n After the Field case, the provision it passed upon was reenacted without change in the Revenue Act of 1921, Section 402(a), 42 Stat. 278, and in the Revenue Act of 1924, Section 302(a), 43 Stat. 304, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 67. If the implications of the Field opinion with respect to unexercised powers had been considered contrary to the intendment of the words 'interest of the decedent' it is reasonable to suppose that Congress would have added some clarifying amendment.\n If the counterparts in the earlier Acts of Section 302(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926 did not require the inclusion of property subject to an unexercised general testamentary power of appointment within the decedent's gross estate, there is no basis for concluding that the amendment of 1926 changed the act in this respect. Prior to 1926 an 'interest ... of the decedent' was to be included in his gross estate only if subject 'after his death ... to the payment of the charges against his estate and the expenses of its administration and ... subject to distribution as part of his estate.' 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts page 67. In the 1926 Act this qualification was abandoned. In the report accompanying the bill which embodied this change, the House Committee on Ways and Means stated only that 'In the interest of certainty it is recommended that the limiting language ... shall be eliminated in the proposed bill, so that the gross estate shall include the entire interest of the decedent at the time of his death in all the property.' 4 Nothing in the report \n\n[316 \nU.S. 56, 61]\n\u00a0\n suggested that the change was intended to have any relevance to powers of appointment, and no such intention can reasonably be inferred from the amended section itself. It is noteworthy that the regulations of the Bureau of Internal Revenue issued after passage of the 1926 Act contain no indication that the Treasury Department regarded the amendment as affecting unexercised powers of appointment. On the other hand, the article pertaining to powers of appointment was reincorporated in the 1926 regulations with the same content, so far as here relevant, as the corresponding article in the last regulations issued prior to the 1926 Act. \n 5\n\u00a0\n\n When it was held in the Field case that property subject to an exercised general testamentary power of appointment was not to be included in the decedent's gross estate under the Revenue Act of 1916, this Court referred to an amendment passed in 1919, 40 Stat. 1097,  402(e), which specifically declared property passing under an exercised general testamentary power to be part of the decedent's gross estate. The passage of this amendment, said the Court, 'indicates that Congress at least was doubtful whether the previous Act included property passing by appointment.' 6 In the face of such doubts, which cannot reasonably be supposed to have been less than doubts with respect to unexercised powers, Congress nevertheless specified only that property subject to exercised powers should be included. From this deliberate singling out of exercised powers alone, without the corroboration of the other matters we have discussed, a Congressional intent to treat unexercised powers otherwise can be de- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 56, 62]\n\u00a0\n duced. At the least, Section 302(f) of the 1926 Act,7 the counterpart of the 1919 amendment referred to in the Field case, represents a course of action followed by Congress since 1919 entirely consistent with a purpose to exclude from decedents' gross estates property subject to unexercised general testamentary powers of appointment.\n In no judicial opinion brought to our attention has it been held that the gross estate of a decedent includes, for purposes of the Federal Estate Tax, property subject to an unexercised general power. On the contrary, as the court below points out, 'the courts have been at pains to consider whether property passed under a general power or not so as to be taxable under section 302(f), a consideration which would have been absolutely unnecessary if the estate were taxable under 302(a) because of the mere existence of a general power whether exercised or not.' \n8\n 121 F.2d 307, 312. In addition, the uniform administrative practice until this case arose appears to have placed an interpretation upon the Federal Estate Tax contrary to that the government now urges. No regulations issued under the several revenue acts, including those in effect at the time this suit was initiated, prescribe that property subject to an unexer- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 56, 63]\n\u00a0\n cised general testamentary power of appointment should be included in a decedent's gross estate. Because of the cimbined effect of all of these circumstances, we believe that a departure from the long-standing, generally accepted9 construction of Section 302(a), now contested for the first time by the government, would override the best indications we have of Congressional intent.\n\n\n II.\n\n\n The second question is the treatment to be given, under Section 302(f) of the Revenue Act of 1926, to a share of the trust property passing to the decedent's brother and sisters as a result of a compromise settlement with other claimants. Should that share be included in whole or in part within the decedent's gross estate as 'property passing under a general power of appointment exercised by the decedent ... by will'?\n The claim of the brother and sisters was based upon: '(1) a purported exercise of the power of appointment in their favor by the decedent in a will he executed in New York, and in the alternative, (2) their right to take in default of appointment under the terms of the trusts. Each of the two children of the decedent (1) denied the validity of the New York will and (2) challenging the right of the brother and sisters to take in default, independently asserted his own. These issues, complicated by many other factors which it is unnecessary here to discuss, were never finally resolved by judicial decision, although there had been much litigation involving them in the North Carolina courts. Eventually, the several claimants agreed to a compromise under which 37 1\/2% of the trust property went to the brother and sisters. The compromise was \n\n[316 \nU.S. 56, 64]\n\u00a0\n confirmed by a judgment of the North Carolina Superior Court and this judgment was affirmed by the North Carolina Supreme Court. Reynolds v. Reynolds, 208 N.C. 578, 182 S.E. 341.\n The government contends that a portion of the share received by the brother and sisters reflects recognition by the other claimants as well as by the North Carolina courts of the assertion that the power of appointment was validly exercised; and that under the doctrine approved by this Court in Lyeth v. Hoey, \n305 \nU.S. 188\n, 59 S.Ct. 155, 119 A.L.R. 410, that portion must be treated as though it actually passed pursuant to an effective exercise of the power.\n The Lyeth case, like the one now before us, came to this Court after a compromise settlement. An heir of the decedent had contested the validity of the decedent's will in which no provision had been made for him. The heir and the devisees and legatees under the will entered into a compromise providing that the will be probated and that a specific sum be paid to the heir. We held that the money the heir received pursuant to the compromise should be treated, with respect to his tax liability under the federal income tax statute,10 as if acquired 'by inheritance' for the reason that it was possible for him to receive it only 'because of his standing as an heir and of his claim in that capacity.' \n11\n\u00a0\n\n The claim of the decedent's brother and sisters here, so far as based on the validity of the purported appointment, had its roots, like the claimed invalidity of the will in the Lyeth case, in an issue never decided in litigation. If it had been litigated to final judgment by a competent tribunal and the brother and sisters had succeeded in establishing the validity of the exercise of the power, the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 56, 65]\n\u00a0\n inclusion in the decedent's gross estate of what they would have received as appointees, pursuant to Section 302(f), could not seriously be questioned. In the Lyeth case we said that 'the distinction sought to be made between acquisition through such a judgment and acquisition by a compromise agreement in lieu of such a judgment is too formal to be sound.' 12 There is no less reason for the same conclusion here.\n The respondents contend that the principle of the Lyeth case, announced by the Court with respect to income tax liability, should not be controlling where, as here, the question is one of estate tax liability. It is urged that taxes should not be influenced by what occurs after the taxable event; that it is reasonable to consider a compromise preceding the receipt of income in connection with an income tax; but that a compromise occurring after the decedent's death, which is the 'taxable event' under an estate tax, should not be considered. Whatever may be the general rule in this respect,13 this Court has clearly recognized, in Helvering v. Grinnell, \n294 \nU.S. 153\n, 55 S.Ct. 354, that events subsequent to the decedent's death, events controlled by his beneficiaries, can determine the inclusion or not of certain assets within the decedent's gross estate under Section 302(f). In that case the decedent had exercised a general testamentary power of appointment, an act which under Section 302(f) brings the property subject to the power within the gross estate. The subsequent renouncement by the appointees of the right to receive by appointment and their election to take as remaindermen in default of appointment were held by this Court to place the property subject to the power outside the scope of Section 302(f). \n\n[316 \nU.S. 56, 66]\n\u00a0\n The respondents further contend that judicial determinations having been made in the state courts that the attempted appointment was invalid, the share of the brother and sisters in the compromise reflects only their alternative claim to the trust property. While there are explicit statements in the opinion of the North Carolina Superior Court that the attempted appointment was invalid, these statements must be regarded as superseded by the opinion which the North Carolina Supreme Court, whose determination constituted the final approval of the compromise, rendered on appeal. For, in the course of that opinion the Supreme Court gave clear recognition to the alleged validity of the decedent's attempted appointment as a basis of the claim the brother and sisters asserted. The court stated (208 N.C. 578, 618, 182 S.E. 341, 365):\n'Serious and grave questions of law and facts were raised. The judgment sets them out, and we refer to same, all troublesome; but we will consider one, for example: The validity and effect of the alleged will executed in New York by Zachary Smith Reynolds, as a basis of the offer of the brother and sisters of Zachary Smith Reynolds.'\n\n Inconsistent statements made in the course of a decree issued by the Circuit Court of Baltimore, Maryland, cannot be regarded as overcoming the force of the foregoing, since the decree purported only to authorize and direct the Maryland trustee to divide the trust property in accordance with the compromise as approved in North Carolina.\n How much, if any, of the 37 1\/2% going to the decedent's brother and sisters should be imputed to the claim based on the attempted exercise of the power of appointment and how much to their alternative claim we do not decide. In remanding this case to the Board of Tax Appeals for a determination of this issue, we recognize that a decision must necessarily be an approximation derived from the evaluation of elements not easily measured. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 56, 67]\n\u00a0\n In matters so practical as the administration of tax laws and in the decision of problems connected with them, a high degree of precision is often impossible to achieve. But it is far better to make such a rough estimate as the data will permit than completely to ignore the realities of the compromise because of the difficulties of evaluation. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed with directions to remand to the Board of Tax Appeals for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice ROBERTS, Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER and Mr. Justice BYRNES concur in the opinion of the court upon the first question decided. They dissent from the decision of the second question. They are of opinion that that question should be answered in favor of the respondents on the authority of Helvering v. Grinnell, \n294 \nU.S. 153\n, 55 S. Ct. 354, and that Lyeth v. Hoey, \n305 \nU.S. 188\n, 59 S.Ct. 155, 119 A.L.R. 410, furnishes no support for a different answer.\n The estate in question is not that of the decedent. The property is a portion of the estates of his mother and father. It is conceded that no part of either estate passed by virtue of the execution by the decedent of the powers of appointment with which he was clothed. The property passed under the deed and wills of his parents, and that passage was the taxable event. If he had voluntarily refrained from exercising the power, his estate would not have been liable to pay an estate tax for the property would then have passed from the estates of his mother and father to the distributees. But it has been decided by competent tribunals that he did not exercise the power although he attempted so to do; and, \n\n[316 \nU.S. 56, 68]\n\u00a0\n in any case there is no determination here, or elsewhere, that the power was ever exercised. This being so, the question is whether anything passed from him to his relatives under the intestate law at his death. It is plain that nothing did so pass.\n In Helvering v. Grinnell, supra, the decedent exercised the power but the appointees, as was their right under state law, elected not to take under the appointment but to take as remaindermen directly from the estate of the creator of the power, and it was held that  302, 26 U.S.C.A.Int. Rev.Acts, page 227, could not be invoked to impose a tax upon the estate of the decedent. It was there said:\n'The crucial words are 'property passing under a general power of appointment exercised by the decedent by will.' Analysis of this clause discloses three distinct requisites: (1) The existence of a general power of appointment; (2) an exercise of that power by the decedent by will; and ( 3) the passing of the property in virtue of such exercise. Clearly, the general power existed and was exercised; and this is not disputed. But it is equally clear that no property passed under the power or as a result of its exercise, since that result was definitely rejected by the beneficiaries. If they had wholly refused to take the property, it could not well be said that the property had passed under the power, for in that event it would not have passed at all. Can it properly be said that, because the beneficiaries elected to take the property under a distinct and separate title, the property nevertheless passed under the power? Plainly enough, we think, the answer must be in the negative.'\n\n Lyeth v. Hoey, supra, decides nothing to the contrary. In that case the property in question was the property of the decedent himself. He disposed of it by will. The will was contested. The contest was compromised and, as a result, those who were his heirs at law received at \n\n[316 \nU.S. 56, 69]\n\u00a0\n least a portion of that which they would have received as his heirs in the absence of a will. Thus, as a result of the compromise, property did pass from the decedent to his heirs at law and it was held that, as they were his heirs, they took by inheritance in contemplation of the Revenue Act. Here nothing passed by virtue of the exercise of the power and no portion of the decedent's estate passed under the law of descent and distribution, or as property would have passed under that law from the dececent to the beneficiaries of the compromise.\n We are at a loss to understand how the Board of Tax Appeals can be permitted to find that any taxable transfer occurred within the meaning of  302 of the Revenue Act of 1926. Moreover, the compromise was motivated by considerations other than the invalidity of the power, fortheclaims ofthe invalidity of the power, for the claims of the in bringing it about. We cannot perceive how the Board can calculate the relative weight of these conflicting claims and thus assess as taxable an apportioned part of the total amount the decedent's collateral relatives received, and thus determine what part of the property passed under the power and what part did not. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In declining to pass upon this issue, we do not reject the principle we have often recognized that the realities of the taxpayer's economic interest rather than the niceties of the conveyancer's art should determine the power to tax.

Francis Biddle, Atty. Gen., and Samuel O. Clark, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. A. Chauncey Newlin, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The primary problem in this case is whether the transaction in question qualified as a 'reorganization' under  112(g)(1) of the Revenue Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 680, 705, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 695. Sec. 112(g) provides: \n\n[315 \nU.S. 194, 196]\n\u00a0\n 'As used in this section and section 113-\n'(1) The term 'reorganization' means (A) a statutory merger or consolidation, or (B) the acquisition by one corporation in exchange solely for all or a part of its voting stock: of at least 80 per centum of the voting stock and at least 80 per centum of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of another corporation; or of substantially all the properties of another corporation, or (C) a transfer by a corporation of all or a part of its assets to another corporation if immediately after the transfer the transferor or its stockholders or both are in control of the corporation to which the assets are transferred, or ( D) a recapitalization, or (E) a mere change in identity, form, or place of organization, however effected.'\n\n Respondent filed an income and excess profits tax return for a part of the year 1934 and for the entire year 1935, reporting a net loss for each year. Petitioner, in determining deficiencies, made certain adjustments on the theory that the acquisition by respondent in 1934 of all of the assets of its predecessor, Southwest Gas Utilities Corp., was not a 'reorganization' as defined in  112(g)(1). The cost basis of the assets in the hands of the old corporation had been about $9,000,000. They were purchased at foreclosure and receivership sales for $752,000. Respondent used the former figure as the basis in computing gains and losses on the acquired assets. Thus it deducted some $75,000 as bad debts. Petitioner in using the lower figure as the basis allowed that deduction only to the extent of $1.26. Deficiencies computed on that theory showed a net income, rather than a net loss, for each year. The Board of Tax Appeals rejected the Commissioner's view. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[315 \nU.S. 194, 197]\n\u00a0\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Board. 5 Cir., 119 F.2d 561.\n The old corporation was burdened with some $2,870,000 face amount of first lien bonds, certain unsecured claims, and issues of preferred and common stock. There was a default in interest on the bonds in May, 1932. A bondholders' committee was formed which obtained the deposit of about 85% of the bonds outstanding. Members of the committee became directors of the old corporation and beginning in the fall of 1932 were in control of it. In 1934 equity receivers were appointed by the Delaware chancery court. A plan of reorganization was formulated which was approved by the court. The plan called for the formation of a new company which would acquire the assets of the old in exchange for voting common stock and Class A and Class B stock purchase warrants. Most of the common stock, issued under the plan, was to go to the bondholders; a small portion, together with the Class A warrants, was to be issued to the unsecured creditors. Class B warrants were to be issued to the preferred and common stockholders. Pursuant to the plan and a court order, the assets securing the bonds were sold by the indenture trustee at a foreclosure sale in 1934. They were bid in by the bondholders' committee for $660,000. The unpledged assets also were sold at public auction and were bought in by the committee for $92, 000. Respondent was thereupon formed and the committee transferred all the assets of the old corporation to it. The Board found that the fair market value of the assets at that time was $1,766,694.98. The stock and warrants of respondent were distributed pursuant to the plan. Non-participating security holders, owning $440,000 face amount of obligations, received about $106,680 in cash. The cash necessary to make this payment was obtained by a loan from a bank. The loan was assumed by the respondent and later repaid by it. About 49,300 shares of common \n\n[315 \nU.S. 194, 198]\n\u00a0\n stock and 2,760 Class A warrants were issued to the creditors; over 18,445 Class B warrants were issued to the stockholders. Class A warrants carried the right to buy one share of common stock at $6 a share during 1934, the price being increased $1 per share each year until expiration in 1938. Class B warrants carried the same right except that the price was $10 a share during 1934 and was increased by $5 per share each year until expiration in 1938. There were 1,760 Class A warrants and 4,623 of the Class B warrants exercised. On the basis of the fair market value of the assets at the time they were acquired in the reorganization, respondent computes that the Class A warrants had a value of $29 each and the Class B warrants a value of $25 each.\n Under the statute involved in Helvering v. Alabama Asphaltic Limestone Co., \n315 \nU.S. 179\n, 62 S.Ct. 540, 86 L.Ed. --, decided this day, there would have been a 'reorganization' here. For the creditors of the old company had acquired substantially the entire proprietary interest of the old stockholders. See Helvering v. Minnesota Tea Co., \n296 \nU.S. 378\n, 56 S.Ct. 269. But clause (B) of  112(g)(1) of the 1934 Act effects an important change as respects transactions whereby one corporation acquires substantially all of the assets of another. See S. Rep. No. 558, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., Committee Reports, Revenue Acts 1913- 1938, pp. 598-599. The continuity of interest test is made much stricter. See Paul, Studies in Federal Taxation (3rd Series), pp. 36-41. Congress has provided that the assets of the transferor corporation must be acquired in exchange 'solely' for 'voting stock' of the transferee. 'Solely' leaves no leeway. Voting stock plus some other consideration does not meet the statutory requirement. See Hendricks, Developments in the Taxation of Reorganizations, 34 Col.L.Rev. 1198, 1202-1203. Congress, however, in 1939 amended clause (B) of  112(g)(1) by adding, 'but in determining whether the exchange is solely for voting stock the assumption by the acquiring \n\n[315 \nU.S. 194, 199]\n\u00a0\n corporation of a liability of the other, or the fact that property acquired is subject to a liability, shall be disregarded.' 53 Stat. 871, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 1177. That amendment was made to avoid the consequences of United States v. Hendler, \n303 \nU.S. 564\n, 58 S.Ct. 655. See H. Rep. No. 855, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 18-20; S. Rep. No. 648, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 3. And it was made retroactive so as to include the 1934 Act. 53 Stat. 872, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 1178. But with that exception, the requirements of  112(g)(1)(B) are not met if properties are acquired in exchange for a consideration other than, or in addition to, voting stock. Under that test this transaction fails to qualify as a 'reorganization' under clause (B).\n In the first place, security holders of the old company owning $440, 000 face amount of obligations were paid off in cash. That cash was raised during the reorganization on a loan from a bank. Since that loan was assumed by respondent, it is argued that the requirement of clause (B), as amended in 1939, was satisfied. But in substance the transaction was precisely the same as if respondent had paid cash plus voting stock for the properties. We search the legislative history of the 1939 amendment in vain for any indication that it was designed to do more than to alter the rule of the Hendler case. That case dealt with a situation where an indebtedness which antedated the transaction in question was assumed by the transferee. There the debt assumed clearly was a 'liability of the other' corporation. The situation here is quite different. The rights of the security holders against the old corporation were drastically altered by the sale made pursuant to the plan. The sale not only removed the lien from the property and altered the rights of the security holders in it; it also limited and defined the rights of the individual creditors if they elected to take cash rather than participate in the plan. See Weiner, Conflicting Functions of the Upset Price, 27 Col.L.Rev. 132, 137-138. In Helvering v. Alabama Asphaltic Limestone Co., supra, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 194, 200]\n\u00a0\n we regarded the several steps in a reorganization as mere 'intermediate procedural devices utilized to enable the new corporation to acquire all the assets of the old one pursuant to a single reorganization plan.' Under that approach part of the consideration which respondent paid for the properties of its predecessor was cash in the amount of about $106,680. The fact that it was paid to the bank rather than to the old corporation or its creditors is immaterial. The requirement to pay cash arose out of the reorganization itself. It derived, as did the requirement to pay stock, from the plan pursuant to which the properties were acquired. It was a necessary incident of the court decree which wiped out the liability of the old corporation and substituted another one in its place. Though the liability assumed had its origin in obligations of the transferor, its nature and amount were determined and fixed in the reorganization. It therefore cannot be labelled as an obligation of the 'other' or predecessor corporation within the meaning of the 1939 amendment. Nor can the property be said to have been acquired 'subject to' that liability within the purview of that amendment. The words 'subject to' normally connote in legal parlance an absence of personal obligation. That seems to be the case here, for the preceding clause of the amendment covers the case of 'assumption'.\n In the second place, the warrants which were issued were not 'voting stock'. Whatever rights a warrant holder may have 'to require the obligor corporation to maintain the integrity of the shares' covered by the warrants (see Berle, Studies in the Law of Corporation Finance (1928), pp. 136-142) he is not a shareholder. Gay v. Burgess Mills, 30 R.I. 231, 74 A. 714. Cf. Miles v. Safe Deposit Co., \n259 \nU.S. 247, 252\n, 42 S.Ct. 483, 485. His rights are wholly contractual. As stated by Holmes, J., in Parkinson v. West End Street Ry., 173 Mass. 446, 448, 53 N.E. 891, 892, he 'does not become a stockholder, by his contract, in \n\n[315 \nU.S. 194, 201]\n\u00a0\n equity any more than at law.' At times his right may expire on the consolidation of the obligor corporation with another. Id. If at the time he exercises his right there are no authorized and unissued shares to satisfy his demand, he will get damages not specific performance. Bratten v. Catawissa Railroad Co., 211 Pa. 21, 60 A. 319. And see Van Allen v. Illinois Central Railroad Co., 20 N.Y.Super.Ct. 515, 7 Bosw. 515. Thus he does not have, and may never acquire, any legal or equitable rights in shares of stock. Lisman v. Milwaukee, L.S. & W. Ry. Co., C.C., 161 F. 472, 480, affirmed 7 Cir., 170 F. 1020. And he cannot assert the rights of a shareholder. See Hills, Convertible Securities, 19 Calif.L.Rev. 1, 4. Accordingly, the acquisition in this case was not made 'solely' for voting stock. \n2\n And it makes no difference that in the long run the unexercised warrants expired and nothing but voting stock was outstanding. The critical time is the date of the exchange. In that posture of the case it is no different than if other convertible securities had been issued, all of which had been converted within the conversion period.\n Nor can this transaction qualify as a 'reorganization' under clause ( C) of  112(g)(1), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 696. That clause requires that 'immediately after the transfer' the 'transferor or its stockholders or both' be in 'control' of the transferee corporation. 'Control' is defined in  112(h), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 696, as 'the ownership of at least 80 per centum of the voting stock and at least 80 per centum of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of the corporation.' Here 'control' at the critical date was not in the old corporation or its 'stockholders'. The participating creditors had received pursuant to the plan rights to receive over a majority of the stock of the new company even though all of the war- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 194, 202]\n\u00a0\n rants allocated to stockholders had been issued and exercised. The contrary conclusion was reached in Commissioner v. Cement Investors, Inc., 10 Cir., 122 F.2d 380, 384, on the theory that the bondholders of the insolvent predecessor company could be regarded as its 'stockholders' within the meaning of  112(g) (1)(C), since they had acquired an equitable interest in the property and were empowered to supplant the stockholders. We have adopted that theory in Helvering v. Alabama Asphaltic Limestone Co., supra, in determining whether the bondholders had retained a sufficient continuity in interest so as to bring the transaction within the statutory definition of merger or consolidation contained in the revenue acts prior to 1934. But it is one thing to say that the bondholders 'stepped into the shoes of the old stockholders' so as to acquire the proprietary interest in the insolvent company. It is quite another to say that they were the 'stockholders' of the old company within the purview of clause (C). In the latter Congress was describing an existing, specified class of security holders of the transferor corporation. That class, as we have seen, received a participation in the plan of reorganization. For purposes of clause (C) they must be counted in determining where 'control' over the new company lay. They cannot be treated under clause (C) as something other than 'stockholders' of the old company merely because they acquired a minority interest in the new one. Indeed clause (C) contemplates that the old corporation or its stockholders, rather than its creditors, shall be in the dominant position of 'control' immediately after the transfer and not excluded or relegated to a minority position. Plainly the normal pattern of insolvency reorganization does not fit its requirements.\n Clause (D) is likewise inapplicable. There was not that reshuffling of a capital structure within the framework of an existing corporation contemplated by the term 'recapitalization'. And a transaction which shifts the owner- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 194, 203]\n\u00a0\n ship of the proprietary interest in a corporation is hardly 'a mere change in identity, form, or place of organization' within the meaning of clause ( E).\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The petition for review by the taxpayer contended that this transaction was a 'reorganization' within the purview of  112(g)(1) and therefore that the carry-over basis provided in  113(a)(7), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts page 698, was applicable. No other issues were raised or considered by the Board or the court below. We pass only on that question leaving open such other questions as may be appropriately presented to the Board. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The contrary view expressed in a letter by the Commissioner dated January 27, 1937 (1937 C.C.H.Vol. 3, Par. 6118) does not have the status of a formal ruling of the Treasury nor does it seem to reflect an established course of administrative construction. \n\n\n\n\n","55":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHELVERING v. STUART(1942)\nNo. 49\nArgued: Decided: November 16, 1942\n\n\n\n As Modified on Denial of Rehearing Dec. 14, 1942.[ Helvering v. Stuart \n317 \nU.S. 154\n (1942) ]\n\n\n[317 \nU.S. 154, 156]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Francis Biddle, Atty. Gen., and Samuel O. Clark, Jr., Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Herbert Pope and George I. Haight, both of Chicago, Ill., for respondent R. Douglas Stuart.\n Mr. Herbert Pope, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent John Stuart.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These petitions for certiorari bring here the liability of each respondent for increased income taxes for the years 1934 and 1935. A deficiency was determined by the Commissioner for each year because of the taxpayers' failure to include in their returns income from various trusts previously created by them for the benefit of their children.\n The taxpayers are brothers, residents of Illinois. In 1930 John Stuart, the respondent in No. 48, created one trust for each of his three children: Joan, Ellen and John. Later, in 1932, R. Douglas Stuart, the respondent in No. 49, created such trusts for each of his four children: Robert, Anne, Margaret and Harriet. The trusts were much alike. They were made in Illinois and specifically provided that they were to be governed by the laws of that state. The three children of John were all of age \n\n[317 \nU.S. 154, 157]\n\u00a0\n by January 1, 1934. None of the children of Douglas were of age during either of the taxable years.\n By the creation of the trusts, each taxpayer transferred to three trustees certain shares of the common stock of the Quaker Oats Company, of which respondents were respectively president and first vice-president. The trustees named in each instrument were the taxpayer-settlor, his wife and his brother. The trusts created by John thus had John, his wife and Douglas as trustees and those created by Douglas had Douglas, his wife and John as trustees.\n The trustees were given the power and authority of 'absolute owners' over the handling of the financial details of the respective trusts. They were freed from liability or responsibility except such as were due to actual fraud or willful mismanagement.\n In the trusts created by R. Douglas Stuart for his minor children, the trustees were directed to 'pay over to (the beneficiary) so much of the net income from the Trust Fund, or shall apply so much of said income for his education, support and maintenance, as to them shall seem advisable, and in such manner as to them shall seem best, and free from control of any guardian, the unexpended portion, if any, of such income to be added to the principal of the Trust Fund. When the said (beneficiary) shall attain the age of twenty-five years, the Trustees shall pay over and deliver to him one-half of the Trust Fund; and they shall pay over to him in reasonable installments the income from the remaining one-half of the Trust Fund until he shall attain the age of thirty years, when they shall pay over and deliver to him the remainder of the Trust Fund.'\n In the trusts created by John Stuart for his adult children the directions were that the trustees should for fifteen years 'pay over and distribute, in reasonable in- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 154, 158]\n\u00a0\n stallments,' to the beneficiaries so much of the net income 'as they in their sole discretion shall deem advisable, the undistributed portion of such income to be added to and become a part of the principal of the Trust Fund.' After the fifteen years, the entire net income was to be paid to the beneficiary for and during her life.\n Each trust provided for the devolution of the corpus to the issue of the beneficiary named in the instrument and in default of such issue to the issue of the donor and in default of issue of either, to named educational or charitable institutions.\n Two paragraphs relating to changes and amendments are important. They were the same in all the instruments and read as follows:\n'Eighth. The Donor reserves and shall have the right at any time and from time to time to direct the Trustees to sell the whole of the Trust Fund, or any part thereof, and to reinvest the proceeds in such other property as the Donor shall direct. The Donor further reserves and shall have the right at any time and from time to time to withdraw and take over to himself the whole or any part of the Trust Fund upon first transferring and delivering to the Trustees other property satisfactory to them of a market value at least equal to that of the property so withdrawn.\n\n'Ninth. During the life of the Donor, the said (wife and brother of the donor), or the survivor of them, shall have full power and authority, by an instrument in writing signed and delivered by them or by the survivor of them to the Trustees, to alter, change or amend this Indenture at any time and from time to time by changing the beneficiary hereunder, or by changing the time when the Trust Fund, or any part thereof, or the income, is to be distributed, or by changing the Trustees, or in any other respect.' \n\n[317 \nU.S. 154, 159]\n\u00a0\n Pursuant to the authority of paragraph ninth, the two trustees authorized in the trusts to make changes did provide on the 2d and 3d of August, 1935, respectively, for the cancellation and expunction of both the eighth and ninth paragraphs set out above and for the substitution of the following in lieu of the expunged ninth paragraph:\n\n'Ninth. This Indenture and all of the provisions thereof are irrevocable and not subject to alteration, change or amendment.' The Commissioner does not claim that any trust income received after these amendments is attributable to the taxpayers.\n\n In answer to the taxpayer's petition in No. 49 for the redetermination of the deficiencies, the Commissioner asserted the increase was required by the provisions of Sections 22, 166, and 167 of the Revenue Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 680, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Acts, pages 669, 727. Section 22 was not raised by the Commissioner in his answer to the petition in No. 48. But the applicability of that section was raised by the Commissioner as appellee before the Circuit Court of Appeals. Helvering v. Gowran, \n302 \nU.S. 238, 245\n, 58 S.Ct. 154, 158. The contention in the Court of Appeals rested on the facts stipulated in the Board of Tax Appeals. On the rejection of that ground in the court below the Commissioner was entitled to raise the question, as he did, in his petition for certiorari and rely on Section 22 in this Court. Helvering v. Gowran, \n302 \nU.S. 246\n, 58 S.Ct. 158; cf. Hormel v. Helvering, \n312 \nU.S. 552\n, 61 S.Ct. 719. So far as pertinent the sections are set out in the footnote below.* \n\n[317 \nU.S. 154, 160]\n\u00a0\n The Board of Tax Appeals upheld the Commissioner's determinations that Section 166 governed the trusts' incomes because the powers of the wife and brother, as trustees, under the ninth paragraph were sufficient to revest the funds in the grantors and because the trustees were without substantial adverse interests. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this determination, Stuart v. Commissioner, 7 Cir., 124 F.2d 772, 777, on its conclusion that under the law of Illinois 'the wife and brother as trustees had no authority ... to revest the property in the grantor.' The same reasoning led the appellate court to say that neither Section 167 nor 22 was applicable, except as to the income of the Douglas Stuart trusts actually used for the support of a minor child. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 154, 161]\n\u00a0\n The applications for certiorari were granted because of differing views in the courts of appeals as to the inclusion of the incomes of trusts with similar provisions in the gross incomes of the donors by virtue of the sections of the Act relied upon by the Commissioner. Altmaier v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 116 F.2d 162; Fulham v. Commissioner, 1 Cir., 110 F.2d 916; Whiteley v. Commissioner, 3 Cir., 120 F.2d 782; Commissioner v. Buck, 2 Cir., 120 F.2d 775.\n To reach a decision as to the applicability of Sections 166 and 167 of the Revenue Act of 1934, see footnote page 3 (63 S.Ct. 144) supra, to these trusts, the instruments must be construed to determine whether the power to revest title to any part of the corpora in the grantors or to distribute to them any of the income lies with any persons not having a substantial adverse interest to the grantors. That construction must be made in the light of rules of law for the interpretation of such documents. The intention of Congress controls what law, federal or state, is to be applied. Burnet v. Harmel, \n287 \nU.S. 103, 110\n, 53 S.Ct. 74, 77; Lyeth v. Hoey, \n305 \nU.S. 188, 194\n, 59 S.Ct. 155, 158, 119 A.L.R. 410. Since the federal revenue laws are designed for a national scheme of taxation, their provisions are not to be deemed subject to state law 'unless the language or necessary implication of the section involved' so requires. United States v. Pelzer, \n312 \nU.S. 399, 402\n, 403 S., 61 S.Ct. 659, 661. This decision applied federal definition to determine whether an interest in property was called a 'future interest.' When Congress fixes a tax on the possibility of the revesting of property or the distribution of income, the 'necessary implication,' we think, is that the possibility is to be determined by the state law. Grantees under deeds, wills and trusts, alike, take according to the rule of the state law. The power to transfer or distribute assets of a trust is essentially a matter of local law. Blair v. Commissioner, \n300 \nU.S. 5, 9\n, 57 S.Ct. 330, 331; Freuler v. Helvering, 291 \n\n[317 \nU.S. 154, 162]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 35, 43-45, 54 S.Ct. 308, 311, 312.1 Congress has selected an event, that is the receipt or distributions of trust funds by or to a grantor, normally brought about by local law, and has directed a tax to be levied if that event may occur. Whether that event may or may not occur depends upon the interpretation placed upon the terms of the instrument by state law. Once rights are obtained by local law, whatever they may be called, these rights are subject to the federal definition of taxability. Recently in dealing with the estate tax levied upon the value of property passing under a general power, we said that 'state law creates legal interests and rights. The federal revenue acts designate what interests or rights, so created, shall be taxed.' Morgan v. Commissioner, \n309 \nU.S. 78, 80\n, 626 S., 60 S.Ct. 424, 426 (a case dealing with the taxability at death of property passing under a general power of appointment). In this case, as in Lyeth v. Hoey,2 we were determining what interests or rights should be taxed, not what interests or rights had been created and therefore applied the federal rule. Cf. Burnet v. Harmel, \n287 \nU.S. 103, 110\n, 53 S.Ct. 74, 77; Palmer v. Bender, \n287 \nU.S. 551, 555\n, 53 S.Ct. 225, 226; Heiner v. Mellon, \n304 \nU.S. 271, 279\n, 58 S.Ct. 926, 930; Helvering v. Fuller, \n310 \nU.S. 69, 74\n, 60 S.Ct. 784, 787. In this view the rules of law to be applied are those of Illinois. That state is the residence of the parties, the place of execution of the instrument, as well as the jurisdiction chosen by the parties to govern the instrument.\n This was the view of the Circuit Court of Appeals. 7 Cir., 124 F.2d 772, 777. Their examination of the Illinois law \n\n[317 \nU.S. 154, 163]\n\u00a0\n led them to conclude that 'the wife and brother as trustees had no authority under the Illinois law to revest the property in the grantor,' a requirement for liability under Section 166. This conclusion does not spring from a statute of that state nor even from a clear or satisfying line of decisions. It is, however, the reasoned judgment of the circuit which includes Illinois in which a judge of long experience in the jurisprudence of that state participated. Without a definite conviction of error in the conclusion, this Court will not reverse that judgment. MacGregor v. State Mutual Life Assurance Company, \n315 \nU.S. 280\n, 62 S.Ct. 607. Cf. Reitz v. Mealey, \n314 \nU.S. 33\n, page 39, 62 S.Ct. 24, 28; Railroad Comm. v. Pullman Co., \n312 \nU.S. 496, 499\n, 61 S.Ct. 643, 644.\n The Government does not challenge the conclusion of the Court of Appeals that Illinois law controls. It sharply differs as to the meaning of paragraph ninth, construed generally, and as to the Illinois rule but does not urge that a federal rule of interpretation applies.\n The suggestion is made that Helvering v. Fitch, \n309 \nU.S. 149, 156\n, 60 S.Ct. 427, 430; Helvering v. Fuller, \n310 \nU.S. 69\n, 60 S.Ct. 784; Helvering v. Leonard, \n310 \nU.S. 80\n, 60 S.Ct. 780; and Pearce v. Commissioner, \n315 \nU.S. 543\n, 62 S.Ct. 754, require determination by this Court of the Illinois law. In each of these cases after courts of appeals had given their opinion of the law of the respective states on the power of the state courts to alter or revise property settlements in judgments of divorce, we reviewed the state decisions to determine whether the husband or wife was taxable under the Federal tax system upon the income from the settlements. This depended upon whether the husband could show clearly and convincingly under the state law that the settlement income was not received by the wife pursuant to his continuing obligation to support or whether the wife could raise doubts and uncertainties as to the proper conclusion. Pearce v. Commissioner, supra, \n315 \nU.S. 547\n, 62 S.Ct. 756. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 154, 164]\n\u00a0\n It is true we examined the state cases to determine the applicable state law but we did it for the purpose of determining whether the taxpayers had met their burden of proving the Commissioner of Internal Revenue wrong in assessing deficiencies against them. We could do the same here but we are satisfied that the finding of the Court of Appeals on Illinois law is a determination that meets that burden. A requirement of a demonstration of state law, 'clearly and convincingly' may well necessitate a review of the conclusion of the Court of Appeals, while a requirement of a finding, as here, of the ultimate fact as to the law would not. If reasonably avoidable we should certainly avoid becoming a Court of first instance for the determination of the varied rules of local law prevailing in the forty-eight states. Nor do we see any reason why we should prefer the view of the Board of Tax Appeals concerning Illinois law to that of the Circuit Court of Appeals within which Illinois is embraced.\n One cannot say that it would be an arbitrary or unreasonable or even an unlikely holding on the part of the courts of Illinois to conclude that under the terms of these trusts, equity ought to and would prevent the wife and brother of the donor, claiming authority under the provisions of paragraph nine of the indenture, from vesting the property in themselves or in the donor or in others for the benefit of themselves or the donor, to the detriment of the present beneficiaries. To support this construction, the Court of Appeals cites Frank v. Frank, 305 Ill. 181, 187, 137 N.E. 151, 152. In that case there was a deed for a life estate in reality with vested remainder to others with 'full power and authority' to the life tenant to sell the premises by her sole deed. The life tenant sold the fee for life support, a consideration necessarily usable by the life tenant alone. The power was construed as applicable to the life estate alone and its use unauthorized \n\n[317 \nU.S. 154, 165]\n\u00a0\n for the fee. In Rock Island Bank & Tr. Co. v. Rhoads, 353 Ill. 131, 142, 187 N.E. 139, 141, the Supreme Court of that state construed the authority of a life tenant to use and dispose of the property as may 'in her judgment be necessary for her comfort and satisfaction in life' to stop short of permitting her to add any of the life estate property to build up her own separate estate. For the authority of courts of equity in Illinois over trustees, there are cited cases establishing their general power to require action in accordance with the intent of the donor. Maguire v. City of Macomb, 293 Ill. 441, 453, 127 N.E. 682; Jones v. Jones, 124 Ill. 254, 262, 264, 15 N.E. 751; Welch v. Caldwell, 226 Ill. 488, 495, 498, 80 N.E. 1014\n\n\n The Commissioner cites no Illinois cases which bring us to a conviction of error on the part of the Court of Appeals. People v. Kaiser, 306 Ill. 313, 137 N.E. 826, goes no further than to say a residuary estate bequeathed to a trustee for gifts to such charitable institutions or needy persons as the trustee deems deserving will be enforced by the courts. It also seems that in Illinois a general power of appointment is exercisable in favor of the donee or his creditors. 306 Ill. 317, 137 N.E. 826; Gilman v. Bell, 99 Ill. 144, 149; Botzum v. Havana Nat. Bank, 367 Ill. 539, 543, 12 N.E.2d 203. But evidently the Court of Appeals does not consider that these trustees under Illinois law have the power to vest this property in themselves. Such a result follows from their view that the property could not be vested in the grantors. Consequently, this power of the trustees is not a general power but a power in trust exercisable as fiduciaries to carry out the purposes of the trust. We therefore do not need to decide whether if they could vest the property in themselves they would have an interest adverse to the grantor. Without that power their interest certainly is not adverse. Cf. Reinecke v. Smith, \n289 \nU.S. 172, 174\n, 53 S. Ct. 570. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 154, 166]\n\u00a0\n The real issue is whether, under Illinois law, the trustees' authority under paragraph nine of the trust instruments 'to alter, change or amend this Indenture at any time and from time to time by changing the beneficiary hereunder ... or in any other respect,' does so far as to permit the substitution of the donor for the beneficiaries. Would the trustees with authority to change the terms and 'the time when the Trust Fund ... is to be distributed' be permitted to revoke the trust and thus vest the corpus in the donor. These quesions are answered in the negative by the Court of Appeals and we accept that conclusion. These trusts, therefore, stand as though an Illinois statute or a provision of the instruments forbade assignments of any of the corpora or of the income to the grantors except as may be specifically provided by their terms. The exception is of importance in examining the trusts' provisions for the minor children of Douglas Stuart.\n On the assumption that the Illinois law forbids the vesting of the trust res in the taxpayers under Section 166, it would also be impossible for the trustees to accumulate the income for or to distribute it to the grantor directly so as to come within Section 167. 7 Cir., 124 F.2d 772, 778. Consequently, the contention that the donors are taxable, as direct beneficiaries, because of the provisions of Section 167 alone, must fail. Could it be, however, that the donors were taxable under Section 167 because the trustees could change the beneficiaries of the trusts to the creditors of the donors or to any other person and thereby relieve the donor of a legal obligation? Assuming that such a change would result in a distribution to the grantor under Section 167 and Douglas v. Willcuts, \n296 \nU.S. 1\n, 56 S.Ct. 59, 101 A.L.R. 391, the ruling of the Court of Appeals on Illinois law forbids such a distribution from these trusts. A decision that a donor cannot take from a trust under state law certainly prohibits a change of the instrument so as to relieve the donor of legal obligations. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 154, 167]\n\u00a0\n The Commissioner, however, raised in the Court of Appeals and has pressed here the liability of the donors for taxation under 22(a), see footnote page 3 (63 S.Ct. 143), on the ground that the trust incomes are chargeable to the donors under the rule of Helvering v. Clifford, \n309 \nU.S. 331\n, 60 S.Ct. 554. That is, whether after the establishment of the trust the grantor may still be treated as the owner of the corpus and therefore taxable on its income. It is obvious that if each of the trust incomes is attributable to the donors under this rule, they become a part of the present taxpayers' income under Section 167(a)(1) and (2) also. This leads us to consider both Section 22(a) and Section 167, and their interplay on one another, together.\n Section 167 took its present form in the Revenue Act of 1932, 26 U.S. C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 543. It was enacted especially to prevent avoidance of surtax by the trust device, when the income really remained in substance at the disposal of the settlor. S. Rep. No. 665, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 34-35. It is to be interpreted in the light of its purpose for the protection of the federal revenue. United States v. Hodson, 10 Wall. 395, 406; United States v. Pelzer, \n312 \nU.S. 399, 403\n, 61 S.Ct. 659, 661. Of course, where the settlor or donor is not actually or in substance a present or possible beneficiary of the trust, he escapes the surtax by a gift in trust. Revenue Act of 1934, Secs. 161 to 168, Supplement E, 48 Stat. 727, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts pages 725- 728. Cf. Helvering v. Fuller, \n310 \nU.S. 69, 74\n, 60 S.Ct. 784, 787. In the absence of a legislative rule, we have left to the process of repeated adjudications, the line between 'gifts of incomeproducing property and gifts of income from property of which the donor remains the owner, for all substantial and practical purposes.' Harrison v. Schaffner, \n312 \nU.S. 579, 583\n, 61 S.Ct. 759, 762.\n In the John Stuart trusts the trustees, in their discretion, were to distribute income to the named beneficiaries for fifteen years and thereafter to distribute the entire net income. In the Douglas Stuart trusts, the directions authorized discretionary distribution to the beneficiaries \n\n[317 \nU.S. 154, 168]\n\u00a0\n or its application to their education, support and maintenance until the children reached the age of twenty-five years. Undistributed portions of the income were to be added to the corpus. Plainly, these distributions or accumulations were to be used for the economic advantage of the children of the settlors and to the amount of these distributions and accumulations would satisfy the normal desire of a parent to make gifts to his children. Is this alone sufficient to make the income of the trusts taxable to the settlors?\n Disregarding for the moment the minority of some of the beneficiaries, we think not. So broad a basis would tax to a father the income of a simple trust with a disinterested trustee for the benefit of his adult child. No act of Congress manifests such an intention. Economic gain realized or realizable by the taxpayer is necessary to produce a taxable income under our statutory scheme. That gain need not be collected by the taxpayer. He may give away the right to receive it as was done in Helvering v. Horst, \n311 \nU.S. 112\n, 61 S.Ct. 144, 131 A.L.R. 655; Helvering v. Eubank, \n311 \nU.S. 122, 125\n, 61 S.Ct. 149, 150, and Harrison v. Schaffner, \n312 \nU.S. 579\n, 61 S.Ct. 759. But the donor nevertheless had the 'use (realization) of his economic gain.' 311 U.S. at page 117, 61 S.Ct. at page 147, 131 A.L.R. 655. In none of the cases had the taxpayer really disposed of the res which produced the income. In Corliss v. Bowers, \n281 \nU.S. 376\n, 50 S.Ct. 336, he had disposed of the res but with a power to revoke at any moment. This right to realize income by revocation at the settlor's option overcame the technical disposition. The 'non-material satisfactions' ( gifts-contributions) of a donor are not taxable as income. Helvering v. Horst, supra.\n That economic gain for the taxable year, as distinguished from the non-material satisfactions, may be obtained through a control of a trust so complete that it must be said the taxpayer is the owner of its income. So \n\n[317 \nU.S. 154, 169]\n\u00a0\n it was in Helvering v. Clifford, \n309 \nU.S. 331, 335\n, 336 S., 60 S.Ct. 554, 556, 557. Cf. Helvering v. Fuller, \n310 \nU.S. 69\n, 72, note 1, 76, 60 S.Ct. 784, 786, 787. Section 22(a) we have said indicated the intention of Congress to use its constitutional powers of income taxation to their 'full measure.' Helvering v. Clifford, \n309 \nU.S. 331, 334\n, 60 S.Ct. 554, 556; Helvering v. Midland Ins. Co., \n300 \nU.S. 216, 223\n, 57 S.Ct. 423, 425, 108 A.L.R. 436; Douglas v. Willcuts, \n296 \nU.S. 1, 9\n, 56 S.Ct. 59, 62, 101 A.L.R. 391; Irwin v. Gavit, \n268 \nU.S. 161, 166\n, 45 S.Ct. 475. Control of the stocks of the company of which the grantors were executives may have determined the manner of creating the trusts. Paragraph eight permits recapture of the stocks from the trust by payment of their value, see page 2 (63 S.Ct. 143) supra. Family relationship evidently played a part in the selection of the trustees. On the other hand broad powers of management in trustees, even though without adverse interest, point to complete divestment of control, as does the impossibility of reversion to the grantors. \n3\n The interlocking trustees were not appointed simultaneously. The triers of fact have made no finding upon this point. Cf. Helvering v. Clifford, supra, \n309 \nU.S. 336, 338\n, 60 S.Ct. 557, 558. When the Board of Tax Appeals decided these cases under Section 166 it was not necessary for it to reach a conclusion on 22(a) or its effect upon Section 167. That should be done in No. 48, the John Stuart trusts.\n In No. 49, the R. Douglas Stuart trusts, the minority of each of the beneficiaries brings the income from the trusts under the provisions of 167(a) (1) and (2). The grantor owes to each the parental obligation of support. The Court of Appeals assumed that all income expended was used for such a purpose unless the taxpayer showed to the contrary. So far as the income was used to dis- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 154, 170]\n\u00a0\n charge this obligation, the sums expended were properly added to the taxpayer's income. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n As indicated in the cases of the Board of Tax Appeals cited in the immediately preceding note, the Board has restricted the tax liability of a grantor of a trust for the support and maintenance of an infant and other purposes to such sums as, actually or by presumption, have been expended to relieve the settlor of his obligations. The Board has not taxed the whole of such income to the taxpayer merely because a part could have been but was not used for the support of an infant. We take a contrary view. Among these involved problems of statutory construction, we observe the time-tried admonition of restricting the scope of our decision to the circumstances before us. We are not here appraising the application of Section 167 to cases where a wife is the trustee or beneficiary of the funds which may be used for the family benefit. Cf. Suhr v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 126 F.2d 283, 285, with Altmaier v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 116 F.2d 162, and Fulham v. Commissioner, 1 Cir., 110 F.2d 916. We are dealing with a trust for minors where the trustees, without any interest adverse to the grantor, have authority to devote so much of the net income as 'to them shall seem advisable' to the 'education, support and maintenance' of the minor. The applicable statute says, 'Where any part of the income ... may ... be distributed to the grantor ... then such part ... shall be included in computing the net income of the grantor.' Under such a provision the possibility of the use of the income to relieve the grantor, pro tanto, \n\n[317 \nU.S. 154, 171]\n\u00a0\n of his parental obligation is sufficient to bring the entire income of these trusts for minors within the rule of attribution laid down in Douglas v. Willcuts. \n No. 48\n is reversed and remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals for remand to the Board of Tax Appeals.\n No. 49 is reversed and for the reasons herein stated, the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is affirmed.\n No. 48 reversed and remanded.\n No. 49 reversed.\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE.\n I think judgment should go for the Government in each case.\n Assuming, as the opinion of the Court declares, that we must look to Illinois law to determine whether the trustees were free to distribute to respondents the trust income which the Commissioner has taxed under  167 of the Revenue Act of 1934, still I think respondents have failed to carry the burden which rests on them to show that the Illinois law prevents such distribution. The power conferred on the trustees to dispose of future income was without restriction. They were in terms authorized at any time to alter the trust instrument so as to change the beneficiary, to change the time when the trust fund or any part of it or the income was to be distributed, or to change it 'in any other respect'. On its face each trust gave to the trustees other than the settlor plenary power to bestow undistributed income on any person they might choose as beneficiaries, including the settlor.\n We are cited to no decision in the Illinois courts which either holds or suggests that a power in trust so broadly phrased may not be exercised for the benefit of its donor. Even the generally accepted rule that the donee of a power in trust may not use it for his own benefit, which Illinois does not appear to follow, would hardly support the conclusion that he could not exercise it for the benefit of the \n\n[317 \nU.S. 154, 172]\n\u00a0\n donor. Reinecke v. Smith, \n289 \nU.S. 172, 176\n, 53 S.Ct. 570, 572. We are without even a speculative basis in judicial authority or in reason for predicting that the Supreme Court of Illinois would forbid such an exercise of the power.\n When state law has not been authoritatively declared we pay great deference to the reasoned opinion of circuit courts of appeals, whose duty it is to ascertain from all available data what the highest court of the state will probably hold the state law to be. Wichita Royalty Co. v. City Bank, \n306 \nU.S. 103\n, 59 S.Ct. 420; West v. American T. & T. Co., \n311 \nU.S. 223\n, 61 S.Ct. 179, 132 A.L.R. 956. But we have not wholly abdicated our function of reviewing such determinations of state law, merely because courts of appeals have made them.\n Here our task is the easier because of the salutary rule that he who assails a deficiency assessment before the Board of Tax Appeals assumes the burden of showing, in point of law as well as of fact, that the tax is unlawfully assessed. Helvering v. Fitch, \n309 \nU.S. 149\n, 60 S.Ct. 427. The terms of the trust instruments bring them so plainly within the provisions of the taxing statute as concededly to subject respondents to the tax unless we are able to conclude that some law of Illinois denies effect to their words. Respondents suggest no reason for such a rule of law which has ever been advanced in judicial opinion, treatise or elsewhere, and they point to no decision of the Illinois courts recognizing its existence. I am unable to conclude that it does exist and consequently that the tax was not properly laid.\n The Board of Tax Appeals found that the trust instruments meant what they said and that in the family circle involved they would be carried out according to their meaning. It was hardly excessive skepticism on the Board's part to conclude that Illinois law would not prevent compliance with the expressed intention. Its judgment ought not lightly to be disregarded.\n Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Text of statutes, id., 686, 729.\n's 22.

STATE OF TEX.(1942)\nNo. 1119\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1942\n\n\n\n Mr. J. F. McCutcheon, of Dallas, Tex., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Pat Coon, Jr., and Spurgeon E. Bell, both of Austin, Tex., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, a negro, was indicted for the crime of rape by the grand jury for Dallas County, Texas. When the case was called for trial he submitted to the court his verified written motion to quash the indictment because he had been denied the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The grounds of his motion were that negroes had been excluded from the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 400, 401]\n\u00a0\n grand jury which returned the indictment, and that the jury commissioners and other state officers charged with the duty of organizing and impanelling grand juries in Dallas County have for many years systematically excluded and in this case did exclude negroes from the grand jury because of their race.\n After hearing evidence the court denied the motion and proceeded with the trial, which resulted in a verdict and judgment of conviction. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals upheld the trial court's ruling on the motion and affirmed the judgment. 157 S.W.2d 369. It held that petitioner had not sustained the burden of proof resting on him to show that the failure to select negroes for service on the grand juries in Dallas County was because of their race rather than their lack of statutory qualifications for grand jury service. We granted certiorari, \n316 \nU.S. 655\n, 62 S.Ct. 1048, 86 L.Ed. --, to inquire whether the court's ruling is consonant with our decisions in Neal v. Delaware, \n103 \nU.S. 370\n; Pierre v. Louisiana, \n306 \nU.S. 354\n, 59 S.Ct. 536; and Smith v. Texas, \n311 \nU.S. 128\n, 61 S.Ct. 164.\n Article 339 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides that a grand juror must be a citizen of the state and county, qualified to vote there, a freeholder within the state or a householder within the county, of sound mind and good moral character, able to read and write. He must not have been convicted of a felony or be under indictment or other legal accusation of any felony. The section directs that 'whenever it shall be made to appear to the court that the requisite number of jurors who have paid their poll taxes can not be found within the county, the court shall not regard the payment of poll taxes as a qualification for service as a joror'.\n On rejecting the proof of discrimination on which petitioner relied, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (157 S.W.2d 372) said 'appellant assumed the burden of sustaining his allega- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 400, 402]\n\u00a0\n tions by proof. He attempted to do so by showing certain facts from which, as he claims, such a conclusion could be reasonably drawn. He showed that 58,000 white persons and 8,000 negroes paid poll taxes in Dallas County, but the record is silent as to how many of them were male and how many were female persons; nor is it shown how many of these male persons could read and write; nor how many of them were freeholders in the state or householders in the county'. And the State argues here that in these circumstances there can be no inference that long-continued failure of the county officials to select members of the colored race to serve on grand juries is discriminatory, without proof that there are members of that race living in the county who are qualified to serve as grand jurors.\n The state filed a general denial of petitioner's motion, but submitted no answering affidavits, and called no witnesses, and so the only question before us is whether petitioner made out a prima facie case of the discriminatory exclusion of negroes from the grand jury. Petitioner called as witnesses two of the three grand jury commissioners, whose duty it is to summon sixteen men, of whom twelve are selected for service on each grand jury in Dallas County (articles 338, 357). They testified that the commission had summoned, for service on the grand jury which returned the indictment, members of the white race with whom they were acquainted and whom they knew to be qualified to serve. They testified that members of the commission had no prejudice against the colored race; that they discussed the possibility of selecting negroes to serve, and that they knew negroes in the county. One testified: 'I personally did not know of a qualified negro that I thought would make a good grand juror'. The other testified he did not know which of the negroes of his acquaintance could read and write. Both testified that they made no investigation or inquiry to ascertain \n\n[316 \nU.S. 400, 403]\n\u00a0\n whether there were negroes in the county qualified for grand jury service.\n An assistant district attorney for the county, who had lived in Dallas County for twenty-seven or twenty-eight years and had served for sixteen years as a judge of the criminal court in which petitioner was tried and convicted, testified that he never knew of a negro being called to serve on a grand jury in the county. The district clerk of the county, whose duty it is to certify the grand jury list to the sheriff (article 344), knew of no citations issued for negroes to serve upon the grand jury. A colored witness, a property owner and poll tax payer in Dallas County, engaged in the insurance and bonding business, and resident in the county for fiftyfour years, testified that he had often been called to serve as a petit juror but had never known of any colored man to be called as a grand juror. Two other colored witnesses, property owners and poll tax payers, who had lived in the county for twenty-five years, had never known of a negro to be called on a grand jury. There was also evidence already mentioned which the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found sufficient to show that of the 66,000 poll tax payers in the county 8,000 were negroes.\n Another witness estimated the total negro population of the county as 55,000. Actually this was an underestimate, for the 1940 census shows the total population of the county to be 398,564 of whom 61,605 are negroes, and of these 19,133 are males twenty-one years old or more. The census of 1930 showed only 7.5 per cent of the negro population of the county to be illiterate. The census data of 1940 show that of the 17,263 male negroes in the county who were twenty-five years of age or more, 16,107 had attended grade school or higher institutions of learning. Of these 7,979 had attended grade school from five to eight years; 1,970 had attended high school from \n\n[316 \nU.S. 400, 404]\n\u00a0\n one to three years, and 1,124 for four years: 466 had attended college from one to three years, and 284 for four years or more.\n We think petitioner made out a prima facie case, which the state failed to meet, or racial discrimination in the selection of grand jurors which the equal protection clause forbids. As we pointed out in Smith v. Texas, supra, \n311 \nU.S. 131\n, 61 S.Ct. 165, chance or accident could hardly have accounted for the continuous omission of negroes from the grand jury lists for so long a period as sixteen years or more. The jury commissioners, although the matter was discussed by them, consciously omitted to place the name of any negro on the jury list. They made no effort to ascertain whether there were within the county members of the colored race qualified to serve as jurors, and if so who they were. They thus failed to perform their constitutional duty-recognized by  4 of the Civil Rights Act of March 1, 1875, 8 U.S.C.  44, 8 U.S.C.A.  44, and fully established since the decision in 1881 of Neal v. Delaware, supra- not to pursue a course of conduct in the administration of their office which would operate to discriminate in the selection of jurors on racial grounds. Discrimination can arise from the action of commissioners who exclude all negroes whom they do not know to be qualified and who neither know nor seek to learn whether there are in fact any qualified to serve. In such a case discrimination necessarily results where there are qualified negroes available for jury service. With the large number of colored male residents of the county who are literate, and in the absence of any countervailing testimony, there is no room for inference that there are not among them householders of good moral character, who can read and write, qualified and available for grand jury service. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 400, 405]\n\u00a0\n More than sixty years ago, in Neal v. Delaware, supra, \n103 \nU.S. 397\n, a case substantially like the present, this Court laid down the rule which we think controlling here: 'The showing thus made, including, as it did, the fact (so generally known that the court felt obliged to take judicial notice of it) that no colored citizen had ever been summoned as a juror in the courts of the State,-although its colored population exceeded twenty thousand in 1870, and in 1880 exceeded twenty- six thousand, in a total population of less than one hundred and fifty thousand,-presented a prima facie case of denial, by the officers charged with the selection of grand and petit jurors, of that equality of protection which has been secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States. It was, we think, under all the circumstances, a violent presumption which the State court indulged that such uniform exclusion of that race from juries, during a period of many years, was solely because, in the judgment of those officers, fairly exercised, the black race in Delaware were utterly disqualified, by want of intelligence, experience, or moral integrity, to sit on juries.' And recently we held in Pierre v. Louisiana, supra, that a prima facie case of race discrimination had been established where there had been a long-continued failure to select colored citizens for service on grand juries in a county, 50 per cent of whose population, or approximately 7,000, were colored, of whom from 70 to 80 per cent were shown to be literate. We thought as we think here that had there been evidence obtainable to contradict the inference to be drawn from this testimony, the state would not have refrained from introducing it, and that the evidence which was introduced sufficiently showed that there \n\n[316 \nU.S. 400, 406]\n\u00a0\n were colored citizens of the county qualified and available for service on the grand jury.\n A prisoner whose conviction is reversed by this Court need not go free if he is in fact guilty, for Texas may indict and try him again by the procedure which conforms to constitutional requirements. But no state is at liberty to impose upon one charged with crime a discrimination in its trial procedure which the Constitution, and an Act of Congress passed pursuant to the Constitution, alike forbid. Nor is this Court at liberty to grant or withhold the benefits of equal protection, which the Constitution commands for all, merely as we may deem the defendant innocent or guilty. Tumey v. Ohio, \n273 \nU.S. 510, 535\n, 47 S.Ct. 437, 445, 50 A.L.R. 1243. It is the state's function, not ours, to assess the evidence against a defendant. But it is our duty as well as the state's to see to it that throughout the procedure for bringing him to justice he shall enjoy the protection which the Constitution guarantees. Where, as in this case, timely objection has laid bare a discrimination in the selection of grand jurors, the conviction cannot stand because the Constitution prohibits the procedure by which it was obtained. Equal protection of the laws is something more than an abstract right. It is a command which the state must respect, the benefits of which every person may demand. Not the least merit of our constitutional system is that its safeguards extend to all-the least deserving as well as the most virtuous.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","57":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOTEL EMPLOYEES' LOCAL v. WISCONSIN EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD(1942)\nNo. 124\nArgued: Decided: March 2, 1942\n\n\n\n Messrs. I. E. Goldberg and Joseph A. Padway, both of Milwaukee, Wis., for petitioners.\n Messrs. N. S. Boardman, of Mineral Point, Wis., and Herman M.

Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88\n, 60 S.Ct. 736; American Federation of Labor v. Swing, \n312 \nU.S. 321\n, 61 S.Ct. 568. The specific question for decision is the constitutional validity of an order made by the Wisconsin Employment Reltions Board acting under the Employment Peace Act, Wisconsin Laws of 1939, c. 57, St.1939,  111.01 et seq. In deciding this question we are of course controlled by the construction placed by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin upon the order and the pertinent provisions of the Act.\n These are the undisputed facts. In June 1938, the petitioners, various unions representing hotel and restaurant employees, made a closed shop agreement for a year with the respondent Plankinton House Company, which owned two hotels in Milwaukee. After negotiations between the parties for renewal of the contract failed, the dispute was submitted to arbitration. On October 30, 1939, the Company notified the unions of its willingness to sign a contract in accordance with the terms of the arbitration. Three days later the employees of both hotels went on strike. Members of the unions picketed the hotels, and the company continued to operate the hotels with new employees. Union pickets forcibly prevented the delivery of goods to one of the hotels. For this conduct two union officials were arrested and fined. One of them returned to the picket line immediately after his arrest, assaulted one of the non-striking employees, and was again arrested and fined. Numerous other outbreaks of violence resulted in the conviction of the offending pickets and occasioned special police measures to maintain the peace.\n The Company complained to the Employment Relations Board that the petitioners had committed 'unfair labor practices'. After due hearing the Board made findings of fact, not challenged throughout these proceedings. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 437, 439]\n\u00a0\n Upon the basis of these findings the Board issued the order set forth in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n In accordance with the statutory provisions for judicial review, the petitioners applied to the Circuit Court of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, to set aside the Board's order. The Board cross-petitioned for enforcement. The Circuit Court sustained the order, and an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin which affirmed the judgment and, after further elucidating the meaning of the statute and the order, denied a rehearing. 236 Wis. 329, 352, 294 N.W. 632, 295 N.W. 634.\n The Wisconsin statute underlying this controversy was enacted as a comprehensive code governing the relations \n\n[315 \nU.S. 437, 440]\n\u00a0\n between employers and employees in the state. Only a few of its many provisions are relevant here. Section 111.06 provides that it shall be 'an unfair labor practice' to 'co-operate in engaging in, promoting or inducing picketing, boycotting or any other overt concomitant of a strike unless a majority in a collective bargaining unit of the employes of an employer against whom such acts are primarily directed have voted by secret ballot to call a strike', and to 'hinder or prevent, by mass picketing, threats, intimidation, force or coercion of any kind the pursuit of any lawful work or employment, or to obstruct or interfere with entrance to or egress from any place of employment, or to obstruct or interfere with free and uninterrupted use of public roads, streets, highways, railways, airports, or other ways of travel or conveyance.' The Act contains a provision expressly dealing with its construction: 'Except as specifically provided in this chapter, nothing therein shall be construed so as to interfere with or impede or diminish in any way the right to strike or the right of individuals to work; nor shall anything in this chapter be so construed as to invade unlawfully the right to freedom of speech.'  111.15.\n The central attack against the order is that, as enforced by the Wisconsin courts, it enjoins peaceful picketing. Whether Wisconsin has denied the petitioners any rights under the federal Constitution is our ultimate responsibility. But precisely what restraints Wisconsin has imposed upon the petitioners is for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to determine. In its opinion in this case, and more particularly in its explanatory opinion denying a rehearing, the Court construed the relevant provisions of the Employment Peace Act and confined the scope of the challenged order to the limits of the construction which it gave them. That Court has of course the final say concerning the meaning of a Wisconsin law and the scope of administrative orders made under it. Aikens \n\n[315 \nU.S. 437, 441]\n\u00a0\n v. Wisconsin, \n195 \nU.S. 194\n, 25 S.Ct. 3; Senn v. Tile Layers Union, \n301 \nU.S. 468\n, 57 S.Ct. 857. What is before us, therefore, is not the order as an isolated, self-contained writing but the order with the gloss of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin upon it. And that Court has unambiguously rejected the construction upon which the claim of the petitioners rests.\n That the order forbids only violance, and that it permits peaceful picketing by these petitioners, is made abundantly clear by the expressions of the Court:\n'The act does not limit the right of an employee to speak freely . ... The term 'picketing' as used in (the act) does not include acts held in the Thornhill case (supra), to be within the protection of the constitutional guaranty of the right of free speech. The express language of the act forbids such a construction. It clearly refers to that kind of picketing which the Thornhill case, \n310 \nU.S. 88\n, 60 S.Ct. 745, says the state has power to deal with as a part of its power 'to preserve the peace and protect the privacy, the lives, and the property of its residents.' ... In this case it is undisputed that numerous assaults were committed by pickets, that the pickets acted in concert; that the fines of these pickets were paid by the unions; that ingress and egress to and from the premises of the employer were prevented by force and arms. It was at conduct of that kind that the statute was aimed. It is conduct of that kind that is dealt with in this case. It is conduct of that kind that is declared to be an unfair labor practice by the statute and from which the defendants are ordered to cease and desist. ...' And on rehearing: 'Under the statute and the order of the board as interpreted and construed by the explicit language of the (previous) opinion, freedom of speech and the right peacefully to picket is in no way interfered with. The appellants could not be ordered to cease and desist from something they were not engaged in. ... The picketing carried on in this case was not peaceful and the right of \n\n[315 \nU.S. 437, 442]\n\u00a0\n free speech is in no way infringed by the statute or the order of the board.' 236 Wis. 329, passim, 294 N.W. 632, 638, 295 N.W. 634, 635.\n\n What public policy Wisconsin should adopt in furthering desirable industrial relations is for it to say so long as rights guaranteed by the Constitution are respected. Aikens v. Wisconsin, \n195 \nU.S. 194\n, 25 S.Ct. 3; Senn v. Tile Layers Union, \n301 \nU.S. 468\n, 57 S.Ct. 857. As the order and the appropriate provisions of the statute upon which it was based leave the petitioners' freedom of speech unimpaired, the judgment below must be affirmed. Problems that would arise had the order and the pertinent provisions of the Act been otherwise construed by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin need not therefore be considered.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'It is ordered that the respondent unions, Hotel and Restaurant Employees International Alliance, Local No. 122, International Laundry Workers, Local No. 174, Bartenders International League of America, Local No. 64, International Union of Operating Engineers, Local No. 311, and the Milwaukee Building Trades Council, the officers, members, agents, successors and assigns of each shall:\n'1.

Allan Watkins, of Atlanta, Ga., and Albert B.

Carolina Freight Carriers Corp., \n315 \nU.S. 475\n, 62 S.Ct. 722, 86 L.Ed. --, decided this day, is an appeal from a district court of three judges (38 F.Supp. 556) convened to review an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission (24 M.C.C. 273) granting appellant a certificate of public convenience and necessity as a common carrier by motor vehicle under the so-called 'grandfather clause',  206(a) of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935. 49 U.S.C.  306(a), 49 U.S.C.A.  306(a).\n Appellant made application as a common carrier of general commodities operating over irregular routes. It \n\n[315 \nU.S. 495, 497]\n\u00a0\n sought authority to operate between all points in a vast territory comprising most of the country east of the Mississippi River except the New England states. The Commission authorized the issuance of a certificate but limited it in two respects: (1) It restricted the geographical scope of the operations by authorizing service only from Birmingham, Ala., and all points within a radius of 10 miles from that city, to all points in certain states and to designated points in others. ( 2) Though it permitted appellant to carry general commodities throughout a large segment of the authorized territory, it limited the kinds of commodities which could be carried between specified points. Its finding containing those restrictions (24 M.C.C., p. 277) reads as follows:\n'We find that applicant was, on June 1, 1935, and continuously since that time has been, in bona fide operation, in interstate or foreign commerce, as a common carrier by motor vehicle, of general commodities, except commodities of unusual value, high explosives, commodities in bulk, commodities requiring special equipment, and household goods, uncrated or in lift vans in connection with so-called household movings between Birmingham, Ala., and all points within 10 miles thereof, on the one hand, and, on the other, all points in North Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, and South Carolina, and those in Florida on and north of a line consisting of U.S. Highway 92 from Tampa to Kissimmee, thence U.S. Highway 192 to Melbourne, of paper and paper products from Birmingham to New Orleans, La., and Chattanooga and Knoxville, Tenn., and from Kingsport, Tenn., to Birmingham, of nails, pipe, pipe fittings, steel, and metal ceilings from Canton, Ohio, to Birmingham, of cloth from Alabama City, Ala., to Wheeling, W.Va., and of matches from Wheeling to Chattanooga and Birmingham, all over irregular routes; that by reason of such operation it is \n\n[315 \nU.S. 495, 498]\n\u00a0\n entitled to a certificate authorizing the continuance thereof; and that the application in all other respects should be denied.'\n\n The District Court refused to enjoin enforcement of the order and dismissed the complaint. The errors urged here do not relate to the substantiality of the evidence in support of the findings. They involve two questions: Whether the Commission was warranted in limiting shipments to and from points located within a 10 mile, rather than a 100 mile, radius of Birmingham; and (2) whether the Commission erred in limiting the operating rights of appellant to the transportation of only a few commodities between certain points.\n I. We perceive no error in the limitation which the Commission made on the territorial scope of appellant's operations.\n Appellant argues that if it may be authorized to serve all points in one state, say Georgia, without showing that every point in Georgia had been previously served by it, then it must be granted like authority as respects the 100 mile radius around Birmingham. That is a non sequitur. Prior operations to several points in a region may or may not justify the Commission in authorizing service throughout the whole region. The precise geographical pattern for future operations is the product of an expert judgment based on the substantiality of the evidence as to prior operations, the characteristics of the particular type of carrier, the capacity or ability of the applicant to render the service, and the like. Alton R. Co. v. United States, \n315 \nU.S. 15\n, 62 S.Ct. 432, 86 L.Ed. --; United States v. Carolina Freight Carriers Corp., supra. The Commission employed those standards in limiting the territorial scope of appellant's operations. We cannot say that its reduction of the Birmingham area from a radius of 100 miles to a radius of 10 miles was unjustified. The Commission found that \n\n[315 \nU.S. 495, 499]\n\u00a0\n only 55 shipments were transported prior to June 1, 1935, to or from points within 100 miles of Birmingham, as against 875 to or from that city. Only 12 points were served in that large area. After June 1, 1935, 270 shipments moved to or from points within 100 miles of Birmingham as against 2,030 to or from that city. The Commission reduced the radius to 10 miles in an endeavor to include only the important industrial area surrounding that city. If we were to enlarge that area, we would clearly usurp a function which Congress entrusted to the Commission. Nor can that finding be assailed because permission to serve all points in other areas was allowed. Such a difference in treatment plainly is not erroneous as a matter of law. And nothing has been called to our attention which would even suggest that the record of prior operations or the characteristics of this transportation enterprise precluded the Commission from restricting the territory where shipments mainly originate while being more liberal as respects the territory where destination points are located.\n II. We take a different view as respects the limitation on commodities which the Commission imposed in case of shipments between specified points. We do not say that that limitation was unjustified. We merely hold that in this case, as in United States v. Carolina Freight Carriers Corp., supra, the basic or essential findings to support that part of the order are lacking. The Commission's conclusion that appellant was authorized to transport general commodities between Birmingham and vicinity on the one hand and all points in designated areas on the other was based on its finding that prior to and since June 1, 1935, appellant 'held itself out to transport general commodities' in that territory and 'actually conducted an operation consistent with such holding out.' But in case of the limitation which it imposed on the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 495, 500]\n\u00a0\n shipment of certain commodities it merely found that 'prior to and since June 1, 1935, applicant transported paper and paper products from Birmingham to New Orleans, La., and Chattanooga and Knoxville, Tennessee, and from Kingsport, Tenn., to Birmingham; nails, pipe, pipe fittings, steel, and metal ceilings from Canton, Ohio, to Birmingham; cloth from Alabama City, Ala., to Wheeling, W. Va., and matches from Wheeling to Chattanooga and Birmingham.'\n As we indicated in United States v. Carolina Freight Carriers Corp., supra, if the applicant had established that it was a 'common carrier' of general commodities during the critical periods in a specified territory, restrictions on commodities which could be moved between specified points in that territory would not be justified. The mere fact that particular commodities had never been transported between designated points in that territory would not mean that authority to haul them between such points should be withheld. On the other hand, an applicant's status may vary from one part of the territory to another. As respects carriage between designated points, the applicant may have restricted its undertaking to particular commodities. It is not clear, however, that the Commission applied those tests in this case. From all that appears it may have allowed only paper and paper products to be shipped from Birmingham to New Orleans merely because paper and paper products were the only commodities previously carried between those cities. It is true that the Commission quoted from Reliance Trucking Co., Inc., 4 M.C.C. 594, 595, to the effect that the question is whether there has been an operation within the critical periods consistent with the holding out in the natural and normal course of business, and that a mere holding out without evidence of an operation consistent therewith is not enough. Yet it also seems to have placed considerable \n\n[315 \nU.S. 495, 501]\n\u00a0\n reliance on Powell Brothers Truck Lines, Inc., 9 M.C.C. 785, 791-792, which we have discussed in United States v. Carolina Freight Carriers Corp ., supra, and which apparently treats irregular route carriers differently in this regard than regular route carriers. Since the influence of that view seems to have permeated the findings, we conclude that here, as in United States v. Carolina Freight Carriers Corp., supra, the case should be remanded to the Commission so that the basic or essential findings required under the rule of Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194, 215\n, 51 S.Ct. 119, 125, may be made.\n It is so ordered.\n Remanded.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER and Mr. Justice JACKSON dissent for the reasons stated in their dissenting opinion in United States v.

Baden, of Hamilton, Ohio, for appellees.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n Appellant is the owner of a 99-year perpetually renewable lease of which the University of Miami, in Ohio, is lessor, and which has been subjected to assessment of county taxes pursuant to  5330 of the Ohio General Code. Appellant contends that this statute as applied violates an exemption from taxation granted by  13 of an Ohio statute of February 17, 1809 (7 Ohio Laws, p. 188), which allegedly became a part of her contract through execution of the lease, and impairs the obligation of her contract contrary to Article I,  10 of the Constitution. The record, however, does not set forth appellant's lease, and the incomplete summary of it contained in her pleading is not adequate to enable us to determine what her rights may be. Accordingly, we must dismiss the appeal.\n Dismissed. \n\n\n\n","60":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHYSLER v. STATE OF FLORIDA(1942)\nNo. 64\nArgued: December 12, 1941Decided: March 2, 1942\n\n\n\n As Amended on Denial of Rehearing April 6, 1942. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 411, 412]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Carlton C. Arnow, of Jacksonville, Fla., for petitioner.\n Mr. Joseph E. Gillen, of Tampa, Fla., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n After the Supreme Court of Florida had affirmed his conviction for murder, the petitioner applied to that court for leave to ask the trial court to review the judgment of conviction. The basis of his application was the claim \n\n[315 \nU.S. 411, 413]\n\u00a0\n that the testimony of two witnesses implicating him was perjured, and that they had testified falsely against him because they were 'coerced, intimidated, beaten, threatened with violence and otherwise abused and mistreated' by the police and were 'promised immunity from the electric chair' by the district attorney. After twice considering the matter, the Supreme Court of Florida denied the application. 146 Fla. 593, 1 So.2d 628. We brought the case here, \n313 \nU.S. 557\n, 61 S.Ct. 1113, in view of our solicitude, especially where life is at stake, for those liberties which are guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The guides for decision are clear. If a state, whether by the active conduct or the connivance of the prosecution, obtains a conviction through the use of perjured testimony, it violates civilized standards for the trial of guilt or innocence and thereby deprives an accused of liberty without due process of law. Mooney v. Holohan, \n294 \nU.S. 103\n, 55 S.Ct. 340, 98 A.L.R. 406. Equally offensive to the Constitutional guarantees of liberty are confessions wrung from an accused by overpowering his will, whether through physical violence or the more subtle forms of coercion commonly known as 'the third degree'. Brown v. Mississippi, \n297 \nU.S. 278\n, 56 S.Ct. 461; Chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227\n, 60 S.Ct. 472; Lisenba v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 219\n, 62 S.Ct. 280, 86 L.Ed. --. In this collateral attack upon the judgment of conviction, the petitioner bases his claim on the recantation of one of the witnesses against him. He cannot, of course, contend that mere recantation of testimony is in itself ground for invoking the Due Process Clause against a conviction. However, if Florida through her responsible officials knowingly used false testimony which was extorted from a witness 'by violence and torture', one convicted may claim the protection of the Due Process Clause against a conviction based upon such testimony. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 411, 414]\n\u00a0\n And so we come to the circumstances of this case.\n On November 25, 1936, as a result of an attempted robbery, John H. Surrency and his wife Mayme Elizabeth were murdered. On December 16, 1936, Hysler was indicted for the murder of John Surrency; he was tried on January 21, 1937, was convicted on February 12, 1937, with recommendation of mercy, and was thereafter sentenced to imprisonment for life. On February 3, 1938, his sentence was affirmed by the Florida Supreme Court. 132 Fla. 200, 181 So. 350. The record in the case was more than 3000 pages. On January 15, 1937, Hysler together with two others, James Baker and Alvin Tyler, was indicted for the murder of Mrs. Surrency. A severance having been granted as to Tyler and Baker, Hysler was placed on trial on March 15, 1937, and on April 5 was found guilty without recommendation of mercy. On April 23, 1937, he was sentenced to death. On April 24 he sued out a writ of error to the state Supreme Court, which on February 3, 1938, sustained the sentence, and on June 3 denied a rehearing. The record on this second trial was some 2500 pages. 132 Fla. 209, 181 So. 354.\n Surrency kept a restaurant near Jacksonville and on the fatal day was returning from one of his regular and well-known trips to that city to get checks cashed. Hysler had known Baker in connection with Hysler's illicit whiskey business. Baker and Tyler were friends. The principal evidence in both trials against Hysler was their testimony. They testified with circumstantiality that Hysler induced them to hold up Surrency, furnished them a car, a pistol, and some whiskey, gave them detailed instructions for carrying out the plan, and by prearrangement was in the vicinity of the place of its execution. While their testimony doubtless was the foundation of Hysler's convictions, the testimony both of numerous witnesses and Hysler himself sheds much confirming light \n\n[315 \nU.S. 411, 415]\n\u00a0\n on the story told by Baker and Tyler. A careful concurring opinion affirming the conviction now challenged concluded thus: 'From the evidence it is difficult to see or understand how the jury in the court below could have rendered a verdict other than guilty. We have thoroughly considered each assignment and failed to find error in the trial of the cause in the lower court.' 132 Fla. 209, 235, 181 So. 354, 364.\n Accordingly, the date for the execution was set by the Governor of Florida for the week of February 20, 1939. In the meantime, however, an application for a writ of habeas corpus by Hysler was made to the Supreme Court of Florida, partly on the ground of insanity. This was denied by that Court on February 20, 1939. 136 Fla. 563, 187 So. 261. Tyler broke jail and has apparently remained a fugitive from justice. Baker was tried after Hysler was convicted of murder in the first degree, and sentenced to death. His conviction was affirmed by the Florida Supreme Court on March 14, 1939, and a rehearing denied on April 11, 1939. Baker v. State, 137 Fla. 27, 188 So. 634.\n We have now reached the final chapter of this unedifying story in the administration of criminal justice. On April 10, 1941, more than four years after Hysler's conviction for the murder of Mrs. Surrency, he petitioned the Supreme Court of Florida for permission to apply to the Circuit Court of Duval County, Florida (the court before which he was originally tried), for writ of error coram nobis. This common law writ, in its local adaption, is Florida's response to the requirements of Mooney v. Holohan, \n294 \nU.S. 103\n, 55 S.Ct. 340, 98 A.L.R. 406, for the judicial correction of a wrong committed in the administration of criminal justice and resulting in the deprivation of life or liberty without due process. See Lamb v. Florida, 91 Fla. 396, 107 So. 535; Skipper v. Schumacher, 124 Fla. 384, 169 So. 58; Jones v. Florida, 130 Fla. 645, 178 So. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 411, 416]\n\u00a0\n 404. In brief, a person in Florida who claims that his incarceration is due to 'failure to observe that fundamental fairness essential to the very concept of justice', Lisenba v. California, supra, \n314 \nU.S. 219\n, 62 S.Ct. at page 290, 86 L.Ed. --, even after his sentence has been duly affirmed by the highest court of the State, has full opportunity to have a jury pass on such a claim provided he first makes an adequate showing of the substantiality of his claim to the satisfaction of the Supreme Court of Florida. The decisions of that Court show that a naked allegation that a constitutional right has been invaded is not sufficient. A petitioner must 'make a full disclosure of the specific facts relied on', and not merely his conclusions 'as to the nature and effect of such facts'. The proof must enable the appellate court to 'ascertain whether, under settled principles pertaining to such writ, the facts alleged would afford, at least prima facie just ground for an application to the lower court for a writ of error coram nobis.' Washington v. Florida, 92 Fla. 740, 749, 110 So. 259, 262; see Skipper v. Schumacher, 124 Fla. 384, 405-408, 169 So. 58; Skipper v. Florida, 127 Fla. 553, 554, 555, 173 So. 692. The latest formulation by the Florida Supreme Court of its function in considering an application for leave to apply to the trial court for a writ of error coram nobis is found in McCall v. Florida, 1939, 136 Fla. 349, 350, 186 So. 803: 'In the exercise of its discretion in matters of this sort the court should look to the reasonableness of the allegations of the petition and to the existence of the probability of the truth thereof. This duty we have met and we are convinced that to grant the petition would be no less than a trifling with justice.'\n Such a state procedure of course meets the requirements of the Due Process Clause. Vindication of Constitutional rights under the Due Process Clause does not demand uniformity of procedure by the forty-eight States. Each State is free to devise its own way of secur- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 411, 417]\n\u00a0\n ing essential justice in these situations. The Due Process Clause did not stereotype the means for ascertaining the truth of a claim that that which duly appears as the administration of intrinsic justice was such merely in form, that in fact it was a perversion of justice by the law officers of the state. Each State may decide for itself whether, after guilt has been determined by the ordinary processes of trial and affirmed on appeal, a later challenge to its essential justice must come in the first instance, or even in the last instance, before a bench of judges rather than before a jury.\n Florida then had ample machinery for correcting the Constitutional wrong of which Hysler complained. But it remains to consider whether in refusing him relief the Supreme Court of Florida denied a proper appeal to its corrective process for protecting a right guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Hysler's claim before the Supreme Court of Florida was that Baker repudiated his testimony insofar as it implicated Hysler and that he now named another man as the instigator of the crime. Considering the fact that this repudiation came four years after leaden-footed justice had reached the end of the familiar trail of dilatory procedure, and that Baker now pointed to an instigator who was dead, the Supreme Court of Florida had every right and the plain duty to scrutinize this repudiation with a critical eye, in the light of its familiarity with the facts of this crime as they had been adduced in three trials, the voluminous records of which had been before that Court. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The Florida Supreme Court had before it four affidavits by Baker. The affidavits must be considered here \n\n[315 \nU.S. 411, 418]\n\u00a0\n as they were before that Court-in their entirety. One was made on April 7, 1941; the second on April 8 between six and seven in the evening; another between eight-thirty and nine of the same night; the fourth, the next day. The most striking feature of this series of retractions is that in his first and spontaneous new account of the happenings that led to the murders on November 25, 1936, Baker does not attribute to coercion or inducements made by state authorities his testimony at the trials that Hysler was the instigator of the crimes. On the contrary, according to Baker's new story, after the killing of the Surrencys, Tyler and he 'agreed between them while they were in Cracker Swamp in the Marietta section of Duval County, that they would lay the blame of the planning of the robbery of the Surrencys upon Clyde Hysler because they had had considerable liquor dealings with Clyde Hysler and knew him well, and for the reason that the Hyslers bore a bad reputation in Duval County, and for the further reason that Clyde Hysler's father had plenty of money and they thought that by laying the planning of the robbery of the Surrencys on Clyde Hysler that his father and his other relatives would put up sufficient money to get Clyde Hysler out of the trouble and that by laying it on to Clyde Hysler, that he, James Baker, and Alvin Tyler would escape the death penalty ...'.\n There is no suggestion whatever in this explanation of what is now claimed to have been a false accusation that it was induced from without. Baker gives five reasons for having fixed the blame on Hysler-an explanation to which he had adhered for more than four years-but all these reasons make Baker and Tyler the spontaneous concocters of the alleged false charge. It was not until the next day, that Baker, under leading questions, suggested that his account of the crime, contemporaneous with it, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 411, 419]\n\u00a0\n was induced by the hope of getting 'life instead of the chair.' \n2\n Even in this second affidavit there is no hint that the prosecutor had any knowledge of the falsity of his implication of Hysler. 3 Only after a third session did Baker, in an ambiguous reply to another leading question, convey a suggestion of the prosecutor's knowledge of the use of force preceding Baker's original testimony. This \n\n[315 \nU.S. 411, 420]\n\u00a0\n is the only testimony that bears on the complicity of the prosecutor in the alleged coercion of Baker's testimony:\n'Q. Baker do you know whether or not Mr. Harrell (the State's Attorney) knew if you was beat up to make you testify? A. Yes, sir, he knows I couldn't set down, none of the sheriff's force knew it at the time, they knew it later when I made it in front all of the officers.\n\n'Q. When you made that statement you couldn't set down? A. Yes, sir, and I can't set good, and I wish you and those men could see that now.\n\n'Q. No, we want care to see-that's all you want to say. A. (Baker nodding his head indicating yes.)'\n\n In his final affidavit on April 9, Baker returns to the alleged promise of the State's Attorney that he would not 'burn' him. But there is this time no suggestion that the prosecutor induced or knew of any false testimony by Baker. We have seen that according to Baker's first statement on April 7, his attribution of Hysler's responsibility was spontaneous and uncoerced. The circumstances of the case reinforce this and cast a proper scepticism upon Baker's subsequent claims of coercion. According to the affidavits of the two lawyers who represented Hysler at his trials, they examined Baker and Tyler 'at great length' in the presence of counsel for the two accomplices and 'said witnesses were particularly questioned as to who was involved in said case, and said witnesses denied that anyone was involved in said case other than the defendants named in the indictment; that said witnesses further denied that any statements previously made by them to law enforcement officers were made under duress or with any hope or expectation or reward'. And the present Chief Justice of Florida in his separate opinion on Baker's appeal characterized Baker's confession as \n\n[315 \nU.S. 411, 421]\n\u00a0\n 'entirely free and voluntary'. 137 Fla. 27, 29, 188 So. 634, 635.\n In addition to these four affidavits by Baker, there were four subsidiary affidavits by others. Their want of significance is sufficiently attested by the fact that on the motion for rehearing of this cause before the Florida Supreme Court, reliance was placed exclusively upon the Baker affidavits and no reference whatever was made to these subsidiary affidavits. Nor was reliance upon them made here.\n The essence of Hysler's claim before the Supreme Court of Florida was that his conviction was secured by unconstitutional means, that Baker was coerced to testify falsely by responsible state officials. The Court had to judge the substantiality of this claim on the basis of all that was before it, namely, the petition with its accompanying affidavits and the records of prior cases arising out of the same crime. The Court concluded that Hysler's proof did not make out a prima facie case for asking the trial court to reconsider its judgment of conviction. However ineptly the Florida Supreme Court may have formulated the grounds for denying the application, its action leaves no room for doubt that the Court deemed the petitioner's claim without substantial foundation. We construe its finding that the 'petition' did not show the responsibility of the state officials for the alleged falsity of Baker's original testimony to mean that the petitioner had failed to make the showing of substantiality which, according to the local procedure of Florida, was necessary in order to obtain the extraordinary relief furnished by the writ of error coram nobis. 4 And our \n\n[315 \nU.S. 411, 422]\n\u00a0\n independent examination of the affidavits upon which his claim was based leaves no doubt that the finding of insubstantiality was justified. It certainly precludes a holding that such a finding was not justified.\n The state's security in the just administration of its criminal law must largely rest upon the competence of its trial courts. But that does not bar the state Supreme Court from exercising the vigilance of a hard- headed consideration of appeals to it for upsetting a conviction. That in the course of four years witnesses die or disappear, that memories fade, that a sense of responsibility may become attenuated, that repudiations and new incriminations like Baker's on the eve of execution are not unfamiliar as a means of relieving others or as an irrational hope for self-these of course are not valid considerations for relaxing the protection of Constitutional rights. But they are relevant in exercising a hardy judgment in order to determine whether such a belated disclosure springs from the impulse for truth-telling or is the product of self- delusion or artifice prompted by the instinct of self-preservation.\n Our ultimate inquiry is whether the State of Florida has denied to the petitioner the protection of the Due Process Clause. The record does not permit the conclusion that Florida has deprived him of his Constitutional rights.\n Petitioner also claims that Florida has denied him the 'equal protection' of its law. This contention is plainly without substance. If Hysler had been singled out for invidious treatment by the Florida Supreme Court, he could properly complain here. Compare Yick Wo v. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 411, 423]\n\u00a0\n Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356\n, 6 S.Ct. 1064; McFarland v. American Sugar Co., \n241 \nU.S. 79\n, 36 S.Ct. 498. But it is not a fact that the Florida Supreme Court has granted such applications in other cases but not in Hysler's. See, e.g., Skipper v. Florida, 127 Fla. 553, 173 So. 692; McCall v. Florida, 136 Fla. 349, 186 So. 803.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MURPHY concur.\n The application denied by the Supreme Court of Florida alleges that Tyler and Baker, the accomplices in the murder for which Hysler was convicted, confessed and gave false testimony against Hysler because they were 'coerced, intimidated, beaten, threatened with violence and otherwise abused and mistreated,' and because they were promised life sentences instead of the electric chair. Sworn statements of Baker made in a state prison in the presence of prison officials were presented in support of these allegations, as were corroborative affidavits of four others. Tyler, a fugitive from justice, is unavailable to the petitioner as an additional source of verification.\n The Florida Supreme Court has stated that the petition does not assert that 'the alleged falsity of the testimony of the witness Baker was known to the prosecuting officer.' In Mooney v. Holohan, \n294 \nU.S. 103\n, 55 S.Ct. 340, 98 A.L.R. 406, this Court held that the use by a state of testimony known by its 'prosecuting authorities' to be false is a denial of due process of law. I do not, however, regard this as a proper occasion to determine whether the rule of Mooney v. Holohan applies only where the guilty knowledge is that of 'the prosecuting officer' and not any other responsible official. For even if every representative of the state believed that the confessions of Tyler and Baker were true in every detail, other allegations of the petitioner make out a denial of due \n\n[315 \nU.S. 411, 424]\n\u00a0\n process on independent grounds, upon which the scope of Mooney v. Holohan has no bearing. In those cases in which this Court held that a conviction based on confessions wrung from the accused or his accomplices by third- degree methods was offensive to the guarantees of the due process clause, there are no indications that the knowledge of any of the state officials involved as to the truth or falsity of the confessions was deemed relevant. 1 And if the allegations of Hysler's petition are true, that is, if Tyler and Baker were held incommunicado and tortured into supplying the controlling testimony at Hysler's trial, his conviction is tainted with a measure of brutality which I had supposed was sufficient, without more, to establish a violation of Constitutional rights. I am therefore unable to agree with the statement of the Florida Supreme Court that 'if all petitioner alleges in his petition had been true and had been fully made known to the trial court and to the jury which tried the defendant- petitioner, it would not have precluded the entry of the judgment upon a verdict of guilty of Murder ....' Nor do I go along with the intimations of approval of that statement to be found in the opinion which this Court has just handed down.\n The opinion of this Court does not rest solely on the ground that Hysler's allegations if true fail to establish a denial of due process. The Court finds in the opinion of the Florida Supreme Court a determination that 'Hysler's proof' was insufficient 'to make the showing of substantiality which, according to the local procedure of Florida, was necessary in order to obtain the extraordinary relief furnished by the writ of error coram nobis.' But 'Hysler's proof' is nowhere mentioned in the opinion below, and of the eight reasons there given for denying Hysler's petition, the only one which touches in any \n\n[315 \nU.S. 411, 425]\n\u00a0\n way upon the credibility of his allegations accepts them as true.\n To be convinced that the Florida Supreme Court did not pass on the credibility of Hysler's allegations but merely decided that these allegations however fully proved would not make out a violation of due process, I should need to look no further than the opinion below. But more support for this interpretation of Florida's denial of Hysler's petition is amply available in other decisions of its highest court. In Washington v. State, 92 Fla. 740, 749, 110 So. 259, 262, for example, the Florida Supreme Court said the issue to be determined when such a petition is before it is 'whether ... the facts alleged'-not the proof-'would afford, at least prima facie, just ground for an application to the lower court for a writ of error coram nobis.' That is not to say that the Florida Supreme Court will not deny a petition when the facts alleged are so patently incredible that further pursuit of the remedy would be a frivolous imposition upon the trial court. Thus, in McCall v. State, 136 Fla. 349, 350, 186 So. 803, where the allegations of the petitioner denied his guilt for the first time, were without any supporting affidavits, and were 'positively and directly contradicted' by himself and other witnesses at the trial, the court denied the petition, stating that to grant it 'would be no less than a trifling with justice.' Even under such circumstances, however, the court explicitly pointed out that it had looked into 'the probability of the truth' of the allegations. And where there is a color of plausibility in the allegations, the court has been meticulous to give the petitioner ample opportunity to prove them. In Chambers v. State, for example, Mr. Justice Buford, who spoke for the court in its opinion on Hysler's petition said: 'The petition for leave to file writ of error coram nobis presents allegations which, if true, would constitute ground for issuing the writ. It is not \n\n[315 \nU.S. 411, 426]\n\u00a0\n the province of this court to determine whether or not such allegations are true. The determination of such question may be had in the circuit court under issues duly made for that purpose.' 111 Fla. 707, 713, 151 So. 499, 152 So. 437.\n It must also be borne in mind that if the proof accompanying a petition for leave to apply for a writ of error coram nobis had to be so full as to establish conclusively the truth of the allegations, petitioners who required the amplifying or corroborative evidence of inaccessible or unwilling witnesses would be effectively barred from access to this remedy, for they would never have the opportunity to utilize the compulsory process which a trial of the facts would afford. In the light of Florida's liberal treatment of other petitioners in other cases,2 and the unambiguous explanation its courts have given where petitions have been denied, I cannot impute to the Florida Supreme Court, on the basis of its opinion in this case, a decision that Hysler's 'proof' was inadequate to support his allegations.\n Although it is at best not clear that the court below has canvassed the issue of credibility, this Court has not hesitated to do so. In the opinion just announced there has even been a recital of considerations relevant in determining whether the disclosure made by Baker 'springs from the impulse for truth-telling or is the product of self-delusion or artifice prompted by the instinct of self-preservation.' And the Court has apparently concluded that Hysler's allegations are so patently incredible that due process does not require a hearing. Where, as here, allegations that controlling testimony was extorted by \n\n[315 \nU.S. 411, 427]\n\u00a0\n third-degree methods are supported by sworn statements and not denied by anyone, a summary rejection of them without hearing by the court of first instance would raise serious questions of compliance with the Constitutional requirement of a fair trial. \n3\n Under such circumstances, I should suppose this Court would be particularly reluctant to make the original and only disposition itself of what it treats as a major issue of the case: the credibility of Hysler's allegations.\n The Supreme Court of Florida declined even to consider the credibility of these allegations, proceeding on the assumption-erroneous if tested by principles which I believe decisions of this Court have affirmed4-that if true, they would be insufficient to impugn the conviction. Having corrected this erroneous assumption, this Court, in my opinion, should allow the Florida courts to make their own disposition of the issue they have not considered. We granted certiorari because of a 'solicitude, especially where life is at stake, for those liberties which are guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.' That solicitude would seem to call for remanding this case for further consideration below. I cannot see why it should impel this Court to sustain the conviction upon a gratuitous disposition of an issue which the state court might resolve otherwise.\n In cases raising no issue of life or death this Court has not hesitated to remand to the lower court for further proceedings where ambiguities in the opinion below beclouded the ground of decision. \n5\n The vital issues here \n\n[315 \nU.S. 411, 428]\n\u00a0\n and the manner of treatment below compel me to believe that a like procedure should be followed now. Because the basis for my belief can best be shown by reference to the record, I am adding excerpts from the petition and accompanying exhibits as well as the whole of the opinion of the Florida Supreme Court in an appendix.\n\n\n APPENDIX.\n\n\n I. Excerpts from Hysler's petition for leave to apply for a writ of error coram nobis:\n'... Alvin Tyler and James Baker who were co-defendants of the petitioner, Clyde Hysler, and upon whose testimony the State of Florida relied upon for a conviction of petitioner was coerced, intimidated, beaten, threatened with violence and otherwise abused and mistreated in order to compell the said witnesses, Tyler and Baker to give testimony at the trial of said cause against petitioner and to implicate said petitioner in the killing of Mrs. Mamie Surrency; and further that the said witnesses, Tyler and Baker were promised immunity from the electric chair, by John W. Harrell and further promised if they would implicate Clyde Hysler in said murder and testify against him during the trial of said cause that he as State's Attorney of the Fourth Judicial Circuit of Florida together with other law enforcing officers of Duval County, Florida would see that he did not get the chair, and that they would procure a pardon and have him released from the State Penitentiary after serving three (3) years of his sentence, all of which is more particularly described by reference to a statement and affidavit made by the said James Baker on the 7th day of April, A.D. 1941, also by further affidavit and statement made by the said James Baker on the 8th day of April, A.D. 1941, and also by statement and affidavit made by the said James Baker on the 9th day of April A.D. 1941, said affidavit being marked 'A-b and c' respectively and hereby made a part of this petition as fully as though set out herein in haec verba. And for further reason that said affidavits show that the said petitioner was not implicated in the murder of the said Mrs. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 411, 429]\n\u00a0\n Mamie Surrency but that one Joe Peterson, Sr. was the person implicated in said murder and not the petitioner, Clyde Hysler, all of which is set out herein more fully in the affidavits herein above referred to and further substantiated by photostatic copies of the following affidavits, to-wit; affidavit of one Ed. Mosley; affidavit of one A. J. Mooney; affidavit of one Mrs. Ruby Crews and affidavit of one Rudolph J. Dowling, said photostatic copies being marked 'd-e-f and g' respectively, and each of said affidavits being hereto attached and hereby made a part of this petition as fully as though set out herein in haec verba.\n\n'That the said witnesses, Alvin Tyler and James Baker immediately after and following their arrest were held incommun-cado for a long period of time without being allowed the benefit and advice of counsel, without being allowed to see or confer with their friends or relatives and without being allowed to confer with the attorneys for the petitioner; that said witnesses, Tyler and Baker were removed from the Duval County Jail and confined in the State Penitentiary at Raiford, Florida with instructions to allow no one to communicate with them for a long period of time immediately following their arrest, and it became necessary for the attorneys for petitioner to procure an order of the Circuit Court of Duval County for permission to confer with said witnesses several weeks after their arrest, and then only in company with, and in the presence of the attorneys appointed by the Court to represent said witnesses and said attorneys for petitioners made diligent effort to ascertain from said witnesses facts about which they would testify to in trial of said petitioner, and thereby used diligent effort in trying to procure the information as set out herein by the respective affidavits by the witness, James Baker, but said witness Baker was afraid to divulge the truth to the attorneys for the petitioner as set out herein in the said affidavits, a-b and c hereto attached, and that said petitioner was denied a fair and impartial trial by reason of the coercion and intimidation of the witnesses, Alvin Tyler and James Baker and the hope of reward promised them as hereinabove set forth, and has by reason thereof denied equal \n\n[315 \nU.S. 411, 430]\n\u00a0\n protection of the law as guaranteed to him by the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution and was thereby denied due process of the law as guaranteed by the 5th Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n\n'That had the said witnesses, Tyler and Baker not been intimidated, coerced and promised immunity from the electric chair by the law enforcement officers in Duval County as described in affidavits 'a-b and c' hereto attached, and by John W. Harrell as herein above described, and the said witnesses had been left free to testify and tell the truth as to the said Joe Peterson, Sr. being the person involved in the murder of the said Mrs. Mamie Surrency instead of the petitioner, said testimony would have prevented the rendition of the judgment, verdict and sentence of petitioner in this cause, and if another trial be had of this cause, this petitioner would be acquitted.\n\n'That petitioner further alleges that the affidavits of the witness, James Baker, being affidavits hereto attached and marked 'a-b and c' and made by the said James Baker freely and voluntarily on his part and without any suggestion or prompting on the part of petitioner or any one on his behalf, and that the statements contained in said affidavits were made in the presence of several prison officials at Raiford, Florida after said James Baker made a voluntarily request to see and talk with the attorney for petitioner.'\n\n II. Excerpts from exhibits accompanying Hysler's petition: (These are from the transcript of three conferences held in a Florida prison on April 7 and 8, 1941. Baker was under oath. Where the statements are not in narrative form, the questioner is Hysler's attorney.)\n'... James Baker ... deposes and says:\n\n'That after the killing of Mr. and Mrs. Surrancy near Grand Crossing in Jacksonville, Florida on the 23rd day of November 1936, that he and Alvin Tyler, the man who was with him at the time of the said killing agreed between them while they were in Cracker Swamp in the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 411, 431]\n\u00a0\n Marietta section of Duval County, that they would lay the blame of the planning of the robbery of the Surrancys upon Clyde Hysler because they had had considerable liquor dealings with Clyde Hysler and knew him well, and for the reason that the Hyslers bore a bad reputation in Duval County, and for the further reason that Clyde Hysler's father had plenty of money and they thought that by laying the planning of the robbery of the Surrancys on Clyde Hysler that his father and his other relatives would put up sufficient money to get Clyde Hysler out of the trouble and that by laying it on to Clyde Hysler that he, James Baker and Alvin Tyler would escape the death penalty, that in truth and fact, that Clyde Hysler was not implicated in the planning of the robbery and had nothing to do with the killing of Mr. and Mrs. Surrancy, but that one Joe Peterson, Sr. was the man who planned the robbery and hired the said James Baker and Alvin Tyler to perform the robbery after being advised by the said Joe Peterson that it would be no trouble, and that Mr. Surrancy did not carry a gun, and all they would have to do would be to point the pistol at him and take the money, that affiant further deposes and says:\n\n'That Clyde Hysler was in no way responsible for the attempted robbery of Mr. and Mrs. Surrancy; that he had nothing to do with it, and the man who planned the robbery and was supposed to protect us in the robbery was Joe Peterson and not Clyde Hysler; that Joe Peterson was in the immediate vicinity when the attempted robbery and the killing of the Surrancys took place, and had it not been that Joe Peterson planned the robbery and hired Alvin Tyler and myself to rob Mr. Surrancy they would probably have still been living and we would not be in any trouble.\n\n'Q. Now Baker, I don't want you to tell me anything except the truth, I want you to tell me if Joe Peterson was the man that got you into all of this instead of Clyde Hysler. A. Yes, sir, he is the man.\n\n'Q. Then you and Alvin Tyler planned to lay this all on Clyde Hysler in order to try to get out of it yourself or to get a life sentence instead of the chair? \n\n[315 \nU.S. 411, 432]\n\u00a0\n A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. You recall what officers brought you over here? A. Mr. Gene Griffen and Mr. Dick Barker and some more officers.\n\n'Q. Now what threats or promises did they make you to testify and implicate Clyde Hysler? A. Well, Mr. Griffen and them didn't, they didn't make no promises, Mr. Hulbert did talk to me, that he would get me life imprisonment-life instead of the chair.\n\n'Q. Mr. Hulbert talked to you and made promises that you would get life instead of the chair? A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. What police-A. That's what it was, police officers and John Harrell.\n\n'Q. John W. Harrell, the State's Attorney at that time? A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. Did Mr. Harrell tell you that he would help you get a life sentence if you would testify against Clyde Hysler? A. He said he wouldn't burn me, that he, Mr. Acosta and Mr. Carson would get me out in three years time.\n\n'Q. Was Detective Cannon and-you was talking about and Inspector Acosta-A. The two men that arrested me, yes sir.\n\n'Q. Now from the time you was arrested, Baker, how long was you kept to yourself before you was allowed to talk to your lawyer or your friends? A. From the time I was arrested until the 21st of January, till we went back and had my trial set.\n\n'Q. The day you were arraigned in Circuit Court for the trial? A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. You was held to your self without being allowed to communicate with any of your friends or your lawyer? A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. When was you arrested? A. It was on the 23rd-24-26-when was Thanksgiving Day-just a few days.\n\n'Q. You was arrested just a few days after Thanksgiving? \n\n[315 \nU.S. 411, 433]\n\u00a0\n A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. Did any of those officers threaten you? A. They carried me in a dark room-\n\n'Q. That was here? A. No, sir, that was in Jacksonville, they carried me out to Mareitta and whipped me.\n\n'Q. What was that with? A. Something covered up in canvas, I don't know what it was and a piece of hose and something looked like a pine limb.\n\n'Q. You remember any of those names? A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. Who were they? A. Mr. Woods, R. L. Woods, and Mr. Carson slapped me two or three times and gave them the black jack to beat me with. ...\n\n'Q. That was in the presence of Mr. Woods, Carson and Acosta? A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. That was to try to make you implicate Mr. Hysler in the robbery of Mr. Surrency and Mrs. Surrency? A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. And if it hadn't been for the beatings and threats and the promises to get you out of here in three years as you have stated above would you have implicated Mr. Hysler in the case at all? A. No, sir, cause I told them I didn't no anything about it; and another thing, between Mr. Hysler's first trial and last one, Mr. Harrell came down to the County Jail after I was allowed to see people, I said, don't you known that if you burn Mr. Hysler you will have to burn me too, and he said he could burn the whole Hysler family and don't burn me cause he and Mr. Sidney Hulbert, Mr. Carson and Mr. Cannon and some more officers was going to run the County as long as they were running it.\n\n'Q. Baker, how many times did the officers threaten you and beat you after you were arrested? A. They beat me about three o'clock in the morning to ten o'clock before they got me to say anything. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 411, 434]\n\u00a0\n 'Q. It was the police made you tell the sheriff's office? A. You, sir.\n\n'Q. Was you afraid not to tell them what they wanted you to, afraid they would beat you some more? A. Yes, sir, if them-I said two words they would slap me, before the sheriff bunch got there they had sent out and bought me dinner, give me $5.00 or $6.00 dollars in money, and said don't tell any body about me being whipped, if anyone asked me, tell them no.\n\n'Q. Then it was a definite promise from Mr. Harrell, the State's Attorney to keep you from burning? A. He said that he would see that I would get life, but that he would see that I didn't stay at the chain gang but three years.\n\n'Q. Baker what about the remarks you wanted to make? A. Where they kicked me.\n\n'Q. That at Jacksonville police station? A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. Who was that? A. Mr. Carson, thats who had me at that time, he taken me down there where a bunch of police was shooting pool.\n\n'Q. What all did they do to you? A. Those officers down there asked him if he made me tell him what they wanted to know, and Mr. Carson-Mr. Carson said not yet, and they said, turn him loose with us about 25 minutes and we will make him say anything they wanted me to say, and he told them to take me and hold me until they went up into the office and make a call, and while he was gone to make a call they carried me back into a room and put a coat over my head and went to beating me, I got scars on me now, I want to show them to you and its what you call risons, you can get your doctor and he will tell you what was caused from blows-\n\n'Q. You still have scars on you from that beating? A. Yes-\n\n'Q. Was those beatings that caused those scars on you to tell on Clyde Hysler? A. To make me tell anything.\n\n'Q. Did they mention Clyde Hysler's name to you while they were beating you? \n\n[315 \nU.S. 411, 435]\n\u00a0\n A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. Do you know the names of those officers? A. No, sir, those were new officers to me, they were speed cops, had those things on their shoulders.\n\n'Q. Did any of them tell you that Clyde Hysler was mixed up in the killing or such as that? A. They said they knew he was in it-and after I told how it was they made me implicate him.\n\n'Q. Implicate him? A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. As a matter of fact, Hysler was not mixed in it but it was Joe Peterson-A. They had me hand cuffed behind my back and I was chained and beat me, ....\n\n'Q. Baker do you know whether or not Mr. Harrell knew if you was beat up to make you testify? A. Yes, sir, he knows I couldn't set down, none of the sheriff's force knew it at the time, they knew it later when I made it in front all of the officers.\n\n'Q. When you made that statement you couldn't set down. A. Yes, sir, and I can't set down good, and I wish you and those men could see that now.'\n\n III. The opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida on motion for rehearing: (No opinion accompanied the original denial of Hysler's petition.)\n'Buford, Justice.\n\n'On motion for rehearing on application for an order for leave to apply to the Circuit Court of Duval County for a writ of error coram nobis to review the judgment of conviction of petitioner of the offense of Murder in the First Degree heretofore entered in that Court, on grounds stated in the petition, we have denied the petition for reasons as follows:\n\n'(a) This Court may take judicial cognizance of its own records and the record lodged in this Court on the writ of error to the judgment of conviction of the petitioner shows ample evidence to support the judgment of conviction without the aid of the testimony given on that trial by the witness James Baker. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 411, 436]\n\u00a0\n '(b) Writ of error coram nobis will not lie because of false testimony given at the trial by important witness. Lamb v. State, 91 Fla. 396, 107 So. 535.\n\n'(c) Matters properly presentable for writ of coram nobis are such as would have prevented conviction and not such as may have caused a different result. Chesser v. State, 92 Fla. 754, 109 So. 906.\n\n'(d) If witness Baker swore falsely at defendant's trial, that fact was known to petitioner at the time of the trial. Washington v. State, 95 Fla. 289, 116 So. 470; Pike v. State, 103 Fla. 594, 139 So. 196.\n\n'(e) The allegations of the petition do not show that the prosecuting attorney had any guilty knowledge of the alleged maltreatment of the witness, or that the alleged falsity of testimony of the witness Baker was known to the prosecuting officer.\n\n'(f) The petition does not show that any alleged maltreatment of witness was inflicted by any officer of the trial court or that same was known to any officer of the trial court.\n\n'(g) The records of this Court, of which we take judicial cognizance, show that petitioner was convicted on trial held subsequent to the trial and conviction of the witness Baker of the offense of Murder in the first degree without recommendation to mercy, and that both trials were conducted on behalf of each defendant by able, diligent and faithful counsel.\n\n'(h) If all petitioner alleges in his petition had been true and had been fully made known to the trial court and to the jury which tried the defendant-petitioner, it would not have precluded the entry of the judgment upon a verdict of guilty of Murder in the first degree having been returned by the jury.\n\n'So it is, the petition in insufficient to require us to grant same and for such reasons the same was denied and the petition for rehearing is likewise denied.\n\n'So ordered.\n\n'Terrell, Thomas, and Chapman, JJ., concur.\n\n'Brown, C.J., dissents.' \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In denying Hysler's application the Supreme Court of Florida specifically stated the that it was taking judicial cognizance of its own records. 146 Fla. 593, 594, 595, 1 So.2d 628. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'Q.

CENTRAL ILLINOIS PUBLIC SERVICE CO.(1942)\nNo. 100\nArgued: December 19, 1941Decided: January 5, 1942\n\n\n\n\n[314 \nU.S. 498, 499]\n\u00a0\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois.\n Mr. Glenn W. Clerk, of Kansas City, Mo., for appellant.\n Mr. Albert E. Hallett, Jr., of Chicago, Ill., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[314 \nU.S. 498, 501]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On complaint of appellee, Central Illinois Public Service Company, which is engaged in the distribution of natural gas to consumers in various cities and towns in Illinois, appellee, Illinois Commerce Commission, made its order requiring appellant, Illinois Natural Gas Company, to supply the Central Company with natural gas and to establish the pipe line connection necessary for \n\n[314 \nU.S. 498, 502]\n\u00a0\n that purpose. In the proceedings before the Commission, appellant contended that its entire operations and business in Illinois constitute interstate commerce and challenged the Commission's exercise of its jurisdiction and its order, as in conflict with the commerce clause and the provisions of the Natural Gas Act, 52 Stat. 821-833, 15 U.S.C.  717- 717w, 15 U.S.C.A.  717-717w. Section 7(c), 15 U.S.C.  717f(c), 15 U.S.C. A.  717f(c), it was contended, prohibits such extension of facilities and sale of gas to distributors without a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Federal Power Commission.\n On review the Illinois Circuit Court sustained the order and the Illinois Supreme Court affirmed, 375 Ill. 634, 32 N.E.2d 157, holding that the activities of appellant affected by the Commission's order constitute intrastate commerce, to which the provisions of the Natural Gas Act do not apply, and that those activities are, therefore, subject to state regulation. The case comes here on appeal under  237(a) of the Judicial Code as amended, 28 U.S.C.  344(a), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(a).\n Appellant, an Illinois corporation, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, which owns and operates a natural gas pipe line system extending from gas fields in Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma across Illinois and into Indiana. Appellant owns a pipe line system wholly in Illinois, whose transmission pipe lines connect at various points in Illinois with the main line of Panhandle Eastern. Appellant by long term contract purchases its supply of gas from Panhandle Eastern and transports it through its own lines to local gas distributing utilities in Illinois to which it sells the gas for distribution to consumers in Illinois cities and towns. It also sells and delivers gas to several industrial consumers in the state. The gas moves continuously, under pressure applied by Panhandle, from the gas fields until it enters appellant's transmission lines where appellant reduces \n\n[314 \nU.S. 498, 503]\n\u00a0\n the pressure according to the needs of its service. After the reduction of pressure the gas continues to move in appellant's lines until it passes into the service pipes of the local distributors, or industrial users, where the pressure is again substantially reduced. The Central Illinois Public Service Company is distributing natural gas to consumers in several Illinois towns and cities, which it purchases for resale from Universal Gas Company, and takes from the pipe line of the latter at the Illinois state line. Universal in turn acquires the gas in Indiana from Panhandle Eastern, and from Kentucky Natural Gas Company.\n The Illinois Commission found that appellant's operations in the sale of the gas to distributors in the state are wholly intrastate commerce; that the supply of gas capable of passing through Central's pipe line is inadequate to supply the Illinois communities served by it. The Commission then ordered appellant to extend its pipe line so as to connect with Central's pipe line system and to supply gas in sufficient quantities to enable it to satisfy the needs of its customers.\n That appellant and Panhandle Eastern are engaged in interstate commerce in the purchase and sale of the natural gas which moves in a continuous stream from points without the state into appellant's pipes within the state seems not to be open to question. Missouri v. Kansas Gas Company, \n265 \nU.S. 298\n, 44 S.Ct. 544; Ozark Pipe Line Corp. v. Monier, \n266 \nU.S. 555\n, 45 S.Ct. 184; People's Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n270 \nU.S. 550\n, 46 S.Ct. 371; State Tax Commission v. Interstate Gas Company, \n284 \nU.S. 41\n, 52 S.Ct. 62. Pursuant to the mutual agreement of the two companies the gas is transported in continuous movement through the pipe line into the state and through appellant's pipes to the service lines of the distributors where appellant delivers it to them. In such a transaction the particular point at which the title and custody of the gas passes to \n\n[314 \nU.S. 498, 504]\n\u00a0\n the purchaser without arresting its movement to the intended destination does not affect the essential interstate nature of the business. See People's Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission, supra, 270 U.S. page 554, 46 S.Ct. page 372; Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, \n262 \nU.S. 553, 587\n, 43 S.Ct. 658, 661, 32 A.L.R. 300; United Fuel Gas Co. v. Hallanan, \n257 \nU.S. 277, 280\n, 281 S., 42 S.Ct. 105.\n But appellee argues, as the State Supreme Court held, that although the sale of the gas and its movement into the state is interstate commerce, that commerce comes to an end when appellant reduces the gas pressure before its delivery into the service pipes of the distributors. In consequence it is asserted the sale of the gas to the distributors is intrastate commerce subject to state regulation by the Commission's order, and is therefore not within the purview of the Natural Gas Act, which is said to be applicable only to interstate commerce.\n This Court has held that the retail sale of gas at the burner tips by one who pipes the gas into the state, or by one who is a local distributor acquiring the gas from another who has similarly brought it into the state, is a sale in intrastate commerce, since the interstate commerce was said to end upon the introduction of the gas into the service pipes of the distributor. Public Utilities Commission v. Landon, \n249 \nU.S. 236\n, 39 S.Ct. 268; East Ohio Gas Co. v. Tax Commission, \n283 \nU.S. 465\n, 51 S. Ct. 499. In applying this mechanical test for determining when interstate commerce ends and intrastate commerce begins this Court has held that the interstate transportation and the sale of gas at wholesale to local distributing companies is not subject to state control of rates, Missouri v. Kansas Gas Co., supra; see Public Utilities Commission v. Landon, supra, 249 U.S. page 245, 39 S.Ct. page 269; cf. Public Utilities Commission v. Attleboro Co., \n273 \nU.S. 83, 89\n, 47 S.Ct. 294, 296, or to a state privilege tax, State Tax Commission v. Interstate Gas Company, supra. Yet state regulation of local retail rates to ultimate consumers has been sustained where the gas so dis- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 498, 505]\n\u00a0\n tributed was purchased at wholesale from one who had piped the gas into the state, Public Utilities Commission v. Landon, supra, as has a state tax measured by receipts from local retail sales of gas by one who has similarly brought the gas into the state. East Ohio Gas Co. v. Tax Commission, supra.\n In other cases the Court, in determining the validity of state regulations, has been less concerned to find a point in time and space where the interstate commerce in gas ends and intrastate commerce begins, and has looked to the nature of the state regulation involved, the objective of the state, and the effect of the regulation upon the national interest in the commerce. Cf. South Carolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros., \n303 \nU.S. 177, 185\n, 187 S. et seq., 58 S.Ct. 510, 513, 514; California v. Thompson, \n313 \nU.S. 109, 113\n, 114 S., 61 S.Ct. 930, 932; Duckworth v. Arkansas, \n314 \nU.S. 390\n, 62 S.Ct. 311, 86 L.Ed. --, decided the term. Thus, in Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n252 \nU.S. 23\n, 40 S.Ct. 279, where natural gas was transported by pipe line from one state into another and there sold directly to ultimate local consumers, it was held that, although the sale was a part of interstate commerce, a state public service commission could regulate the rates for service to such consumers. While the Court recognized that this local regulation would to some extent affect interstate commerce in gas, it was thought that the control of rates was a matter so peculiarly of local concern that the regulation should be deemed within state power. Cf. Arkansas Louisiana Gas Co. v. Department of Public Utilities, \n304 \nU.S. 61\n, 58 S.Ct. 770. And, similarly, this Court has sustained a non-discriminatory tax on the sale to a buyer within the taxing state of a commodity shipped interstate in performance of the sales contract, upon upon the ground that the delivery was not a part of interstate commerce, see East Ohio Gas Co. v. Tax Commission, supra, but because the tax was not a prohibited regulation of or burden on that commerce. Wil- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 498, 506]\n\u00a0\n oil Corporation v. Pennsylvania, \n294 \nU.S. 169\n, 55 S.Ct. 358; McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Co., \n309 \nU.S. 33, 50\n, 60 S.Ct. 388, 394, 128 A.L.R. 876. In Southern Gas Corp. v. Atabama, \n301 \nU.S. 148, 156\n, 157 S., 57 S.Ct. 696, 700, on which the Illinois Supreme Court relied, we held only that the sale of gas to a local industrial consumer by one who was piping the gas into the state was a local business sufficient to sustain a franchise tax on the privilege of doing business within the state, measured by all the taxpayer's property located there, including that used for wholesale distribution of gas to local public service companies.\n In the absence of any controlling act of Congress we should now be faced with the question whether the interest of the state in the present regulation of the sale and distribution of gas transported into the state balanced against the effect of such control on the commerce in its national aspect, is a more reliable touchstone for ascertaining state power than the mechanical distinctions on which appellee relies. But we are under no necessity of making that choice here for Congress, by the Natural Gas Act, has brought under national control the very matters which the state has undertaken to regulate by the order.\n An avowed purpose of the Natural Gas Act of June 21, 1938, was to afford, through the exercise of the national power over interstate commerce, an agency for regulating the wholesale distribution to public service companies of natural gas moving interstate, which this Court had declared to be interstate commerce not subject to certain types of state regulation. H.R. No. 709, Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., April 28, 1937.1 By its enactment Congress under- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 498, 507]\n\u00a0\n took to regulate a defined class of natural gas distribution without the necessity, where Congress has not acted, of drawing the precise line between state and federal power by the litigation of particular cases. By  1(b), 15 U.S.C.  717(b), 15 U.S.C.A.  717(b), the Act is restricted in its application 'to the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, to the sale in interstate commerce of naturl gas for resale for ultimate public consumption for domestic, commercial, industrial, or any other use, and to natural-gas companies engaged in such transportation or sale .... And by  2(6), 15 U.S.C.  717a(6), 15 U.S.C.A.  717a(6) 'natural-gas company' means a person (including corporation) engaged in the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce or the sale in interstate commerce of such gas for resale. Sections 4, 5, 6, 15 U.S.C.  717c, 717d, 717e, give the Federal Power Commission extensive control over the rates at which the gas is sold for resale. Under  7(a), 15 U.S.C.  717f(a), 15 U.S.C.A.  717f(a), the Commission has authority to order natural-gas companies to extend their systems to establish physical connections of their transportation facilities with those of \n\n[314 \nU.S. 498, 508]\n\u00a0\n distributors and to sell gas to them. Section 7(b) prohibits the abandonment of the facilities of natural-gas companies without approval of the Commission. Section 7(c), here involved, provides that 'No natural-gas company shall undertake the construction or extension of any facilities for the transportation of natural gas to a market in which natural gas in already being served by another natural-gas company, or acquire or operate any such facilities or extensions thereof, or engage in transportation by means of any new or additional facilities, or sell natural gas in any such market', without the Federal Commission's certificate of public convenience and necessity.\n We think it plain that these provisions, read in the light of the legislative history, were intended to bring under federal regulation wholesale distribution, like that of appellant, of gas moving interstate. Appellant engages in interstate commerce in gas and in its interstate transportation as those terms had been denied by this Court, before the adoption of the Act. After the gas is brought into the state appellant makes the first sale to distributors for resale, to which the Act in terms applies, and which the cases last mentioned defined as a part of the commerce subject in some respects to the exclusive regulation of Congress. Cf. Parker v. Motor Boat Sales, Inc., \n314 \nU.S. 244\n, 62 S.Ct. 221, 86 L.Ed . --, decided this term. Section 7 of the Act commits to the Federal Commission the control of extensions and abandonment of the transportation facilities of natural-gas companies, their physical connection with those of distributors and sales to distributors, and prohibits extensions, such as the state commission has now ordered, into an area already served by another natural-gas company, unless the Commission has first granted a certificate of public convenience and necessity. Since the communities here are supplied by the Universal and Central companies, which transport the gas interstate, they constitute a market already served by a natural- gas company within  7(c) and  2(6) of the Act. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 498, 509]\n\u00a0\n The Federal Commission has ruled that it has jurisdiction under the Act over companies which, like appellant, sell at wholesale to local distributors gas moving interstate. Re Billings Gas Company, 35 P.U.R.,N.S ., 321; Re East Ohio Gas Company, 28 P.U.R.,N.S., 129. The proceedings of the Commission under  7(c) indicate the many important matters which it takes into consideration in determining whether an extension of facilities in a case such as this should be permitted. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n In determining the scope of the federal power over the proposed extension of facilities and sale of gas it is unnecessary to scrutinize with meticulous care the physical characteristics of appellant's business, in order to ascertain whether, as the court below held, the interstate commerce involved in bringing the gas into the state ends before delivery to distributors. In any case the proposed extension of appellant's facilities is so intimately associated with the commerce and would so affect its volume moving into the state and distribution among the states as to be within the Congressional power to regulate those matters which materially affect interstate commerce, as well as the commerce itself.

The States have, of course, for many years regulated sales of natural gas to consumers in intrastate transactions. The States have also been able to regulate sales to consumers even though such sales are in interstate commerce, such sales being considered local in character and in the absence of congressional prohibition subject to State regulation. (See Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission, 1920, \n252 \nU.S. 23\n (40 S. Ct. 279).) There is no intention in enacting the present legislation to disturb the States in their exercise of such jurisdiction. However, in the case of sales for resale, or so-called wholesale sales, in interstate commerce (for example, sales by producing companies to distributing companies) the legal situation is different. Such transactions have been considered to be not local in character and, even in the absence of Congressional action, not subject to State regulation. ( See Missouri v. Kansas Gas Co., 1924, \n265 \nU.S. 298\n (44 S.Ct. 544), and Public Utilities Commission v. Attleboro Steam & Electric Co., 1927, \n273 \nU.S. 83\n (47 S.Ct. 294).) The basic purpose of the present legislation is to occupy this field in which the Supreme Court has held that the States may not act.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In Re Kansas Pipe Line & Gas Co., No. G-106 and in Re North Dakota Consumers Gas Co., No. G-119, October 24, 1939, it inquired:\n (1) whether the applicant possessed a supply of natural gas adequate to meet those demands which it was reasonable to assume would be made upon it; (2) whether there existed in the territory proposed to be served customers who could reasonably be expected to use such gas service; (3) whether the facilities proposed to be constructed would be adequate to meet the estimated demands for gas in the area; (4) whether applicant possessed adequate financial resources with which to construct the facilities proposed; (5) whether the cost of construction of the facilities proposed was adequate and reasonable; (6) whether anticipated fixed charges were reasonable; (7) whether the rates proposed to be charged were reasonable, comparing in that connection the proposed rates with those of other natural-gas companies already serving the territory. \n\n\n\n\n","62":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINTERSTATE COMMERCE COM'N v.

McEwen, of Toledo, Ohio, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant Pacific Electric Railway Company owns and operates electric railroads and motor bus and truck lines in California. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Southern Pacific Railroad Company with whose lines it makes connections at numerous points. It applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission for permission to carry out 'a general program of rearrangement of ... passenger service, involvign abandonment of certain rail lines and substitution of motor coach transportation as a means of increasing operating revenues, reducing expenses, and rendering a more adequate service to the public.' The Railway Labor Executives' Association and The Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen appeared before the Commission as representatives of Pacific's employees. They contended that if the Commission were to grant Pacific's application, it should do so only upon conditions designed to protect employees, and proposed that Pacific be required to provide certain specified benefits for employees who would be displaced or otherwise prejudiced by the abandonment. In support of this contention, they argued that many of Pacific's employees had devoted a large part of their lives to the service of the railroad and had acquired valuable rights of seniority in connection with their employment; that the proposed change would cause many of them to lose their jobs as a result of which they would suffer great hardships and some would become public charges; and that although the abandonment and rearrangement would give Pacific a net annual savings \n\n[315 \nU.S. 373, 375]\n\u00a0\n of approximately $378,000, about $302,000 of the saving would be due to a net wage loss suffered by employees. After a hearing, Division 4 of the Commission issued an order permitting abandonment upon the ground that continued operation of the line by Pacific 'would impose an undue burden upon the applicant and upon interstate commerce,' but held that the Commission was without statutory authority to impose any conditions whatever for the protection of employees in these proceedings. Pacific Electric Railway Co. Abandonment, 242 I.C.C. 9. The full Commission denied the brotherhood's request for rehearing. Upon application of the brotherhoods, the Federal District Court of the District of Columbia, composed of three judges, in accordance with 28 U.S.C.  47, 28 U.S.C.A.  47, held that the Commission did have authority to impose conditions for the protection of displaced employees. Accordingly, it set aside 'That part of the Commission's report which denies consideration of the employees' petition for lack of power ... with directions to the Commission to consider the petition and take such action thereon as in the discretion of the Commission is proper.' Railway Labor Executives' Ass'n v. United States, D.C., 38 F.Supp. 818, 824. Whether it is within the Commission's power in abandonment proceedings to impose conditions for the protection of employees is the single question presented by this appeal.\n Section 1(18) of the Interstate Commerce Act provides that 'no carrier by railroad subject to this part (chapter) shall abandon all or any portion of a line of railroad, or the operation thereof, unless and until there shall first have been obtained from the commission a certificate that the present or future public convenience and necessity permit of such abandonment.' And Section 1(20) empowers the Commission to 'attach to the issuance of the certificate such terms and conditions as in its judgment the public convenience and necessity may require.' 49 U.S.C.  1(18)-(20), 49 U.S.C.A.  1(18-20). \n\n[315 \nU.S. 373, 376]\n\u00a0\n With respect to consolidations, another section of the Act, 5(4), is controlling. In United States v. Lowden, \n308 \nU.S. 225\n, 60 S.Ct. 248, 251, this Court held that the Commission has authority under Section 5(4) to impose conditions similar to those sought here in order to protect employees adversely affected by a consolidation. At the time of the Lowden case, Section 5(4) provided: 'If ... the Commission finds that, subject to such terms and conditions and such modifications as it shall find to be just and reasonable, the proposed consolidation ... will promote the public interest, it may enter an order approving and authorizing such consolidation ... upon the terms and conditions and with the modifications so found to be just and reasonable.' 49 U.S.C.  5( 4), 49 U.S.C.A.  5(2).\n The Commission argues that the conditions it is authorized to impose under the consolidation section-'just and reasonable' conditions, which 'will promote the public interest'-are of much broader scope than the conditions it is authorized to impose under the abandonment section- conditions which 'the public convenience and necessity may require.' Although admitting that provisions for the protection of displaced employees may be a condition that 'will promote the public interest', the Commission concludes that such provisions cannot be required by 'the public convenience and necessity.' We need not decide in what respects, if any, the authorization to impose conditions in consolidations is broader than the authorization to impose conditions in abandonments. For even assuming that the language of the abandonment section is narrower, we cannot agree that it excludes all power to impose conditions of the kind sought here.\n The phrase 'public convenience and necessity' no less than the phrase 'public interest' must be given a scope consistent with the broad purpose of the Transportation Act of 1920, 49 U.S.C.A.  71 et seq.: to provide the public with an efficient and nationally integrated railroad system. Akron, C. & Y.R. Co. v. United States, (New England \n\n[315 \nU.S. 373, 377]\n\u00a0\n Divisions Case), \n261 \nU.S. 184\n, 189-191, 43 S.Ct. 270, 273. Clear recognition that 'public convenience and necessity' includes the consideration of effects on the national transportation system of a proposed abandonment appears in the decision of this Court in Colorado v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 153\n, 46 S.Ct. 452, 454. There, Mr. Justice Brandeis, although stating that 'public convenience and necessity' was the sole criterion for determining whether or not an abandonment should be allowed, nevertheless considered the effect of the proposed abandonment in a much broader sphere than the immediate locality and population served by the trackage to be abandoned. See, also, Transit Commission v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 360\n, 52 S.Ct. 157. And if national interests are to be considered in connection with an abandonment, there is nothing in the Act to indicate that the national interest in purely financial stability is to be determinative while the national interest in the stability of the labor supply available to the railroads is to be disregarded. On the contrary, the Lowden case recognizes that the unstabilizing effects of displacing labor without protection might be prejudicial to the orderly and efficient operation of the national railroad system. Such possible unstabilizing effects on the national railroad system are no smaller in the case of an abandonment like the one before us than in a consolidation like that involved in the Lowden case. Hence, it is only by excluding considerations of national policy with respect to the transportation system from the scope of 'public convenience and necessity', an exclusion inconsistent with the Act as this Court has interpreted it, that the distinction made by the Commission can be maintained.\n It was not until 1935, fifteen years after the passage of Section 1( 20), that the Commission first decided that it was without power to impose conditions for the protection of workers in an abandonment. Chicago G.W.R. Co. Trackage, 207 I.C.C. 315, 322. At that time the Com- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 373, 378]\n\u00a0\n mission took the position that requiring displacement allowances as a condition would be the equivalent of granting a private benefit to a particular group of workers, and therefore beyond the scope of authority granted by Congress. The Commission has taken the same position here. It must not be forgotten, however, that the immediate result of permitting the abandonment itself is a private benefit for the railroad in the form of savings realized by discontinuing uneconomic services. The justification lies in the benefit to the transportation system which the Commission concluded the abandonment would produce. There is nothing in the Act to prevent the Commission from taking action in furtherance of the 'public convenience and necessity' merely because the total impact of that action will include benefits to private persons, either carriers or employees. The Lowden case specifically recognized that the imposition of conditions similar to those sought here might strengthen the national system through their effect on the morale and stability of railway workers generally. Exactly the same considerations of national importance are applicable and operative here.\n We must also reject the further argument that Congress has ratified the Commission's construction of Section 1(18)-(20). It is true that Congress made no changes in Section 1(18)-(20) of the Interstate Commerce Act in passing the Transportation Act of 1940, 49 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq., and that the annual reports of the Commission to Congress in 1935 and 1936 had specifically asked 'for further statutory provisions to protect employees from undue financial loss as a consequence of authorized railway abandonments or unifications.' But the Lowden case, clearly establishing that the Commission's 1935 and 1936 doubts about its powers with respect to unifications were erroneous, was decided on December 4, 1939. Congress could with good reason have concluded that the principle of the Lowden case was \n\n[315 \nU.S. 373, 379]\n\u00a0\n equally applicable to abandonments. In any event, the contrary conclusion- that abandonments were now to be distinguished although the Commission had made no such distinction in presenting the problem to Congress and that Congress approved such a distinction-is at best the product of a set of inference none of which is free from doubt. We therefore cannot impute to Congress's failure to amend Section 1(18)-(20) the significance which the petitioners contend it should have.\n Nor is the petitioners' contention strengthened because Congress did modify Section 5(4) in the Transportation Act of 1940. The modifications, so far as relevant here, merely made mandatory with respect to unifications the protections for workers that had previously been discretionary. \n1\n See Lowden v. United States, supra, \n308 \nU.S. 239\n, 60 S.Ct. 255. To regard them as a restriction on the discretionary power of the Commission with respect to abandonments is not merely illogical. It requires us to impute to Congress a policy of mandatory protection for labor in unifications and no \n\n[315 \nU.S. 373, 380]\n\u00a0\n protection at all in abandonments. It is reasonable to suppose that if Congress had intended to make such a distinction, it would have said so more explicitly.\n The petitioners have made further arguments based on the statutory history of the Transportation Act of 1940, relying upon incidental and sporadic references in committee hearings and reports to the protection of labor in connection with abandonments. We have reviewed those references, and have found that they raise inferences too ambiguous to support the conclusion that Congress has ratified the Commission's construction of Section 1(18)-(20).\n It is also urged that we should not disturb the Commission's construction of the abandonment provisions for the reason that administrative interpretations by the agency charged with the enforcement of a statute are entitled to great weight. But as we have pointed out, the construction placed upon Section 1(18)-(20) by the Commission is not only hostile to the major objective of the Act and inconsistent with decisions of this Court, but irreconcilable with its own interpretations of Section 5(4). Under such circumstances, we believe the court below was amply justified in refusing to accept the Commission's construction. Cf. Mitchell v. United States, \n313 \nU.S. 80\n, 61 S.Ct. 873; City Bank Farmers Trust Co. v. Helvering, \n313 \nU.S. 121\n, 61 S.Ct. 896\n\n\n We therefore conclude that the Commission has authority to attach terms and conditions for the benefit of employees displaced by railroad abandonments. Whether such terms and conditions should be attached in this case and if so their nature and extent are questions for the Commission to decide in the light of the evidence. The judgment of the court below should accordingly be affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'As a condition of its approval, under this paragraph (2), of any transaction involving a carrier or carriers by railroad subject to the provisions of this part (chapter), the Commission shall require a fair and equitable arrangement to protect the interests of the railroad employees affected.

Kaskell, Jr., of Jamaica, L.I., N.Y., for appellants Edward and Robert McGlone, infants, by their guardian.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The federal question presented upon this appeal is whether  18 of the New York Decedent Estate Law, Consol.Law, c. 13, \n\n[314 \nU.S. 556, 558]\n\u00a0\n works an impairment of the obligation of contract, forbidden by Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution, or a deprivation of property without due process, forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The instrument which appellees claim embodies a contract which has been impaired, and under which they claim property rights, reads as follows:\n'I, Helena Day Snyder, being of sound mind and in possession of all my faculties, on the eve of my marriage to John J. McGlone, in London, England, on February 4th, 1922, wish to record, of my free will, that, as I already possess, in my own right, ample of this world's goods in the way of a fortune of my own, as a compliment to my aforesaid husband, and for other good and sufficient reasons, I hereby, voluntarily and irrevocably renounce all right, title and interest I might, legally or otherwise, have in any estate, real or personal, of which my said husband to be, John J. McGlone, might due seized.'\n\n Appellee's decedent, Helena Day Snyder, who died in the course of this litigation, executed this instrument in London two days before her marriage to John J. McGlone, appellant's decedent. The laws of New York at the time gave to a widow dower rights in her husband's real estate, but, except for restrictions on charitable gifts not involved here, left him otherwise free to make testamentary disposition of all his property to strangers.\n On August 21, 1930, McGlone executed a will, one clause of which recited Helena's waiver but 'nevertheless' made a bequest of $2,000 to her as a 'slight token' of his affection and admiration. The legislation complained of, giving a testator's surviving spouse a right of election to take against the will, had been enacted as  18 of the Decedent Estate Law on March 29, 1929, but it did not become effective until September 1, 1930, a \n\n[314 \nU.S. 556, 559]\n\u00a0\n few days after McGlone executed his will. \n1\n It premitted waiver by a spouse or prospective spouse of the protection thus afforded, but in order to be effective the waiver was required to be 'by an instrument subscribed and duly acknowledged.' \n2\n The instrument signed by Helena was not acknowledged, and the new legislation was limited in operation to wills executed after its effective date.\n McGlone so acted as to bring his estate under this new legislation. On July 6, 1934, he executed a codicil \n\n[314 \nU.S. 556, 560]\n\u00a0\n to his will which, although it did not disturb the provision made for his wife in his earlier will, had the effect of bringing the entire will, modified and republished, within the provisions of the new law3 and thus, according to the terms of  18, of giving her a right of election to take under the statute and against the will.\n Helena sought to exercise this right, and thus precipitated the present litigation, in which the quoted instrument was pleaded as a bar to the right. The Surrogate held that the instrument was not a contract, In re McGlone's Will, 171 Misc. 612, 13 N.Y.S.2d 76; the Appellate Division held that it was, In re McGlone's Will, 258 App.Div. 596, 17 N.Y.S.2d 316; and the New York Court of Appeals assumed, without deciding, that apart from the effect of  18 of the Decedent Estate Law, it was a binding contract, validly executed, and entitled to the protection of the Constitutional provisions here invoked. The Court of Appeals held, however, that 'A wife cannot by agreement make the husband's right created by law immune from the right of the State to change the law which created the right nor waive in advance a right created for her benefit if the law does not permit such a waiver.' Section 18 was held to confer a right of election upon Helena, and to be consistent with the requirements of the contract and due process clauses of the Federal Constitution. Matter of McGlone's Will, 284 N.Y. 527, 533, 32 N.E.2d 539, 542.\n The reluctance of the New York Court of Appeals to decide the question whether the instrument in question did constitute a contract is quite understandable upon consideration of the record made up in this case. It appears from the face of the instrument that it was penned on stationery of the Savoy Hotel, London, by an unidentified scribe, and that the only signature was Helena's. The instrument does not recite mutuality of agreement. It recites no consideration, and none is \n\n[314 \nU.S. 556, 561]\n\u00a0\n proved. It rather negatives the receipt of consideration and the likelihood that marriage was such by indicating that the parties had already exchanged promises to marry. Nor is there anything in text or context to help identify the source of the rights said to be waived. No circumstances are adduced to show that either of the parties, about to marry in a foreign land, then had New York as a domicile or was contracting with reference to its laws, either present or future. The marriage record in evidence shows that his 'residence at the time of marriage' was 'Savoy Hotel, London' and hers was 'The Beverleys, Thornbury Road, Isleworth.' If either was domiciled elsewhere, there is nothing to indicate it. There is not even any showing that at the time either of the parties owned or had any expectation of owning property in New York. No apparent heed has been given to the usual rule that the law of the place of contracting determines questions of form, capacity to contract, necessity of consideration, and some aspects of the duty of performance. Both sides seem to have assumed, but for reasons that are not revealed, that the law of New York governs these questions. The niggardliness of the record may by due in some part to the restriction imposed on the right of a survivor to testify by  347 of the New York Civil Practice Act, but this does not warrant an illinformed guess by this Court as to the existence of a contract or its meaning under properly applicable rules of law.\n When this Court is asked to invalidate a state statute upon the ground that it impairs the obligation of a contract, the existence of the contract and the nature and extent of its obligation become federal questions for the purposes of determining whether they are within the scope and meaning of the Federal Constitution, and for such purposes finality cannot be accorded to the views of a state court.

Eastern Texas R.R., \n264 \nU.S. 79, 86\n, 87 S., 44 S.Ct. 247, 249; Coolidge v. Long, \n282 \nU.S. 582, 597\n, 51 S.Ct. 306, 309; United States Mortgage Co. v. Matthews, \n293 \nU.S. 232, 236\n, 55 S.Ct. 168, 170; Higginbotham v. Baton Rouge, \n306 \nU.S. 535, 538\n, 59 S.Ct. 705, 706. In any view we might take of the constitutional questions urged here we should not regard this record as an adequate basis for invalidating a state statute. But, lest a decision on this ground be taken as an invitation to further litigation in the New York courts and in this Court, we shall emulate the generosity shown by the Court of Appeals to the appellants and adopt its assumption as to the existence and nature of the contract for the purpose of disposing of the other questions urged.\n Rights of succession to the property of a deceased, whether by will or by intestacy, are of statutory creation, and the dead hand rules succession only by sufferance. Nothing in the Federal Constitution forbids the legislature of a state to limit, condition, or even abolish the power of testamentary disposition over property within its jurisdiction. Mager v. Grima, 8 How. 490; United States v. Fox, \n94 \nU.S. 315\n; United States v. Perkins, \n163 \nU.S. 625\n, 16 S.Ct. 1073; cf. Randall v. Kreiger, 23 Wall. 137, 148. Expectations or hopes of succession, whether testate or intestate, to the property of a living person, do not vest until the death of that person. Appellants cannot successfully attack the constitutionality of the new legislation which went into effect before McGlone's death, and became operative only as the result of his own voluntary act.\n McGlone was free to consent to a cancellation or revocation of Helena's waiver, or to make a valid bequest to her of all or any of his property despite it. Further, he could free her of the restraints of her waiver by voluntarily committing an act to which the applicable law attached that consequence. This is what he did by executing the codicil of July 6, 1934, voluntarily taking \n\n[314 \nU.S. 556, 563]\n\u00a0\n advantage of the privilege of further testamentary disposition offered by the laws of New York. So long as McGlone stood on the will made before the effective date of the legislation, the law allowed him to avail himself of the full force and effect of the waiver. Given his choice between adhering to any will made before September 1, 1930, or of bringing his estate under the new law, McGlone saw fit to execute a further testamentary document after that date and thus to bring the new legislation into operation as to himself, his estate and survivors. For the purpose of considering the application of the contract and due process clauses of the Federal Constitution, the case is as if he had made a voluntary legacy to his wife despite her waiver. If the obligation of the waiver suffered impairment, it was only because he exercised further testamentary privileges with a condition attached, and thereby brought those consequences unwittingly or intentionally upon himself and his estate.\n The condition clearly was such as New York might without restraint from the Federal Constitution annex to the privilege of making a will under its law. Its effect was to continue as obligations of his estate social responsibilities which he had assumed during life,4 unless they had been waived with required formality. The State could have conditioned any further exercise of testamen- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 556, 564]\n\u00a0\n tary power upon giving a right of election to the surviving spouse regardless of any waiver, however formally executed; and having recognized the binding effect of a waiver, it could condition that recognition upon acknowledgment, which was no doubt considered a desirable safeguard against casual, informal, or ill-considered abandonment of statutory protection, as well as against overreaching or fraud.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 18, subd. 1 of the Decedent Estate Law, enacted by N.Y.Laws of 1929, c. 228,  4, provided: 'Where a testator dies after August thirty- first, nineteen hundred and thirty, and leaves a will thereafter executed and leaves surviving a husband or wife, a personal right of election is given to the surviving spouse to take his or her share of the estate as in intestacy, subject to the limitations, conditions and exceptions contained in this section.'\n Section 18, subd. 1(f) provided: 'Where the aggregate of the provisions under the will for the benefit of the surviving spouse including the principal of a trust, or a legacy or devise, or any other form of testamentary provision, is less than the intestate share, the surviving spouse shall have the limited right to elect to take the difference between such aggregate and the amount of the intestate share, and the terms of the will shall otherwise remain effective.' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 18, subd. 9 read as follows: 'The husband or wife during the lifetime of the other may waive the right of election to take against a particular last will and testament by an instrument subscribed and duly acknowledged, or may waive such right of election to take against any last will and testament of the other whatsoever in an agreement of settlement so executed, made before or after marriage.'\n In the following year the words 'of settlement' were deleted from this provision, and the following sentence was added: 'An agreement so executed made before the taking effect of this section wherein a spouse has waived or released all rights in the estate of the other spouse shall be deemed to release the right of election granted in this section.'

Laws of 1930, c. 174,  1. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Decedent Estate Law,  2. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Court of Appeals has said of this legislation: 'After September 1, 1930, the absence of protection to the widow under prior laws gave way to the widow's right of election to take a specific part of the estate against the will. The inconsistency in our old law which compelled a man to support his wife during his lifetime, and permitted him to cut her off with a dollar at his death, has given way to a new public policy which no longer permits a testator to dispose of his property as he pleases.'

CITY OF NEW YORK(1942)\nNo. 589\nArgued: March 6, 1942Decided: March 30, 1942\n\n\n\n Messrs. Dominick Blasi, of Brooklyn, N.Y., and Silas B. Axtell, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Alfred T. White, of New York City, (Messrs. William C. Chanler, Corp. Counsel, Paxton Blair, and Leon Shaw, all of New York City, on the brief), for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The right of jury trial in civil cases at common law is a basic and fundamental feature of our system of federal jurisprudence which is protected by the Seventh Amendment. A right so fundamental and sacred to the citizen, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 752, 753]\n\u00a0\n whether guaranteed by the Constitution or provided by statute, should be jealously guarded by the courts. The present case is a suit by petitioner under the Jones Act1 for personal injuries sustained when he fell because the wrench he was using to tighten a nut slipped under the torque applied to it. We are called upon to determine whether on the evidence adduced by petitioner, and in contravention of accepted juridical standards, petitioner was wrongfully deprived of his statutory right to jury trial by the action of the trial court in dismissing his complaint,2 thereby refusing to submit the case to a jury which had been duly empanelled to try it. In holding that petitioner had failed to prove facts sufficient to warrant submitting the issue of respondent's negligence to the jury, the trial court relied on the so-called simple tool doctrine. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 2 Cir., 119 F.2d 800. The novel questions thus presented in the administration of the Jones Act prompted us to grant certiorari. \n314 \nU.S. 595\n, 62 S.Ct. 117, 86 L.Ed. --.\n Petitioner's testimony3 is the complete answer to the question whether the case should have been taken from \n\n[315 \nU.S. 752, 754]\n\u00a0\n the jury. The gist of that testimony is as follows: For three weeks prior to the accident petitioner, an employee with twenty years' experience, had been serving as water-tender in charge of the fire-room on the 'Dongan Hills', a ferry-boat operated by respondent between Staten and Manhattan Islands in New York harbor. One of his duties was to change oil strainers. This was done about three times a week and required the removal and replacement of a manifold head, housing the strainers, which was held in place by six studs and nuts. When the manifold was replaced, the nuts had to be very tight. The best tool to remove and to tighten the nuts was a straight end wrench fitting a 1 1\/4' nut. Petitioner used an S-shaped end wrench of the proper size which was 'well worn', 'had seen a lot of service', was 'a loose fit', and 'had a lot of play on it'. There was about one-sixteenth of an inch 'play in the jaws; it was worn.' The wrench was about eighteen inches long and the 'play' at the end was 'about an inch'. Petitioner asked the chief engineer for a new wrench three times, the first request being when petitioner first had occasion to use the worn wrench to change an oil strainer, and the last two or three days before the accident. In answer to this last request the chief engineer 'said for me (petitioner) to look in the tool closet and see if there was one in there; and I went up there and couldn't find any and I believe he said he sent an order out for one.' The regular way of requisitioning needed tools was by a report to the chief engineer. All petitioner was supposed to do was order; he did not know what respondent kept in its storeroom. The 'Dongan Hills' docked at Manhattan Island on the average of six or seven times each day. On the day of the accident petitioner did not renew his request, but he did look in the chief engineer's tool set. He found no end wrench of the proper size, did not know if a Stillson wrench was there, but believed \n\n[315 \nU.S. 752, 755]\n\u00a0\n that a monkey wrench was. A monkey wrench could 'probably' be used on any nut. At the time of the accident petitioner was using the worn, S-shaped, end wrench to tighten the nuts after changing the oil strainer. There was about five-eighths of an inch of thread on the studs, and petitioner had changed the wrench on one nut four times. As he started the fifth tightening, the wrench slipped, causing him to fall from the eighteen inch square platform on which he was standing to the catwalk eighteen inches below. In the course of the fall petitioner sustained an injury to his right side which struck an angle iron alongside the catwalk.\n The Jones Act, in addition to giving injured seamen the right to trial by jury in actions arising under the Act, also incorporates 'all statutes of the United States modifying or extending the common law right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees'. Among such statutes is 45 U.S.C.  51, 45 U.S.C.A.  51, which provides in part that a carrier is liable for 'injury or death ... by reason of any defect or insufficiency, due to its (the carrier's) negligence, in its cars, engines, appliances, machinery, track, roadbed, works, boats, wharves or other equipment'.\n Although proof of negligence is an essential to recovery under the Jones Act, Kunschman v. United States, 2 Cir., 54 F.2d 987; cf. Beadle v. Spencer, \n298 \nU.S. 124, 128\n, 56 S.Ct. 712, 713, contributory negligence and assumption of risk are not available defenses. The admiralty doctrine of comparative negligence applies. Secony-Vacuum Oil Co. v. Smith, \n305 \nU.S. 424\n, 59 S.Ct. 262. The salient points of petitioner's testimony, summarized above, made a sufficient showing to allow the jury to consider the issue of respondent's negligence. The wrench petitioner was using had become defective for the purpose for which it was designed. After discovering that defect petitioner made three requests to the proper person, the chief engineer, for a new wrench. The \n\n[315 \nU.S. 752, 756]\n\u00a0\n first of those requests was about three weeks prior to the accident, the last but two or three days before it occurred. At that time the chief engineer said he sent out an order for one, but it was not forthcoming in the two or three days intervening before the accident despite the fact that the 'Dongan Hills' docked at Manhattan Island six or seven times a day. While the best tool for doing the work was a straight end wrench of the proper size, petitioner had access to a monkey wrench which 'probably' could be used on any nut. We think these facts entitled petitioner to have the jury consider whether his injury was caused by any 'defect or insufficiency, due to its (respondent's) negligence, in its ... appliances'. That is to say, it was for the jury to decide whether a monkey wrench was a reasonably safe and suitable tool for petitioner's work, whether respondent's failure, although it had at least two days' and possibly three weeks' notice of the defect, to supply petitioner with a new wrench amounted to negligence on its part, and whether respondent, after it had knowledge of the defect, might not have reasonably foreseen the possibility of resulting harm if it allowed the worn wrench to remain in use. Cf. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. v. Smith, supra. Without doubt the case is close and a jury might find either way. But that is no reason for a court to usurp the function of the jury. We are satisfied that a due respect for the statutory guaranty of the right of jury trial, with its resulting benefits, requires the submission of this case to the jury.\n The simple tool doctrine, used by the courts below to bolster their belief that the evidence was insufficient, does not affect our conclusion. In the first place, the contrariety of opinion as to the reasons for and the scope of the simple tool doctrine, and the uncertainty of its application,4 suggest that it should not apply to cases arising under \n\n[315 \nU.S. 752, 757]\n\u00a0\n legislation, such as the Jones Act, designed to enlarge in some measure the rights and remedies of injured employees. \n5\n But even assuming its applicability, the doctrine does not justify withdrawing this case from the jury. For the only possible basis for the doctrine which is compatible with the provisions and policy of the Jones Act is that the master is not negligent in the case of defective simple tools because the possibility of injury from such tools is so slight as to impose no duty on him to see that they are free from defects in the first instance or to inspect them thereafter. \n6\n Newbern v. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., 4 Cir., 68 F.2d 523; cf. Hedicke v. Highland Springs Co., 185 Minn. 79, 239 N.W. 896-or to put it another way, the master is relieved of the duty to inspect simple tools for defects because the servant's opportunity for ascertaining such defects is equal to or greater than the master's. O'Hara v. Brown Hoisting Mach. Co., 3 Cir., 171 F. 394; Miller v. Erie R.R. Co., 21 App.Div. 45, 47 N.Y.S. 285; 2 Agency A.L.I.  503(d). Petitioner inspected the wrench, found it defective and then asked three times for a new one. This satisfied the burden of inspection placed on his shoulders by the doctrine, and it was then for the jury to say whether respondent's failure to comply with those repeated requests was negligence on \n\n[315 \nU.S. 752, 758]\n\u00a0\n its part. To deny petitioner the right to have the jury pass on that issue because of the simple tool doctrine is to say that doctrine relieves the master of any duty to furnish reasonably safe and suitable simple tools in spite of the fact that he knows they are defective, and requires the servant not only to inspect simple tools for defects, but also to supply his own simple tools when he finds those of the master defective. This is so obvious a perversion of the Jones Act as to require no comment. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Since there must be a new trial we deem it appropriate to state that in our opinion no reversible error was committed when the trial court refused to allow opinion testimony as to the best type of tool for the work. \n8\n Respondent's duty was not to supply the best tools, but only tools which were reasonably safe and suitable. Cf. The Tawmie, 5 Cir., 80 F.2d 792; The Cricket, 9 Cir., 71 F.2d 61.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. So ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER and Mr. Justice JACKSON concur in the result.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice ROBERTS, and Mr. Justice REED are of opinion that the judgment below should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 41 Stat. 988, 1007, 46 U.S.C.  688, 46 U.S.C.A.  688. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The complaint set forth two causes of action-the first for personal injuries and the second for maintenance and cure. Respondent moved to dismiss only the first cause of action. At the same time, in settlement of the second cause of action, respondent offered to consent to judgment for loss of wages from the time of the accident until petitioner returned to work. This offer was refused by petitioner's counsel and the second cause was thereupon dismissed. The Circuit Court of Appeals, sua sponte, directed that judgment be entered on the second cause of action for petitioner in the amount admitted to be due from respondent. That judgment is not in issue here. Only the first cause of action, that for personal injuries, survives for our consideration. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Petitioner was the sole witness in his own behalf. The trial court did not allow an opinion witness, called for the purpose of establishing the best type of wrench for the work petitioner was doing at the time of the accident, to testify. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See 3 Labatt, Master and Servant (2d ed.), pp. 2476-2484. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Compare McCarthy v. Palmer, 2 Cir., 113 F.2d 721, with Spain v. Powell, 4 Cir., 90 F.2d 580. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] If the doctrine is but a phase of assumption of risk or contributory negligence, as has been suggested (see Labatt, op. cit., pp. 2479, 2480, 2484), it is manifestly not applicable to actions under the Jones Act for those common-law affirmative defenses are not available in such actions. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. v. Smith, \n305 \nU.S. 424\n, 59 S.Ct. 262.\n And, if the scope of the doctrine is that a master is under no duty to furnish reasonably safe an suitable simple tools (see Allen Gravel Co. v. Yarbrough, 133 Miss. 652, 98 So. 117; Middleton v. National Box Co., D. C., 38 F.2d 89), the doctrine is hardly compatible with the scheme of the Jones Act fixing liability on a master for injuries caused by defects and insufficiencies in his appliances due to his negligence. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] See note 6, ante. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] See note 3, ante. \n\n\n\n\n","65":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJONES v.

Covington, of Brooklyn, N.Y., for appellant Jobin.\n No appearance for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By writ of certiorari in Nos. 280 and 314 and by appeal in No. 966 we have before us the question of the constitu- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 586]\n\u00a0\n tionality of various city ordinances imposing the license taxes upon the sale of printed matter for nonpayment of which the appellant, Jobin, and the petitioners, Jones, Bowden and Sanders, all members of the organization known as Jehovah's Witnesses, were convicted. \n No. 280.\n\n The City of Opelika, Alabama, filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Lee County charging petitioner Jones with violation of its licensing ordinance by selling books without a license, by operating as a Book Agent without a license, and by operating as a transient agent, dealer or distributor of books without a license. \n1\n The license fee for Book Agents ( Bibles excepted) was $10 per annum, that for transient agents, dealers or distributors of books $5. 2 \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 587]\n\u00a0\n Under section 1 of the ordinance all licenses were subject to revocation in the discretion of the City Commission, with or without notice. \n3\n There is a clause providing for severance in case of invalidity of any section, condition or provision. \n4\n Petitioner demurred, alleging that the ordinance because of unlimited discretion in revocation and requirement of a license was an unconstitutional encroachment upon freedom of the press. During the trial without a jury these contentions, with the added claim of interference with freedom of religion, were renewed at the end of the city's case, and at the close of all the evidence. The court overruled these motions, and found petitioner guilty on evidence that without a license he had been displaying pamphlets in his upraised hand and walking on a city street selling them two for five cents. \n5\n The court excluded as irrelevant testimony designed to show that the petitioner was an ordained minister, and that his activities \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 588]\n\u00a0\n were in furtherance of his beliefs and the teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses. Once again by an unsuccessful motion for new trial the constitutional issues were raised. The Court of Appeals of Alabama reversed the conviction on appeal because it thought the unlimited discretion of the City Commission to revoke the licenses invalidated the ordinance. Without discussion of this point the Supreme Court of Alabama decided that non-discriminatory licensing of the sale of books or tracts was constitutional, reversed the Court of Appeals, and stayed execution pending certiorari. 241 Ala. 279, 3 So.2d 76. This Court, having granted certiorari, \n314 \nU.S. 593\n, 62 S.Ct. 93, 86 L.Ed. --, dismissed the writ for lack of a final judgment. \n315 \nU.S. 782\n, 65 S.Ct. 630, 86 L.Ed. --. The Court of Appeals thereupon entered a judgment sustaining the conviction, which was affirmed by the Alabama Supreme Court and is final. 7 So.2d 503. We therefore grant the petition for rehearing of the dismissal of the writ and proceed with the consideration of the case.\n No. 314.\n Petitioners Bowden and Sanders were arrested by police officers of Fort Smith, Arkansas, brought before the Municipal Court on charges of violation of City Ordinance No. 1172, and convicted. They appealed to the Sebastian Circuit Court, and there moved to dismiss on the ground that the ordinance was an unconstitutional restriction of freedom of religion and of the press, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. The circuit judge heard the case de novo without a jury on stipulated facts. The ordinance required a license 'For each person peddling dry goods, notions, wearing apparel, household goods or other articles not herein or otherwise specifically mentioned $25 per month, $10 per week, $2.50 per day.' \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 589]\n\u00a0\n The petitioners, in the exercise of their beliefs concerning their duty to preach the gospel, admitted going from house to house without a license, playing phonographic transcriptions of Bible lectures, and distributing books setting forth their views to the residents in return for a contribution of twenty-five cents per book. When persons desiring books were unable to contribute, the books were in some instances given away free. The Circuit judge concluded as a matter of law that the books were 'other goods' and that petitioners were guilty of the peddling without a license. A motion for new trial was denied. On appeal the Supreme Court of Arkansas held the ordinance constitutional on the authority of its previous decision in Cook v. Harrison, 180 Ark. 546, 21 S.W.2d 966, and affirmed the convictions. 202 Ark. 614, 151 S.W.2d 1000. This Court denied certiorari, \n314 \nU.S. 651\n, 62 S.Ct. 99, 86 L.Ed. --, but later, because of the similarity of the issues presented to those in the Jobin case, No. 966, vacated the denial of certiorari and issued a writ. \n315 \nU.S. 793\n, 62 S.Ct. 903, 86 L.Ed. --.\n No. 966.\n The City of Casa Grande, Arizona, by ordinance made it a misdemeanor for any person to carry on any occupation or business specified without first procuring a license. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 590]\n\u00a0\n Transient merchants, peddlers and street vendors were listed as subject to a quarterly license fee of $25.00, payable in advance. \n8\n In the Superior Court of Pinal County Jobin was tried and convicted by a jury on a complaint charging that not having 'a permanent place of business in the City' he there carried on the 'business of peddling, vending, selling, offering for sale and soliciting the sale of \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 591]\n\u00a0\n goods, wares and merchandise, to wit: pamphlets, books and publications without first having procured a license,' contrary to the ordinance. The evidence for the state showed that without a license the appellant called at two homes and a laundry and offered for sale and sold books and pamphlets of a religious nature. At one home, ccompanied by his wife, he was refused admission, but was allowed by the girl who came to the door to play a portable phonograph on the porch. The girl purchased one of his stock of books, 'Religion,' for a quarter, and received a pamphlet free. During the conversation he stated that he was an ordained minister preaching the gospel and quoted passages from the Bible. At the second home the lady of the house allowed him and his wife to enter and play the phonograph, but she refused to buy either books or pamphlets. When departing the appellant left some literature on the table although informed by the lady that it would not be read and had better be given to someone else. At the laundry the appellant introduced himself as one of the Jehovah's Witnesses and discussed with the proprietor their work and religion generally. The proprietor bought the book 'Religion' for a quarter but declined to buy others at the same price. He was given a pamphlet free. When arrested the appellant stated that he was 'selling religious books and preaching the gospel of the kingdom,' and that because of his religious beliefs he would not take out a license. A motion at the close of the evidence for a directed verdict of acquittal on the ground that the ordinance violated the Fourteenth Amendment was denied. The jury was instructed to acquit unless it found the defendant was selling books or pamphlets. It returned a verdict of guilty. On appeal the Supreme Court of Arizona held that the ordinance, an 'ordinary occupational license tax ordinance,' did not deny freedom of religion and of the press and affirmed the conviction. 118 P.2d 97, 98. An appeal to this Court \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 592]\n\u00a0\n was allowed under  237 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  344.\n The Opelika ordinance required book agents to pay $10.00 per annum, transient distributors of books (annual only) $5.00. The license fee in Casa Grande was $25 per quarter, that in Fort Smith ranged from $2.50 per day to $25 per month. All the fees were small, yet substantial. But the appellant and the petitioners, so far as the records disclose, advanced no claim and presented no proof in the courts below that these fees were invalid because so high as to make the cost of compliance a deterrent to the further distribution of their literature in those cities. Although petitioners in No. 314 contended that their enterprise was operated at a loss there was no suggestion that they could not obtain from the same sources which now supply the funds to meet whatever deficit there may be sums sufficient to defray license fees also. The amount of the fees was not considered in the opinions below except for a bare statement by the Alabama court that the exaction was 'reasonable', and neither the briefs nor the assignments of error in this Court have directed their attack specifically to that issue. Consequently there is not before us the question of the power to lay fees, objectionable in their effect because of their size, upon the constitutionally protected rights of free speech, press or the exercise of religion. If the size of the fees were to be considered, to reach a conclusion one would desire to know the estimated volume, the margin of profit, the solicitor's commission, the expense of policing and other pertinent facts of income and expense. In the circumstances we venture no opinion concerning the validity of license taxes if it were proved, or at least distinctly claimed, that the burden of the tax was a substantial clog upon activities of the sort here involved. \n9\n The \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 593]\n\u00a0\n sole constitutional question considered is whether a nondiscriminatory license fee, presumably appropriate in amount, may be imposed upon these activities.\n We turn to the constitutional problem squarely presented by these ordinances. There are ethical principles of greater value to mankind than the guarantees of the Constitution, personal liberties which are beyond the power of government to impair. These principles and liberties belong to the mental and spiritual realm where the judgments and decrees of mundane courts are ineffective to direct the course of man. The rights of which our Constitution speaks have a more earthy quality. They are not absolutes10 to be exercised independently of other cherished privileges, protected by the same organic instrument. Conflicts in the exercise of rights arise and the conflicting forces seek adjustments in the courts, as do these parties, claiming on the one side the freedom of religion, speech and the press, guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment,11 and on the other the right to employ the sovereign power explicitly reserved to the State by the Tenth Amendment to ensure orderly living without which constitutional guarantees of civil liberties would be a mockery. \n12\n Courts, no more than Constitutions, can intrude into the consciences of men or compel them to believe contrary to their faith or think contrary \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 594]\n\u00a0\n to their convictions, but courts are competent to adjudge the acts men do under color of a constitutional right, such as that of freedom of speech or of the press or the free exercise of religion and to determine whether the claimed right is limited by other recognized powers, equally precious to mankind. \n13\n So the mind and spirit of man remain forever free, while his actions rest subject to necessary accommodation to the competing needs of his fellows.\n If all expression of religion or opinion, however, were subject to the discretion of authority, our unfettered dynamic thoughts or moral impulses might be made only colorless and sterile ideas. To give them life and force, the Constitution protects their use. No difference of view as to the importance of the freedoms of press or religion exist. They are 'fundamental personal rights and liberties.' Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147, 161\n, 60 S.Ct. 146, 150. To proscribe the dissemination of doctrines or arguments which do not transgress military or moral limits is to destroy the principal bases of democracy,-knowledge and discussion. One man, with views contrary to the rest of his compatriots, is entitled to the privilege of expressing his ideas by speech of broadside to anyone willing to listen or to read. Too many settled beliefs have in time been rejected to justify this generation in refusing a hearing to its own dissentients. But that hearing may be limited by action of the proper legislative body to times, places and methods for the enlightenment of the community which, in view of existing social and economic conditions, are not at odds with the preservation of peace and good order.\n This means that the proponents of ideas cannot determine entirely for themselves the time and place and manner for the diffusion of knowledge or for their evangelism, any more than the civil authorites may hamper or suppress the public dissemination of facts and prin- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 595]\n\u00a0\n ciples by the people. \n14\n The ordinary requirements of civilized life compel this adjustment of interests. The task of reconcilement is made harder by the tendency to accept as dominant any contention supported by a claim of interference with the practice of religion or the spread of ideas. Believing as this nation has from the first that the freedoms of worship and expression are closely akin to the illimitable privileges of thought itself, any legislation affecting those freedoms is scrutinized to see that the interferences allowed are only those appropriate to the maintenance of a civilized society. The determination of what limitations may be permitted under such an abstract test rests with the legislative bodies, the courts, the executive and the people themselves guided by the experience of the past, the needs of revenue for law enforcement, the requirements and capacities of police protection, the dangers of disorder and other pertinent factors.\n Upon the courts falls the duty of determining the validity of such enactments as may be challenged as unconstitutional by litigants. \n15\n In dealing with these delicate adjustments this Court denies any place to administrative censorship of ideas or capricious approval of distributors. In Lovell v. Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 444\n, 58 S.Ct. 666, the requirements of permission from the city manager invalidated the ordinance, 303 U.S. pages 447 and 451, 58 S.Ct. 667, 668; in Schneider v. State, that of a police officer, 308 U.S. pages 157 and 163, 60 S.Ct. 149, 151. In the Cantwell case, the secretary of the public welfare council was to determine whether the object of charitable solicitation was worthy, 310 U.S. page 302, 60 S.Ct. 902, 128 A.L.R. 1352. We held the requirement bad. \n16\n Ordinances abso- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 596]\n\u00a0\n lutely prohibiting the exercise of the right to disseminate information are, a fortiori, invalid. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n The differences between censorship and complete prohibition, either of subject matter or the individuals participating, upon the one hand, and regulation of the conduct of individuals in the time, manner and place of their activities upon the other, are decisive. 'One who is a martyr to a principle ... does not prove by his martyrdom that he has kept within the law,' said Mr. Justice Cardozo concurring in Hamilton v. Regents, \n293 \nU.S. 245, 268\n, 55 S.Ct. 197, 206, which held that conscientious objection to military training would not excuse a student, during his enrollment, from attending required courses in that science. \n18\n There is to be noted, too, a distinction between nondiscriminatory regulation of operations which are incidental to the exercise of religion or the freedom of speech or the press and those which are imposed upon the religious rite itself or the unmixed dissemination of information. Casual reflection verifies the suggestion that both teachers and preachers need to receive support for themselves as well as alms and benefactions for charity and the spread of knowledge. But when, as in these cases, the practitioners of these noble callings choose to utilize the vending of their religious books and tracts as a source of funds, the financial aspects of their transactions need not be wholly disregarded. To subject any religious or didactic group to a reasonable fee for their money-making activities does not require a finding that the licensed acts are purely commercial. It is enough that money is earned by the sale \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 597]\n\u00a0\n of articles. A book agent cannot escape a license requirement by a plea that it is a tax on knowledge. It would hardly be contended that the publication of newspapers is not subject to the usual governmental fiscal exactions, Giragi v. Moore, \n301 \nU.S. 670\n, 57 S.Ct. 946; Id., 48 Ariz. 33, 58 P.2d 1249; Id., 49 Ariz. 74, 64 P.2d 819, 110 A.L.R. 320, or the obligations placed by statutes on other business. Associated Press v. Labor Board, \n301 \nU.S. 103, 130\n, 57 S.Ct. 650, 654. The Constitution draws no line between a payment from gross receipts or a net income tax and a suitably calculated occupational license. Commercial advertising cannot escape control by the simple expedient of printing matter of public interest on the same sheet or handbill. Valentine v. Chrestensen, \n316 \nU.S. 52\n, 62 S.Ct. 920, 86 L.Ed. --. Nor does the fact that to the participants a formation in the streets is an 'information march,' and 'one of their ways of worship,' suffice to exempt such a procession from a city ordinance which, narrowly construed, required a license for such a parade. \n 19\n\u00a0\n\n When proponents of religious or social theories use the ordinary cmmercial methods of sales of articles to raise propaganda funds, it is a natural and proper exercise of the power of the state to charge reasonable fees for the privilege of canvassing. Careful as we may and should be to protect the freedoms safeguarded by the Bill of Rights, it is difficult to see in such enactments a shadow of prohibition of the exercise of religion or of abridgement of the freedom of speech or the press. It is prohibition and unjustifiable abridgement which is interdicted, not taxation. Nor do we believe it can be fairly said that because such proper charges may be expanded into unjustifiable abridgements they are therefore invalid on their face. The freedoms claimed by those seeking relief here are guaranteed against abridgement by the Fourteenth Amendment. Its commands protect their rights. The legislative power of municipalities must yield when \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 598]\n\u00a0\n abridgement is shown. Compare Grosjean v. American Press Co., \n297 \nU.S. 233\n, 56 S.Ct. 444, with Giragi v. Moore, \n301 \nU.S. 670\n, 57 S.Ct. 946. If we were to assume, as is here argued, that the licensed activities involve religious rites, a different question would be presented. These are not taxes on free will offerings. But it is because we view these sales as partaking more of commercial than religious or educational transactions that we find the ordinances, as here presented, valid. A tax on religion or a tax on interstate commerce may alike be forbidden by the Constitution. It does not follow that licenses for selling Bibles or for manufacture of articles of general use, measured by extrastate sales, must fall. It may well be that the wisdom of American communities will persuade them to permit the poor and weak to draw support from the petty sales of religious books without contributing anything for the privilege of using the streets and conveniences of the municipality. Such an exemption, however, would be a voluntary, not a constitutionally enforced, contribution.\n In the ordinances of Casa Grande and Fort Smith, we have no discretionary power in the public authorities to refuse a license to any one desirous of selling religious literature. No censorship of the material which enters into the books or papers is authorized. No religious symbolism is involved such as was urged against the flag salute in Minersville District v. Gobitis, \n310 \nU.S. 586\n, 60 S.Ct. 1010, 127 A.L.R. 1493. For us there is no occasion to apply here the principles taught by that opinion. Nothing more is asked from one group than from another which uses similar methods of propagation. We see nothing in the collection of a nondiscriminatory license fee, uncontested in amount, from those selling books or papers, which abridges the freedoms of worship, speech or press. Cf. Grosjean v. American Press Co., \n297 \nU.S. 233, 250\n, 56 S.Ct. 444. As to the claim that even small license charges, if valid, will impose upon the itinerant colporteur a crushing ag- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 599]\n\u00a0\n gregate, it is plain that if each single fee is, as we assume, commensurate with the activities licensed, then though the accumulation of fees from city to city may in time bulk large, he will have enjoyed a correlatively enlarged field of distribution. Cf. Coverdale v. Arkansas- Louisiana Pipe Line Co., \n303 \nU.S. 604, 612\n, 613 S., 58 S.Ct. 736. The First Amendment does not require a subsidy in the form of fiscal exemption. Giragi v. Moore, supra. Accordingly the challenge to the Fort Smith and Casa grande ordinances fails.\n There is an additional contention by petitioner as to the Opelika ordinance. It is urged that since the licenses were revocable, arbitrarily, by the local authorities, note 3, supra, there can be no true freedom for petitioners in the dissemination of information because of the censorship upon their actions after the issuance of the license. But there has been neither application for nor revocation of a license. The complaint was bottomed on sales without a license. It was that charge against which petitioner claimed the protection of the Constitution. This issue he had standing to raise. Smith v. Cahoon, \n283 \nU.S. 553, 562\n, 51 S.Ct. 582, 585. From what has been said previously it follows that the objection to the unconstitutionality of requiring a license fails. There is no occasion, at this time, to pass on the validity of the revocation section, as it does not affect his present defense. Highland Farms Dairy v. Agnew, \n300 \nU.S. 608, 616\n, 57 S.Ct. 549, 553; Lehon v. City of Atlanta, \n242 \nU.S. 53, 56\n, 37 S.Ct. 70, 72.\n In Lovell v. Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 444\n, 58 S.Ct. 666, we held invalid a statute which placed the grant of a license within the discretion of the licensing authority. By this discretion, the right to obtain a license was made an empty right. Therefore the formality of going through an application was naturally not deemed a prerequisite to insistence on a constitutional right. Here we have a very different situation. A license is required that may properly be required. The fact that such a license, if it were granted, may subse- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 600]\n\u00a0\n quently be revoked does not necessarily destroy the licensing ordinance. The hazard of such revocation is much too contingent for us now to declare the licensing provisions to be invalid. Lovell v. Griffin has, in effect, held that discretionary control in the general area of free speech is unconstitutional. Therefore, the hazard that the license properly granted would be improperly revoked is far too slight to justify declaring the valid part of the ordinance, which is alone now at issue, also unconstitutional.\n The judgments in Nos. 280, 314 and 966 are affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE.\n The First Amendment, which the Fourteenth makes applicable to the states, declares: 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press'. I think that the ordinance in each of these cases is on its face a prohibited invasion of the freedoms thus guaranteed, and that the judgment in each should be reversed.\n The ordinance in the Opelika case should be held invalid on two independent grounds. One is that the annual tax in addition to the 50 cent 'issuance fee' which the ordinance imposes is an unconstitutional restriction on those freedoms, for reasons which will presently appear. The other is that the requirement of a license for dissemination of ideas, when as here the license is revocable at will without cause and in the unrestrained discretion of administrative officers, is likewise an unconstitutional restraint on those freedoms.\n The sole condition which the Opelika ordinance prescribes for grant of the license is payment of the designated annual tax and issuance fee. The privilege thus purchased, for the period of a year, is forth-with revocable in the unrestrained and unreviewable discretion of the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 601]\n\u00a0\n licensing commission without cause and without notice or opportunity for a hearing. The case presents in its baldest form the question whether the freedoms which the Constitution purports to safeguard can be completely subjected to uncontrolled administrative action. Only recently this Court was unanimous in holding void on its face the requirement of a license for the distribution of pamphlets which was to be issued in the sole discretion of a municipal officer. Lovell v. Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 444, 451\n, 58 S.Ct. 666, 669. The precise ground of our decision was that the ordinance made enjoyment of the freedom which the Constitution guarantees contingent upon the uncontrolled will of administrative officers. We declared:\n'We think that the ordinance is invalid on its face. Whatever the motive which induced its adoption, its character is such that it strikes at the very foundation of the freedom of the press by subjecting it to license and censorship. The struggle for the freedom of the press was primarily directed against the power of the licensor. It was against that power that John Milton directed his assault by his 'Appeal for the Liberty of Unlicensed Printing.' And the liberty of the press became initially a right to publish 'without a license what formerly could be published only with one.' While this freedom from previous restraint upon publication cannot be regarded as exhausting the guaranty of liberty, the prevention of that restraint was a leading purpose in the adoption of the constitutional provision.'\n\n That purpose cannot rightly be defeated by so transparent a subterfuge as the pronouncement that, while a license may not be required if its award is contingent upon the whim of an administrative officer, it may be if its retention and the enjoyment of the privilege which it purports to give is wholly contingent upon his whim. In either case enjoyment of the freedom is dependent upon the same contingency and the censorship is as effective in \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 602]\n\u00a0\n one as in the other. Nor is any palliative afforded by the assertion that the defendant's failure to apply for a license deprives him of standing to challenge the ordinance because of its revocation provision, by the terms of which retention of the license and exercise of the privilege may be cut off at any time without cause.\n Indeed, the present ordinance is a more callous disregard of the constitutional right than that exhibited in Lovell v. Griffin, supra. There at least the defendant might have been given a license if he had applied for it. In any event he would not have been compelled to pay a money exaction for a license to exercise the privilege of free speech-a license which if granted in this case would have been wholly illusory. Here the defendant Jones was prohibited from distributing his pamphlets at all unless he paid in advance a year's tax for the exercise of the privilege and subjected himself to termination of the license without cause, notice or hearing, at the will of city officials. To say that he who is free to withhold at will the privilege of publication exercises a power of censorship prohibited by the Constitution, but that he who has unrestricted power to withdraw the privilege does not, would be to ignore history and deny the teachings of experience, as well as to perpetuate the evils at which the First Amendment was aimed.\n It is of no significance that the defendant did not apply for a license. As this Court has often pointed out, when a licensing statute is on its face a lawful exercise of regulatory power, it will not be assumed that it will be unlawfully administered in advance of an actual denial of application for the license. But here it is the prohibition of publication, save at the uncontrolled will of public officials, which transgresses constitutional limitations and makes the ordinance void on its face. The Constitution can hardly be thought to deny to one subjected to the restraints of such an ordinance the right to attack its constitutionality, because he has not yielded to its demands. Lovell v. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 603]\n\u00a0\n Griffin, supra, \n303 \nU.S. 452, 453\n, 58 S.Ct. 669; Smith v. Cahoon, \n283 \nU.S. 553, 562\n, 51 S.Ct. 582, 585. The question of standing to raise the issue in this case is indistinguishable from that in the Lovell case, where it was resolved in the only manner consistent with the First Amendment.\n The separability provision of the Opelika ordinance1 cannot serve, in advance of judicial decision by the state court, to separate those parts which are constitutionally applicable from those which are not. We have no means of knowing that the city would grant any license if the license could not be made revocable at will. The state court applied the ordinance as written. It did not rely or pass upon the effect to be given to the separability clause, or determine whether any effect was to be given to it. Until it has done so this Court-as we decided only last Monday-must determine the constitutional validity of the ordinance as it stands and as it stood when obedience to it was demanded and punishment for its violation inflicted. No. 782, Skinner v. Oklahoma, \n316 \nU.S. 535\n, 62 S.Ct. 1110, 86 L.Ed. --, decided June 1, 1942; Smith v. Cahoon, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 563, 564\n, 51 S.Ct. 586\n\n\n In all three cases the question presented by the record and fully argued here and below is whether the ordinances-which as applied penalize the defendants for not having paid the flat fee taxes levied-violate the freedom of speech, press, and religion guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Defendants' challenge to the ordinances, naming them, is a challenge to the substantial taxes which they impose, in specified amounts, and not to some tax of a different or lesser amount which some other ordinance might levy. In their briefs here they argue, as upon the records they are entitled to do, that the taxes are an unconstitutional burden on the right of \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 604]\n\u00a0\n free speech and free religion comparable to license taxes which this Court has often held to be an inadmissible burden on interstate commerce. They argue also that the cumulative effect of such taxes, in town after twon throughout the country, would be destructive of freedom of the press for all persons except those financially able to distribute their literature without soliciting funds for the support of their cause.\n While these are questions which have been studiously left unanswered by the opinion of the Court, it seems inescapable that an answer must be given before the convictions can be sustained. Decision of them cannot rightly be avoided now by asserting that the amount of the tax has not been put in issue; that the tax is 'uncontested in amount' by the defendants, and can therefore be assumed by us to be 'presumably appropriate', 'reasonable', or 'suitably calculated'; that it has not been proved that the burden of the tax is a substantial clog on the activities of the defendants, or that those who have defrayed the expense of their religious activities will not willingly defray the license taxes also. All these are considerations which would seem to be irrelevant to the question now before us-whether a flat tax, more than a nominal fee to defray the expenses of a regulatory license, can constitutionally be laid on a non- commercial, non-profit activity devoted exclusively to the dissemination of ideas, educational and religious in character, to those persons who consent to receive them.\n Nor is the essential issue here disguished by the reiterated characterization of these exactions, not as taxes but as 'fees'-a characterization to which the records lend no support. All these ordinances on their face purport to be an exercise of the municipality's taxing power. In none is there the slightest pretense by the taxing authority, or the slightest suggestion by the state court, that the 'fee' is to defray expenses of the licensing system. The \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 605]\n\u00a0\n amounts of the 'fees', without more, demonstrate that such a contention is groundless. In No. 280, Opelika itself contends that the issue relates solely to its power to raise money for general revenue purposes, and the Supreme Court of Alabama referred to the levy as a 'reasonable' 'tax.' The tax exacted by Opelika, on the face of the ordinance, is in addition to a 50 cent 'issuance fee', which alone is presumably what the city deems adequate to defray the cost of administering the licensing system. Similarly in the Fort Smith and Casa Grande cases, the state courts sustained the ordinances as a tax, and nothing else. If this litigation has involved any controversy-and the state courts all seemed to think that it did-the controversy has been one solely relating to the power to tax, and not the power to collect a 'fee' to support a licensing system which, as has already been indicated, has no regulatory purpose other than that involved in the raising of revenue.\n This Court has often had occasion to point out that where the state may, as a regulatory measure, license activities which it is without constitutional authority to tax, it may charge a small or nominal fee sufficient to defray the expense of licensing, and similarly it may charge a reasonable fee for the use of its highways by interstate motor traffic which it cannot tax. Compare Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., \n306 \nU.S. 583\n, 598- 600, 59 S.Ct. 744, 753, with Ingels v. Morf, \n300 \nU.S. 290\n, 57 S.Ct. 439, and cases cited; see Cox v. New Hampshire, \n312 \nU.S. 569, 576\n, 577 S., 61 S.Ct. 762, 765, 766, 133 A.L.R. 1396. But we are not concerned in these cases with a nominal fee for a regulatory license, which may be assumed for argument's sake to be valid. Here the licenses are not regulatory, save as the licenses conditioned upon payment of the tax may serve to restrain or suppress publication. None of the ordinances, if complied with, purports to or could control the time, place or manner of the distribution of the books and pamphlets concerned. None has any discernible relationship to the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 606]\n\u00a0\n police protection or the good order of the community. The only condition and purpose of the licenses under all three ordinances is suppression of the specified distributions of literature in default of the payment of a substantial tax fixed in amount and measured neither by the extent of the defendants' activities under the license nor the amounts which they receive for and devote to religious purposes in the exercise of the licensed privilege. Opelika exacts a license fee for book agents of $10 per annum and of $5 per annum for transient distributors of books, in addition to a 50 cent 'issuance fee' on each license. The Supreme Court of Alabama found it unnecessary to determine whether both or only one of these taxes was payable by defendant Jones. The Fort Smith tax of $25 a month or $10 a week or $2.50 a day is substantial in amount for transient distributors of literature of the character here involved; the Opelika exaction is even more onerous when applied against one who may be in the city for only a day or two; and the tax of $25 per quarter exacted by the Casa Grande ordinance, adopted in a community having an adult population of less than 1,000 and applied to distributions of literature like the present, is prohibitive in effect.\n In considering the effect of such a tax on the defendants' activities it is important to note that the state courts have applied levies obviously devised for the taxation of business employments-in the first case the 'business or vocation' of 'book agent'; in the second the business of peddling specified types of merchandise or 'other articles'; in the third, the practice of the callings of 'peddlers, transient merchants and venders'-to activities which concededly are not ordinary business or commercial transactions. As appears by stipulation or undisputed testimony, the defendants are Jehovah's Witnesses, engaged in spreading their religious doctrines in conformity to the teachings of St. Matthew, Matt. 10:11-14 and \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 607]\n\u00a0\n 24:14, by going from city to city, from village to village, and house to house, to proclaim them. After asking and receiving permission from the householder, they play to him phonograph records and tender to him books or pamphlets advocating their religious views. For the latter they ask payment of a nominal amount, two to five cents for the pamphlets and twenty-five cents for books, as a contribution to the religious cause which they seek to advance. But they distribute the pamphlets, and sometimes the books, gratis when the householder is unwilling or unable to pay for them. The literature is published for such distribution by non- profit charitable corporations organized by Jehovah's Witnesses. The funds collected are used for the support of the religious movement and no one derives a profit from the publication and distribution of the literature. In the Opelika case the defendant's activities were confined to distribution of literature and solicitation of funds in the public streets.\n No one could doubt that taxation which may be freely laid upon activities not within the protection of the Bill of Rights could-when applied to the dissemination of ideas-be made the ready instrument for destruction of that right. Few would deny that a license tax laid specifically on the privilege of disseminating ideas would infringe the right of free speech. For one reason among others, if the state may tax the privilege it may fix the rate of tax and, through the tax, control or suppress the activity which it taxes. Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, \n292 \nU.S. 40, 45\n, 54 S.Ct. 599, 601; Grosjean v. American Press Co., \n297 \nU.S. 233, 244\n, 245 S., 56 S.Ct. 444, 446, 447. If the distribution of the literature had been carried on by the defendants without solicitation of funds, there plainly would have been no basis, either statutory or constitutional, for levying the tax. It is the collection of funds which has been seized upon to justify the extension, to the defendants' activities, of the tax laid upon business callings. But if we assume, despite our recent \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 608]\n\u00a0\n decision in Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147, 163\n, 60 S.Ct. 146, 151, that the essential character of these activities is in some measure altered by the collection of funds for the support of a religious undertaking, still it seems plain that the operation of the present flat tax is such as to abridge the privileges which the defendants here invoke.\n It lends no support to the present tax to insist that its restraint on free speech and religion is non-discriminatory because the same levy is made upon business callings carried on for profit, many of which involve no question of freedom of speech and religion and all of which involve commercial elements-lacking here-which for present purposes may be assumed to afford a basis for taxation apart from the exercise of freedom of speech and religion. The constitutional protection of the Bill of Rights is not to be evaded by classifying with business callings an activity whose sole purpose is the dissemination of ideas, and taxing it as business callings are taxed. The immunity which press and religion enjoy may sometimes be lost when they are united with other activities not immune. Valentine v. Chrestensen, \n316 \nU.S. 52\n, 62 S.Ct. 920, 86 L.Ed. --. But here the only activities involved are the dissemination of ideas, educational and religious, and the collection of funds for the propagation of those ideas, which we have said is likewise the subject of constitutional protection. Schneider v. State, supra; Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296\n, 304-307, 60 S.Ct. 900, 903, 904, 128 A.L.R. 1352.\n The First Amendment is not confined to safeguarding freedom of speech and freedom of religion against discriminatory attempts to wipe them out. On the contrary the Constitution, by virtue of the First and the Fourteenth Amendments, has put those freedoms in a preferred position. Their commands are not restricted to cases where the protected privilege is sought out for attack. They extend at least to every form of taxation which, because it is a condition of the exercise of the privilege, is capable of being used to control or suppress it. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 609]\n\u00a0\n Even were we to assume-what I do not concede-that there could be a lawful non-discriminatory license tax of a percentage of the gross receipts collected by churches and other religious orders in support of their religious work, cf. Giragi v. Moore, \n301 \nU.S. 670\n, 57 S.Ct. 946, we have no such tax here. The tax imposed by the ordinances in these cases is more burdensome and destructive of the activity taxed than any gross receipts tax. The tax is for a fixed amount, unrelated to the extent of the defendants' activities or the receipts derived from them. It is thus the type of flat tax which, when applied to interstate commerce, has repeatedly been deemed by this Court to be prohibited by the commerce clause. See McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Coal Mining Co., \n309 \nU.S. 33\n, 55- 57, 60 S.Ct. 388, 397, 398, 128 A.L.R. 876, and cases cited; cf. Best & Co. v. Maxwell, \n311 \nU.S. 454, 456\n, 61 S.Ct. 334, 335. When applied as it is here to activities involving the exercise of religious freedom, its vice is emphasized in that it is levied and paid in advance of the activities taxed, and applied at rates well calculated to suppress those activities save only as others may volunteer to pay the tax. It requires a sizable out-of-pocket expense by someone who may never succeed in raising a penny in his exercise of the privilege which is taxed.\n The defendants' activities, if taxable at all, are taxable only because of the funds which they solicit. But that solicitation is for funds for religious purposes, and the present taxes are in no way gauged to the receipts. The taxes are insupportable either as a tax on the dissemination of ideas or as a tax on the collection of funds for religious purposes. For on its face a flat license tax restrains in advance the freedom taxed and tends inevitably to suppress its exercise. The First Amendment prohibits all laws abridging freedom of press and religion, not merely some laws or all except tax laws. It is true that the constitutional guaranties of freedom of press and religion, like the commerce clause, make no distinction between fixed-sum \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 610]\n\u00a0\n taxes and other kinds. But that fact affords no excuse to courts, whose duty it is to enforce those guaranties, to close their eyes to the characteristics of a tax which render it destructive of freedom of press and religion.\n We may lay to one side the Court's suggestion that a tax otherwise unconstitutional is to be deemed valid unless it is shown that there are none who, for religion's sake, will come forward to pay the unlawful exaction. The defendants to whom the ordinances have been applied have not paid it and there is nothing in the Constitution to compel them to seek the charity of others to pay it before protesting the tax. It seems fairly obvious that if the present taxes, laid in small communities upon peripatetic religious propagandists, are to be sustained, a way has been found for the effective suppression of speech and press and religion despite constitutional guaranties. The very taxes now before us are better adapted to that end than were the stamp taxes which so successfully curtailed the dissemination of ideas by eighteenth century newspapers and pamphleteers, and which were a moving cause of the American Revolution. See Collett, History of the Taxes on Knowledge, vol. 1, c. 1; May, Constitutional History of England, 7th ed., vol. 2, p. 245; Hanson, Government and the Press, 1695-1763, pp. 7-14; Morison, The English Newspaper, 1622-1932, pp. 83-88; Grosjean v. American Press Co., supra, \n297 \nU.S. 245\n-249, 56 S.Ct. 447, 448. Vivid recollections of the effect of those taxes on the freedom of press survived to inspire the adoption of the First Amendment.\n Freedom of press and religion, explicitly guaranteed by the Constitution, must at least be entitled to the same freedom from burdensome taxation which it has been thought that the more general phraseology of the commerce clause has extended to interstate commerce. Whatever doubts may be entertained as to this Court's function to relieve, unaided by Congressional legislation, from burdensome taxation under the commerce clause, see Gwin, \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 611]\n\u00a0\n White & Prince, Inc., v. Henneford, \n305 \nU.S. 434, 441\n, 446 S.-455, 59 S.Ct. 325, 328, 331-335; McCarroll v. Dixie Lines, \n309 \nU.S. 176, 184\n, 185 S., 60 S.Ct. 504, 508, it cannot be thought that that function is wanting under the explicit guaranties of freedom of speech, press and religion. In any case the flat license tax can hardly become any the less burdensome or more permissible, when levied on activities within the protection extended by the First and Fourteenth Amendments both to the orderly communication of ideas, educational and religious, to persons willing to receive them, see Cant-well v. Connecticut, supra, and to the practice of religion and the solicitation of funds in its support. Schneider v. State, supra.\n In its potency as a prior restraint on publication the flat license tax falls short only of outright censorship or suppression. The more humble and needy the cause, the more effective is the suppression.\n Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MURPHY join in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY, with whom the CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice BLACK, and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS concur, dissenting.\n When a statute is challenged as impinging on freedom of speech, freedom of the press, or freedom of worship, those historic privileges which are so essential to our political welfare and spiritual progress, it is the duty of this Court to subject such legislation to examination, in the light of the evidence adduced, to determine whether it is so drawn as not to impair the substance of those cherished freedoms in reaching its objective. Ordinances that may operate to restrict the circulation or dissemination of ideas on religious or other subjects should be framed with fastidious care and precise language to avoid undue encroachment on these fundamental liberties. And the protection of the Constitution must be extended to all, not \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 612]\n\u00a0\n only to those whose views accord with prevailing thought but also to dissident minorities who energetically spread their beliefs. Being satisfied by the evidence that the ordinances in the cases now before us, as construed and applied in the state courts, impose a burden on the circulation and discussion of opinion and information in matters of religion, and therefore violate the petitioners'1 rights to freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of worship in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment, I am obliged to dissent from the opinion of the Court.\n It is not disputed that petitioners, Jehovah's Witnesses, were ordained ministers preaching the gospel, as they understood it, through the streets and from house to house, orally and by playing religious records with the consent of the householder, and by distributing books and pamphlets setting forth the tenets of their faith. It does not appear that their motives were commercial, but only that they were evangelizing their faith as they saw it.\n In No. 280 the trial court excluded as irrelevant petitioner's testimony that he was an ordained minister and that his activities on the streets of Opelika were in furtherance of his ministerial duties. The testimony of ten clergymen of Opelika that they distributed free religious literature in their churches, the cost of which was defrayed by voluntary contribution, and that they had never been forced to pay any license fee, was also excluded. It is admitted here that petitioner was a Jehovah's Witness and considered himself an ordained minister.\n The Supreme Court of Arizona (118 P.2d 98) stated in No. 966 that appellant was 'a regularly ordained minister of the denomination commonly known as Jehovah's Witnesses ... going from house to house in the city of Casa Grande preaching the gospel, as he understood it, by means of his \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 613]\n\u00a0\n spoken word, by playing various religious records on a phonograph, with the approval of the householder, and by distributing printed books, pamphlets and tracts which set forth his views as to the meaning of the Bible. The method of distribution of these printed books, pamphlets and tracts was as follows: He first offered them for sale at various prices ranging from five to twenty-five cents each. If the householder did not desire to purchase any of them he then left a small leaflet summarizing some of the doctrines which he preached.'\n The facts were stipulated in No. 314 (151 S.W.2d 1001). Each petitioner 'claims to be an ordained minister of the gospel .... 'They do not engage in this work for any selfish reason, but because they feel called to publish the news and preach the gospel of the Kingdom to all the world as a witness before the end comes. ... They believe that the only effective way to preach is to go from house to house and make personal contact with the people and distribute to them books and pamphlets setting forth their views on Christianity\". Petitioners 'were going from house to house in the residential section within the City of Fort Smith ... presenting to the residents of these houses various booklets, leaflets and periodicals setting forth their views of Christianity held by Jehovah's Witnesses.' They solicited a 'contribution of twenty-five cents for each book,' but 'these books in some instances are distributed free when the people wishing them are unable to contribute.'\n There is no suggestion in any of these three cases that petitioners were perpetrating a fraud, that they were demeaning themselves in an obnoxious manner, that their activities created any public disturbance or inconvenience, that private rights were contravened, or that the literature distributed was offensive to morals or created any 'clear and present danger' to organized society.\n The ordinance in each case is sought to be sustained as a system of non-discriminatory taxation of various busi- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 614]\n\u00a0\n nesses, professions, and vocations, including the distribution of books for which contributions are asked, for the sole purpose of raising revenue. 2 Any inclination to take the position that petitioners, who were proselytizing by distributing informative literature setting forth their religious tenets, and whose activities were wholly unrelated to any commercial purposes, were not within the purview of these occupational tax ordinances,3 is foreclosed by the decisions of the state courts below to the contrary. As so construed the ordinances in effect impose direct taxes on the dissemination of ideas and the distribution of literature, relating to and dealing with religious matters, for which a contribution is asked in an attempt to gain converts, because those were petitioners' activities. Such taxes have been held to violate the Fourteenth Amendment, McConkey v. City of Fredericksburg, 179 Va. 556, 19 S.E.2d 682; State v. Greaves, 112 Vt. 222, 22 A.2d 497; City of Blue Island v. Kozul, 379 Ill. 511, 41 N.E. 2d 515; and that should be the holding here. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Freedom of Speech and Freedom of the Press.\n In view of the recent decisions of this Court striking down acts which impair freedom of speech and freedom \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 615]\n\u00a0\n of the press no elaboration on that subject is now necessary. We have 'unequivocally held that the streets are proper places for the exercise of the freedom of communicating information and disseminating opinion and that, though the states and municipalities may appropriately regulate the privilege in the public interest, they may not unduly burden or proscribe its employment in these public thoroughfares.' Valentine v. Chrestensen, \n316 \nU.S. 52\n, 62 S.Ct. 920, 86 L.Ed. --, decided April 13, 1942. And as the distribution of pamphlets to spread information and opinion on the streets and from house to house for non-commercial purposes is protected from the prior restraint of censorship, Lovell v. Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 444\n, 58 S.Ct. 666; Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147\n, 60 S.Ct. 146, so should it be protected from the burden of taxation.\n The opinion of the Court holds that the amount of the tax is not before us and that a 'nondiscriminatory license fee, presumably appropriate in amount, may be imposed upon these activities'. Both of these holdings must be rejected.\n Where regulation or infringement of the liberty of discussion and the dissemination of information and opinion are involved, there are special reasons for testing the challenged statute on tis face. Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88\n, 96-98, 60 S.Ct. 736, 741, 742, and see Lovell v. Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 444, 452\n, 58 S.Ct. 666, 669; Milk Wagon Drivers Union v. Meadowmoor Co., \n312 \nU.S. 287, 297\n, 61 S.Ct. 552, 556, 132 A.L.R. 1200. That should be done here. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Consideration of the taxes leads to but one conclusion-that they prohibit or seriously hinder the distribution of petitioners' religious literature. The opinion of the Court admits that all the taxes are 'substantial'. The $25 quar- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 616]\n\u00a0\n terly tax of Casa Grande approaches prohibition. The 1940 population of that town was 1,545. With so few potential purchasers it would take a gifted evangelist, indeed, in view of the antagonism generally encountered by Jehovah's Witnesses, to sell enough tracts at prices ranging from five to twenty-five cents to gross enough to pay the tax. Cf. McConkey v. City of Fredericksburg, 179 Va. 556, 19 S.E.2d 682. While the amount is actually lower in Opelika6 and may be lower in Fort Smith in that it is possible to get a license for a short period,7 and while the circle of purchasers is wider in those towns,8 these exactions also place a heavy hand on petitioners' activities. The petitioners should not be subjected to such tribute.\n But whatever the amount, the taxes are in reality taxes upon the dissemination of religious ideas, a dissemination carried on by the distribution of religious literature for religious reasons alone and not for personal profit. As such they place a burden on freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the exercise of religion even if the question of amount is laid aside. Liberty of circulation is the very life blood of a free press, cf. Lovell v. Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 444, 452\n, 58 S.Ct. 666, 669, and taxes on the circulation of ideas have a long history of misuse against freedom of thought. \n9\n See Grosjean v. American Press Co., \n297 \nU.S. 233\n, 245-249, 56 S.Ct. 444, 447, 448. And taxes on circulation solely for the purpose of revenue were success- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 617]\n\u00a0\n fully resisted, prior to the adoption of the First Amendment, as interferences with freedom of the press. \n10\n Surely all this was familiar knowledge to the framers of the Bill of Rights. We need not shut our eyes to the possibility that use may again be made of such taxes, either by discrimination in enforcement or otherwise, to suppress the unpalatable views of militant minorities such as Jehovah's Witnesses. See McConkey v. City of Fredericksburg, 179 Va. 556, 19 S.E.2d 682. As the evidence excluded in No. 280 tended to show, no attempt was there made to apply the ordinance to ministers functioning in a more orthodox manner than petitioner.\n Other objectionable features in addition to the factor of historical misuse exist. There is the unfairness present in any system of flat fee taxation, bearing no relation to the ability to pay. And there is the cumulative burden of many such taxes throughout the municipalities of the land, as the number of recent cases involving such ordinances abundantly demonstrates. \n11\n The activities of Jehovah's \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 618]\n\u00a0\n Witnesses are widespread, and the aggregate effect of numerous exactions, no matter how small, can conceivably force them to choose between refraining from attempting to recoup part of the cost of their literature, or else paying out large sums in taxes. Either choice hinders and may even possibly put an end to their activities. There is no basis, other than a refusal to consider the characteristics of taxes such as these, for any assumption that such taxes are 'commensurate with the activities licensed'. Nor is there any assurance that 'a correlatively enlarged field of distribution' will insure sufficient proceeds even to meet such exactions, let alone leaving any residue for the continuation of petitioners' evangelization.\n Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion all have a double aspect-freedom of thought and freedom of action. Freedom to think is absolute of its own nature; the most tyrannical government is powerless to control the inward workings of the mind. But even an aggressive mind is of no missionary value unless there is freedom of action, freedom to communicate its message to others by speech and writing. Since in any form of action there is a possibility of collision with the rights of others, there can be no doubt that this freedom to act is not absolute but qualified, being subject to regulation in the public interest which does not unduly infringe the right. However, there is no assertion here that the ordinances were regulatory, but if there were such a claim, they still should not be sustained. No abuses justifying regulation are advanced and the ordinances are not narrowly and precisely drawn to deal with actual, or even hypothetical evils, while at the same time preserving the substance of the right. Cf. Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.S. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 619]\n\u00a0\n 88, 105, 60 S.Ct. 736, 745; Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296, 311\n, 60 S.Ct. 900, 128 A.L.R. 1352. They impose a tax on the dissemination of information and opinion anywhere within the city limits, whether on the streets or from house to house. 'As we have said, the streets are natural and proper places for the dissemination of information and opinion; and one is not to have the exercise of his liberty of expression in appropriate places abridged on the plea that it may be exercised elsewhere.' Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147, 163\n, 60 S. Ct. 146, 151. These taxes abridge that liberty.\n It matters not that petitioners asked contributions for their literature. Freedom of speech and freedom of the press cannot and must not mean freedom only for those who can distribute their broadsides without charge. There may be others with messages more vital but purses less full, who must seek some reimbursement for their outlay or else forego passing on their ideas. The pamphlet, an historic weapon against oppression,12 Lovell v. Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 444, 452\n, 58 S.Ct. 666, 669, is today the convenient vehicle of those with limited resources because newspaper space and radio time are expensive and the cost of establishing such enterprises great. If freedom of speech and freedom of the press are to have any concrete meaning, people seeking to distribute information and opinion, to the end only that others shall have the benefit thereof, should not be taxed for circulating such matter. It is unnecessary to consider now the validity of such taxes on commercial enterprises engaged in the dissemination of ideas. Cf. Valentine v. Chrestensen, \n316 \nU.S. 52\n, 62 S.Ct. 920, 86 L.Ed. --, decided April 13, 1942; Giragi v. Moore, \n301 \nU.S. 670\n, 57 S.Ct. 946. Petitioners were not engaged in a traffic for profit. While the courts below held their activities were covered by the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 620]\n\u00a0\n ordinances, it is clear that they were seeking only to further their religious convictions by preaching the gospel to others.\n The exercise, without commercial motives, of freedom of speech, freedom of the press, or freedom of worship are not proper sources of taxation for general revenue purposes. In dealing with a permissible regulation of these freedoms and the fee charged in connection therewith, we emphasized the fact that the fee was 'not a revenue tax, but one to meet the expense incident to the administration of the act and to the maintenance of public order', and stated only that, 'There is nothing contrary to the Constitution in the charge of a fee limited to the purpose stated.' Cox v. New Hampshire, \n312 \nU.S. 569, 577\n, 61 S.Ct. 762, 766, 133 A.L.R. 1396. The taxes here involved are ostensibly for revenue purposes; they are not regulatory fees. Respondents do not show that the instant activities of Jehovah's Witnesses create special problems causing a drain on the municipal coffers, or that these taxes are commensurate with any expenses entailed by the presence of the Witnesses. In the absence of such a showing I think no tax whatever can be levied on petitioners' activities in distributing their literature or disseminating their ideas. If the guaranties of freedom of speech and freedom of the press are to be preserved, municipalities should not be free to raise general revenue by taxes on the circulation of information and opinion in non-commercial causes; other sources can be found, the taxation of which will not choke off ideas. Taxes such as the instant ones violate petitioners' right to freedom of speech and freedom of the press, protected against state invasion by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Freedom of Religion.\n Under the foregoing discussion of freedom of speech and freedom of the press any person would be exempt from taxation upon the act of distributing information or \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 621]\n\u00a0\n opinion of any kind, whether political, scientific, or religious in character, when done solely in an effort to spread knowledge and ideas, with no thought of commercial gain. But there is another, and perhaps more precious reason why these ordinances cannot constitutionally apply to petitioners. Important as free speech and a free press are to a free government and a free citizenry, there is a right even more dear to many individuals-the right to worship their Maker according to their needs and the dictates of their souls and to carry their message or their gospel to every living creature. These ordinances infringe that right, which is also protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296\n, 60 S.Ct. 900, 128 A.L.R. 1352.\n Petitioners were itinerant ministers going through the streets and from house to house in different communities, preaching the gospel by distributing booklets and pamphlets setting forth their views of the Bible and the tenets of their faith. While perhaps not so orthodox as the oral sermon, the use of religious books is an old, recognized and effective mode of worship and means of proselytizing. \n13\n For this petitioners were taxed. The mind rebels at the thought that a minister of any of the old established churches could be made to pay fees to the community before entering the pulpit. These taxes on petitioners' efforts to preach the 'news of the Kingdom' should be struck down because they burden petitioners' right to worship the Deity in their own fashion and to spread the gospel as they understand it. There is here no contention that their manner of worship gives rise to conduct which calls for regulation, and these ordinances are not aimed at any such practices.\n One need only read the decisions of this and other courts in the past few years to see the unpopularity of Jehovah's \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 622]\n\u00a0\n Witnesses and the difficulties put in their path because of their religious beliefs. An arresting parallel exists between the troubles of Jehovah's Witnesses and the struggles of various dissentient groups in the American colonies for religious liberty which culminated in the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom,14 the Northwest Ordinance of 1787,15 and the First Amendment. In most of the colonies there was an established church, and the way of the dissenter was hard. All sects, including Quaker, Methodist, Baptist, Episcopalian, Separatist, Rogerine, and Catholic suffered. \n16\n Many of the non-conforming ministers were itinerants, and measures were adopted to curb their unwanted activities. The books of certain denominations were banned. \n17\n Virginia and Connecticut had burdensome licensing requirements. \n18\n Cf. Lovell v. Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 444\n, 58 S.Ct. 666; Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147\n, 60 S.Ct. 146; Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296\n, 60 S.Ct. 900, 128 A.L.R. 1352. Other states required oaths before one could preach which many ministers could not conscientiously take. \n19\n Cf. Reid v. Borough of Brookville, Pa., D.C., 39 F.Supp. 30; \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 623]\n\u00a0\n Kennedy v. City of Moscow, D.C., 39 F.Supp. 26. Research reveals no attempt to control or persecute by the more subtle means of taxing the function of preaching, or even any attempt to tap it as a source of revenue. \n20\n\u00a0\n\n By applying these occupational taxes to petitioners' non-commercial activities, respondents now tax sincere efforts to spread religious beliefs, and a heavy burden falls upon a new set of itinerant zealots, the Witnesses. That burden should not be allowed to stand, especially if, as the excluded testimony in No. 280 indicates, the accepted clergymen of the town can take to their pulpits and distribute their literature without the impact of taxation. Liberty of conscience is too full of meaning for the individuals in this nation to permit taxation to prohibit or substantially impair the spread of religious ideas, even though they are controversial and run counter to the established notions of a community. If this Court is to err in evaluating claims that freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion have been invaded, far better that it err in being overprotective of these precious rights.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, Mr. Justice MURPHY.\n The opinion of the Court sanctions a device which in our opinion suppresses or tends to suppress the free exercise of a religion practiced by a minority group. This is but another step in the direction which Minersville School District v. Gobitis, \n310 \nU.S. 586\n, 60 S.Ct. 1010, 127 A.L.R. 1493, took against the same religious minority and is a logical extension of the principles upon which that decision rested. Since we joined in the opinion in the Gobitis case, we think this is an ap- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 584, 624]\n\u00a0\n propriate occasion to state that we now believe that it was also wrongly decided. Certainly our democratic form of government functioning under the historic Bill of Rights has a high responsibility to accommodate itself to the religious views of minorities however unpopular and unorthodox those views may be. The First Amendment does not put the right freely to exercise religion in a subordinate position. We fear, however, that the opinions in these and in the Gobitis case do exactly that. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] '4. Penalties.

Administrator, \n312 \nU.S. 126, 657\n, 61 S.Ct. 524, the constitutionality of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 1060, 29 U.S.C.  201 et seq., 29 U.S.C.A .  201 et seq., was sustained. In the cases now before us we are required to consider the scope of the Act in relation to a particular phase of industrial activity. Specifically, the problem is this: Under  6 of the Act an employer must pay prescribed minimum wages 'to each of his employees who is engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce', and under  7 overtime compensation must be given 'any of his employees who is engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce'. Section 3(j) provides that 'for the purposes of this Act ( chapter) an employee shall be deemed to have been engaged in the production of goods if such employee was employed ... in any process or occupation necessary to the production thereof, in any State.' The employees here are engaged in the operation and maintenance of a loft building in which large quantities of goods for interstate commerce are produced. Does the Fair Labor Standards Act extend to such employees?\n The facts in the two cases differ only in minor detail. In No. 910, the petitioner owns and operates a six-story loft building in Philadelphia. The tenants are, for the most part, manufacturers of men's and boys' clothing. In No 924, the petitioners own and operate a twenty-two story building located in the heart of the New York City clothing manufacturing district. Practically all of the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 517, 519]\n\u00a0\n tenants manufacture or buy and sell ladies' garments. Concededly, in both cases the tenants of the buildings are principally engaged in the production of goods for interstate commerce. In No. 910, the petitioner employs an engineer, three firemen, three elevator operators, two watchmen, a porter, a carpenter, and a carpenter's helper. In No. 924, the controversy involves two firemen, an electrician, fourteen elevator operators, two watchmen, and six porters. These employees perform the customary duties of persons charged with the effective maintenance of a loft building. The engineer and the firemen produce heat, hot water, and steam necessary to the manufacturing operations. They keep elevators, radiators, and fire sprinkler systems in repair. The electrician maintains the system which furnishes the tenants with light and power. The elevator operators run both the freight elevators which start and finish the interstate journeys of goods going from and coming to the tenants, and the passenger elevators which carry employees, customers, salesmen, and visitors. The watchmen protect the buildings from fire and theft. The carpenters repair the halls and stairways and other parts of the buildings commonly used by the tenants. The porters keep the buildings clean and habitable.\n Deeming these employees within the Act because of their relationship to the activities of the tenants, the Administrator brought suits to enjoin the petitioners from violating the Act by paying wages at lower rates than those fixed by the Act. In No. 910, the District Court granted an injunction, Fleming v. A. B. Kirschbaum Co., 38 F.Supp. 204, and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed. 124 F.2d 567. In No. 924, the District Court denied an injunction, Fleming v. Arsenal Building Corp., 38 F.Supp. 207, but the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed. 125 F.2d 278. Despite \n\n[316 \nU.S. 517, 520]\n\u00a0\n this concurrence of views of the two Circuit Courts of Appeals,1 we brought the cases here because of the important questions presented as to the scope of the Fair Labor Standards Act. A. B. Kirschbaum Co. v. Fleming, \n315 \nU.S. 792\n, 62 S.Ct. 800, 86 L.Ed. --; Arsenal Building Corp. v. Fleming, \n315 \nU.S. 792\n, 62 S.Ct. 801, 86 L.Ed. --.\n To search for a dependable touchstone by which to determine whether employees are 'engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce' is as rewarding as an attempt to square the circle. The judicial task in marking out the extent to which Congress has exercised its constitutional power over commerce is not that of devising an abstract formula. Perhaps in no domain of public law are general propositions less helpful and indeed more mischievous than where boundaries must be drawn under a federal enactment between what it has taken over for administration by the central Government and what it has left to the States. To a considerable extent the task is one of accommodation as between assertions of new federal authority and historic functions of the individual states. The expansion of our industrial economy has inevitably been reflected in the extension of federal authority over economic enterprise and its absorption of authority previously possessed by the States. Federal legislation of this character cannot therefore be construed without regard to the implications of our dual system of government.\n The body of Congressional enactments regulating commerce reveals a process of legislation which is strikingly empiric. The degree of accommodation made by Congress from time to time in the relations between federal and state governments has varied with the subject mat- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 517, 521]\n\u00a0\n ter of the legislation, the history behind the particular field of regulation, the specific terms in which the new regulatory legislation has been cast, and the procedures established for its administration. See, e.g ., Virginian R. Co. v. System Federation, \n300 \nU.S. 515\n, 57 S.Ct. 592. Thus, while a phase of industrial enterprise may be subject to control under the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., a different phase of the same enterprise may not come within the 'commerce' protected by the Sherman Law, 15 U.S.C.A.  1-7, 15 note. Compare, for example, United Leather Workers' International Union v. Herkert & Meisel Trunk Co., \n265 \nU.S. 457\n, 44 S.Ct. 623, 33 A.L.R. 566, and Levering & G. Co. v. Morrin, \n289 \nU.S. 103\n, 53 S.Ct. 549, with National Labor Relations Board v. Friedman-Harry Marks Clothing Co., \n301 \nU.S. 58\n, 57 S.Ct. 645, 108 A.L.R. 1352, and National Labor Relations Board v. Fainblatt, \n306 \nU.S. 601\n, \n307 \nU.S. 609\n, 59 S.Ct. 668. Similarly, enterprises subject to federal industrial regulation may nevertheless be taxed by the States without putting an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. Compare Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., \n260 \nU.S. 245\n, 43 S.Ct. 83, and Oliver Iron Mining Co. v. Lord, \n262 \nU.S. 172\n, 43 S.Ct. 526, with Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, \n310 \nU.S. 381\n, 60 S.Ct. 907\n\n\n We cannot, therefore, indulge in the loose assumption that when Congress adopts a new scheme for federal industrial regulation, it thereby deals with all situations falling within the general mischief which gave rise to the legislation. Such an assumption might be valid where remedy of the mischief is the concern of only a single unitary government. It cannot be accepted where the practicalities of federalism-or, more precisely, the underlying assumptions of our dual form of government and the consequent presuppositions of legislative draftsmanship which are expressive of our history and habits-cut across what might otherwise be the implied range of the legislation. Congress may choose, as it has chosen frequently in the past, to regulate only part of what it constitutionally can regulate, leaving to the States activities which, if isolated, are only local. One need refer only to the history of Congressional control over the rates of intra-state carriers \n\n[316 \nU.S. 517, 522]\n\u00a0\n which affect interstate commerce,2 and the amendment of August 11, 1939, to the Federal Employers' Liability Act, extending the scope of that Act to employees who 'shall, in any way directly or closely and substantially, affect' interstate commerce, 53 Stat. 1404, 45 U.S.C.A.  51. Compare Federal Trade Commission v. Bunte Bros., \n312 \nU.S. 349\n, 61 S.Ct. 580. The history of Congressional legislation regulating not only interstate commerce as such but also activities intertwined with it, justifies the generalization that, when the federal government takes over such local radiations in the vast network of our national economic enterprise and thereby radically readjusts the balance of state and national authority, those charged with the duty of legislating are reasonably explicit and do not entrust its attainment to that retrospective expansion of meaning which properly deserves the stigma of judicial legislation.\n The Administrator does not contend that the employees in the cases before us are within the Act because Congress could have placed them there. The history of the legislation leaves no doubt that Congress chose not to enter areas which it might have occupied. As passed by the House, the bill applied to employers 'engaged in commerce in any industry affecting commerce'. See H.Rep. No. 2182, 75th Cong., 3rd Sess., p. 2; 83 Cong.Rec. 7749-50. But the bill recommended by the conference applied only to employees 'engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce'. H.Rep. No. 2738, 75th Cong., 3rd Sess., pp. 29-30; 83 Cong.Rec. 9158, 9266- 67. Moreover, in one of \n\n[316 \nU.S. 517, 523]\n\u00a0\n its intermediate stages, the measure incorporated the Shreveport doctrine, Houston, E. & W. Texas R. Co. v. United States, supra, in that it was specifically made applicable to intrastate production which competed with goods produced in another state. S. 2475, 75th Cong. 3rd Sess., as recommitted December 17, 1937,  8(a). But, as reported by the House Committee on Labor, this provision was deleted. S. 2475, supra, as reported April 21, 1938; see H.Rep. 2182, supra.\n Since the scope of the Act is not coextensive with the limits of the power of Congress over commerce, the question remains whether these employees fall within the statutory definition of employees 'engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce', construed as the provision must be in the context of the history of federal absorption of governmental authority over industrial enterprise. In this task of construction, we are without the aid afforded by a preliminary administrative process for determining whether the particular situation is within the regulated area. Unlike the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A .  1 et seq., and the National Labor Relations Act and other legislation, the Fair Labor Standards Act puts upon the courts the independent responsibility of applying ad hoc the general terms of the statute to an infinite variety of complicated industrial situations. Our problem is, of course, one of drawing lines. But it is not at all a problem in mensuration. There are no fixed points, though lines are to be drawn. The real question is how the lines are to be drawn-what are the relevant considerations in placing the line here rather than there. To that end we have tried to state with candor the larger considerations of national policy, legislative history, and administrative practicalities that underlie the variations in the terms of Congressional commercial regulatory measures and which therefore should govern their judicial construction. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 517, 524]\n\u00a0\n We start with the weighty opinions of the two Circuit Courts of Appeals that the employees here are within the Act because they were engaged in occupations 'necessary to the production' of goods for commerce by the tenants. Without light and heat and power the tenants could not engage, as they do, in the production of goods for interstate commerce. The maintenance of a safe, habitable building is indispensable to that activity. The normal and spontaneous meaning of the language by which Congress defined in  3(j) the class of persons within the benefits of the Act, to wit, employees engaged 'in producing, manufacturing, mining, handling, transporting, or in any other manner working on such goods, or in any process or occupation necessary to the production thereof', encompasses these employees, in view of their relation to the conceded production of goods for commerce by the tenants. The petitioners assert, however, that the building industry of which they are part is purely local in nature and that the Act does not apply where the employer is not himself engaged in an industry partaking of interstate commerce. But the provisions of the Act expressly make its application dependent upon the character of the employees' activities. And, in any event, to the extent that his employees are 'engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce', the employer is himself so engaged. \n3\n Nor can we find in the Act, as do the petitioners, any requirement that employees must themselves prticipate in the physical process of the making of the goods before they can be regarded as engaged in their production. Such a construction erases the final clause of  3(j) which includes employees engaged 'in any process or occu- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 517, 525]\n\u00a0\n pation necessary to the production' and thereby does not limit the scope of the statute to the preceding clause which deals with employees 'in any other manner working on such goods'.\n But the petitioners urge that  3(j) cannot be construed literally, that Congress surely did not design the Act to apply to every employee who happens to perform services that are essential to the production of goods for commerce. But because some employees may not be within the Act even though their activities are in an ultimate sense 'necessary' to the production of goods for commerce, it does not follow that no employees whose activities are 'necessary' are entitled to the benefits of the Act. Section 3(j) cannot thus be read out of the Act. The lower court in No. 924 met the petitioners' argument by finding the Act applicable to these employees because their work was 'in kind substantially the same as it would be if the manufacturers employed them directly'. In the immediate situation, the answer may be adequate; but as a guiding criterion it may prove too much. 'Necessary' is colored by the context not only of the terms of this legislation but of its implications in the relation between state and national authority. We cannot, in construing the word 'necessary', escape an inquiry into the relationship of the particular employees to the production of goods for commerce. If the work of the employees has only the most tenuous relation to, and is not in any fitting sense 'necessary' to, the production, it is immaterial that their activities would be substantially the same if the employees worked directly for the producers of goods for commerce.\n We agree, however, with the conclusion of the courts below. In our judgment, the work of the employees in these cases had such a close and immediate tie with the process of production for commerce, and was there- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 517, 526]\n\u00a0\n fore so much an essential part of it, that the employees are to be regarded as engaged in an occupation 'necessary to the production of goods for commerce'. What was said about a related problem is not inapposite here: 'Whatever terminology is used, the criterion is necessarily one of degree and must be so defined. This does not satisfy those who seek for mathematical or rigid formulas. But such formulas are not provided by the great concepts of the Constitution such as 'interstate commerce,' 'due process,' 'equal protection'. In maintaining the balance of the constitutional grants and limitations, it is inevitable that we should define their applications in the gradual process of inclusion and exclusion. There is thus no point in the instant case in a demand for the drawing of a mathematical line. And what is reasonably clear in a particular application is not to be overborne by the simple and familiar dialectic of suggesting doubtful and extreme cases.' Santa Cruz Fruit Packing Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n303 \nU.S. 453, 467\n, 58 S.Ct. 656, 660. 'What is needed is something of that common-sense accommodation of judgment to kaleidoscopic situations which characterizes the law in its treatment of problems of causation.' Gully v. First Nat. Bank, \n299 \nU.S. 109, 117\n, 57 S.Ct. 96, 100.\n A final objection to the decisions below need not detain us long. The petitioners' buildings cannot be regarded as 'service establishments' within the exemption of  13(a)(2). Selling space in a loft building is not the equivalent of selling services to consumers, and, in any event, the 'greater part' of the 'servicing' done by the petitioners here is not in intrastate commerce. The suggestion that the Act, if applied to these employees, goes beyond the bounds of the commerce power is without merit. Labor Board Cases (National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp.), \n301 \nU.S. 1\n, 57 S.Ct. 615, 108 A.L.R. 1352; United States v. Darby, supra; Opp Cotton Mills v. Administrator, supra.\n In both cases the judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 517, 527]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n I dissent. I think the power of Congress does not reach the purely local activities in question. If it did, the commerce power alone would support regulation of any local action, since it is conceivable that such activity, however remotely, 'affects' commerce or is 'necessary' to the production of goods for commerce.\n But I am convinced that Congress never intended by the statute to reach the employees of the petitioners. Neither the words of the Act, nor its legislative history, nor the purpose to be served, requires the application of the statute in these cases. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Compare Warren-Bradshaw Drilling Co. v.

U.S.(1942)\nNo. 322\nArgued: December 17, 1941Decided: January 19, 1942\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Washington.\n Mr. Albert E. Stephan, of Seattle, Wash., for appellant.\n Mr. Frank Coleman, of Washington, D.C., for appellees. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 57, 58]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a companion case to United States v. N. E. Rosenblum Truck Lines, Inc., and United States v. Margolies, \n315 \nU.S. 50\n, 62 S.Ct. 445, 86 L.Ed. --, this day decided. It is a direct appeal from the final decree of a specially constituted three-judge district court1 dismissing appellant's petition to set aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission denying appellant's application under the 'grandfather' clauses of Sections 206(a) and 209(a) of the Motor Carrier Act of 19352 for operating authority as a 'common' or 'contract' carrier by motor vehicle.\n The Commission's findings3 show that appellant's method of operations was substantially the same as that of appellees in the Rosenblum and the Margolies cases. Appellant operated between Los Angeles and Seattle and held permits from the States of California, Oregon, and Washington. Between June 1935 and January 1938 most, if not all, of the traffic Handled by appellant was solicited and billed by other motor carriers and moved in appellant's vehicles only between the terminals of those other carriers. From April 1937 until January 1938 appellant hauled exclusively for a single common carrier, Hendricks Refrigerated Truck Lines, Inc. The goods moved on Hendricks' bills of lading and its tariff rates were applied. Appellant requested loading instructions from, and re- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 57, 59]\n\u00a0\n ported loadings to, Hendricks. Appellant received the total revenue less ten percent on southbound loads and the total revenue on northbound loads. On 'express' traffic he received a flat rate of eighty cents per hundred pounds. Shippers' claims generally were paid in the first instance by Hendricks and then charged back to appellant.\n In January 1938 appellant engaged a solicitor of his own, established terminals and apparently discontinued the operations previously conducted in connection with other carriers.\n On the basis of its findings the Commission concluded that the service performed 'was not the fulfillment of engagements in consequence of a holding out to the general public, but primarily was the hauling of traffic for motor common carriers.' \n4\n\u00a0\n\n While the application in the instant case is for a common carrier certificate, or, in the alternative, for a contract carrier permit, rather than for a contract carrier permit as in United States v. N. E. Rosenblum Truck Lines, Inc. and United States v. Margolies, that difference is without legal significance. The question in both situations is whether the applicant was a carrier, either common or contract, within the meaning of the Act prior to June 1935 and continuously thereafter to the date of the hearing. For the reasons set forth in the Rosenblum and Margolies cases, this day decided, the decision below must be affirmed.\n We have considered and found without substance appellant's argument that findings as to whether Hendricks was acting as a broker during the period in question and as to whether appellant's name was carried on his equipment were 'quasi jurisdictional' and that the absence of findings on those points renders the order void. Neither finding was here essential to the existence of authority \n\n[315 \nU.S. 57, 60]\n\u00a0\n to enter the order and hence was not 'quasi jurisdictional'. Cf. United States v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., \n293 \nU.S. 454, 462\n, 463 S., 55 S.Ct. 268, 271, 272; State of Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194, 214\n, 215 S., 51 S.Ct. 119, 124, 125. One of the findings of the Commission, which appellant may not attack5 was that appellant hauled 'for Hendricks, a common carrier by motor vehicle', and the Commission was satisfied from the evidence before it that Hendricks, and not the appellant, was the carrier in respect to the operations in which appellant was engaged. It was therefore immaterial whether Hendricks acted as a broker in connection with some other operations. Whether appellant's name was on his equipment can only be a factor bearing on the ultimate issue. It is in no sense 'quasi jurisdictional.'\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Convened pursuant to the Urgent Deficiencies Act of 1913, 38 Stat. 220, 28 U.S.C. secs. 47 and 47a, 28 U.S.C.A.  47, 47a, and Section 205(h) of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, rearranged by the Transportation Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 899, as Section 205(g) of Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  305(g). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Motor Carrier Act of 1935 is now designated as Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act. 54 Stat. 919, 49 U.S.C.A.  301 et seq. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Since the evidence upon which these findings were made is not included in the record before us, appellant may not here attack them.

Felsenberg, of Baltimore, Md., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n During the years 1936 and 1937 respondents purchased various parcels of real estate in Baltimore, Maryland. In each instance the state and city taxes on the real estate for the current year had not been paid at the time of \n\n[316 \nU.S. 394, 395]\n\u00a0\n purchase. The various contracts provided for the apportionment of these current real estate taxes, respondents agreeing to pay the amount of the taxes, and the vendors undertaking to bear the burden of that portion of the taxes arithmetically allocable to the fraction of the year that had expired prior to the date of purchase. Adjustments were accordingly made in the purchase prices to reflect this arrangement.\n Respondents paid the local authorities the full amounts necessary to discharge the tax liability. In their 1936 and 1937 income tax returns, which were on the cash basis, they deducted that portion of those taxes 'allocable' to the periods after purchase. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue ruled that the amounts in question were not deductible under Section 23(c) of the Revenue Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 1648, 1659, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  23(c),1 but instead were merely part of the cost of the properties. Accordingly, he made a deficiency assessment which was paid under protest. This suit for refund followed. The District Court held the amounts were deductible,2 the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed3 on the authority of its previous decision in Commissioner v. Rust's Estate, 4 Cir ., 116 F.2d 636. We granted certiorari because of an asserted conflict with Lifson v. Commissioner, 8 Cir., 98 F.2d 508.\n The question for decision is whether the amounts apportioned by respondents on the basis of the fractions of the taxable years remaining after the several purchases constitute 'taxes paid ... within the taxable year' within the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 394, 396]\n\u00a0\n meaning of Section 23(c) of the Revenue Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 1648, 1659, and hence are deductible.\n The guiding principle for determining whether a payment satisfying a tax liability is a 'tax paid' within the meaning of Section 23(c) is furnished by the applicable Treasury regulation, which states that 'In general taxes are deductible only by the person upon whom they are imposed'.4 See Colston v. Burnet, 61 App.D.C. 192, 59 F.2d 867; Small v. Commissioner, 27 B.T.A. 1219; Paul, Selected Studies in Federal Taxation, Second Series, p. 24. Resort must be had here to the laws of Maryland and of the City of Baltimore to determine upon whom the state and city real estate taxes were imposed. Walsh-McGuire Co. v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 97 F. 2d 983, 984; cf. Helvering v. Fuller, \n310 \nU.S. 69, 74\n, 75 S., 60 S.Ct. 784, 787; and see Paul, op. cit. supra, pp. 23, 24.\n To illustrate concretely the workings of the Maryland tax system with respect to respondents' purchases the property bought on May 10, 1936, may be taken as typical of all the other transactions. The assessment date, or 'date of finality', for both state and city taxes was October 1, 1935.5 These taxes were for the calendar year 19366 and \n\n[316 \nU.S. 394, 397]\n\u00a0\n became due and payable on January 1, 1936,7 although the default date for city taxes was not until July 1, 1936, and for state taxes January 1, 1937. 8 Both the state and the city had liens against the property from the due date, January 1, 1936.9 And, respondents' vendor became personally liable for these taxes before the sale. An action of assumpsit could have been brought against him for the taxes at any time after the due date. \n10\n Had he sold the property between October 1, 1935 and January 1, 1936, he apparently would still have remained personally liable, and if he had gone into bankruptcy after such sale the taxing authorities would have had a provable claim against him. In re Wells, D.C., 4 F.Supp. 329; cf. City of Baltimore v. Perrin, 178 Md. 101, 107, 12 A.2d 261.\n It is thus apparent that tax liens had attached against the properties and that respondents' predecessors in title had become personally liable for the taxes prior to any of the purchases. The attachment of a lien for taxes against property before its sale has been held to prohibit the ven- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 394, 398]\n\u00a0\n dee from deducting as 'taxes paid', amounts paid by him to discharge this liability. Lifson v. Commissioner, 8 Cir., 98 F.2d 508; Walsh-McGuire Co. v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 97 F.2d 983; Merchants Bank Building Co. v. Helvering, 8 Cir., 84 F.2d 478; Helvering v. Missouri State Life Insurance Co., 8 Cir., 78 F.2d 778, 781. A tax lien is an encumbrance upon the land, and payment, subsequent to purchase, to discharge a pre-existing lien is no more the payment of a tax in any proper sense of the word than is a payment to discharge any other encumbrance, for instance a mortgage. It is true that respondents here could not have retained the properties unless the taxes were paid, but it is also true that they could not retain them without paying the purchase price. It is no answer therefore to say that the property was burdened with the taxes and that respondents became obligated to pay them. There was a burden, but it was contractually assumed. In discharging this assumed obligation respondents were not paying taxes imposed upon them within the meaning of Section 23(c). For 'only the person owning the property at that time (i.e., when the tax lien attaches) is subjected to the burden which the law imposes; and only the person who has been thus subjected to the burden of the tax is entitled to a deduction for paying it. Payment by a subsequent purchaser is not the discharge of a burden which the law has placed upon him, but is actually as well as theoretically a payment of purchase price; for, after the lien attaches and the taxing authority becomes pro tanto an owner of an interest in the property, payment of the tax by a purchaser is nothing but a part of the payment for unencumbered title.' Judge Parker, dissenting in Commissioner v. Rust's Estate, 4 Cir., 116 F.2d 636, 641.\n Furthermore, respondents paid taxes for which their vendors were personally liable. This was clearly the payment of a tax imposed upon another and therefore not deductible by respondents. Cf. Walsh-McGuire Co. v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 97 F.2d 983; Gatens Investment Co. v. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 394, 399]\n\u00a0\n Commissioner, 36 B.T.A. 309; Kohlsaat v. Commissioner, 40 B.T.A. 528. And see Commissioner v. Coward, 3 Cir., 110 F.2d 725, 727.\n Thus either a pre-existing tax lien or personal liability for the taxes on the part of a vendor is sufficient to foreclose a subsequent purchaser, who pays the amount necessary to discharge the tax liability, from deducting such payment as a 'tax paid'. Where both lien and personal liability coincide, as here, there can be no other conclusion than that the taxes were imposed on the vendors. Respondents simply paid their vendors' taxes; they cannot deduct the amounts or any portion thereof, paid to discharge liabilities so firmly fixed against their predecessors in title by the laws of Maryland.\n The view of the court below that the parties' contractual arrangement for apportionment of the tax burden was controlling is untenable. \n11\n Parties cannot change the incidence of local taxes by their agreement. And it is misleading to speak of real estate taxes as 'applicable to the fractional part of a tax period following purchase. Such taxes are simply one form of raising revenue for the support of government. They are not like rent, nor are they paid for the privilege of occupying property for any given period of time.\n The judgment below is reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] ' 23.

WASHINGTON, BALTIMORE & ANNAPOLIS REALTY CORP.(1942)\nNo. 601\nArgued: Decided: April 13, 1942\n\n\n\n\n[316 \nU.S. 69, 70]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Francis Biddle, Atty. Gen., and Robert L. Stern, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Richard F. Cleveland and Ambler H. Moss, both of Baltimore, Md., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit for refund of capital stock taxes paid by respondent for the years ending June 30, 1936, through 1939. We are asked to determine whether respondent was 'carrying on or doing business' within the meaning of  105(a) of the Revenue Act of 1935, c. 829, 49 Stat. 1017, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, page 796, and subsequent acts, which provide:\n'For each year ending June 30, beginning with the year ending June 30, 1936, there is hereby imposed upon every domestic corporation with respect to carrying on or doing business for any part of such year an excise tax of $1.40 for each $1,000 of the adjusted declared value of its capital stock.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[316 \nU.S. 69, 71]\n\u00a0\n Respondent was organized in 1935 with broad corporate powers under the laws of Maryland by the protective committee for the bondholders of the defunct Washington, Baltimore & Annapolis Railway Company. It was formed for the purpose of liquidating certain properties formerly belonging to the Railway Company which the committee had acquired through foreclosure. Among the properties received by respondent from the committee were certain rights of way, easements, terminal properties, and other real estate located in Baltimore, Annapolis, and Washington, as well as at the other points along the line of the railroad, and the stock of a realty holding company which owned another realty company, both of which had been subsidiaries of the Railway Company for the purpose of holding legal title to real estate. The value of the properties received in 1935, as shown by respondent's balance sheet, was $419,250.\n\n Since its incorporation respondent has been carrying on negotiations for the sale of the properties acquired, selling them from time to time as satisfactory offers were received, and renting unsold properties under short term leases in an attempt to earn the carrying charges pending ultimate sale. Receipts from sales during the four year period here in question were approximately $675,000, and rentals amounted to $136,000. At the end of this period respondent's books still showed properties worth $ 122,000. All net income, except small reserves for contingencies, was distributed as received to the stockholders, former bondholders of the Railway Company.\n Respondent paid capital stock taxes for the four years in question and then brought this suit for refund of the payments in the District Court. The court held that because respondent was a liquidating corporation, it was \n\n[316 \nU.S. 69, 72]\n\u00a0\n not 'carrying on or doing business' within the meaning of the capital stock tax and was therefore exempt. In so holding the court refused to give effect to the Treasury regulation claimed to be applicable. \n2\n 35 F. Supp. 340. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 120 F.2d 441. We granted certiorari because of the importance of the question in the administration of the revenue acts. \n314 \nU.S. 601\n, 62 S.Ct. 135, 86 L.Ed. --.\n The regulation, Article 43(a)(5), provides:\n'Art. 43. Illustrations.-(a) General.-In general 'doing business' includes any activities of a corporation whether it engages in-\n\n'(5) the orderly liquidation of property by negotiating sales from time to time as opportunity and judgment dictate and distributing the proceeds as liquidation is effected-for example, the liquidation of an estate, or of properties taken over from another corporation, or of the shareholders' fractional interests in particular property;' If the regulation is both applicable and valid, respondent manifestly cannot prevail.\n\n On the question of applicability there can be no doubt for the language of the regulation precisely describes respondent's activities. We find without substance respondent's assertions that Article 43(b)(2)3 is inconsistent with Article 43(a)(5) and that it more exactly fits the facts \n\n[316 \nU.S. 69, 73]\n\u00a0\n of this case. During the period in question respondent did not fall into that state of quietude, covered by the specific language of Article 43(b)( 2), in which it was merely owning and holding specific property and distributing the resulting proceeds. See Zonne v. Minneapolis Syndicate, \n220 \nU.S. 187\n, 31 S.Ct. 361; cf. Von Baumbach v. Sargent Land Co., \n242 \nU.S. 503, 516\n, 517 S., 37 S.Ct. 201, 204. On the contrary, respondent was actively engaged in fulfilling the purpose of its creation, the liquidation of its holdings for the best obtainable price.\n Article 43(a)(5) is both a contemporary and a long standing administrative interpretation, having been in effect in substantially the same form since 1918, except for the period from 1926 to 1933 when the tax was not imposed. 4 We are of opinion that it is valid, as well as applicable. The crucial words of the statute, 'carrying on or doing business', are not so easy of application to varying facts that they leave no room for administrative interpretation or elucidation. To be sure, in many, if not in most instances, the factual situation will be so extreme as to leave no doubt whether a corporation is doing business or not. But the nuances of facts between the two ex- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 69, 74]\n\u00a0\n tremes have produced a nebulous field of confusion which has been recognized by courts striving to fit close cases into one category or the other. \n5\n Interpretative regulations, such as Article 43(a)(5), are appropriate aids toward eliminating that confusion and uncertainty.

MILLER(1942)\nNo. 74\nArgued: November 17, 1942Decided: December 7, 1942\n\n\n\n\n[317 \nU.S. 178, 179]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edwin J. Skeen, of Salt Lake City, Utah, for petitioners.\n Mr. Hadlond P. Thomas, of Salt Lake City, Utah, for respondent.\n\n\n\n[317 \nU.S. 178, 180]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether the interest of one of two joint tenants of a land purchase contract can be administered in farmer-debtor proceedings under  75 of the Bankruptcy Act as amended, 11 U.S.C.  203, 11 U.S.C.A.  203, although subsequent to the filing of his petition the interest of his co-tenant had been forfeited by default in payment of installments of the purchase price.\n Petitioners, husband and wife, as 'joint tenants with full right of survivorship and not as tenants in common', entered into a contract with respondent's assignor for the purchase of a plot of land. They apparently entered into possession under the contract, although the fact does not explicitly appear in the record. The contract stipulated for a down payment of $500 of the purchase price and for payment of the balance in equal monthly installments extending over a period of more than seven years. Nearly two years later, the buyers being in default in payment of installments, respondent gave appropriate notice, in conformity to state law, that the contract would be forfeited unless all payments due were made. Five days before the date on which the forfeiture was to become effective, the husband alone, without reference to his co-tenant, filed his petition as a farmer-debtor under  75. After the date of forfeiture, respondent moved, on a showing of the facts as stated, to strike the land in question from the schedules of the debtor's property, challenging the jurisdiction of the court to administer it. The wife thereupon filed in the bankruptcy proceeding a 'joinder of Rose L. Mangus' in which she asked to be permitted to adopt the petition of her husband for relief under  75 and his schedules of property, referring to the land in question. It does not appear whether she was an insolvent farmer-debtor within the meaning of  75, sub. r, and so entitled to the benefits of \n\n[317 \nU.S. 178, 181]\n\u00a0\n the Act. Upon respondent's filing of a supplemental motion to strike the land from the schedules of the debtor's property, with a showing that at the time of the wife's attempted joinder she had forfeited her interest in the property, the court denied both of respondent's motions.\n The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed, 125 F.2d 507, holding that the right or interest which the wife had acquired in the land by the contract of purchase had been forfeited before her attempted joinder in the bankruptcy proceedings, see Federal Land Bank of Berkeley v. Sorenson, Utah, 121 P.2d 398; Leone v. Zuniga, 84 Utah 417, 34 P.2d 699, 94 A.L.R. 1232, and that in consequence she had no remaining interest in the land which she could ask the bankruptcy court to administer. It thought that by the forfeiture respondent became vested as her successor with the interest which she had acquired in the land by virtue of the contract. But it was also of opinion that notwithstanding the forfeiture she remained a joint tenant of the contract with her husband and so was an indispensable party to any judgment or order of the bankruptcy court making disposition of the debtor's interest in the contract and the property. It also pointed out that although the interest of a bankrupt joint tenant may be sold in a regular bankruptcy proceeding, the proceedings under  75, subs. a to r, do not look in the first instance to a sale of the debtor's property or operate to pass title to a trustee or the court, but contemplate maintenance of the status quo by a moratorium pending an adjustment or composition of his debts, and his ultimate emergence from bankruptcy with all his property. See John Hancock Mut. Ins. Co. v. Bartels, \n308 \nU.S. 180, 184\n, 60 S.Ct. 221, 223; Wright v. Union Central Life Ins. Co., \n311 \nU.S. 273\n, 61 S.Ct. 196.\n From all this the court concluded that the difficulties of administration of the bankrupt's interest in  75 proceedings are so insurmountable as to require dismissal of the \n\n[317 \nU.S. 178, 182]\n\u00a0\n proceeding. \n1\n In the circumstances of this case it attributed these difficulties to the uncertainty as to the rights of the husband as joint tenant of the contract with his wife and as tenant in common with respondent of the land. The uncertainty arose, it was suggested, from the doubt whether the husband upon effecting an adjustment and compromise with creditors would be entitled to acquire all the land upon payment of the balance of the purchase price, or only to demand half of it on payment of one-half of the purchase money due. We granted certiorari, \n316 \nU.S. 657\n, 62 S.Ct. 1277, on a petition which challenged the rulings of the Circuit Court of Appeals that the wife was an indispensable party to the farmer-debtor proceeding, and that the interest of the husband alone was not susceptible of administration in that proceeding.\n Section 75, sub. n, directs that the filing of the farmer-debtor's petitioner 'shall immediately subject the farmer and all his property ... for all the purposes of this section, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court, including ... any equity or right in any such property, including, among others, contracts for purchase, Section 75, sub. o, provides an effective Section 75, sub. o, provides an effective moratorium, pending further proceedings, against the forfeiture of the debtor's interest in the property over which the court has jurisdiction. This is accomplishes by staying, unless otherwise permitted by the court, proceedings for foreclosure of a mortgage, or for cancellation or rescission of an agreement for the sale of land, or for the recovery of possession of land, or for the seizure or sale of the debtor's property under conditional sales agreement. Kalb v. Feuerstein, \n308 \nU.S. 433\n, 60 S.Ct. 343; John Hancock Ins. Co. v. Bartels, \n308 \nU.S. 180\n, 60 S.Ct. 221. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 178, 183]\n\u00a0\n We see no reason to doubt that, under these provisions and others presently to be noted, the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction in a  95 proceeding over the husband's interest as joint tenant in the contract for the purchase of the land. Section 75, sub. n, expressly subjects to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court the vendee's interest in such a contract. And, so far as we are advised, Utah accepts the general common law rules relating to joint tenancies, including the rules permitting alienation of the interest of a joint tenant, and making it property subject to execution and separate sale. Cf. Spalding v. Allred, 23 Utah, 354, 64 P. 1100; Neill v. Royce, Utah, 120 P.2d 327;  104-37-9 Revised Statutes of Utah, 1933; and see 3 Tiffany, Real Property (3rd ed.)  425; 2 Thompson, Real Property,  1714-17. When so locally recognized the interest of a joint tenant is a property interest subject to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court under  70 of the general Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.  110, 11 U.S.C.A.  110; Matter of DePree, 30 A.B.R.,N.S., 629; In re Williams, 16 A.B.R.,N.S., 218; cf. In re Brown, D.C., 60 F.2d 269; In re Williams' Estate, D.C., 16 F.Supp. 909.\n Section 75, sub. n, of the Farm Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.  203, sub. n, which provides that the filing of a petition shall subject 'the farmer and all his property' to the jurisdiction of the Court, further directs that 'In proceedings under this section, except as otherwise provided herein, the jurisdiction and powers of the courts, the title, powers and duties of its officers, the duties of the farmer, and the rights and liabilities of creditors, and of all persons with respect to the property of the farmer ... shall be the same as if a voluntary petition for adjudication had been filed and a decree of adjudication had been entered . ...' And subsection s(4) of  75 commands that '... the provisions of this title shall be held to apply also to part- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 178, 184]\n\u00a0\n nerships, common, entirety, joint, community ownerships ... and any such parties may join in one petition.'\n The final clause of this provision permitting both joint tenants to join in the petition suggests that either, if entitled to the benefits of the Act, may file a petition without the other. Such was declared to be its purpose by the House Judiciary Committee which recommended its addition by way of amendment to  75, sub. s, as originally enacted. In reporting this amendment the Committee pointed out the diversity of rulings of the courts under  75, saying, 'Some have held that if a husband and wife were jointly interested or had interests in common or were partners in the farming operation that then neither of them could take advantage of the Act, nor could they join. Obviously such was not the intention of Congress'. H.R. Rep. No. 570, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 4. We need not now determine whether the wife, who does not appear to be a farmer-debtor, could before the forfeiture have joined in the petition. It is enough that one joint tenant is authorized to file his petition under  75 and subject his interest to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court just as he may under  70 of the general Bankruptcy Act.\n Accordingly we conclude that the husband's interest in the property held by him as joint tenant with his wife is property within the meaning of  75, sub. n, and that the court acquired jurisdiction over that interest upon the filing of his petition. The husband's interest as joint tenant being subject to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court, he was entitled to the benefit of the moratorium afforded by  75, sub. o, for the purpose of enabling him to effect a composition with his creditors, failing which he was entitled to proceed under  75, sub. s. John Hancock Ins. Co. v. Bartels, supra.\n The Court of Appeals cited no decision of the Utah courts and we are referred to none which supports its \n\n[317 \nU.S. 178, 185]\n\u00a0\n conclusion that respondent, as the result of the forfeiture of the wife's interest in the land, succeeded to that interest and became a co-tenant with the husband. So far as the law of that state is concerned, it would seem to be an equally tenable position that the forfeiture freed respondent's title of any equitable interest of the wife and left it subject only to such demands as the husband might assert by virtue of his interest. In advance of an authoritative determination by the state courts of the rights of the parties to the contract after the forfeiture of the wife's interest, we cannot say that the difficulties of administering the husband's interest under  75, sub. s, are insurmountable. Indeed, before dismissing the proceedings because of difficulties in ascertaining the rights of the debtor under state law and in administering them in bankruptcy, it would be an appropriate exercise of the court's jurisdiction to take suitable measures to remove those difficulties by affording the interested parties opportunity to assert their rights in the state courts and, when they are ascertained and defined, by administering the debtor's interest as the Act provides, so far as may be found to be practicable.\n Section 75, sub. e, provides that 'after the filing of the petition and prior to the confirmation or other disposition of the composition or extension proposal by the court, the court shall exercise such control over the property of the farmer as the court deems in the best interests of the farmer and his creditors.' During such control the court is free to permit and to facilitate proceedings in the state courts which would adjudicate the interests of the parties in the contract, subject to the stay directed by  75, sub. o, of any cancellation of the contract or foreclosure of petitioner's interest in it. Utah, by 104-3-18 of its Revised Statutes, has provided that 'all persons holding as tenants in common or as joint tenants, or any number \n\n[317 \nU.S. 178, 186]\n\u00a0\n less than all, may jointly or severally commence or defend any civil action or proceeding for the enforcement or protection of the rights involved. In all cases one tenant in common or joint tenant can sue his co- tenant.' And it has adopted the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act under which respondent or petitioners, or either of them, are free to proceed to an adjudication of their rights. 104-64-1 et seq., Revised Statutes of Utah, 1933. We perceive no insurmountable obstacle, if the bankruptcy court is so advised, to the exercise of its jurisdiction so as to permit the parties to ascertain their respective rights by an appropriate proceeding in the state courts. See Thompson v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., \n309 \nU.S. 478, 483\n, 60 S.Ct. 628, 630. While such practice is to be regarded as exceptional, the circumstances which here suggest it appear to be exceptional. It may be suggested too that if pending the proceedings for adjustment or composition with creditors the wife were to release or assign to her co-tenant her interest in the contract, all beneficial interest under which she has forfeited, the technical difficulties thought to exist by reason of her absence as a party from the bankruptcy proceedings might be removed.\n With the court's jurisdiction over the debtor's interest in the land and the duty to administer it established, we cannot say that the accommodation with respondent and other creditors which the statute contemplates could not be arrived at. But in the event that no composition is effected the debtor may ask to be adjudicated a bankrupt and as such to be placed in possession of the property under the provisions of  75, sub. s, upon terms which will enable him, by paying a suitable rental, to redeem the property unless he is sooner able to finance himself. See John Hancock Ins. Co. v. Bartels, supra. If his interest is found to be such that it is impracticable to place him in possession or otherwise to administer the property as \n\n[317 \nU.S. 178, 187]\n\u00a0\n provided by  75, sub. s, he is entitled to petition the court for leave to redeem the property, and if he is unable to redeem it, a sale of his interest may be ordered as directed by  75, sub. s(3). Wright v. Union Central Ins. Co., supra. The sale of the interest of a co-tenant may be separately effected in a bankruptcy proceedings. In re Toms, 6 Cir., 101 F. 2d 617; In re Brown, supra, 60 F.2d at page 273. And we cannot say that a court possessing the powers of a court of equity could not in this case direct a sale on conditions which would protect the rights of the debtor, respondent, and the purchaser.\n Respondent moves to dismiss the writ of certiorari because after the judgment below denying the district court's jurisdiction, petitioners procured a return of rental deposited by them in the bankruptcy court as an incident to proceedings under  75, sub. s(2). It is argued that this action is so inconsistent with petitioners' appeal as to estop them from further prosecution of it. The other, if any, directing the deposit, and the attendant proceedings do not appear in the record. Whether the withdrawal of the amount deposited is so inconsistent with further proceedings for the three-year stay authorized by  75, sub. s, upon payment of a prescribed rental obviously cannot be determined on this record and should, in any case, be determined in the first instance by the bankruptcy court having jurisdiction of the cause. But it plainly is not inconsistent with other remedies which the court has jurisdiction to give under  75, or with recourse to measures which the court may take to permit an adjudication of the rights of the parties, on the basis of which a composition may be effected. In any case, since deposit of rental is not prerequisite to jurisdiction, petitioners' recall and receipt of money, whatever effect it may have had on their right to the three-year stay authorized by  75, sub. s, involved no inconsistency with the assertion on this appeal of the court's jurisdiction to resolve that question and to take \n\n[317 \nU.S. 178, 188]\n\u00a0\n other appropriate action. The court's authority to give relief upon compliance with such terms as it may properly impose, including the payment of rental, either by moratorium pending a composition with creditors or by sale as the statute provides, remains unaffected. At least it has authority under  75, sub. s, and is required to permit redemption of the property by the debtor before ordering a sale. Wright v. Union Central Ins. Co., supra.\n We are of opinion that the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction over the debtor's interest in the property in question and that in its sound discretion it should, in every practicable way, exercise that jurisdiction for the protection of the interest of the debtor as the statute directs.\n The judgment below should be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Compare Buss v.

X of the Bankruptcy Act, 52 Stat. 883, 11 U.S.C.  501 et seq., 11 U.S.C.A .  501 et seq., was not filed in 'good faith'.\n The debtor's sole asset is an apartment building in New York City which is subject to a first mortgage of $370,000. This mortgage is held by the respondent, Manufacturer's Trust Co. (successor to The Mortgage Corporation of New York) as trustee for certificate holders. There are also junior mortgages and other claims, including an unspecified amount of unsecured indebtedness. Concededly the property of the debtor is worth less than the amount of the first mortgage debt. The first mortgage was originally created in 1931 and was held by Title Guarantee and Trust Co. which issued and sold to the public certificates of participation, guaranteed as to principal and interest by Bond and Mortgage Guarantee Co. The latter company became involved in financial difficulties in 1933 and was taken over by the Superintendent of Insurance of New York for rehabilitation. \n1\n Pursuant to provisions of the Schackno Act, N.Y.Laws 1933, c. 745, McK.Unconsol.Laws,  1796 et seq., the Superintendent of Insurance promulgated in 1934 a plan for the readjustment of the rights of the certificate holders in the mortgage by which the mortgage was extended to December 1, 1937 and the interest reduced. Over two-thirds of the certificate holders consented to the plan and the debtor joined in the extension agreement. The New York court approved it. In 1935 the New York Mortgage Commission succeeded the Superintendent of Insurance as administrator of certificated bonds and mortgages. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 78, 82]\n\u00a0\n N.Y.Laws 1935, c. 19, c. 290, McK.Unconsol.Laws  1751 et seq. That Commission2 in 1938 proposed the designation of the Mortgage Corporation of New York as trustee of the bond and mortgage in the instant case under a declaration of trust granting the trustee broad and comprehensive powers. This proposal was consented to by over two-thirds of the certificate holders and approved by the New York court. The order of the court provided 'that this Court, having assumed jurisdiction of this proceeding, shall retain jurisdiction hereof until the complete liquidation of the Trust Estate and the termination of the trust; and the Trustee, or any other interested party herein, may apply at the foot of this Final Order upon such notice as the Court may direct for such other and further relief as to the Court may seem just and proper.'\n The principal of the first mortgage was not paid at its extended maturity in 1937. But until April 1, 1941, the debtor made all other payments due under the 1934 extension agreement. At that time the debtor defaulted in payment of interest and taxes. Both before and after that default the debtor and the trustee negotiated for an agreement of further extension and modification. But no agreement between them could be reached and no further proposal for a modification or extension of the mortgage was presented to the state court or to the certificate holders. On May 1, 1941, the trustee instituted foreclosure proceedings in the state court. A receiver was appointed who took possession. In September 1941 the debtor filed its voluntary petition under Ch. X of the Bankruptcy Act. An ex parte order approving the petition and appointing trustees was obtained. Shortly thereafter the mortgage trustee moved to vacate that order and to dismiss the debtor's petition on the ground that it was not filed in \n\n[317 \nU.S. 78, 83]\n\u00a0\n 'good faith'. That motion was denied. D.C., 41 F.Supp. 814. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, one judge dissenting, 2 Cir., 125 F.2d 296. We granted the petition for certiorari because of the importance in the administration of the Bankruptcy Act of the problems involved.\n Every petition under Ch. X must state, inter alia, 'the specific facts showing the need for relief under this chapter.'  130(7), 11 U.S.C. A.  530(7). Sec. 141 provides that the judge shall enter an order approving a debtor's petition 'if satisfied that it complies with the requirements of this chapter and has been filed in good faith, or dismissing it if not so satisfied.' Sec. 146 defines 'good faith' and provides in part:\n'Without limiting the generality of the meaning of the term 'good faith', a petition shall be deemed not to be filed in good faith if-\n\n'(4) a prior proceeding is pending in any court and it appears that the interests of creditors and stockholders would be best subserved in such prior proceeding.'\n\n The federal bankruptcy power is, of course, paramount and supreme and may be so exercised by Congress as to exclude every competing or conflicting proceeding in state or federal tribunals. Kalb v. Feuerstein, \n308 \nU.S. 433\n, 60 S.Ct. 343. In fashioning Ch. X Congress, however, did not go so far. While the pendency of prior proceedings in state or federal courts does not bar the filing of a petition under Ch. X ( 256), Congress in effect directed the bankruptcy courts not to approve petitions under Ch. X in such cases unless it appeared that the interests of creditors and stockholders would not be best subserved in the prior proceedings. And it put the burden on the petitioner to make that showing. The Report of the House Judiciary Committee states that the purpose of  146(4) was to 'stop the removal of prior pending cases from other courts where the interests of creditors and stockholders would be better served by retaining and continuing the prior proceedings.' H.Rep. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 78, 84]\n\u00a0\n No. 1409, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 42. Sec. 146 represents a codification of some of the interpretations which the courts had given the words 'good faith' in proceedings under  77B, 11 U.S.C.A.  207. S.Rep.No. 1916, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 27. Thus the necessity of showing 'a need for the machinery of  77B as an essential in accomplishing a reorganization because other procedures were either unavailable or more cumbersome and expensive' led courts to find an absence of 'good faith' in the sense that no 'need for relief' had been established, where 77B was sought to be employed by a debtor as 'a mechanism for preserving equities at the expense of creditors.' See Report on the Study and Investigation of the Work, Activities, Personnel and Functions of Protective and Reorganization Committees, Securities and Exchange Commission, Pt. VIII, p. 94 (1940).\n In view of that history it seems clear that when a prior proceeding is pending, a petitioner's showing of 'need for relief' under Ch. X, required to be contained in every petition by the express provisions of  130(7), must demonstrate that at least in some substantial particular the prior proceedings withhold or deny creditors or stockholders benefits, advantages, or protection which Ch. X affords. In absence of such a showing the 'need for relief' has not been established and the District Court is not enabled to make an informed judgment on the 'good faith' issue.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals in this case, as in Brooklyn Trust Co. v. Rembaugh, 2 Cir., 110 F.2d 838, held that the debtor's petition was not filed in 'good faith' since it was seeking to escape the jurisdiction of the state court to which it had voluntarily submitted itself. But that is not the test which Congress has provided in  146(4). That provision requires the bankruptcy court to inquire whether 'the interests of creditors and stockholders' would be better subserved in the prior proceedings or \n\n[317 \nU.S. 78, 85]\n\u00a0\n under Ch. X. That the desire of the petitioner to escape the prior proceedings is immaterial to that inquiry is supported not only by the language of  146(4) but also by the fact that  256 expressly sanctions the filing of petitions under Ch. X although prior proceedings are pending. To disqualify a petitioner under Ch. X merely because he had in some way participated in the prior proceeding would effect a substantial impairment of  146(4), since it would be the exception rather than the rule where both the debtor and the creditors had not taken some part in the prior proceedings. Furthermore, the issue as to the adequacy of the prior proceedings as compared with Ch. X is the same whether the petition is filed by creditors or by the debtor. All petitions whether filed by the debtor or by others must show the 'need for relief',  130, 131; and in every case the bankruptcy court must be satisfied that the petition has been filed in 'good faith'.  141-144.\n We are of the opinion, however, that the debtor did not sustain the burden which the federal statute places on a petitioner. So far as the 'interests' of stockholders are concerned it is not apparent that the equity owners would be denied in the state foreclosure proceedings benefits, advantages, or protection which Ch. X would afford them. Admittedly the property is worth less than the amount of the first mortgage indebtedness. Under the rule of Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Boyd, \n228 \nU.S. 482\n, 33 S.Ct. 554, and Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., \n308 \nU.S. 106\n, 60 S.Ct. 1, a plan of reorganization would not be fair and equitable which in such circumstances admitted the stockholders to participation, unless the stockholders made a fresh contribution in money or in money's worth in return for 'a participation reasonably equivalent to their contribution.' Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., supra, 308 U.S. at page 121, 60 S.Ct. at page 10. That rule obtains under Ch. X as well as under its predecessor,  77B. There is no suggestion in the record \n\n[317 \nU.S. 78, 86]\n\u00a0\n that the equity owners desire to make a contribution on that basis and that unless they are allowed to do it under Ch. X, they will be barred. All that the record shows is an affidavit by one Silverman that 'if the creditors desire liquidation of their claims on the basis of present actual values rather than on the face amount of their claims', $50,000 in cash could be raised. Ch. X would not permit such a dilution of creditors' interests. Hence such a showing does not establish on behalf of the stockholders that 'need for relief' which  130(7) read in light of  146( 4) requires. In fact, the approval of the petition on that ground would be giving the equity owners a nuisance value wholly unjustified by the reorganization standards which are incorporated into Ch. X.\n The District Court, however, concluded that it was in the interests of all the creditors that the Ch. X petition be approved. It noted that the market value of the certificates was far under par and that there were lienors and creditors other than the first mortgage certificate holders with which the bankruptcy court, but not the state court, could deal. If there were a showing, for example, that the property was worth more than the amount of first mortgage indebtedness and it appeared that that excess value would be lost to the junior interests in the state proceedings or that the state proceedings were less adequate by reorganization standards than the bankruptcy court to protect such interests, approval of the petition clearly would be justified whether filed by the debtor or by creditors. But no such showing was made. Hence it was not established that continuation of the state proceedings would deny the junior creditors any benefits which Ch. X would afford them. Approval of the petition on the grounds advanced by the District Court could be made only under the composition theory of reorganization which Ch. X, like  77B, rejected in favor of the full priority rule of the Boyd case. See Case v. Los Angeles \n\n[317 \nU.S. 78, 87]\n\u00a0\n Lumber Products Co., supra, 308 U.S. at page 119, 60 S.Ct. at page 9, note 14. That rule protects the rights of senior creditors against dilution either by junior creditors or by equity interests. See Id ., 308 U.S. at page 123, 60 S.Ct. at page 11; Consolidated Rock Products Co. v. Du Bois, \n312 \nU.S. 510, 525\n, 526 S., 529, 530, 61 S.Ct. 675, 684, 685, 686, 687.\n There remains the contention that it was in the 'interests' of the certificate holders to have the proceedings transferred to Ch. X. In this connection much emphasis is placed on numerous safeguards contained in Ch. X which this Court reviewed in Securities and Exchange Commission v. United States Realty & Imp. Co., \n310 \nU.S. 434\n, 448-450, 60 S.Ct. 1044, 1049, 1050. And it is asserted that comparable safeguards are wholly or largely lacking in proceedings under the Schackno Act. Those considerations would be highly relevant and persuasive if this was a case of the usual reorganization proceeding dealing with more than one class of securities under the older procedures which Ch. X was designed to improve and supplant. See Securities and Exchange Commission v. United States Realty & Imp. Co., supra, 310 U.S. at page 448, 60 S.Ct. at page 1049; H.Rep.No. 1409, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 37 et seq. Then the safeguards afforded by Ch. X would have special significance in protecting the respective classes of investors against improvident, unfair or inequitable adjustments, compromises, and settlements-steps which are basic to the reorganization process but which in selfish hands led to much abuse. H.Rep.No. 1409, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 37 et seq. But here the machinery of the state which is being used is the foreclosure proceeding which so far as appears has been invoked on behalf of the certificate holders alone. Presumptively, the result of the foreclosure will be an appropriation of the assets of the debtor for the benefit of the certificate holders exclusively. There is no showing that the foreclosure proceedings have been conducted in such a way as to jeopardize the interests of the certificate holders contrary to the design of Ch. X. There is no showing \n\n[317 \nU.S. 78, 88]\n\u00a0\n that assets subject to the payment of the certificates are being neglected. Thus it is not shown that the claim against the guarantee company is not being pursued or that its collection could better be handled in proceedings under Ch. X. There is no showing that the machinery employed or available in the state foreclosure proceeding to safeguard and protect the interests of those creditors after the sale is not comparable to that contained in Ch. X for the consummation of plans which are not only fair but feasible.  221(2). In view of the burden on a petitioner to make the showing required by  130(7) and  146(4), the bankruptcy court is not warranted in assuming without more that a state foreclosure proceeding instituted for and on behalf of the first mortgage creditors exclusively is inadequate, measured by Ch. X standards, to protect their interests. The contrary course would result in Ch. X making greater inroads on prior proceedings than  130(7) and  146(4) indicate was the purpose.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See generally, Report of Commissioner George W.

Montgomery, of New York City, and John W. Dinkelspiel, of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 564, 565]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John J. Dailey, of San Francisco, Cal. (Mr. Maurice P. McCaffrey, of Sacramento, Cal., of counsel), for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner is the trustee of a bankrupt which was indebted to the California Unemployment Reserves Commission for contributions which had accrued under the California Unemployment Reserves Act. Section 45 of that Act provided that in the event of default in payment \n\n[314 \nU.S. 564, 566]\n\u00a0\n of contributions due the employer 'shall become additionally liable for interest on such payments at the rate of twelve per cent per annum from the date such payment becomes due, both principal and interest being payable in the same manner as the contributions.' Deering's Cal. Laws 1937, Act 8780d,  45. The Commission filed proof of a priority claim in the bankruptcy proceeding for the principal amount of the accrued contributions and interest thereon at the rate of twelve per cent.\n The trustee paid the principal sum with interest at six per cent, but refused to pay more, relying on  57, sub. j, of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U. S.C.  93, sub. j, 11 U.S.C.A.  93, sub. j, which provides that 'Debts owing to the United States, a State, a county, a district, or a municipality as a penalty or forfeiture shall not be allowed, except for the amount for the pecuniary loss sustained by the act, transaction, or proceeding out of which the penalty or forfeiture arose, with reasonable and actual costs occasioned thereby and such interest as may have accrued thereon according to law.' The trustee asserted that any exaction in excess of six per cent, which he claimed was the 'reasonable and customary rate of interest,' was a penalty; the bankruptcy court decreed that all above seven per cent (a common, though not an invariable, legal rate in California) was a penalty and refused to allow so much of the claim; and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed on the ground that no part of the twelve per cent was a penalty. 116 F.2d 330. We granted certiorari because of the conflict between this decision and that of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in In re Pressed Steel Car Co. of New Jersey. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Petitioner seeks to establish that the twelve per cent exaction here in question is not 'interest' by pointing to Article XX, Section 22 of the California Constitution, which \n\n[314 \nU.S. 564, 567]\n\u00a0\n provides that, except for specified institutions, the rate of interest on loans, and on accounts after demand or judgment, shall be seven per cent, and leaves the parties free to contract in writing for a rate not exceeding ten per cent. \n2\n We do not understand that as a matter of State law the California legislature was thereby forbidden to prescribe the higher rate here involved. And the mere difference in rates does not establish that the twelve per cent rate is not 'interest' within the meaning of  57, sub. j, of the Bankruptcy Act.\n It is common knowledge that interest rates vary not only according to the general use value of money but also according to the hazard of particular classes of loans. Delinquent taxpayers as a class are a poor credit risk; tax default, unless an incident of legitimate tax litigation, is, to the eye sensitive to credit indications, a signal of distress. A rate of interest on tax delinquencies which is low in comparison to the taxpayer's borrowing rate-if he can borrow at all-is a temptation to use the state as a convenient, if involuntary, banker by the simple practice of deferring the payment of taxes.\n Another variable is the amount necessary to compensate for the trouble of handling the item. The legislature may include compensation to the state for the increased costs of administration in the exaction for delay in paying taxes without thereby changing it from interest to penalty. \n\n[314 \nU.S. 564, 568]\n\u00a0\n These factors-risk, and the expenses of handling-are reflected in the interest rates permitted by California to certain types of financial institutions: for example, credit unions may charge interest at the rate of one per cent per month;3 pawnbrokers, at two per cent per month on the first one hundred dollars of indebtedness;4 and personal property brokers, two and one-half per cent per month on the first three hundred dollars. \n5\n A differentiation of treatment for particular types of loans similar in principle is commonly made by other states. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n People of State of New York v. Jersawit, \n263 \nU.S. 493\n, 44 S.Ct. 167, is thought by petitioner to require a decision in his favor. That was involved a New York statute visiting tax delinquents with an additional liability of ten per cent of the tax, and adding thereto a further liability of one per cent per month, which was not denominated interest. The Circuit Court of Appeals had held that such provision was penal, but had allowed interest at the usual legal rate on the theory that it represented actual damage. In re Ajax Dress Co., 2 Cir., 290 F. 950. This Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Holmes, said:\n'There can be no doubt that the additional ten per centum charged for failure to pay by January 1 is a penalty, disallowed by the Bankruptcy Act ,  57j, but it is urged that the one per centum for each month of default is statutory interest and that the State is entitled to that and otherwise would be entitled to none. As the one per centum is more than the value of the use of the money and is added by the statute to the ten to make a single sum it must be treated as part of one corpus and must fall with that. We presume that in this event the State does not object to receiving the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 564, 569]\n\u00a0\n simple interest allowed. That part of the order will stand.' 263 U.S. at page 496, 44 S.Ct. at page 168.\n\n Here the exaction computed according to lapse of time is not lumped together with another percentage computed without reference to lapse of time; here the exaction is denominated interest by the statute, and there it was not; and we cannot be so confident here that twelve per cent 'is more than the value of the use of the money,' or of the validity of the implied major premise that an exaction in excess of such value cannot be merely an interest charge. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The decision which controls here is the more recent one of United States v. Childs, \n266 \nU.S. 304\n, 45 S.Ct. 110, where the statute separately denominated a flat five per cent exaction as a penalty, and an additional one of one per cent a month as interest. The latter was held to be 'interest' within the meaning of  57, sub. j, of the Bankruptcy Act. The distinction from the fact that the exaction in that case was by the United States and in this case by a State calls for no difference in result. We must give credit to a state legislature acting within its Constitutional sphere like that accorded to Congress acting in its Constitutional \n\n[314 \nU.S. 564, 570]\n\u00a0\n sphere. And the distinction which Congress made in the legislation considered in the Childs case and in other revenue legislation between penalty as a fixed ad valorem amount taking no account of time, and interest which does depend on time, is persuasive that its use of the word 'penalty' in the Bankruptcy Act will bear a like differentiation from interest.\n Finally, it may be observed that Congress itself has provided in the District of Columbia Unemployment Compensation Act that in the event contributions are not paid when due 'there shall be added, as part of the contributions, interest at the rate of 1 per centum per month.'

McEachern, Jr., of New York City, for appellant.\n Messrs. Whitworth Stokes and Lewis S. Pope, both of Nashville, Tenn., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is whether a tax laid pursuant to  1316- 1318 of the Tennessee Code of 1932 upon the Memphis Natural Gas Company's net income derived from sales of natural gas in Tennessee, during the years 1932 to 1935, violates the commerce clause, Const. U.S. art. 1,  8, cl. 3.\n The case comes here by appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Tennessee, which sustained the tax and reversed a decree of the Tennessee chancery court enjoining its collection. Appellant contends that the case is properly an appeal, under section 237(a) of the Judicial Code as amended, 28 U.S.C.  344(a), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(a), because the validity of the Tennessee statute as applied to the facts of this case has been drawn in question. Cf. Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282\n, 42 S.Ct. 106. But appellant's bill of complaint, filed in the chancery court, alleged only that the assessment of the tax and the threatened levy violated its rights under the commerce clause. Our decisions have long since established that an attack upon a tax assessment or levy, on the ground that it infringes a taxpayer's federal rights, privileges or immunities, will not sustain an appeal under section 237(a).

It is not enough that an appellant could have launched his attack upon the validity of the statute itself as applied; if he has \n\n[315 \nU.S. 649, 651]\n\u00a0\n failed to do so we are without jurisdiction over the appeal. The Judicial Code was intended to restrict our obligatory appellate jurisdiction to a narrow class of cases, and to foreclose an appeal as of right whenever the prescribed conditions have not been rigorously fulfilled.\n It is true that when this case reached the Supreme Court of Tennessee the appellant included in its brief, which has been certified as part of the record here, a statement of its legal position which might serve as a challenge to the validity of the statute. But appellant has failed to establish that under Tennessee practice such a contention can be availed of if advanced for the first time in the appellate court, cf. Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Illinois Brick Co., \n297 \nU.S. 447, 462\n, 463 S., 56 S.Ct. 556, 561; Jacobi v. Alabama, \n187 \nU.S. 133, 135\n, 136 S., 23 S.Ct. 48, 49; Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. McGrew, \n188 \nU.S. 291\n, 23 S.Ct. 375, 63 L.R.A. 33, and appellant's burden is to show affirmatively that we have jurisdiction. Chicago, Indianapolis, etc., Ry. Co. v. McGuire, \n196 \nU.S. 128, 132\n, 25 S.Ct. 200, 201; cf. Lynch v. People of New York, \n293 \nU.S. 52, 54\n, 55 S., 55 S.Ct. 16, 17; Enriquez v.

Terminal Railroad Ass'n, \n302 \nU.S. 678\n, 58 S.Ct. 134.\n The first opinion rendered by the Supreme Court of Tennessee made no mention of any federal question, and in a supplemental opinion, the court stated only that 'the claim of federally protected right was decided adversely to complainant'. Since it does not appear that the validity of the statute was either drawn in question or passed upon in the trial court or deemed by the state supreme court to be in issue, we must dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction. Treating the papers on which the appeal was allowed as a petition for writ of certiorari, as required by section 237(c) of the Judicial Code as amended, 28 U.S.C.  344(c), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(c), certiorari is granted and we proceed to consider the merits of the case.\n Taxpayer, a Delaware corporation, was engaged during the period in question in the business of purchasing natural gas in Louisiana and transporting it through its \n\n[315 \nU.S. 649, 652]\n\u00a0\n pipeline to points in Tennessee where it delivered the gas into the pipelines of two distributing companies-Memphis Power & Light Co. and West Tennessee Power & Light Co.-which sold the gas to local consumers. Taxpayer sells some of its gas in other states, but in Tennessee it sells from 1 to 2% of its output to the West Tennessee Power & Light Co. and delivers 80% or more to the Memphis company. That company distributes it to consumers under a contract with taxpayer which the Supreme Court of Tennessee has found to be a joint undertaking of the two companies whereby taxpayer furnishes gas from its pipeline, the Memphis company furnishes facilities and service for distribution and sale to consumers, and the proceeds of the sale, after deduction of specified costs and expenses, are divided between the two companies.\n Taxpayer is licensed by the State of Tennessee to do business there. It maintains a statutory office in Delaware and a stock transfer office in New York City, but conducts no business at either. It manages its business from its office in Memphis, Tennessee, where it keeps its accounts, provides for the payroll of employees on its line in Tennessee and other states, and prepares and sends out bills for gas delivered in Tennessee and other states. It has thus established a commercial domicile in Tennessee by virtue of which it is subject to taxation there upon its intangibles, unless such taxation infringes the commerce clause. Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Fox, \n298 \nU.S. 193\n, 56 S.Ct. 773\n\n\n Section 1316 of the Tennessee Code of 1932 imposes on all foreign and domestic corporations doing business for profit in the state an annual excise tax of 'three per cent. of the net earnings for their preceding fiscal year ... arising from business done wholly within the state, excluding earnings arising from interstate commerce.' The Supreme Court of Tennessee sustained the tax on the ground \n\n[315 \nU.S. 649, 653]\n\u00a0\n that it was laid on appellant's net earnings from the distribution of gas under its contract with the Memphis company, which distribution it held not to be interstate commerce within the meaning of the statute. It decided that by virtue of their contract the companies became in effect partners or joint enterprisers in the distribution and sale of the gas to Tennessee consumers, the net earnings from which are taxable under the statute.\n On petition for rehearing, taxpayer asked a modification of the decree on the ground that included in the measure of the tax were profits derived from sales of gas to the West Tennessee Power & Light Co. and from certain other sales to the Memphis company, not under the joint adventure agreement, which it was insisted were concededly sales in interstate commerce. The court rejected this contention upon the adequate state ground, not challenged here, that taxpayer had failed to show what portion, if any, of the taxed profits was derived from such sales and consequently had laid no basis for an injunction restraining collection of that part of the tax.\n This Court has often had occasion to rule that the retail sale of gas at the burner tips by one who pipes the gas into the state or by a local distributor acquiring the gas from another who has similarly brought it into the state is subject to state taxation and regulation. Public Utilities Comm. v. Landon, \n249 \nU.S. 236\n, 39 S.Ct. 268; East Ohio Gas Co. v. Tax Comm., \n283 \nU.S. 465\n, 51 S.Ct. 499; Southern Natural Gas Corp. v. Alabama, \n301 \nU.S. 148, 154\n, 57 S.Ct. 696, 698; cf. Missouri v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., \n265 \nU.S. 298, 309\n, 44 S.Ct. 544, 546; Illinois Natural Gas Co. v. Central Illinois Public Service Co., \n314 \nU.S. 498\n, 62 S.Ct. 384, 86 L.Ed. --. It follows that if the Supreme Court of Tennessee correctly construed taxpayer's contract with the Memphis company as establishing a profit- sharing joint adventure in the distribution of gas to Tennessee consumers, the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 649, 654]\n\u00a0\n taxpayer's net earnings under the contract were subject to local taxation.\n The meaning and effect of the contract, so far as they establish taxpayer's participation in and ownership of profits derived from the retail sale of the gas, are local questions conclusively settled by the decision of the state court save only as this Court, in the performance of its duty to safeguard an asserted constitutional right, may inquire whether the decision of the state question rests upon a fair or substantial basis. See Board River Power Co. v. South Carolina, \n281 \nU.S. 537\n, 50 S.Ct. 401, and cases cited. We examine the contract only to make certain that the non-federal ground of decision is not so colorable or unsubstantial as to be in effect an evasion of the constitutional issue.\n The contract was entered into as a preliminary to the award by the City of Memphis to the Memphis company of its franchise to distribute gas to consumers, and execution of the contract was a condition of the grant of the franchise. By the contract the Memphis company undertook to establish its distribution system. Taxpayer undertook to construct its pipeline with facilities, including measuring stations at a delivery point, for supplying the Memphis company with a varying flow of gas into the service pipes as and when required by the Memphis company for consumer needs. The amount so furnished, less certain deductions covered by a separate contract not now material, was to be divided into five classes, according to the use made of the gas by consumers, and was to be billed by taxpayer to the Memphis company at five different specified rates. The amount of gas allocated to each class was to be in proportion to the amount of that class of gas sold by the Memphis company for like use during the preceding month.\n At the end of each year the combined net surplus or deficit of the two companies was to be divided between \n\n[315 \nU.S. 649, 655]\n\u00a0\n them by a cash settlement. The surplus or deficit of each was to be arrived at by deducting from its gross revenues the operating costs, costs of property restorations and replacements, taxes, amortization of investment, and 6% upon investment. After all net deficits of both parties had been made up and the Memphis company had received from the combined net surpluses 1 1\/2% of its total investment annually, any additional combined net income was to be paid to or retained by taxpayer.\n The contract provided for readjustment from time to time of the billing price of the gas supplied by taxpayer so as to admit of reduction in the rates to consumers, after first allowing 'a reasonable return' on taxpayer's investment. The contract contains the usual provisions for inspection of books by the parties and the city, and a clause requiring all notices to be given to taxpayer at its Memphis office.\n The Supreme Court of Tennessee held that the city was a party to the contract entitled to the benefits of its provisions for rate reductions. It held that the circumstance that taxpayer and the Memphis company were designated by the contract as 'seller' and 'buyer' did not alter or obscure the fact that taxpayer was a participant in the profits derived from the joint undertaking and that the precise time when the title to the gas passed, if it passed before distribution to consumers, was immaterial. In any case it thought that the tentative amounts to be paid by the Memphis company for the gas in the first instance were to be determined after delivery by the use made of it by consumers.\n We cannot say that there is not a substantial basis for the state court's conclusion that in substance the contract called for the contribution of the services and facilities of the companies to a joint enterprise, the taxpayer's delivery of gas into the mains of the Memphis company for distribution to consumers, and a division between the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 649, 656]\n\u00a0\n two companies of the operating profits after providing for certain agreed initial costs and expenses. Nor can we say that by this participation the taxpayer did not do such a business in the state as to be taxable there, or that the profits derived from it are not an appropriate measure of the tax.\n Taxpayer's contribution to the joint undertaking with the Memphis company for the distribution of gas to local consumers, and its activities at its Memphis general office in supplying gas to be distributed for the joint account as required by the Memphis company and in safeguarding and securing payment of its share of the profits, went beyond the mere sale, to a distributor, of gas in interstate commerce. It also constituted participation in the business of distributing the gas to consumers after its delivery into the service pipes of the Memphis company. Cheney Bros. Co. v.

UNITED STATES(1942)\nNo. 83\nArgued: December 12, 1941Decided: January 12, 1942\n\n\n\n Mr. John Lewis Evans, of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioner.\n Mr. J. Louis Monarch, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question in this case-whether amounts paid members of the Merion Cricket Club during the period from July 1, 1931, to June 30, 1935, for golf privileges, constituted payments as 'dues or membership fees' subject to the tax imposed by  501 of the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 9, 92, as amended by Section 413 of the Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 791, 864, 26 U. S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 441,-does not differ in substance from that decided this day in White v. Winchester Country Club, ante, \n315 \nU.S. 32\n, 62 S.Ct. 425, 86 L.Ed. --.\n With certain exceptions, a member of the Merion Cricket Club could obtain annual golf privileges only by payment of a fee, which varied in amount according to his age and status. The fee was payable in two equal installments, one on the first of January, and the other on \n\n[315 \nU.S. 42, 43]\n\u00a0\n the first of July. A member admitted to golf privileges after the latter date was entitled to remission of one-half of the annual fees, but if one stopped using the golf facilities during the year there was no proportionate refund. If a member elected to play golf he continued to be liable for the succeeding year unless he gave notice of withdrawal before the end of the year. Members who paid the annual golf fees were entitled to use the golf facilities as often as they desired without further charge, and could on occasion obtain golf privileges for their wives and guests.\n After a claim for refund of the amounts alleged to have been paid as taxes on the annual golf fees had been duly filed and rejected, the Club on its own behalf and on behalf of its members sued the United States in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to recover them. The District Court entered a judgment for the United States which was affirmed on appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 119 F.2d 578. Certiorari was granted in this case and in White v. Winchester Country Club, supra, because of an asserted conflict between the decisions below. \n313 \nU.S. 555\n, 61 S.Ct. 1104; \n314 \nU.S. 589\n, 62 S.Ct. 59, 86 L.Ed. --.\n In this case, as in White v. Winchester Country Club, supra, we hold that amounts paid were paid as 'dues or membership fees,' since they were for rights to the repeated and general use of a common club facility for an appreciable period of time, and were not fixed by each occasion of actual use.\n The decision below is therefore\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","76":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMILCOR STEEL CO. v. GEORGE A. FULLER CO.(1942)\nNo. 720\nArgued: March 30, 1942Decided: April 27, 1942\n\n\n\n Messrs. George L. Wilkinson, of Chicago, Ill., and Asher Blum, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Malcolm K. Buckley, of Buffalo, N.Y., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought in the District Court for infringement of two claims of a patent issued to one Holdsworth and assigned to the petitioner. One defense pleaded by the respondents was that Holdsworth was not the original inventor. When a patentee, 'through inadvertence, accident, or mistake, and without any fraudulent or deceptive intention ... has claimed more than that of which he was the original or first inventor ...' , Rev.Stat.  4917, 35 U.S.C.  65, 35 U.S.C.A.  65, preserves for him or his as- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 143, 144]\n\u00a0\n signee 'all that part which is truly and justly his own, provided the same is a material or substantial part of the thing patented.' The method prescribed for saving the patent in part is 'disclaimer of such parts of the thing patented' as the patentee or his assignee 'shall not choose to claim.' After the respondents answered, the petitioner filed disclaimers in the patent office with respect to the two claims in suit, purporting to narrow their scope in accordance with the statutory authorization. The defendants then moved for summary judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rules 12(c) and 56(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c. Their grounds, among others, were that the revised claims added new elements not recited in the original ones; and represented an effort to give the old patent a new scope not previously contemplated and never passed upon in the light of the prior art by the patent office. The District Court found that the disclaimers did import new elements not included in the original claims and held that they rendered the claims invalid, relying upon our decision in Altoona Publix Theatres v. American Tri-Ergon Corp., \n294 \nU.S. 477\n, 55 S.Ct. 455. Accordingly, it entered summary judgment for the defendants. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 2 Cir., 122 F.2d 292.\n As we read the opinion of the court below, it affirms the proposition that where a disclaimer attempts to add a new element to a claim the disclaimer is invalid even though it may also make the revised claim narrower than the original. We granted certiorari, \n314 \nU.S. 604\n, 62 S.Ct. 360, 86 L.Ed. --, because of alleged conflict with decisions on the question in other circuits. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The patent in suit here is for a wall, to be used as a partition between rooms or on the inner side of the walls of the building itself. The necessary parts are a piece \n\n[316 \nU.S. 143, 145]\n\u00a0\n of metal to be fastened to the ceiling; another to be fastened to the floor; upstanding channel iron supports running between the top and bottom members; metal lathing to be fastened by wires to the skeleton wall in order that plastering may be supported.\n The specifications describe and drawings illustrate (1) a top angle iron member with a perforated surface or flange hanging downward so as to fit into slots at the top of the upstanding irons; (2) recesses in the base member providing a snug fit for the bottom part of the upstanding channel irons. The two claims in controversy are printed in the margin. \n2\n As the courts below pointed out, it is these claims, not the specifications, that afford \n\n[316 \nU.S. 143, 146]\n\u00a0\n the measure of the grant to the patentee. \n3\n 'Out of all the possible permutations of elements which can be made from the specifications, he reserves for himself only those contained in the claims.' 122 F.2d 292, 294. The foregoing features appearing in the specifications are not set out in the claims themselves; the claims do not indicate in any way that these features were essential parts of the combination for which the patent was issued. On the contrary, Holdsworth asserted that his specifications in general showed only a 'preferred embodiment' of his invention, and with respect to the ceiling member in particular, stated: 'I do not wish to be limited to an angle iron for completing the top of the metal construction.'\n The disclaimers, however, purported to make these two features essential parts of the claimed combination. One disclaimer substituted for part of one of the original general claims a description of a 'ceiling member (which) comprises a vertical depending perforated flange, one side of which is overlapped by metal lathing'; and the other disclaimer substituted for part of another original general claim a description of a 'base member ... composed of a longitudinal strip having recesses to receive the lower ends of the webs of channel wall supports, the flanges of the channel wall supports overlapping the base members adjacent the recesses.' Limiting ourselves as we must to the original claims to determine the nature of the combination covered by the patent when it was granted, and comparing that combination with the one purportedly embodied by the claims after the disclaimer, we can only conclude that the revised patent includes new elements which were not present in the original. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 143, 147]\n\u00a0\n The petitioner's argument is that the statute authorizes any disclaimer which actually narrows the claim, and that its disclaimer would have the requisite narrowing effect because it would restrict the claims to cover the combination only when the features described in the disclaimers were present.\n But in Altoona Publix Theatres v. American Tri-Ergon Corp., supra, \n294 \nU.S. 489, 490\n, 55 S.Ct. 460, the test which the petitioner argues for here was rejected. Although this Court recognized that an effect of the disclaimer in controversy in the Altoona case was 'in one sense to narrow the claims', it concluded that the disclaimer statute 'does not permit the addition of a new element to the combination previously claimed, whereby the patent originally for one combination is transformed into a new and different one for the new combination.'\n The Holdsworth patent was for a structure composed of a combination of familiar elements. If there was novelty it consisted in the combination. 'A combination is always an entirety. In such cases, the patentee cannot abandon a part and claim the rest, nor can he be permitted to prove that a part is useless, and, therefore, immaterial. He must stand by his claim as he has made it. If more or less than the whole of his ingredients are used by another, such party ... has not used the invention or discovery patented. With the change of the elements the identity of the product disappears.' Schumacher v. Cornell, \n96 \nU.S. 549\n, 554. This Court has explicitly recognized that the disclaimer statute cannot be invoked to justify such a change. Vance v. Campbell, 1 Black 427, 429. And here, as in the Altoona case, the revised claims change the combination set out in the original claims. The disclaimers do more than delete a 'distinct and separable matter ... without mutilating or changing what is left standing'; they change the character of the claimed invention and are therefore unau- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 143, 148]\n\u00a0\n thorized by the disclaimer statute. Hailes v. Albany Stove Co., \n123 \nU.S. 582, 587\n, 8 S.Ct. 262, 265.\n If an alteration of one of the essential elements of a claimed combination were permissible at all it would be under the reissue statute, Rev.Stat.  4916, 35 U.S.C.  64, 35 U.S.C.A.  64, which grants rights only from the date of reissue and after consideration by the patent office. Altoona Publix Theatres v. American Tri-Ergon Corp., supra, \n294 \nU.S. 491\n, 55 S.Ct. 461. To permit such substantial alterations under the disclaimer statute which, where applicable, gives effect to the revised claims from the date of the original issue without any consideration by the patent office would be contrary to the policy of the patent laws. In the words of Mr. Justice Bradley, it would permit 'a man ... by merely filing a paper drawn up by his solicitor, (to) make to himself a new patent.' Hailes v. Albany Stove Co., supra, \n123 \nU.S. 587\n, 8 S.Ct. 265. Cf. Brooks v. Fiske, 15 How. 212, 219. It would also retroactively create possibilities of innocent infringement where no one would reasonably have suspected them to exist.\n The courts below properly decided that the attempted disclaimers here invalidated the claims in controversy. Accordingly, the judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See, e.g., Payne Furnace & Supply Co. v. Williams-Wallace Co., 9 Cir., 117 F.2d 823; Cincinnati Rubber Mfg. Co. v.

G. Cavett, of Memphis, Tenn., for petitioners.\n Messrs. Thomas A. Evans and Larry Creson, both of Memphis, Tenn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The effect of section 6 of the Federal Employers' Liability Act1 on the power of a state court to enjoin its citizens, on the ground of oppressiveness and inequity to the defendant carrier, from suing on a F.E. L.A. claim in the state courts of another state, furthering such a suit in any manner, or receiving the proceeds of any judgment so obtained, is before us for decision.\n The respondent, an Illinois corporation, hereafter referred to as the Illinois Central, brought an original bill in the Chancery Court of Shelby County, Tennessee, seeking to enjoin one of the petitioners here, Mrs. Miles, then the Tennessee administratrix of her husband, a resident of that State, from further prosecuting in a Missouri state court her F.E.L.A. claim against the Illinois Central for the death of her husband, its employee. The fatal accident had occurred at Memphis, Tennessee. After a temporary injunction issued, Mrs. Miles promptly dismissed her Missouri suit and was discharged as administratrix by \n\n[315 \nU.S. 698, 700]\n\u00a0\n the Tennessee probate court. A Missouri administrator was then appointed at her suggestion, and he instituted another Missouri suit for the same casue of action. The Illinois Central filed an amended and supplemental bill, adding decedent's children, likewise residents of Tennessee, as defendants, and enlarging its prayer to forbid furthering the new suit in any manner or receiving the proceeds of any judgment. A new temporary injunction was issued as prayed.\n The grounds for the injunction were the inconvenience and expense to the Illinois Central of taking its Memphis employees to St. Louis and the resulting burden upon interstate commerce. The anticipated extra expense was several hundred dollars per day for an estimated two days of actual trial and whatever additional time might be lost by continuances or delay. Inconvenience was expected through the withdrawal of some twelve to twenty employees and officials from their duties for the same period. The defense relied upon a timely plea that section 6 of the F.E.L.A. prevented the enjoining of proceedings in the Missouri courts.\n The trial court found that the continued prosecution of the pending Missouri case would be 'oppressive and inequitable' to the Illinois Central and 'a burden on the commerce and business of the complainant.' As a matter of law the court concluded, however, that the Illinois Central was not entitled to permanent injunctions. On appeal the Court of Appeals reversed the decree and made the temporary injunctions permanent. Further state review by certiorari in the Supreme Court of Tennessee was refused, and we granted certiorari to the Court of Appeals to settle an important federal question2 as to the ap- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 698, 701]\n\u00a0\n plicability of section 6 of the F.E.L.A. to this situation. \n314 \nU.S. 602\n, 62 S.Ct. 177, 86 L.Ed. --. Cf. Payne v. Knapp, Iowa 737, 198 N.W. 62; Peterson v. Chicago, B. & Q.R. Co., 187 Minn. 228, 244 N.W. 823; Baltimore & O.R. Co. v. Kepner, 137 Ohio St. 409, 30 N.E.2d 982, affirmed \n314 \nU.S. 44\n, 62 S.Ct. 6, 10, 86 L.Ed. --.\n The Kepner case dealt with the power of a state court to enjoin a resident from continued prosecution of a suit under the F.E.L.A. in a distant federal district court on the ground of inequity, vexatiousness and harassment. The decision denied the power to interfere with the privileges of federal venue 'for the benefit of the carrier or the national transportation system.'\n As in the Kepner case, there is in this case no occasion to go into the question of the availability as support for an injunction of a charge of interference with interstate commerce by reason of the burden of expense and inconvenience. The trial court found a burden on the commerce of the Illinois Central but made no finding as to any burden on interstate commerce. Moreover, the Court of Appeals stated that the Illinois Central 'expressly abandoned the contention' 'that the prosecution of the suit in St. Louis was a burden on interstate commerce.' No contention is made here that there is any such burden or that the Illinois Central is not doing substantial business in Missouri, as found by the trial court. It operates daily passenger trains with its own crews into St. Louis over the St. Louis Terminal Company tracks, maintains passenger and freight offices and had total receipts in St. Louis of a million and a half the year the suit was filed. Under the rule announced in Denver & R.G.W.R. Co. v. Terte, \n284 \nU.S. 284, 287\n, 52 S.Ct. 152, 153, the Illinois Central is properly subable in Missouri. In the Kepner case, \n314 \nU.S. 44, 51\n, 62 S.Ct. 6, 9, 86 L.Ed. --, we pointed out, with a discussion of the applicable cases, that the carrier must submit to inconvenience and expense, if there is jurisdiction, 'although thereby interstate commerce is in- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 698, 702]\n\u00a0\n cidentally burdened.' There is no occasion to repeat the comments here. The specific declaration in section 6 that the United States courts should have concurrent jurisdiction with those of the several states and the prohibition against removal point clearly to the conclusion that Congress has exercised its authority over interstate commerce to the extent of permitting suits in state courts, despite the incidental burden, where process may be obtained on a defendant, not merely soliciting business but actually carrying on railroading by operating trains and maintaining traffic offices within the territory of the court's jurisdiction. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The real point of controversy here is whether that portion of section 6 of the F.E.L.A., which holds litigation in the state court where it is instituted, prevents the court of another state from enjoining citizens, within its jurisdiction, from continued prosecution of the suit on grounds of inequity. Here, as in Kepner's case, there is no question but what the Missouri court has venue of the proceeding. Here, too, we need to look no farther into Tennessee law than the opinion of the state's highest court in this record to conclude that under state law a court of equity may enjoin a resident citizen from attempting to enforce his rights, oppressively and inequitably,4 and that the expense and inconvenience hereinbefore set out resulted in oppressiveness and inconvenience in the eye of the state court. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 698, 703]\n\u00a0\n In the legislative history of section 6,5 the provision that removal may not be had from a 'State court of competent jurisdiction' was added to the House bill on the floor of the Senate and later accepted by the House, in order to assure a hearing to the employee in a state court. Words were simultaneously adopted recognizing the jurisdiction of the state courts by providing that the federal jurisdiction should be concurrent. The venue of state court suits was left to the practice of the forum. The opportunity to present causes of action arisng under the F.E.L.A. in the state courts came, however, not from the state law but from the federal. By virtue of the Constitution, the courts of the several states must remain open to such litigants on the same basis that they are open to litigants with causes of action springing from a different source. This is so because the Federal Constitution makes the laws of the United States the supreme law of \n\n[315 \nU.S. 698, 704]\n\u00a0\n the land, binding on every citizen and every court and enforceable wherever jurisdiction is adequate for the purpose. Second Employers' Liability Cases (Mondou v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co.), \n223 \nU.S. 1\n, 56-59, 32 S.Ct. 169, 177, 178, 38 L.R.A.,N.S., 44. The Missouri court here involved must permit this litigation. To deny citizens from other states, suitors under F.E.L.A., access to its courts would, if it permitted access to its own citizens, violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause. Constitution, Art. IV,  2; McKnett v. St. Louis & S.F. Ry. Co., \n292 \nU.S. 230, 233\n, 54 S.Ct. 690, 691.6 Since the existence of the cause of action and the privilege of vindicating rights under the F.E.L.A. in state courts spring from federal law, the right to use in state courts of proper venue where their jurisdiction is adequate is of the same quality as the right of sue in federal courts. It is no more subject to interference by state action than was the federal venue in the Kepner case.\n This is not to say that states cannot control their courts. We do not deal here with the power of Missouri by judicial decision or legislative enactment to regulate the use of its courts generally as was approved in the Douglas or the Chambers cases, note 6 supra. We are considering another state's power to so control its own citizens that they cannot exercise the federal privilege of litigating a federal right in the court of another state. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 698, 705]\n\u00a0\n State courts have assumed the right to enjoin their citizens from proceeding in the courts of other states. This was done, for example, in Reed's Adm'r'x v. Illinois Central R. Co., 182 Ky. 455, 206 S.W. 794. The basis of the decision was the inequity of allowing a suit at a distant point in a state or federal court, 182 Ky. page 464, 206 S.W. 794.7 Reed's case was relied upon by Kern v. Cleveland, C., C.& St. L. Ry., 204 Ind. 595, 185 N.E. 446, for the authority of a state court to enjoin its citizens from inequitable conduct under the F.E.L.A. Other state courts deny their authority to issue such injunctions. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n The permission granted by Congress to sue in state courts may be exercised only where the carrier is found doing business. If suits in federal district courts at those points do not unduly burden interstate commerce, suits in similarly located state courts cannot be burdensome. As Congress has permitted both the state and federal suits, its determination that the carriers must bear the incidental burden is a determination that the state courts may not treat the normal expense and inconvenience of trial in permitted places, such as the one selected here, as inequitable and unconscionable.\n The judgment below is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Court of Appeals of Tennessee for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON, concurring.\n I agree with the conclusion and, with exceptions stated herein, with the opinion of Mr. Justice REED, though I \n\n[315 \nU.S. 698, 706]\n\u00a0\n am not able to sublimate the conflict that underlies this case to the level of either of the conflicting opinions. Realistically considered, the issue is earthy and unprincipled. So viewed, the real issue is whether a plaintiff which a cause of action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U.S.C.A.  51 et seq., may go shopping for a judge or a jury believed to be more favorable than he would find in his home forum. An advantage which it is hoped will be reflected in a judgment is what makes plaintiffs leave home and incur burdens of expense and inconvenience that would be regarded as oppressive if forced upon them. And that is what makes railroads seek injunctions such as this one.\n The judiciary has never a favored this sort of shopping for a forum. It has sought to protect its own good name as well as to protect defendants by injunctions against the practice of seeking out soft spots in the judicial system in which to bring particular kinds of litigation. But the judges with lawyerly indirection have not avowed the interest of the judiciary in orderly resort to the courts as a basis for their decision, and have cast their protective doctrines in terms of sheltering defendants against vexatious and harassing suits. This judicial treatment of the subject of venue leads Congress and the parties to think of the choice of a forum as a private matter between litigants and in cases like the present obscures the public interest in venue practices behind a rather fantastic fiction that a widow is harassing the Illinois Central Railroad. If Congress had left us free to consult the ultimate public interest in orderly resort to the judicial system I should agree with Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER'S conclusion. But the plaintiffs say that they go shopping, not by leave of the courts themselves, but by the authority of Congress. Whether the Congress has granted such latitude is our question.\n Unless there is some hidden meaning in the language Congress has employed, the injured workman or his sur- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 698, 707]\n\u00a0\n viving dependents may choose from the entire territory served by the railroad any place in which to sue, and in which to choose either a federal or a state court of which to ask his remedy. There is nothing which requires a plaintiff to whom such a choice is given to exercise it is an self-denying or large-hearted manner. There is nothing to restrain use of that privilege as all choices of tribunal are commonly used by all plaintiffs to get away from judges who are considered to be unsympathetic and to get before those who are considered more favorable; to get away from juries thought to be smallminded in the matter of verdicts and to get to those thought to be generous; to escape courts whose procedures are burdensome to the plaintiff and to seek out courts whose procedures make the going easy.\n That such a privilege puts a burden on interstate commerce may well be admitted, but Congress has the power to burden. The Federal Employers' Liability Act itself leaves interstate commerce under the burden of a medieval system of compensating the injured railroad worker or his survivors. He is not given a remedy, but only a lawsuit. It is well understood that in most cases he will be unable to pursue that except by splitting his speculative prospects with a lawyer. The functioning of this backward system of dealing with industrial accidents in interstate commerce burdens it with perhaps two dollars of judgment for every dollar that actually reaches those who have been damaged, and it leaves the burden of many injuries to be borne by them utterly uncompensated. Such being the major burden under which the workmen and the industry must function, I see no reason to believe that Congress could not have intended the relatively minor additional burden to interstate commerce from loading the dice a little in favor of the workman in the matter of venue. It seems more probable that Congress intended to give the disadvantaged workman some leverage in \n\n[315 \nU.S. 698, 708]\n\u00a0\n the choice of venue than that it intended to leave him in a position where the railroad could force him to try one lawsuit at home to find out whether he would be allowed to try his principal lawsult elsewhere. This latter would be a frequent result if we upheld the contention made in this case and in the Kepner case. I think, therefore, that the petitioner had a right to resort to the Missouri court under the circumstances of this case for her remedy.\n I do not, however, agree with the statement in Mr. Justice REED'S opinion that 'the Missouri court here involved must permit this litigation.' It is very doubtful if any requirement can be spelled out of the Federal Constitution that a state must furnish a forum for a nonresident plaintiff and a foreign corporation to fight out issues imported from another state where the cause of action arose. It seems unnecessary to decide now whether this litigation could be imposed on the Missouri court, for it appears to have embraced the litigation. Even if Missouri, by reason of its control of its own courts, might refuse to open them to such a case, it does not follow that another state may close Missouri's courts to one with a federal cause of action. If Missouri elects to entertain the case, the courts of no other state can obstruct or prevent its exercise of jurisdiction as conferred by the federal statute or its right to obtain evidence and to distribute the proceeds, if any, in accordance with the Federal Employers' Liability Act. I therefore favor reversal.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, dissenting.\n The decision in this case mutilates principles that have long been regarded as basic in the law. Few legal doctrines have been more universally accepted than those recognizing the powers which this Court now denies to the states when suits under the Federal Employers' Liability Act are brought in state courts: the power of a court to prevent injustice by restraining a person subject to its \n\n[315 \nU.S. 698, 709]\n\u00a0\n authority from maintaining an inequitable suit in the courts of another state, Cole v. Cunningham, \n133 \nU.S. 107\n, 10 S.Ct. 269; the right of a court to decline its facilities to a suit that 'in the interest of justice' should be tried elsewhere, Canada Malting Co. v. Paterson Co., \n285 \nU.S. 413, 422\n, 423 S., 52 S.Ct. 413, 415. The decision disregards the constitutional relationship between the 'judicial power' of the federal government and that of the states whereby state courts enforce federal rights (when such remedies have not been exclusively entrusted to the federal courts) as part of their 'duty to safeguard and enforce the right of every citizen without reference to the particular exercise of governmental power from which the right may have arisen'. Minneapolis & St. Louis R.R. v. Bombolis, \n241 \nU.S. 211, 222\n, 36 S.Ct. 595, 598, L.R.A.1917A, 86, Ann.Cas.1916E, 505.\n For a decision so far-reaching in its implications, warrant is found in the inarticulate radiations of Section 6 of the 1910 amendment to the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U.S.C.A.  56. While the words of a statute do not by themselves distil its meaning, we must at least begin with them. The language of Section 6 is simple and direct. After establishing a two-year period of limitations, it continues: 'Under this Act (chapter) an action may be brought in a district court of the United States, in the district of the residence of the defendant, or in which the cause of action arose, or in which the defendant shall be doing business at the time of commencing such action. The jurisdiction of the courts of the United States under this Act (chapter) shall be concurrent with that of the courts of the several States, and no case arising under this Act ( chapter) and brought in any State court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to any court of the United States.' 36 Stat. 291.\n This is a conventional provision. There is nothing novel or distinctive about it. Recognition of concurrent jurisdiction in the state courts to vindicate federal rights is found in the First Judicaiary Act of 1789. 1 Stat. 73, 77. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 698, 710]\n\u00a0\n And the statute books are replete with instances in which Congress has acknowledged the existence of this jurisdiction in the state courts unless explicitly withheld from them. See the discussion of Mr. Justice Bradley in Claflin v. Houseman, \n93 \nU.S. 130, 139\n, 143 S.. The essence of Section 6 is merely that the state courts are open to a plaintiff suing under the Act and that if he chooses to bring suit in a state court, the defendant may not remove the cause to a federal court. So far as language conveys ideas , the Act affords no intimation that Congress intended anything more.\n We are not of course concerned here, as we were in the Kepner case decided the other day, \n314 \nU.S. 44\n, 62 S.Ct. 6, 10, 86 L.Ed. --, with an attempt by a state court to prevent resort to a federal court. Historically, the problem of interferences, direct or indirect, between federal and state courts is entirely separate from the problem of the relations of the state courts to each other. See Warren, Federal and State Court Interfernece, 43 Harv.L.Rev. 345. The question now before us- relating to the power of a state to enjoin those subject to its jurisdiction from unjustly resorting to the courts of a sister state-is an aspect of the latter problem. In the Kepner case this Court held only that the provision of Section 6 'filled the entire field of venue in federal courts' and that what had thus been legislatively given to the federal courts could not judicially be taken away. The Kepner decision cast no cloud upon Douglas v. New York, New Haven R. Co., \n279 \nU.S. 377\n, 49 S.Ct. 355, which sustained the power of a state to apply the principle of forum non conveniens to suits under the Act brought in its courts by non-residents. The issue in the case at bar is essentially another phase of the problem in the Douglas case-whether, merely by authorizing access to the state courts to enforce rights created by the Federal Employers' Liability Act, Congress impliedly repealed pro tanto the means for \n\n[315 \nU.S. 698, 711]\n\u00a0\n achieving justice which the states customarily employ in similar cases. Specifically, the question for decision is this: Has Congress, by providing explicitly that state courts shall have concurrent jurisdiction of suits under the Act, withdrawn from each state its recognized power to enjoin persons within its jurisdiction from bringing a suit under the Act 'contrary to equity and good conscience' in the courts of another state? This question was wholly outside the scope of the Kepner case. It was not presented, and was therefore not decided, by that case.\n The relevant circumstances here are these. A resident of Tennessee was killed in a railroad accident occurring in Tennessee. The railroad, an Illinois corporation, has its principal offices in Tennessee. All of the witnesses reside in Tennessee, as do the deceased's legal representatives. But suit was brought in a state court of Missouri, where the railroad does some business. Finding that the Missouri suit was 'oppressive and inequitable', the Tennessee Court of Appeals sustained the power of the chancellor to restrain the further prosecution of that suit. The finding that the Missouri suit was 'oppressive and inequitable' was challenged by the petitioners neither before us nor in the courts of Tennessee, and the propriety of the action taken by the Tennessee court, as a matter of equitable discretion, is not here in issue. We are called upon to decide only whether Congress has deprived Tennessee of the power which it has asserted in this case.\n It is admitted that the courts of Tennessee customarily exercise this power in situations like the present case. See American Express Co. v. Fox, 135 Tenn. 489, 187 S.W. 1117, Ann.Cas.1918B, 1148. If the accident here had occurred while the deceased was engaged in intrastate commerce and consequently had not given rise to a right of action under the federal statute, Tennessee would unquestionably have \n\n[315 \nU.S. 698, 712]\n\u00a0\n had the power to do what she has done here. For while the Privileges and Immunities Clause, Art. IV,  2, secures to citizens of other states such right of access to the courts of state as that state gives to its own citizens, Chambers v. Baltimore & Ohio R.R., \n207 \nU.S. 142, 148\n, 28 S.Ct. 34, 35; McKnett v. St. Louis & S.F. Ry. Co., \n292 \nU.S. 230, 233\n, 54 S.Ct. 690, 691, it does not take away from a state its historic power to prevent unjust resort to the courts of another state. Cole v. Cunningham, \n133 \nU.S. 107\n, 10 S.Ct. 269. Moreover, the Constitution would not prevent Missouri from declining to entertain a suit to vindicate a federal right, such as was brought here, if an action to enforce a similar non-federal right would also not lie in her courts. The availability of state courts for the enforcement of federal rights has not resulted in putting federal rights on any different footing from state rights. 'A state may not discriminate against rights arising under federal laws', McKnett v. St. Louis & S.F. Ry. Co., supra, 292 U.S. at page 234, 54 S.Ct. at page 692, but neither the Constitution nor Congress has compelled the states to discriminate in favor of federal rights. And this Court has expressly held that the rights created by the Federal Employers' Liability Act are not different, in this respect, from other federal rights. 'As to the grant of jurisdiction in the Employers' Liability Act that statute does not purport to require State Courts to entertain suits arising under it but only to empower them to do so, so far as the authority of the United States is concerned.' Douglas v. New York, New Haven R. Co., supra, 279 U.S. at page 387, 49 S.Ct. at page 356.\n The utilization of state courts for the vindication of federal rights does not require that their established procedures be remodelled or that their customary modes for administering justice be restricted. 'And it was, of course, presumably an appreciation of the principles so thoroughly settled which caused Congress, in the enactment of the Employers' Liability Act, to clearly contemplate the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 698, 713]\n\u00a0\n existence of a concurrent power and duty of both Federal and state courts to administer the rights conferred by the statute in accordance with the modes of procedure prevailing in such courts.' Minneapolis & St. Louis R.R. v. Bombolis, \n241 \nU.S. 211, 218\n, 36 S.Ct. 595, 597, L.R.A. 1917A, 86, Ann.Cas.1916E, 505; and see Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 56\n, 32 S.Ct. 169, 177, 38 L.R.A.,N.S., 44. The mere fact that a federal right is the basis of suit cannot therefore deprive the state courts of the power to use their customary procedures for the achievement of justice. In simply taking advantage of the facilities afforded by the courts of the states, Congress cannot be deemed to have altered the settled jurisprudence of the states so as to operate more favorably for federal rights than for similar rights created by the states themselves. Such drastic inroads upon the authority of the states should be made only upon clear Congressional mandate.\n The Court finds such a plain command in the Act because Congress has explicitly provided in Section 6 that the jurisdiction of the state courts 'shall be concurrent' with that of the federal courts. But Congress thereby merely spelt out what has always been unquestioned constitutional doctrine. 'It is a general rule that the grant of jurisdiction to one court does not, of itself, imply that the jurisdiction is to be exclusive . ... Upon the state courts, equally with the courts of the Union, rests the obligation to guard and enforce every right secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States whenever those rights are involved in any suit or proceedings before them.' United States v. Bank of New York Co., \n296 \nU.S. 463, 479\n, 56 S.Ct. 343, 348; see Claflin v. Houseman, \n93 \nU.S. 130, 136\n, 137 S.; Robb v. Connolly, \n111 \nU.S. 624, 635\n, 637 S., 4 S.Ct. 544, 549-551. And in Grubb v. Public Utilities Commission, \n281 \nU.S. 470, 476\n, 50 S.Ct. 374, 377, the Court reaffirmed the doctrine that 'the state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction of suits of a civil nature arising under the Constitution and laws of the United \n\n[315 \nU.S. 698, 714]\n\u00a0\n States, save in exceptional instances where the jurisdiction has been restricted by Congress to the federal courts'. The source of these formulations is Hamilton's classic statement in No. 82 of the Federalist ( sesquicentennial ed., p. 536): 'I hold that the State courts will be divested of no part of their primitive jurisdiction, further than may relate to an appeal; and I am even of opinion that in every case in which they were not expressly excluded by the future acts of the national legislature, they will of course take cognizance of the causes to which those acts may give birth. This I infer from the nature of judiciary power, and from the general genius of the system. The judiciary power of every government looks beyond its own local or municipal laws, and in civil cases lays hold of all subjects of litigation between parties within its jurisdiction, though the causes of dispute are relative to the laws of the most distant part of the globe. ... When in addition to this we consider the State governments and the national governments, as they truly are, in the light of kindred systems, and as parts of one whole, the inference seems to be conclusive, that the State courts would have a concurrent jurisdiction in all cases arising under the laws of the Union, where it was not expressly prohibited.'\n Therefore, if Congress had been silent with respect to the jurisdiction of state courts of suits arising under the Act, the state courts would still have had such jurisdiction. If it be suggested that by articulating what would otherwise have been implied, Congress must have had some purpose, some interest of emphasis, it would be enough to say that such punctiliousness, and perhaps redundancy, of phrasing is not uncommon in procedural legislation. But, in any event, the legislative history of the 1910 amendment conclusively shows that Congress did not insert this \n\n[315 \nU.S. 698, 715]\n\u00a0\n provision in order to cut down the normal powers of state courts. The concurrent jurisdiction of the state courts was explicitly defined in order to dissipate an unwarranted doubt as to the right and duty of state courts to entertain suits arising under the Act. Congress wanted to avoid an implication of denial to the state courts of power to entertain cases under the Act, and not to create an implication of denial to the state courts of their traditional powers in dealing with such cases.\n The Act of 1908 contained no provision specifically dealing with venue. 35 Stat. 65. On January 7, 1910, Representative Sterling introduced a bill, H.R. 17263, that eventually became the 1910 amendment to the Act. The bill had this provision: 'This Act shall not be construed as excluding the exercise of a concurrent jurisdiction of cases arising under the Act by the courts of the several States.' The House Committee on the Judiciary reporting on the bill explained its purpose:\n'It is proposed to further amend the act by making the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States 'concurrent with the courts of the several States.'\n\n'This is proposed in order that there shall be no excuse for courts of the States to follow in the error of Hoxie v. N.Y., N.H. & H.R.R. Co. ( 82 Conn. 352) (73 A. 754) (17 Ann.Cas. 324) in which the court declined jurisdiction upon the ground, inter alia, that Congress did not intend that jurisdiction of cases arising under the act should be assumed by state courts.\n\n'It is clear under the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, that this conclusion of the Connecticut court is erroneous. And the reasons recited by the Connecticut court lead to an opposite conclusion from that which the opinion declares upon the subject. But no harm can come, and much injustice and wrong to suitors may be prevented by an express declaration that \n\n[315 \nU.S. 698, 716]\n\u00a0\n there is no intent on the part of Congress to confine remedial actions brought under the employers' liability act to the courts of the United States.' H.Rep.No.513, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 7.\n\n The Committee also recommended that the wording of the provision be changed to read as follows: 'The jurisdiction of the courts of the United States under this act (chapter) shall be concurrent with that of the courts of the several States'. This language was embodied in the Act.\n When the bill came to the floor of the House, Representative Sterling, who was in charge of the measure underscored the sole reason for the provision: 'The second change in the law provides that the federal courts and the state courts shall have concurrent jurisdiction. I am very sure that they have concurrent jurisdiction as the law is now, but on account of a decision of one of the state courts of Connecticut, where one judge declined to take jurisdiction in a case because it was under a federal statute, the committee thought best to expressly provide in the law that the federal courts and the state courts should have concurrent jurisdiction to avoid the possibility of such a construction in the future.' 45 Cong.Rec. 2253.\n In reply to a question as to the Committee's purpose in recommending this provision, 'Did you intend to limit the state courts in any way in this matter?' the answer was, 'Oh, no; just the contrary.' 45 Cong.Rec. 2254.\n With these authoritative explanations the bill was passed by the House on February 23, 1910. 45 Cong.Rec. 2260. It was then sent to the Senate and there referred to its Judiciary Committee. The report of that Committee repeated in haec verba the explanation of the provision made by the House Committee. See Sen.Rep.No.432, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 5. Senator Borah, who steered the bill in the Senate, said: \n\n[315 \nU.S. 698, 717]\n\u00a0\n 'The amendment which has been proposed in the latter portion of section 6 was necessitated, if that term can properly be used, by reason of a decision of the supreme court of the State of Connecticut. My individual view is that the law is now as the amendment attempts to make it-that is to say, that both the federal and state courts have jurisdiction of this matter-concurrent jurisdiction. ... As I understand the law, unless there is a clause prohibiting or inhibiting the state court it always has concurrent jurisdiction with the federal courts in such a subject-matter as this. The report cites a number of authorities to this effect. But the supreme court of Connecticut refused to assume jurisdiction or to take jurisdiction of the matter, though the well- established legal principle seems to be absolutely different. I do not believe this amendment is necessary. I believe it is thoroughly established that the federal courts and the state courts have concurrent jurisdiction. But in order to avoid courts being misled upon this proposition this specific provision is thought to be necessary in the law.' 45 Cong.Rec. 3995. See also his remarks at 45 Cong.Rec. 4034, 4035.\n The Court appears to draw comfort from the provision of the Act prohibiting removal of a suit from a state court of competent jurisdiction to a federal court. The bill as passed by the House contained no such provision. It was offered as an amendment on the floor of the Senate by Senator Paynter who, in proposing the amendment, made a few remarks that are unenlightening for present purposes. The amendment was approved by the Senate without further discussion. 45 Cong.Rec. 4093. When the bill came back to the House, Representative Clayton, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, explained the purpose of this amendment:\n'The real amendment (made by the Senate) and the one that I think is a distinct improvement of the bill, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 698, 718]\n\u00a0\n certainly more so than the other two, is to add ... these words: 'And no case arising under this act and brought in any state court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to any court of the United States.' And the gentleman, being, as I am, a states-rights Democrat, will certainly say that is a decided improvement upon the bill as it originally passed the House. Furthermore, I say that this amendment will tend to relieve the federal courts of some litigation which can be as well, if not better, determined in the courts of the States.' 45 Cong.Rec. 4158.\n\n Such a restriction against removal of litigation normally arising in the state courts is not unique in the history of legislation dealing with the business of the lower federal courts. Thirty years earlier Congress had begun to limit the right of removal to the federal courts. See, e.g., Act of July 12, 1882,  4, 22 Stat. 162, 163; Act of March 3, 1887, 24 Stat. 552, corrected by Act of August 13, 1888, 25 Stat. 433, 28 U.S.C.A.  71 note. The removal prohibition of the 1910 Act must be regarded as a phase of the movement to ease the pressure upon the lower federal courts by curtailing access to them rather than by multiplying unduly the number of federal judges. Nothing warrants the inference that thereby Congress intended a reversal of the historic relation of state courts to one another.\n That no expression of Congress, nor the purposes revealed by it outside of the language it employed, calls for a break with the past in giving effect to the 1910 amendment was the conclusion reached by this Court upon the fullest consideration of the significance of the provision. 'The amendment, as appears by its language,' it was held in the Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 56\n, 32 S.Ct. 169, 178, 38 L.R.A.,N.S., 44, 'instead of granting jurisdiction to the state courts, presupposes that they already possessed it.' Later, in the Douglas case, the Court noted that the amendment 'does not purport to require State Courts to entertain suits arising under it but only to empower them to do so, so far \n\n[315 \nU.S. 698, 719]\n\u00a0\n as the authority of the United States is concerned.' 279 U.S. at page 387, 49 S.Ct. at page 356. And again in McKnett's case, 292 U.S. at page 233, 54 S.Ct. at page 692, the Court emphasized that 'Congress has not attempted to compel states to provide courts for the enforcement of the Federal Employers' Liability Act'. In short, every time the question has arisen this Court has recognized that by the 1910 amendment Congress did not write a new chapter in judicial history nor did it modify the historic function of state courts as agencies for the enforcement of federal rights employing the same instruments for achieving justice as they employ when enforcing rights having their source in state law.\n The Court now holds that, where considerations of equity and justice are otherwise compelling, Section 6 has deprived the state courts of the power to enjoin a plaintiff from pursuing a suit against a carrier in the courts of any state in which the carrier does business. But a series of decisions following Davis v. Farmers' Co-operative Co., \n262 \nU.S. 312\n, 43 S. Ct. 556, enforces a contrary proposition. In these cases, notably Denver & R.G.W.R. Co. v. Terte, \n284 \nU.S. 284\n, 52 S.Ct. 152, and Michigan Central R. Co. v. Mix, \n278 \nU.S. 492\n, 49 S.Ct. 207, suits against a carrier in a state where it did business were nevertheless found to constitute an unjustifiable burden on commerce and therefore could not be maintained. If Congress had conferred obligatory jurisdiction upon the state courts, it would have been entirely beyond the province of this Court to hold, as it did in these decisions, that a suit in a state court which was given 'concurrent jurisdiction' by the 1910 amendment constituted a burden on commerce. To suggest that the grant of 'concurrent jurisdiction' repealed the historic powers of equity sanctioned by Cole v. Cunningham, \n133 \nU.S. 107\n, 10 S.Ct. 269, is to imply that in all these cases the Court disregarded what is now found to be the right of a plaintiff to resort to a state court, unhampered by the authority of the state courts to invoke their familiar equtable powers to restrain oppressive and \n\n[315 \nU.S. 698, 720]\n\u00a0\n vexatious suits in other state courts. This is to say that in all these cases over a period of years this Court disregarded the jurisdictional requirements of the Federal Employers' Liability Act. Yet the Act was constantly before the Court, and, it may not be amiss to recall, no member of this Court, in modern times at least, was more familiar with and more mindful of jurisdictional requirements than Mr. Justice Brandeis, who spoke for a unanimous Court in both the Davis and Mix cases.\n The Court does not now overrule these decisions. They stand as unchallenged authorities that in giving the state courts concurrent jurisdiction of suits under the Act Congress did not thereby preclude the application of principles of equity and justice to such suits. These decisions show clearly that Section 6 did not give the state courts compulsive jurisdiction; it merely conferred authority to be administered in the context of existing law.\n The power invoked by Tennessee in this case was a familiar head of equity jurisdiction long before the Constitution. Injunctions by the chancellor against suits in other courts go back to at least the late sixteenth century. See Cliffe v. Turnor, Cary 83 (1579); Chock v. Chea, Cary 83 (1579); Tanfield v. Davenport, Tot. 114 (1638); Trinick v. Bordfield, Tot. 117 (1638). When Lord Chancellor Clarendon in 1677 refused to enjoin a foreign attachment, Love v. Baker, Ch.Cas. 67, the reporter noted that 'all the bar was of another opinion. It was said, the injunction did not lie for foreign jurisdictions, nor out of the king's dominions. But to that it was answered, the injunction was not to the court, but to the party.' The opinion of the bar soon became the accepted law of England. In the leading case of Lord Portarlington v. Soulby, 3 Myl .& K. 104, Brougham, L.C., expressed the historic doctrine of equity jurisdiction. Referring to the attitude of the bar towards Love v. Baker, he commented: 'A very sound answer, as it appears to me; for the same argument might \n\n[315 \nU.S. 698, 721]\n\u00a0\n apply to a Court within this country, which no order of this Court ever affects to bind, our orders being only pointed at the parties to restrain them from proceeding. Accordingly this case of Love v. Baker has not been recognized or followed in later times.' 3 Myl. & K. at 107. See Wharton v. May, 5 Ves.Jr. 27; Kennedy v. Earl of Casillis, 2 Swans. 313; Harrison v. Gurney, 2 Jac. & W. 563; Bushby v. Munday, 5 Madd. 184; Beauchamp v. Marquis of Huntley, Jac. 546; Eden on Injunctions (1822 Ed.) p. 3 et seq., 101, 102.\n This doctrine of equitable power has been universally accepted by American courts. See, e.g., Dehon v. Foster, 4 Allen, Mass., 545, 550; Cole v. Young, 24 Kan. 435, 438; Bigelow v. Old Dominion Co., 74 N.J.Eq. 457, 473, 71 A. 153. And the power has been exercised by the state courts generally to enjoin oppressive suits brought under the Act in other state courts. See Reed's Adm'x v. Illinois Central R. Co., 182 Ky. 455, 206 S.W. 794; Chicago, M. & St. P.R. Co. v. McGinley, 175 Wis. 565, 185 N.W. 218; State ex rel. New York, C. & St. L.R. Co. v. Nortoni, 331 Mo. 764, 55 S.W. 2d 272, 85 A.L.R. 1345; Kern v. Cleveland, C., C. & St. L.R. Co., 204 Ind. 595, 185 N.E. 446. Of course, since a federal right is involved, no state court can screen denial of or discrimination against a federal right, under the guise of enforcing its local law. Davis v.

See \n317 \nU.S. 713\n, 63 S.Ct. 438, 87 L.Ed. --. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 192, 193]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Howard C. Westwood, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Archibald Cox, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents important questions in respect of criminal proceedings against poor persons in federal courts. For this reason we granted certiorari.\n The petitioner was indicted, tried, and convicted in the United States District Court for Western Arkansas for kidnapping in violation of Title 18 U.S. Code  408a, 18 U.S.C.A.  408a. As he was without funds to conduct his defense, the court appointed counsel for him. The person charged to have \n\n[317 \nU.S. 192, 194]\n\u00a0\n been kidnapped was the illegitimate daughter of petitioner's wife.\n Two defenses were presented. The first was that the petitioner came within the exception stated in the statute, that it shall not apply to a kidnapping 'in the case of a minor, by a parent thereof'. To sustain this defense petitioner offered evidence to prove that the girl was a minor and that, having married her mother, he stood in the relation of a parent to her. The second defense was that the petitioner had neither taken nor detained the young woman against her will. The District Judge ruled against the petitioner's contention that he was a parent within the intendment of the statute, but sent the case to the jury on the question whether he had apprehended or detained his wife's daughter against her will. The jury rendered a verdict of guilty. Judgment of sentence was entered.\n In due time petitioner's counsel filed notice of appeal in which, amongst others, reasons advanced were that the court erred in refusing peremptory instructions for acquittal at the conclusion of the Government's case and at the conclusion of all the evidence; that the verdict of the jury was contrary to the weight of the evidence, and that the court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that if they found the complaining witness was under the age of eighteen years at the time of the kidnapping they must find the petitioner not guilty.\n The District Court entered an order permitting the petitioner to appeal in forma pauperis and the Circuit Court of Appeals also permitted the prosecution of the proceedings in that court in forma pauperis.\n In connection with the appeal, errors were specifically assigned to the ruling of the District Court respecting the status of the petitioner as a parent, but no error was so assigned to the action of the court in submitting the fact questions respecting the alleged apprehension and detention of the complaining witness, although the assignments \n\n[317 \nU.S. 192, 195]\n\u00a0\n of error concluded with a prayer for a reversal for 'other manifest errors in the record and proceedings'. The Bill of Exceptions allowed by the District Court set forth only so much of the proceedings as went to the question of petitioner's asserted parenthood of the alleged minor. It also included the proceedings on motions for directed verdict and the action of the court upon those motions but none of the evidence on which the motions were based.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment and, in so doing, dealt only with the question of the petitioner's parenthood. \n1\n At the close of its opinion it stated: 'No other question having been raised on this appeal, it follows that the judgment must be and is affirmed.'\n The petitioner entered upon service of his sentence and, being without counsel, personally forwarded to the Circuit Court of Appeals a petition for the appointment of counsel and a petition for rehearing. In the latter he urged that there was no testimony in the record indicating that he took or detained his wife's daughter against her will, and prayed that the Circuit Court of Appeals issue a writ of certiorari to bring up a complete transcript of the testimony taken at his trial. In a per curiam opinion,2 the court stated that it had decided the only question before it, but ordered that the United States Attorney answer the petition so that it might be ascertained whether a Bill of Exceptions could be prepared to raise the questions which the petitioner desired to have decided. The prosecuting officer answered alleging that the entire testimony in the case had been taken stenographically by the district judge's secretary, whose notes were available and could be transcribed. The answer further set forth that the judge's secretary had important duties to perform; that the testimony which he took stenographically was of large volume; that its transcription would involve labor \n\n[317 \nU.S. 192, 196]\n\u00a0\n for which he ought to be paid; and that the Government could not be required to pay for a transcript of the evidence or to furnish such a transcript to the defendant.\n To this answer the petitioner filed a response in which, amongst other things, he alleged that he had repeatedly urged his attorney to present to the Circuit Court of Appeals the question of the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his conviction and that his attorney had invariably replied that this could not be done without obtaining a transcript of the evidence so as to make a proper Bill of Exceptions covering the subject; that the attorney further advised him that a transcript of the testimony could not be procured because the petitioner had no funds to pay for its preparation. It stands admitted on the record that these are the facts.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, in a third opinion,3 stated that it had requested a response to the petition for rehearing in order to ascertain whether the Government, as in Holmes v. United States, \n314 \nU.S. 583\n, 62 S. Ct. 357, would consent to the vacation of the judgment so that a proper record might be made as the basis for consideration of the question urged by the petitioner. The court stated that, in view of the Government's opposition to a vacation of the judgment or a reopening of the case, it felt itself without power to act further in the matter and indicated that if the petitioner desired to bring the cause to this court such facilities should be furnished him as were necessary to that end without the obligation to pay fees or costs.\n The petitioner presented to this Court a petition for certiorari and a petition for leave to proceed in forma pauperis. We granted the writ and gave leave to proceed in forma pauperis. \n316 \nU.S. 658\n, 62 S.Ct. 1307. As he was without counsel we appointed counsel to act for him in this Court. 63 S.Ct. 70, 87 L.Ed. --. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 192, 197]\n\u00a0\n 1. There is no law of the United States creating the position of official court stenographer and none requiring the stenographic report of any case, civil or criminal, and there is none providing for payment for the services of a stenographer in reporting judicial proceedings. The practice has been for the parties to agree that a designated person shall so report. The one selected must be paid by private arrangement with one or more of the parties to the litigation. The amount paid to him is not costs in the cause nor taxable as such against any of the parties.\n\n 2. \nAt the instance of the Conference of Senior Circuit Judges, legislation has been introduced in Congress to provide an official system of reporting and to defray the cost of it. That legislation, as we understand, will, if adopted, obviate the difficulties presented in this case. As the matter stands, however, it is clear that the judge's secretary who stenographically reported the trial is not an officer of the United States in his capacity as reporter, is not entitled to fees from the United States for his services, and his compensation cannot be treated as costs. The Act of July 20, 1892, as amended,4 applies only to court costs, permits the taking of an appeal without prepayment of cost of printing the record in the appellate court, and provides in certain cases for the printing of that record at Government expense. It does not authorize the procurement of a transcript of the testimony nor the payment for services in reporting evidence taken at the trial nor for the obtaining of it by the Government in behalf of an indigent defendant.\n\n 3. \nIt is urged by the petitioner that the District Court has inherent power, in the interests of justice, to order preparation of a transcript for the petitioner's use in making up a bill of exceptions and to impose the expense of so \n\n[317 \nU.S. 192, 198]\n\u00a0\n doing upon the Government. The respondent points out that the Comptroller General has ruled that there is no appropriation from which such expense may be paid5 and, whether he is or is not right, it remains that no appropriation is available without authorization of payment by the Attorney General. That officer appears unwilling to test the matter by making such authorization. We need not stop to consider these opposing views because of the facts developed in the briefs and in argument.\n\n 4. \nAs we have said, the trial judge's secretary took stenographic notes of the entire testimony and his notes are available. It was stated at the bar that this gentleman stands ready to read his notes into a dictaphone without charge to the petitioner. In the light of these facts it would seem that it is possible to prepare an adequate bill of exceptions fairly reflecting the purport of the testimony.\n It has become the usual, because the more convenient, method to prepare a bill of exceptions by the use of a stenographic transcript of the evidence. Even so, the bill ought not to contain all of the evidence but only that which is relevant to the issues made upon the appeal and often it is expedient and satisfactory to summarize the evidence and transmute it into narrative form. Historically a bill of exceptions does not embody a verbatim transcript of the evidence but, on the contrary, a statement with respect to the evidence adequate to present the contentions made in the appellate court. Such a bill may be prepared from notes kept by counsel, from the judge's notes, from the recollection of witnesses as to what occurred at the trial, and, in short, from any and all sources which will contribute to a veracious account of the trial judge's action and the basis on which his ruling was invoked. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 192, 199]\n\u00a0\n Counsel in this case could, therefore, have prepared and presented to the trial judge, as was his duty, a bill of exceptions so prepared, and it would then have become the duty of the trial judge to approve it, if accurate, or, if not, to assist in making it accurately reflect the trial proceedings. We are unwilling to hold that the petitioner is foreclosed from obtaining a bill in the circumstances of this case. Petitioner repeatedly insisted that counsel procure a proper record on appeal to present the question of the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his conviction. The petitioner did everything that lay within his power to obtain such a proper record, and we think he should not be penalized for the failure of his appointed counsel to take the necessary measures, if the power exists to afford him a hearing on the point he deems material.\n\n 5. \nWe are of opinion that the Circuit Court of Appeals had power in the circumstances to remand the cause for the settlement of a proper bill of exceptions. Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeals' Rules6 provides that, after the filing of the notice of appeal, the appellate court shall have supervision of the proceedings on appeal including the proceedings relating to the preparation of the record on appeal, and that it may entertain a motion for directions to the trial court. This power extends to the procurement of a proper bill of exceptions7 and ought to be liberally exercised where the contention is that the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n We think the right course in this instance is to remand the cause to the Circuit Court of Appeals in order that it may enter an order permitting the settlement of a bill \n\n[317 \nU.S. 192, 200]\n\u00a0\n of exceptions in the District Court to present the point urged by petitioner. Upon the entry of such an order it will be the duty of counsel for petitioner to present a bill made up from the best sources available. It will then become the duty of the district judge to assist in amplifying, correcting, and perfecting this bill from such sources, and to settle the same in order to present the evidence given at the trial. From such a bill the Circuit Court of Appeals will no doubt be able to decide whether there was evidence to sustain petitioner's conviction. So ordered.\n Remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 8 Cir., 123 F.2d 715, 718. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 8 Cir., 124 F.2d 849. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 8 Cir., 126 F.2d 462. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 28 U.S.C.  832, 28 U.S.C.A.  832. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] 9 Comp.Gen. 503; cf. 21 Comp.Gen. 347. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] 18 U.S.C.A. following section 688. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] Ray v.

KRESGE CO.(1942)\nNo. 649\nArgued: April 1, 1942Decided: May 4, 1942\n\n\n\n Mr. George L. Wilkinson, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. William B. Giles, of Detroit, Mich., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner, which manufactures and sells shoes and rubber heels, employs a trade-mark, registered under the Trade-Mark Act of 1905, 33 Stat. 724, 15 U.S.C.  81 et seq., 15 U.S.C.A.  81 et seq., consisting of a red circular plug embedded in the center of a heel. The heels were not sold separately but were attached to shoes made by the petitioner. It has spent considerable sums of money in seeking to gain the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 203, 204]\n\u00a0\n favor of the consuming public by promoting the mark as assurance of a desirable product. The respondent sold heels not made by the petitioner but bearing a mark described by the District Court as 'a circular plug of red or reddish color so closely resembling that of the plaintiff ( petitioner) that it is difficult to distinguish the products sold by the defendant from the plaintiff's products.' The heels sold by the respondent were inferior in quality to those made by the petitioner, and 'this tended to destroy the good will created by the plaintiff in the manufacture of its superior product.' Although there was no evidence that particular purchasers were actually deceived into believing that the heels sold by the respondent were manufactured by the petitioner, the District Court found that there was a 'reasonable likelihood' that some purchases might have been induced by the purchaser's belief that he was obtaining the petitioner's product. 'The ordinary purchaser having become familiar with the plaintiff's trade-mark, would naturally be led to believe that the heels marketed by the defendant were the product of the plaintiff company.' Concluding that the petitioner's mark had thus been infringed, the Court enjoined future infringement and also ordered that the respondent account to the petitioner for profits made from sales 'to purchasers who were induced to buy because they believed the heels to be those of plaintiff and which sales plaintiff would otherwise have made.'\n Complaining of this criterion for determining the profits that improperly accrued to the respondent by reason of the infringement, the petitioner appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which affirmed the decree. 119 F.2d 316. Deeming the matter to present an important question under the Trade-Mark Act, we brought the case here, \n314 \nU.S. 603\n, 62 S.Ct. 183, 86 L.Ed. --, solely to review the provisions of the decree dealing with the measure of profits and \n\n[316 \nU.S. 203, 205]\n\u00a0\n damages for the infringement found by the two lower courts. Whether there was such an infringement as to entitle the petitioner to the remedies provided by the federal trade-mark laws is therefore not open here.\n The protection of trade-marks is the law's recognition of the psychological function of symbols. If it is true that we live by symbols, it is no less true that we purchase goods by them. A trade-mark is a merchandising short-cut which induces a purchaser to select what he wants, or what he has been led to believe he wants. The owner of a mark exploits this human propensity by making every effort to impregnate the atmosphere of the market with the drawing power of a congenial symbol. Whatever the means employed, the aim is the same-to convey through the mark, in the minds of potential customers, the desirability of the commodity upon which it appears. Once this is attained, the trade-mark owner has something of value. If another poaches upon the commercial magnetism of the symbol he has created, the owner can obtain legal redress. And in this case we are called upon to ascertain the extent of the redress afforded for infringement of a mark registered under the Trade-Mark Act of 1905\n\n\n The 'right to be protected against an unwarranted use of the registered mark has been made a statutory right' by that Act. Thaddeus Davis Co. v. Davids, \n233 \nU.S. 461, 471\n, 34 S.Ct. 648, 652. Section 19 of the Act provides that 'upon a decree being rendered in any such case for wrongful use of a trade-mark the complainant shall be entitled to recover, in addition to the profits to be accounted for by the defendant, the damages the complainant has sustained thereby, and the court shall assess the same or cause the same to be assessed under its direction ...; and in assessing profits the plaintiff shall be required to prove defendant's sales only; defendant must \n\n[316 \nU.S. 203, 206]\n\u00a0\n prove all elements of cost which are claimed.' \n1\n 33 Stat. 724, 729; 15 U.S. C.  99, 15 U.S.C.A.  99. Infringement and damage having been found, the Act requires the trade-mark owner to prove only the sales of articles bearing the infringing mark. Although the award of profits is designed to make the plaintiff whole for losses which the infringer has caused by taking what did not belong to him, Congress did not put upon the despoiled the burden-as often as not impossible to sustain-of showing that but for the defendant's unlawful use of the mark, particular customers would have purchased the plaintiff's goods.\n If it can be shown that the infringement had no relation to profits made by the defendant, that some purchasers bought goods bearing the infringing mark because of the defendant's recommendation or his reputation or for any reason other than a response to the diffused appeal of the plaintiff's symbol, the burden of showing this is upon the poacher. The plaintiff of course is not entitled to profits demonstrably not attributable to the unlawful use of his mark. Cf. Straus v. Notaseme Hosiery Co., \n240 \nU.S. 179, 183\n, 36 S.Ct. 288, 289; compare Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corp., \n309 \nU.S. 390\n, 60 S.Ct. 681; Westinghouse Electric & Mfg. Co. v. Wagner Electric & Mfg. Co., \n225 \nU.S. 604\n, 32 S.Ct. 691, 41 L.R.A., N.S., 653. The burden is the infringer's to prove that \n\n[316 \nU.S. 203, 207]\n\u00a0\n his infringement had no cash value in sales made by him. If he does not do so, the profits made on sales of goods bearing the infringing mark properly belong to the owner of the mark. Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co. v. Wolf Bros. & Co., \n240 \nU.S. 251\n, 36 S.Ct. 269. There may well be a windfall to the trade-mark owner where it is impossible to isolate the profits which are attributable to the use of the infringing mark. But to hold otherwise would give the windfall to the wrongdoer. In the absence of his proving the contrary, it promotes honesty and comports with experience to assume that the wrongdoer who makes profits from the sales of goods bearing a mark belonging to another was enabled to do so because he was drawing upon the good will generated by that mark. And one who makes profits derived from the unlawful appropriation of a mark belonging to another cannot relieve himself of his obligation to restore the profits to their rightful owner merely by showing that the latter did not choose to use the mark in the particular manner employed by the wrongdoer.\n The starting point of the case before us is respondent's infringement of the petitioner's trade-mark in violation of the federal Act. The decree is assailed by the petitioner because, upon its reading of the decree, it is awarded only those profits which it can affirmatively prove to have resulted from sales 'to purchasers who were induced to buy because they believed the heels to be those of plaintiff, and which sales plaintiff would otherwise have made.' We are not prepared to say that such is not a sensible reading of the language in which the decree was cast, the purpose of which was to recover profits that came to the respondent through its infringement and that in good conscience belong to the petitioner. The decree in effect requires the petitioner to prove by a procession of witnesses that when they bought heels from the infringer they had a clear, well-focussed consciousness that they were buying the petitioner's heels and that otherwise they \n\n[316 \nU.S. 203, 208]\n\u00a0\n would not have bought them. But the shoe is on the other foot. The creation of a market through an established symbol implies that people float on a psychological current engendered by the various advertising devices which give a trade-mark its potency. It is that which the Trade- Mark Act of 1905 protects. We therefore vacate the decree in order that the cause be remanded to the District Court for the entry of a decree in conformity with this opinion. If the petitioner suffered damages beyond the loss of profits the decree should provide for the assessment of such damages.\nREVERSED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MURPHY concur.\n Mishawaka does not sell detached rubber heels. The heels bearing its mark are attached to the rubber boots and shoes it manufactures, and reach the market only as parts of these larger products. Kresge, on the other hand, sells in its retail stores detached rubber heels manufactured by others. Hence, like the courts below, I find it difficult to conclude that there were substantial probabilities of deception and that Kresge's sales took away business that might otherwise have gone to Mishawaka. In any event, the economic rivalry, if it existed at all, was so remote and indirect that an injunction alone would seem to have afforded ample relief against the infringement, found by both courts below to have been without fraudulent intent.\n Moreover, upon the extensive evidence introduced by both parties, the trial court concluded that there was 'no direct proof of any ordinary purchaser being misled into believing that heels marketed by the defendant were prod- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 203, 209]\n\u00a0\n ucts of the plaintiff company.' The Circuit Court of Appeals reached a similar conclusion: 'No justification is found in the record for an inference that any one appears to have been deceived by appellee's trade- mark into purchasing its shoe heels and lifts in the belief that he was purchasing shoe heels produced by appellant.' 119 F.2d 316, 324.\n If the respondent had wilfully palmed off the heels it sold as products of the petitioner, and if it had been shown that the petitioner had suffered any injury, I should agree to a decision resolving doubts about the measure of damages in favor of the petitioner. But under the circumstances of this case, I believe the effect of the decision handed down is to grant a windfall to the petitioner and to impose a penalty upon the respondent, neither of which is deserved. Finding nothing in the Trade- Mark Act of 1905 which compels such a result, I can see no abuse of discretion in the decree of the trial court which the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. Saxlehner v.

This section corresponds in terms with section 4921 of the Revised Statutes, 35 U.S.C.A.  70, relating to patent cases, except that it specially provides the manner in which profits shall be ascertained. Under existing rules it is necessary for the complainant to prove sales and costs with entire and absolute accuracy. The only persons having knowledge of making the sales are the defendant or some one in his employ. It has seemed, therefore, only fair and just that if the complainant proves the sales, the defendant should be required to produce evidence of the expenses he was put to in making such sales as an offset against the sales proven by the complainant.'

Mehlhope, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Estill E. Ezell and Lawrence C. Kingsland, both of St. Louis, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent brought this suit in the district court for an injunction and an accounting for infringement of its Patent No. 2,060,645, of November 10, 1936, on a machine for depositing salt tablets, a device said to be useful in the canning industry for adding predetermined amounts of salt in tablet form to the contents of the cans.\n Upon petitioner's motion, pursuant to Rule 56 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, the trial court, without passing \n\n[314 \nU.S. 488, 490]\n\u00a0\n on the issues of validity and infringement, granted summary judgment dismissing the complaint. It took the ground that respondent was making use of the patent to restrain the sale of salt tablets in competition with its own sale of unpatented tablets, by requiring licensees to use with the patented machines only tablets sold by respondent. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, 117 F.2d 968, because it thought that respondent's use of the patent was not shown to violate  3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.  14, 15 U.S.C.A.  14, as it did not appear that the use of its patent substantially lessened competition or tended to create a monopoly in salt tablets. We granted certiorari \n313 \nU.S. 555\n, 61 S.Ct. 1098, because of the public importance of the question presented and of an alleged conflict of the decision below with B. B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis, 1 Cir., 117 F.2d 829, and with the principles underlying the decisions in Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Development Corp., \n283 \nU.S. 27\n, 51 S.Ct. 334, and Leitch Mfg. Co. v. Barber Co., \n302 \nU.S. 458\n, 58 S.Ct. 288.\n The Clayton Act authorizes those injured by violations tending to monopoly to maintain suit for treble damages and for an injunction in appropriate cases. 15 U.S.C.  1, 2, 14, 15, 26, 15 U.S.C.A.  1, 2, 14, 15, 26. But the present suit is for infringement of a patent. The question we must decide is not necessarily whether respondent has violated the Clayton Act, but whether a court of equity will lend its aid to protect the patent monopoly when respondent is using it as the effective means of restraining competition with its sale of an unpatented article.\n Both respondent's wholly owned subsidiary and the petitioner manufacture and sell salt tablets used and useful in the canning trade. The tablets have a particular configuration rendering them capable of convenient use in respondent's patented machines. Petitioner makes and leases to canners unpatented salt deposition machines, \n\n[314 \nU.S. 488, 491]\n\u00a0\n charged to infringe respondent's patent. For reasons we indicate later, nothing turns on the fact that petitioner also competes with respondent in the sale of the tablets, and we may assume for purposes of this case that petitioner is doing no more than making and leasing the alleged infringing machines. The principal business of respondent's subsidiary, from which its profits are derived, is the sale of salt tablets. In connection with this business, and as an adjunct to it, respondent leases its patented machines to commercial canners, some two hundred in all, under licenses to use the machines upon condition and with the agreement of the licensees that only the subsidiary's salt tablets be used with the leased machines.\n It thus appears that respondent is making use of its patent monopoly to restrain competition in the marketing of unpatented articles, salt tablets, for use with the patented machines, and is aiding in the creation of a limited monopoly in the tablets not within that granted by the patent. A patent operates to create and grant to the patentee an exclusive right to make, use and vend the particular device described and claimed in the patent. But a patent affords no immunity for a monopoly not within the grant. Interstate Circuit v. United States, \n306 \nU.S. 208, 228\n, 230 S., 59 S. Ct. 467, 475, 476; Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, \n309 \nU.S. 436, 456\n, 60 S.Ct. 618, 625, and the use of it to suppress competition in the sale of an unpatented article may deprive the patentee of the aid of a court of equity to restrain an alleged infringement by one who is a competitor. It is the established rule that a patentee who has granted a license on condition that the patented invention be used by the licensee only with unpatented materials furnished by the licensor, may not restrain as a contributory infringer one who sells to the licensee like materials for like use.

United States, \n298 \nU.S. 131, 140\n, 56 S.Ct. 701, 705.\n The grant to the inventor of the special privilege of a patent monopoly carries out a public policy adopted by the Constitution and laws of the United States, 'to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to ... Inventors the exclusive Right ....' to their 'new and useful' inventions. United States Constitution, Art. I ,  8, cl. 8; 35 U.S.C.  31, 35 U.S.C.A.  31. But the public policy which includes inventions within the granted monopoly excludes from it all that is not embraced in the invention. It equally forbids the use of the patent to secure an exclusive right or limited monopoly not granted by the Patent Office and which it is contrary to public policy to grant.\n It is a principle of general application that courts, and especially courts of equity, may appropriately withhold their aid where the plaintiff is using the right asserted contrary to the public interest. Virginian R. Co. v. System Federation, \n300 \nU.S. 515, 552\n, 57 S.Ct. 592, 601; Central Kentucky Natural Gas Co. v.

Morgan, \n307 \nU.S. 183, 194\n, 59 S.Ct. 795, 801. Respondent argues that this doctrine is limited in its application to those cases where the patentee seeks to restrain contributory infringement by the sale to licensees of competing unpatented article, while here respondent seeks to restrain petitioner from a direct infringement, the manufacture and sale of the salt tablet depositor. It is said that the equitable maxim that a party seeking the aid of a court of equity must come into court with clean hands applies only to the plaintiff's wrongful conduct in the particular act or transaction which raises the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 488, 493]\n\u00a0\n equity, enforcement of which is sought; that where, as here, the patentee seeks to restrain the manufacture or use of the patented device, his conduct in using the patent to restrict competition in the sale of salt tablets does not foreclose him from seeking relief limited to an injunction against the manufacture and sale of the infringing machine alone.\n Undoubtedly 'equity does not demand that its suitors shall have led blameless lives', Loughran v. Loughran, \n292 \nU.S. 216, 229\n, 54 S.Ct. 684, 689, cf. Keystone Driller Co. v. General Excavator Co., \n290 \nU.S. 240, 241\n, 245 S., 54 S.Ct. 146, 147; but additional considerations must be taken into account where maintenance of the suit concerns the public interest as well as the private interests of suitors. Where the patent is used as a means of restraining competition with the patentee's sale of an unpatented product, the successful prosecution of an infringement suit even against one who is not a competitor in such sale is a powerful aid to the maintenance of the attempted monopoly of the unpatented article, and is thus a contributing factor in thwarting the public policy underlying the grant of the patent. Maintenance and enlargement of the attempted monopoly of the unpatented article are dependent to some extent upon persuading the public of the validity of the patent, which the infringement suit is intended to establish. Equity may rightly withhold its assistance from such a use of the patent by declining to entertain a suit for infringement, and should do so at least until it is made to appear that the improper practice has been abandoned and that the consequences of the misuse of the patent have been dissipated. Cf. B. B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis, \n314 \nU.S. 495\n, 62 S.Ct. 406, 86 L.Ed. --, decided this day.\n The reasons for barring the prosecution of such a suit against one who is not a competitor with the patentee in the sale of the unpatented product are fundamentally the same as those which preclude an infringement suit against a licensee who has violated a condition of the license by using with the licensed machine a competing \n\n[314 \nU.S. 488, 494]\n\u00a0\n unpatented article, Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., supra, or against a vendee of a patented or copyrighted article for violation of a condition for the maintenance of resale prices, Adams v. Burke, 17 Wall. 453; Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, 210 U.S 339, 28 S.Ct. 722; Bauer & Cie v. O'Donnell, \n229 \nU.S. 1\n, 33 S.Ct. 616, 50 L.R.A.,N.S., 1185, Ann.Cas.1915A, 150; Straus v. Victor Talking Machine Co., \n243 \nU.S. 490\n, 37 S.Ct. 412, L. R.A.1917E, 1196, Ann.Cas.1918A, 955; Boston Store v.

It is the adverse effect upon the public interest of a successful infringement suit in conjunction with the patentee's course of conduct which disqualifies him to maintain the suit, regardless of whether the particular defendant has suffered from the misuse of the patent. Similarly equity will deny relief for infringement of a trademark where the plaintiff is misrepresenting to the public the nature of his product either by the trademark itself or by his label. Manhattan Medicine Co. v. Wood, \n108 \nU.S. 218\n, 2 S.Ct. 436; Worden & Co. v. California Fig Syrup Co., \n187 \nU.S. 516\n, 23 S.Ct. 161; Leather Cloth Co. v.

The patentee, like these other holders of an exclusive privilege granted in the furtherance of a public policy, may not claim protection of his grant by the courts where it is being used to subvert that policy.\n It is unnecessary to decide whether respondent has violated the Clayton Act, for we conclude that in any event the maintenance of the present suit to restrain petitioner's manufacture or sale of the alleged infringing machines is contrary to public policy and that the district court rightly dismissed the complaint for want of equity.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","81":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMOTHER LODE COALITION MINES CO. v. HELVERING(1942)\nNo. 94\nArgued: November 19, 1942Decided: December 7, 1942\n\n\n\n Paul E. Shorb, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Valentine Brookes, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The ultimate question presented by this case is whether petitioner is entitled to a deduction in its 1935 income tax return for percentage depletion under  114(b)(4) of the \n\n[317 \nU.S. 222, 223]\n\u00a0\n Revenue Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 680, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code  114(b)(4), which allowed the deduction from gross income in the case of mines, etc., of specified percentages of gross income, but not to exceed 50% of the net income computed without regard to depletion allowance, and required that:\n'A taxpayer making his first return under this title (chapter) in respect of a property shall state whewther he elects to have the depletion allowance for such property for the taxable year for which the return is made computed with or without regard to percentage depletion, and the depletion allowance in respect of such property for such year shall be computed according to the election thus made. If the taxpayer fails to make such statement in the return, the depletion allowance for such property for such year shall be computed without reference to percentage depletion. The method, determined as above, of computing the depletion allowance shall be applied in the case of the property for all taxable years in which it is in the hands of such taxpayer, ....'1\n\n The pivotal question is whether petitioner's income tax return for 1934 or for 1935 was the first return in respect of its mining property within the meaning of  114(b)(4). During the tax year 1934 petitioner's copper mine was closed. In its 1934 income tax return petitioner reported gross income from the sale of one mined the previous year, but the deductions, most of which were attributed to 'Shutdown Expense', were such that there was no net income. Petitioner claimed no depletion allowance in the return-depletion allowances prior to 1933 had exhausted petitioner's cost basis-and made no statement with regard to percentage depletion. In 1935 petitioner derived a net profit from the operation of its mine and claimed a deduction for percentage depletion, stating that it had elected percentage depletion for the future in its 1933\n\n\n\n\n[317 \nU.S. 222, 224]\n\u00a0\n return, filed under  114(b)(4) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 169, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 519. The Commissioner disallowed the percentage depletion deduction for 1935, ruling that under  114(b)(4) of the 1934 Act petitioner's 1934 return was its first return in respect of its mining property and that its failure to make an affirmative election in that return constituted an election to compute depletion thereafter without reference to percentage depletion. Accordingly, the Commissioner made a deficiency determination which the Board of Tax Appeals sustained. The Court below affirmed. 2 Cir., 125 F.2d 657. We granted certiorari because of an asserted conflict with the decision in Pittston-Duryea Coal Co. v. Commissioner, 3 Cir., 117 F.2d 436. 2\n Section 114(b)(4) required petitioner to elect in its 'first return under this title (chapter) (income tax) in respect of a property' whether its depletion allowance was to be computed with or without regard to percentage depletion, and the method thus chosen became binding for the subsequent taxable years. Petitioner's 1934 return falls within the exact statutory definition of 'first return'. It was the first return filed under the 1934 Act, and it was 'in respect of' the mining property since it listed items of gross income and deductions arising out of that property. Petitioner's failure there to state its election foreclosed any subsequent claim to percentage depletion. This has been the administrative interpretation. Article 23(m)-5 of Regulations 86. 3 We think this regulation is \n\n[317 \nU.S. 222, 225]\n\u00a0\n binding because not only is it practically compelled by the words of  114( b)(4), but also it is a reasonable interpretation, which, as will be shortly pointed out, is fair and workable in its operation.\n Petitioner asserts that this interpretation fails to give effect to the meaning of  114(b)(4) as a whole, and contends that when such effect is given, 'first return' must mean the first return in which a depletion allowance could be claimed. The argument for this result runs as follows: Section 114(b)(4) requires the taxpayer to state in its first return whether it elects to have 'the depletion allowance for such property for the taxable year for which the return is made computed with or without regard to percentage depletion' and then provides that 'the depletion allowance in respect of such property for such year shall be computed according to the election thus made'; therefore, the 'first return' must be one in which petitioner could elect to have the 'depletion allowance ... for the taxable year' computed with or without reference to percentage depletion; and, in its 1934 return petitioner could not so elect because a percentage depletion allowance is limited in any case to 50% of net income and it had no net income.\n The fallacy of this argument is apparent, and the fault lies in the final step. The statute provides for the election of a method of computation for the present and the future; it does not, contrary to petitioner's assertions, make the necessity for election depend upon whether an allowance actually results from the method of computation chosen. Petitioner could have elected in 1934 to have the depletion allowance for 1934 'computed with \n\n[317 \nU.S. 222, 226]\n\u00a0\n or without regard to percentage depletion', and the computation could then have been made according to the method chosen. It so happened that petitioner was not entitled to any allowance in 1934; its depletable cost had been exhausted, and computation on the percentage basis would have resulted in nothing. So the choice had no significance for that year, but, that could be ascertained only after the computation was made. The idea that it would be absurd to compel an election until a deduction actually resulted, see Pittston-Duryea Coal Co. v. Commissioner, 3 Cir., 117 F.2d 436, 438, is best answered by the fact that the statute gave taxpayers an opportunity to elect a depletion program for the present and future years; nothing in it indicates that Congress was concerned with whether a depletion allowance actually resulted in each year from the program selected.\n Petitioner's contentions really resolve into the proposition that 'first return' means 'first return made by a taxpayer having net income derived from a property'. But the statute does not speak of first return showing net income and there is nothing to indicate that such was Congress' intention. \n4\n Furthermore, as the court below pointed out, 2 Cir., 125 F.2d 657, at page 659, if petitioner had a basis for cost depletion in 1934 it would have been put to an election in that year even though it had no net income because cost depletion allowance is in no manner dependent upon the existence of net income. The fact \n\n[317 \nU.S. 222, 227]\n\u00a0\n that petitioner's depletable cost was exhausted is no reason for expanding the statutory definition. Section 114(b)(4) is a liberal offer limited to those who meet the exact statutory terms. Riley Co. v. Commissioner, \n311 \nU.S. 55\n, 61 S.Ct. 95.\n Strong practical considerations also support the Commissioner's construction of the statute and warrant rejection of petitioner's 'first return with net income' theory. All taxpayers are put on an equal basis if they must elect their depletion program in the first return filed 'in respect of a property'; a taxpayer, situated as petitioner, is not then free to defer election until it has net income at some future date when conditions may be such that its election can be made more advisedly than that of its competitors. Secondly, administrative simplicity and certainty are best achieved by the Commissioner's interpretation. If by 'first return made by a taxpayer having net income derived from a property', petitioner means first return for a year in which there actually was net income, cf. Kehoe-Berge Coal Co. v. Commissioner, 3 Cir., 117 F.2d 439, it could not be known in some cases whether a taxpayer was put to its election in 1934 or a later year until after finally determining, perhaps after protracted litigation, whether or not the taxpayer had actual net income in 1934. The uncertainty and confusion thereby created would be most undesirable; a taxpayer could not intelligently plan its operations, and the Bureau of Internal Revenue would be compelled to keep open all the returns for subsequent years in order to check the later depletion deductions. If it is petitioner's contention that the critical fact of net income is disclosed by the face of the return, the obligation to state an election would depend to some extent upon the errors of the taxpayer, a consequence which it is not to be presumed that Congress intended.\n The judgment below is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Emphasis added. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In granting the writ we excluded argument on the point, decided adversely to petitioner below, that its election to take percentage depletion in its 1933 return under the Revenue Act of 1932 made unnecessary a new election under the Revenue Act of 1934. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] This Article provides in part as follows: 'In his first return made under Title I of the Act (for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1933) the taxpayer must state as to each property with respect to which the taxpayer has any item of income or deduction whether he elects to have the depletion allowance for each such property for the taxable year computed with or without reference to percentage depletion. ... If the taxpayer fails to make such statement in the return in which the election should be so indicated, the depletion allowance for the year for which an election must be first exercised and for all succeeding taxable years will be computed without reference to percentage depletion.' \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Petitioner relies upon the remarks of Representative Disney who offered an amendment to  114(b)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code, as part of the Revenue Act of 1942, which would have written the petitioner's interpretation into the statute with the explanation that the amendment clarified the original Congressional intent. Hearings Before House Committee on Ways and Means on Revenue Revision of 1942, 17th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 3489. However, this amendment was rejected in Committee. Section 145(a) of the Revenue Act of 1942, approved October 21, 1942, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code  114(b)(4), eliminates the necessity of election, but nothing in its legislative history casts any light upon our problem. \n\n\n\n\n","82":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMUNCIE GEAR WORKS v. OUTBOARD, MARINE & MFG. CO.(1942)\nNo. 323\nArgued: February 12, 1942Decided: March 30, 1942\n\n\n\n Mr. Samuel E. Darby, Jr., of New York City, for petitioners.\n Mr. Henry M. Huxley, of Chicago, Ill., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We are required in this case to determine the validity of claims numbered 11, 12, 13 and 14 of letters patent No. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 759, 760]\n\u00a0\n 1,716,962, granted on June 11, 1929, to Harry L. Johnson for invention in a 'water propulsion device'. Respondent Johnson Brothers Engineering Corporation is the owner of the patent, and respondent Outboard, Marine & Manufacturing Company, is the exclusive licensee thereunder. Petitioner Muncie Gear Works, Inc., manufactured outboard motors which are claimed to infringe, and petitioner Bruns & Collins, Inc., sold them.\n Respondents contend that this as a validly issued patent covering an invention which solved the problems of 'cavitation' by relatively large and fast outboard motors. 'Cavitation' is the drawing of air by the propeller from above the surface of the water to the propeller itself. Air so drawn reduces the propulsive effect of the propeller and causes 'racing' of the motor with consequent risk of its disintegration and danger to the user. Increased speed or power entails a greater tendency to cavitate. Cavitation may be diminished by setting the propeller deeper in the water, but this increased projection increases resistance and retards speed.\n Long before the patent in question, it was known that cavitation could be controlled, and in practice it was controlled, in at least all but relatively large and fast outboard motors, by setting a flat plate horizontally above the propeller and beneath the surface of the water, to act as a baffle and prevent the propeller from drawing air. \n1\n Respondents presented expert testimony to the effect that relatively large and fast water-cooled outboard motors cannot be successful unless they embody the asserted invention which respondents say is the subject matter of the claims in question. In general, this may be said to consist in the use of an anti-cavitation plate on a housing for the engine and propeller shafts enclosing the water passages for the cooling system, shaped both above and \n\n[315 \nU.S. 759, 761]\n\u00a0\n below the plate so as to reduce water displacement and resistance and thus to reduce or eliminate eddy currents forming vortexes through which air can be sucked into the propeller. This permits adequate control of cavitation by means of a not unduly large anti-cavitation plate.\n Harry L. Johnson, an experienced engineer and manufacturer of outboard motors, filed his application for the patent on August 25, 1926, but it in no way suggested the combination now asserted as his invention. The single sheet of drawing accompanying the application was not changed during the prosecution of the application, and is the same as the drawing of the issued patent. This drawing showed an outboard motor assembly comprising, among other things, an engine at the top connected with a propeller at the bottom, with an anti-cavitation plate located horizontally above the propeller approximately midway between top and bottom of the housing for the engine and propeller shafts. All water passages for the cooling system beneath the normal water level were shown to be enclosed in the housing. No cross section of this housing was drawn or indicated, and for all that appears from the drawing it might have been circular, triangular or rectangular. The drawing showed an arched member extending from the housing and anti-cavitation plate over the top and to the rear of the propeller, containing openings and passages for the intake and discharge of water, and ending in a curved 'deflection plate' extending rearwardly like a fixed rudder. From the specifications and claims it appeared that the purpose of the deflection plate was to compensate for the side an pivotal force of the moving propeller, which tended to draw the boat off its course unless the operator made constant adjustment to offset the 'side throw.' The specifications and drawings both indicated an anti-cavitation plate which the specifications said 'prevents cavitation,' but it was in no way asserted that the cavitation plate was new, or that it \n\n[315 \nU.S. 759, 762]\n\u00a0\n was being employed in any novel cooperative relation to the other elements.\n All of the claims of the application as originally made were rejected on December 15, 1926. On December 13, 1927, Johnson offered amendments which retained and amended the prior claims and added others directed to the feature of the deflection plate. In urging allowance, he said, among other things: 'It is conceded that cavitation plates are old in the art as shown in the patent to Johnson cited,' and he proceeded to urge as an invention the combination of the cavitation plate and the arching member of reflection plate. A similar supplemental amendment was filed on January 19, 1928. Several of the original claims as amended were allowed, and the rest of the claims rejected, on June 7, 1928\n\n\n On December 8, 1928, Johnson came forward with new claims. Claims 20 to 25 offered by this amendment made no mention of the deflection plate or of the arching members, but did not even suggest the presently asserted invention. On March 30, 1929, Johnson cancelled these claims and offered further amendments to his original application, together with a supplemental oath that he had invented the subject matter of the application as so amended, prior to the filing of the original amendment. \n2\n The effect of those changes was aptly described by the patent examiner: 'The amendments have been such that the claims now emphasize the anticavitation plate rather than the anti-torque plate.' With changes which are immaterial here, the new claims so offered became the claims in issue. In them Johnson for the first time made claims relating to the exterior surface of the housing. Claim 12 described the housing as having 'unbroken outer wall surfaces at each side,' and claim 14, as having \n\n[315 \nU.S. 759, 763]\n\u00a0\n 'smooth and unbroken walls.' Claims 11 and 13 were silent on the subject. The amendment also set forth an addition to the description which was incorporated in the description of the patent as issued. Here we find the expression 'relatively smooth and substantially stream-line surfaces.' Other than these, no indication of the nature of the surface or cross section of the housing was given at any time during the prosecution of the application.\n The petitioners interposed defenses to all of the eight patents upon which respondents sued them in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division3 which we take to have put in issue the question whether the claims were void because made more than two years after the first public use of the device. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[315 \nU.S. 759, 764]\n\u00a0\n At the trial two of the officers of respondent Outboard, Marine & Manufacturing Company testified on direct examination as respondents' witnesses to the effect that in January or February of 1926 one of this respondent's predecessors put on the market licensed outboard motors equipped with smooth-walled housings, anti-cavitation plates, and internal water passages as described in the claims in suit; and that at least one competitor (which was also a predecessor) had brought out a substantially similar, but unlicensed, motor about a year later. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[315 \nU.S. 759, 765]\n\u00a0\n In an unreported decision the District Court did not touch on this question, but found as a matter of fact and of law that the claims in question were invalid because merely aggregational. On appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals the issue of sale or public use was not clearly presented,6 if indeed it was presented at all; and the opinion rendered by that Court did not advert to it, although it held that the claims here involved were valid and infringed. 7 Cir., 119 F.2d 404. While there was no conflict \n\n[315 \nU.S. 759, 766]\n\u00a0\n of decision with respect to these claims,7 we granted certiorari in view of the questions presented and because the patent dominates a substantial portion of an industry so concentrated in the Seventh Circuit that litigation in other circuits, resulting in a conflict of decisions, is unlikely. \n314 \nU.S. 594\n, 62 S.Ct. 100, 86 L.Ed. --. Schriber-Schroth Co. v. Cleveland Trust Co., \n305 \nU.S. 47\n, 59 S.Ct. 8.\n Section 4886 of the Revised Statutes, as amended and applicable to the present case, provided for the issuance of a patent to an inventor upon certain conditions, one of which was that his invention was 'not in public use or on sale in this country for more than two years prior to his application.' \n8\n\u00a0\n\n In an effort to avoid the effect of this provision, respondents contend that the question of its applicability was not raised either in the District Court or in the Circuit Court of Appeals; that there was no opportunity to meet the issue; and that the invention as finally claimed was disclosed by the application as originally made or in any event as amended on December 8, 1928.\n However, the evidence of public use and sale, given as we have pointed out, by respondents' own officers and witnesses,9 has not been questioned or contradicted, and \n\n[315 \nU.S. 759, 767]\n\u00a0\n is interpreted by respondents' counsel in accordance with our view of it. In their brief they say 'It is true that after Johnson Motor Company, licensee under the patent in suit, had popularized devices embodying the subject matter of the claims in suit, at least one competitor copied the combinations of the claims in suit from the Johnson motor before claims closely resembling those in suit were presented to the Patent Office in December 1928. This was done by Lockwood Ash Motor Company, then a competitor, but subsequently merged to constitute a predecessor of Respondent, Outboard, Marine & Manufacturing Company. ... Lockwood Ash first adopted this combination for the 1927 season. The model year commenced in January or February. ... Concededly, the original claims were limited additionally either to the deflection plate or to the arched support. But claims without these limitations had, contrary to Petitioners' assertions, been filed December 8, 1928. The difference in date is critical because the record shows that the only manufacture of devices embodying the invention which had occurred more than two years prior to December 8, 1928, was licensed manufacture by Johnson Motor Company, predecessor of Respondent Outboard, Marine & Manufacturing Company, and in 1926, exclusive licensees of Respondent Johnson Brothers Engineering Corporation, owner of the application for the patent in suit . ... The only concern which produced outboard motors in accordance with the invention of the patent in 1926 was the exclusive licensee under the application for the patent in suit. ... March, 1929, would be more than two years after the opening of the 1927 model year; but the actual date in December, 1928 when the patentee claimed the specific invention in controversy, without regard to deflection plate or arched support, was well within two years of the first competitive use of the invention, even assuming that the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 759, 768]\n\u00a0\n two year period is of any significance in the present case. ...'\n It is clear to us, however, that the amendments of December 8, 1928, like the original application, wholly failed to disclose the invention now asserted.\n The claims in question are invalid if there was public use, or sale of the device which they are claimed to cover, more than two years before the first disclosure thereof to the Patent Office. Cf. Chicago & N.W. Railway Co. v. Sayles, \n97 \nU.S. 554, 557\n, 559 S., 563, 564; Schriber-Schroth Co. v. Cleveland Trust Co., supra, 305 U.S. at page 57, 59 S.Ct. at page 12. Section 4886 of the Revised Statutes would in terms provide for their invalidity had they been offered by application rather than by amendment; and whatever may be the efficacy of an amendment as a substitute for an application, it surely can effect no more than the application itself.\n We think the conclusion is inescapable that there was public use, or sale, of devices embodying the asserted invention, more than two years before it was first presented to the Patent Office. We are not foreclosed from a decision under Section 4886 on the point by the obscurity of its presentation in the courts below. This issue has been fully presented to this Court by the petition for a writ of certiorari, and in subsequent briefs and argument; and there is not the slightest indication that respondents have been prejudiced by such obscrity. To sustain the claims in question upon the established and admitted facts would require a plain disregard of the public interest sought to be safeguarded by the patent statutes, and so frequently present but so seldom adequately represented in patent litigation.\n We therefore hold that the claims in question are invalid under Section 4886 of the Revised Statutes, and accordingly have no occasion to decide any other question in the case.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Smith, No. 1,226,400 (1917); Johnson, No. 1,467,641 (1923). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] No question has ever been raised in this case respecting the veracity of this oath.

Are you familiar with the type of lower unit construction which is shown on this charn reproduced from the drawings of the Johnson patent No. 1,716,962? A. I am.\n\n'Q. Do you recall when such a construction was introduced to the market, and by whom? A. To the best of my recollection it was for the model year of 1926, which would mean it was probably introduced about January or February of 1926.\n\n'Q. By whom? A. By Johnson Motor Company.\n\n'Q. At that time was Evinrude Motor Company a competitor of Johnson Motor Company? A. Yes, they were.\n\n'Q. At that time was Elto Motor Company a competitor of Johnson Motor Company? A. Yes.\n\n'Q. At that time was Lockwood-Ash Motor Company a competitor of Johnson Motor Company? A. Yes.\n\n'Q. What was the result of the introduction of this model by Johnson Motor Company in 1926? A. As far as I was concerned, I was connected with the Lockwood-Ash Motor Company that was making a motor in 1926 and not having that combination; and, not having it, we did not have the satisfactory performance that the Johnson combination had.\n\n'Q. In what respect did your motor not have as satisfactory a performance? A. It had cavitation.\n\n'Q. What did your motor lack particularly of the structure shown in this Johnson patent? A. We did not have an anticavitation plate.\n\n'Q. What did you do to remedy this difficulty? A. In the fall of 1926, for the 1927 model year, we put on an anticavitation plate.\n\n'Q. Did that remedy your difficulty, so far as cavitation was concerned? A. Yes.\n\n'Q. Do you know what was done by Evinrude and Elto? A. My recollection is that possibly, not at the same moment, I doubt Evinrude did the same year, put on an anti-cavitation plate on the stream line housing. I don't remember clearly whether Elto did it that year or the next, but they subsequently did put on the same combination.' \n\n Irgens, Chief Engineer and Production Manager of the Evinrude Division, testified as follows:\n'Q. How long has it been true that all of the larger sizes of outboard motors have been equipped with smooth walled lower unit housings, anti-cavitation plates intermediate the top and bottom thereof, and internal water passages. A. They became popular about 1926, and from then on practically all of them have been made that way.' \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The brief of petitioners in the Circuit Court of Appeals, which has been certified to this Court by the Clerk of that Court, contained the following statement under the heading of anticipation: 'In considering these claims it is appropriate to first have in mind their historical background, in view of the importance that Plaintiffs place upon them as being for subject matter that 'solved a problem' previously 'stalling' a great industry. In the first place the subject matter of these claims was in no way considered in or made a part of the original application. ... It was not until more than two years later that the patentee on December 6, 1928, by his amendment 'C', added claims to his application covering any of the matter that is now deemed to be of such great importance. Then, for the first time the patentee claimed, in claims originally numbered 17 to 25, inclusive, the anticavitation plate apart from the limitations which characterized his originally filed disclosures and originally filed claims.' \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] They had previously been sustained by a District Court in the Sixth Circuit.

CITY OF BIRMINGHAM(1942)\nNo. 755\nArgued: April 1, 1942Decided: April 27, 1942\n\n\n\n\n[316 \nU.S. 153, 154]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Claude H. Stevens, of Detroit, Mich., for appellant.\n Court declined to hear further argument.\n Messrs. Ferris D. Stone and Harry Allen, both of Detroit, Mich., on the brief, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal challenges a decision of the Supreme Court of Michigan, which upheld the constitutionality of Michigan statutes1 extinguishing unmatured special assessments, tax liens or other encumbrances on land sold for tax delinquency, and which therefore refused a writ of mandamus to compel the City of Birmingham to levy an additional special assessment on land so sold, to pay defaulted paving bonds issued in 1928 by its predecessor, the Village of Birmingham. 298 Mich. 314, 299 N.W. 90. The appellant, Municipal Investors Association, as holder of these bonds, claims to have a contract right under the law of Michigan in 1928 to require such an additional assessment, and asserts that the subsequent Michigan statutes construed to prevent the levy impair the obligation of its contract contrary to Article I, Section 10 of the United States Constitution.\n Determination of this Court's jurisdiction of the appeal was postponed to the hearing of the case upon the merits. We think that the constitutionality of the two 1937 statutes upheld by the Michigan Supreme Court was sufficiently and seasonably drawn in question in appellant's reply, and that the jurisdictional requirements of  237 \n\n[316 \nU.S. 153, 155]\n\u00a0\n of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  344, 28 U.S.C.A.  344, are satisfied. Appellant challenged the Acts as violative of the Contract Clause. But we find it unnecessary to consider the effect or validity of these statutes, for we think the appellant has failed to establish any contract right to an additional assessment after a sale to enforce an assessment lien under the preexisting Michigan law, in force when the bonds were issued.\n The decision refusing mandamus for an additional assessment was entered on the pleadings. These disclose that the Village of Birmingham, in order to pay the cost of paving certain streets, took proceedings in 1928 to assess 23.4% of the cost to the village at large, and 76.6% to the property abutting the improvement, Special Assessment District No. 146. The property assessment was payable in five equal annual installments commencing with 1928. Of one hundred and ten parcels in District No. 146, about one hundred never paid their shares of the assessment, were offered for sale for these and other unpaid taxes at the annual tax sale of 1938, and were bid in by the State of Michigan. They were not redeemed, and were later sold by the State. About ten parcels in the District paid their shares of the paving assessment and have never been sold for taxes.\n In anticipation of the collection of this special assessment the Village had issued in 1928 seventeen annually maturing serial 5 1\/4% bonds. Of these No. 1 to No. 7 appear to have been paid, No. 8 to No. 11 were refunded, and No. 12 to No. 17, which are held by appellant, have all been in default both as to interest and principal at least since October 1, 1933. A negligible amount is on hand in the special assessment fund, and not over 20% of the amount still owing will be realized from the District's share in the proceeds of the tax sales. In order to replenish the fund, the appellant seeks to compel the de- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 153, 156]\n\u00a0\n fendants by the laws in force when the bonds were issued to levy upon all the land in the District, including the lots previously sold for taxes and the original assessment, an additional assessment equal to the unpaid principal and interest.\n The general act under which the Village was incorporated listed among the permissible charter powers a provision 'for assessing and reassessing the cost, or any portion thereof, of any public improvement to a special district;' Act No. 278, Public Acts of 1909,  24(e), Mich.Comp.Laws 1929 ,  1786(e).2 Pursuant to this authorization section 15 of Chapter XXI of the village charter provided: 'Should any special assessment prove insufficient to pay for the improvement or work for which it was levied, and the expenses incident thereto, the Commission may make an additional pro rata assessment to supply the deficiency; and in case a larger amount shall have been collected than was necessary, the excess shall be refunded ratably to those by whom it was paid.' 3 Section 22 of Chapter XX of the charter stated that special assessment \n\n[316 \nU.S. 153, 157]\n\u00a0\n bonds should 'be payable out of the special assessment district fund when the assessment is collected.' In the bonds themselves the Village promised to pay the principal and interest, 'said principal and interest however, being payable from the Special Assessment fund created for the purpose ... The full faith and credit of the Village of Birmingham are hereby pledged for the punctual payment of the principal and interest of this bond from the special assessment fund created for the purpose, when the same shall have been collected.'\n The Michigan Supreme Court assumed, without deciding, that these various provisions did include in the bondholders' contract a right to additional assessments after a tax sale for the payment of deficiencies attributable to nonpayment of valid prior assessments. 298 Mich. 314, 319, 299 N.W. 90, 92. As a contract must exist before it can be impaired, and as our conclusion against existence of the contract right settles this case, we feel it proper to consider only whether there was a contract between the bondholders and the Village for an additional assessment on the district property to meet deficiencies instead of undertaking the resolution of the constitutional issue presented by the challenged statutes of Michigan. While this approach forces us to decide the meaning of Michigan legislation without the assistance of the courts of that State, it is necessary to do so because of the obligation of this Court to determine for itself the basic assumptions upon which interpretations of the Federal Constitution rest. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The complete charter of the Village is not before us. From the authorized power granted by the Public Act of 1909 under which it was organized, however, from the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 153, 158]\n\u00a0\n language in section 15 of Chapter XXI of the charter providing for 'an additional pro rata assessment' and from the terms of the bond, limiting its payment to 'the special assessment fund created for the purpose, when the same shall have been collected,' we are satisfied there was no contract to reassess lots once sold for the original assessment. If the stated powers of the Village to levy an assessment on improvement district property required that the lots assessed, after sale for default in their installments, should be subject to an additional assessment to cover such deficiencies, the burden might depress their value to a point where little if anything could be realized for the bondholders, and successful sale for non-payment would be frustrated. This would clearly be true where, as here, a very large proportion of the assessments were defaulted. A prospective investor in the bonds must look ultimately to the sale of each lot for the payment of the amount assessed against that particular parcel. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Section 15 of the village charter authorizes an additional assessment when the original assessment proves insufficient to pay for the improvement. Assessment bonds may \n\n[316 \nU.S. 153, 159]\n\u00a0\n be based on undertakings whereby benefited lands may be liable even after they were sold to pay the assessment liens upon them to recover for defaults in sales of other assessed properties. See Kadow v. Paul, \n274 \nU.S. 175\n, 47 S.Ct. 561. But in the absence of controlling Michigan law, section 15 repels such a construction. The language falls far short of subjecting lots which have been sold to pay tax or assessment liens to an additional assessment for the deficit. Such a construction would defeat the remedy of tax sales as a means of realizing the assessment lien. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The opinion of the Supreme Court of Michigan does not deal specifically with the status of the lots which have not been sold to satisfy the assessments. In the absence of an assignment of error upon that ground, we express no opinion thereon.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Acts Nos. 114, 155, Mich.Pub.Acts of 1937. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The same act stated that 'No village shall have power: ... To issue any bonds without creating a sinking fund for the payment of the same, except special assessment bonds which are a charge upon a special district created for the payment thereof, and serial bonds payable annually.' Act No. 278, Public Acts of 1909,  26(k), Mich.Comp. Laws 1929 ,  1788(k). \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 18 of Chapter X of the charter of the City of Birmingham, adopted in 1933, makes provision for an additional assessment to meet insufficiencies in special assessments 'for any cause, mistake or inadvertence.' Section 12 of Chapter XVIII makes these provisions effective for the village debts where legally applicable. Obviously unless the village charter provision in effect when the bonds were issued authorized additional assessments to meet deficiencies, the city clause could not add that burden to the lots. It would be applicable only if it were a means of enforcing an existing right. Cf. In re Farm Drainage Dist.

United Stated, \n316 \nU.S. 407\n, 62 S.Ct. 1194, 86 L.Ed. --, decided this day. Both present substantially similar facts and the same issues of law.\n Appellant, National Broadcasting Company, maintains two radio broadcasting systems, the 'blue network' and the 'red network'. The two other appellants operate radio broadcasting stations licensed by the Communica- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 447, 448]\n\u00a0\n tions Commission, and have entered into contracts with National similar to those involved in the Columbia case and to those of other stations which participate in National's networks.\n Appellants brought the present suit in the Southern District of New York to set aside the order of the Commission of May 2, 1941, as amended by its order of October 11, 1941, promulgating the Chain Broadcasting Regulations which we considered in the Columbia case, on the grounds that the order is beyond the Commission's statutory authority or, if within it, that the statute is an unconstitutional delegation of the legislative power of Congress in violation of Article I,  1 of the Constitution, and operates to deprive appellants of property without the due process of law guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.\n The district court of three judges dismissed the complaint, D.C., 44 F.Supp. 688, holding that the Commission's order is not reviewable under the provisions of  402(a) of the Communications Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 1093, 47 U.S.C.  402(a), 47 U.S.C.A.  402(a), and the Urgent Deficiencies Act, 38 Stat. 219, 28 U.S.C.  47, 28 U.S.C.A.  47, but stayed the operation of the order pending direct appeal to this Court.\n According to the allegations of the bill of complaint, National conducts its broadcasting business in substantially the same manner as Columbia. It establishes telephone wire connections with licensed broadcasting stations with which it enters into contracts for limited periods for chain broadcasting of its radio programs. These contracts do not require that the station shall broadcast the programs of no other chain than National. But a feature of them is the option given to National for use of the station on 28 days' notice for certain specified periods of radio time in broadcasting commercial network programs provided by National. It is alleged that because of the contract provisions the regulations will require the stations affiliated with National to abandon their contracts \n\n[316 \nU.S. 447, 449]\n\u00a0\n or lose their licenses either by the Commission's cancellation of or refusal to renew them. The bill of complaint makes a sufficient showing of irreparable injury to National, including an allegation that forty-eight affiliated stations have served notice of abrogation of the contracts.\n For the reasons stated at length in the opinion in the Columbia case, we hold that the order of the Commission is reviewable in the present suit by the district court of three judges. The bill of complaint states a cause of action in equity. The judgment will accordingly be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings.\n Unlike the Columbia case, the record discloses no facts showing what effect the Commission's minute adopted after the present suit was brought has had or will have upon the cancellation of appellants' contracts by the affiliated stations. So far as relevant that will be a matter for consideration by the court below, as will be the question, not considered here, whether the appellants other than National are proper parties plaintiff.\n As in the Columbia case the stay now in effect will be continued, on terms to be settled by the court below.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice BLACK took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n Mr. Justice REED, Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS dissent for the reasons set forth in the dissenting opinion in No. 1026. \n\n\n\n","85":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNATIONAL LABOR R.

The right is challenged because exercised prior to a closed shop agreement.\n The other respondents are various unions, all affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, which we shall call the Affiliates. Since June 22, 1935, these unions have been recognized by the employer as the duly chosen agents of the employees for collective bargaining. On that date the Affiliates and the employer entered into a written contract covering hours and working conditions for the period ending June 23, 1936. A similar contract extended the arrangements to June 23, 1937. In making the latter contract the Affiliates satisfied the employer of their right to represent the workers by exhibiting authorization cards totaling 771 out of the 809 employees affected. These cards gave the Affiliates 'full power and authority' to conclude for the signer 'all agreements as to hours of labor, wages and other employment conditions.' They were to 'remain in full force and effect for one year from date and thereafter, subject to thirty (30) days written notice of my desire to withdraw such power and authority to act for me in the matters referred to herein.' We assume that the cancellation clause is ineffective prior to twelve months from the date of the card and that all cards were dated just prior to the termination of the first or 1935 contract.\n In March, 1937, when the contract and the individual powers of attorney still had several months to run, the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 685, 688]\n\u00a0\n United Electrical and Radio Workers of America (hereafter called United) affiliated with the Committee for Industrial Organization, began an effort to organize the plant. The Board on adequate evidence found that about sixty employees immediately signed United cards, that on March 19th a meeting of United was held at the Post Office building in East Cleveland, attended by a 'large number of employees,' and that on March 28th another United meeting was held 'by a large number of persons, for the purpose of securing formal resignations from the A.F. of L. Affiliates.' It is undisputed that a United charter was issued to the interested employees for a Local 720, and that on April 2nd the Local notified the employer by letter that a majority of its employees had resigned their memberships in the Affiliates and had 'affiliated' themselves with United. Local 720 claimed in the letter the right to negotiate grievances 'under the existing contract,' i.e., that expiring June 23, 1937. This letter was not received by the employer until April 5th.\n Prior to the receipt of this letter and during a shutdown of the plant by the employer, which had begun on Monday, March 22, 1937, pursuant to a request of the Affiliates, dated March 20th, the employer and the Affiliates had entered into an oral arrangement on Saturday, April 3rd, pursuant to which the employer notified its employees it was reopening its plant Monday, April 5th, under the contract expiring the subsequent June 23rd and added 'but only those employees who are members of the crafts under contract with us will be employed.' Eventually a closed shop clause appeared in a bilateral written contract, superseding the one expiring June 23rd, executed as of May 20, 1937, in the following form:\n Article III (d) 'The Employer agrees to employ only members of the Unions in good standing in their respective Unions, and should the Employer require more employees \n\n[315 \nU.S. 685, 689]\n\u00a0\n than those now employed, the Employer will secure such employees through the Unions, if however, the Unions are unable to furnish such employees, the Employer may secure them elsewhere, it being understood, however, that such employees so secured shall become members of the Union.'\n On the reopening of the plant no one was permitted to return to work who did not present a clearance card from the Affiliates. The refusal of the company to reemploy certain members of United Local 720 gave rise to charges of unfair labor practices, which were sustained by the National Labor Relations Board. 18 N.L.R.B. 591. The employer was ordered to cease and desist from discouraging membership in United and encouraging membership in the Affiliates; from giving any effect at any time to paragraph (d) of Article III of the May 20, 1937, agreement, quoted above, requiring a closed shop; from giving any effect to the remainder of the May 20, 1937, agreement upon certification of any other labor organization than the Affiliates as exclusive collective bargaining representative, and from in any manner interfering with its employees' rights to self- organization. The order required affirmative action by the employer for certain employees to the extent of reinstatement and back pay with the usual provisions for posting notices of compliance and notification of the Board. Some other charges and a petition for investigation and certification of bargaining representatives were dismissed without prejudice. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The respondents successfully contested an enforcement petition. The Circuit Court of Appeals set aside the order, 6 Cir, 120 F.2d 611, on the ground that the refusal to permit \n\n[315 \nU.S. 685, 690]\n\u00a0\n members of the United to resume their work was justified because at the time a valid closed shop contract in favor of the Affiliates under  8(3) of the statute, set out below, was in effect. \n2\n Deeming the issues important in the administration of the Act, we granted certiorari. \n314 \nU.S. 600\n, 62 S.Ct. 131, 86 L.Ed. --.\n In addition to the facts just stated, the Board found there was an oral provision pertaining to a closed shop included in the 1935 and 1936 contracts. This was to the effect, the Board concluded, that all employees hired after the date of the first contract (referred to as new employees) should be required after a work-probation period of two weeks to become members of the appropriate Affiliate union. Respondents contend the oral addition was somewhat different, and that under it not only were new employees compelled to join the Affiliates but old employees (those employed before the first contract) who were or who became members of the Affiliates were required to maintain their membership unimpaired. Respondents' position was upheld by the Circuit Court of Appeals for this and other reasons. The freedom of old employees, under the earlier contracts, to join or not, as they wished, is acknowledged by all. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 685, 691]\n\u00a0\n The Court relied heavily upon the authorizations to bargain3 furnished the Affiliates by the old employees, as indicating the old employees who were members must maintain that status until the year was up. Assuming that every old employee furnished a power of representation for collective bargaining not revocable during the year, it need not be inferred the employee also was bound thereby not to switch his union allegiance. If the employee were forced to await the expiration of the year before changing membership, the first bargaining representative might have a contract for the ensuing year executed before a new representative could be organized and empowered to act. There is nothing in this record to compel such interpretation of the authorizations. With respect to the contract between the employer and the Affiliates, the Board cites the evidence of several, including a letter from the employer's president, written before any controversy arose, to the effect that the oral provision was that new employees must join the Affiliates. From this evidence, the Board was fully justified in reaching its determination that nothing more was agreed. National Labor Relations Board v. Automotive Maintenance Mach. Co., \n315 \nU.S. 282\n, 62 S.Ct. 608, 86 L.Ed. --; National Labor Relations Board v. Falk Corp., \n308 \nU.S. 453, 461\n, 60 S.Ct. 307, 311; National Labor Relations Bd. v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, \n303 \nU.S. 261, 271\n, 58 S.Ct. 571, 576, 115 A.L.R. 307. There is a difference between being bound to retain the same bargaining representative \n\n[315 \nU.S. 685, 692]\n\u00a0\n for a specified period, and being bound not to become a member of a different union during the term of the contract. The first situation, not the second, arose from the earlier contracts.\n The commencement of the United campaign for membership in March brought cooperative action between the employer and the Affiliates to strengthen the latter's position. Under the oral contract, as defined by the ruling of the Board, now approved here, new employees could properly be required to become members of the Affiliates but old employees could neither be required to become members nor to maintain their membership. The Board found that to forestall defections of old employees from the Affiliates to the United the employer 'summoned old employees to the office and there sought to, and in many instances was able to, coerce them into joining the A.F. of L. Affiliates.' In the office were representatives of the Affiliates as well as the employer. A number of old men were called before this group. It is not clear from the record which ones had been members of the Affiliates and lost their standing, or which ones had never been members. There were instances of each type. Vitosky had been a member. Ramsey had not. Both Vitosky and Ramsey were old employees, each in service long prior to the first contract. Vitosky and four others signed affiliate cards on demand and returned to work. Ramsey refused to sign and was discharged. Upon the report of Ramsey's discharge reaching the workshops, there was a one day sitdown strike. Respondents urge that Ramsey's discharge was the result of an error. This issue need not be resolved as there is evidence that some old men, in violation of the collective bargaining agreement, were required to maintain or renew their membership in the Affiliates prior to the closed shop agreement of April 3rd. Such facts are adequate to support the Board's ruling of coercion of em- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 685, 693]\n\u00a0\n ployees by the employer in order to maintain the membership of the Affiliates. Without a closed shop contract covering the employees involved, this company effort to maintain a union violates provisions protecting the freedom of employees to organize as they may wish. 49 Stat. 452,  7, 8(1 ), (3), 29 U.S.C.  157, 158(1), (3), 29 U.S.C.A.  157, 158(1, 3).\n Furthermore, upon the adjustment of this sit-down strike which took place Friday, March 19th, after the occurrences just described, the Affiliates requested and the employer ordered a shutdown of the entire plant which lasted from March 22nd to April 5th. The Board found that this shutdown was for the purpose of preventing 'further proselyting' among members of the Affiliates by the United. A vice-president of the employer testified to such facts, learned by him in conference with officials of the Affiliates who stated they needed the time to 'get their lines in order.' Assistance to a union by a shutdown, like any other employer assistance, is forbidden. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Respondents assert that whatever employer assistance was rendered the Affiliates was justified even under an interpretation of the contract which restricts the oral portion to a requirement that new members join the Affiliates. The assistance, it is urged, was rendered to collective bargaining representatives, selected freely by a majority of the employees and possessed of unrestricted and unrevoked powers to negotiate generally over labor conditions, including the closed shop clause of April 3rd and the new closed shop contract of May 20, 1937. Under this view, since the discharges took place after a valid closed shop amendment, they were in conformity with  8(3) of the Labor Act. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 685, 694]\n\u00a0\n An examination of the proviso of  8(3) will demonstrate the error of this position. That proviso reads, so far as pertinent, as follows:\n'Provided, That nothing in this Act (sections 151-166 of this title ) ... shall preclude an employer from making an agreement with a labor organization (not established, maintained, or assisted by any action defined in this Act (sections 151-166 of this title) as an unfair labor practice) to require as a condition of employment membership therein, if such labor organization is the representative of the employees as provided in section 9(a) (159(a) of this title), in the appropriate collective bargaining unit covered by such agreement when made.'\n\n Under the findings already sustained, the Affiliates were assisted and maintained by the cooperation of the employer in dealing with the old employees. Such acts encouraged the labor organization in violation of the portion of  8(3) preceding the proviso, set out in note 2. Consequently when the closed shop agreement was adopted, April 3rd, it was invalid because entered into with a labor organization assisted by an employer in the precise words of  8(3) quoted above. Cf. International Ass'n of Machinists v. National Labor Relations Board, \n311 \nU.S. 72, 81\n, 61 S.Ct. 83, 89. Being invalid, the discharges violated  7, 8(1) and (3).\n Respondents, however, take the position that the Congressional purpose embodied in the Labor Act is not served by such literalness. As they see the situation, freedom to organize must necessarily be qualified after uncoerced employees obtain validly chosen majority representatives. Previously untrammeled rights, they argue, must be subjected to the modicum of interference here practiced, in order that the Congressional object of industrial peace may be realized. We think, however, that the Board's interpretation of the applicable language is correct. The provision for a closed shop as permitted by  8 \n\n[315 \nU.S. 685, 695]\n\u00a0\n (3) follows gramatically a prohibition of discrimination in hiring. These words of the exception must have been carefully chosen to express the precise nature and limits of permissible employer activity in union organization. To permit employer interference prior to the execution of a closed shop contract, as soon as a bare majority of employees had properly selected their representatives, would go far to restore the type of company-union co-ordination in labor matters which the act forbids. \n 5\n\u00a0\n\n Since we have held that assistance was given the Affiliates by the unfair labor practice of encouraging membership in those unions, it follows that the closed shop agreement of April 3rd, requiring old employees to be members of the Affiliates, was made with an assisted labor organization and could be held invalid. International Ass'n of Machinists v. National Labor Relations Board, \n311 \nU.S. 72, 75\n, 61 S.Ct. 83, 86. How long that invalidity continues is an inference of fact for the fair determination of the Board. Cf. H. J. Heinz Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n311 \nU.S. 514, 522\n, 61 S.Ct. 320, 323. Consequently the refusal of the employer to permit the employees to work without clearance from the Affiliates could be found a forbidden interference and discrimination.  8(1) and (3). National Labor Relations Board v. Link-Belt Co., \n311 \nU.S. 584, 601\n, 61 S.Ct. 358, 366. Further, the Board's conclusion that the infirmities of the April 3rd arrangement were destructive of the May 20th contract proceeds naturally from its decision as to the effect of the employer activities prior to April 3rd. The force of the unfair practices was not necessarily dissipated so quickly. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 685, 696]\n\u00a0\n The employer calls our attention to provisions of the order reinstating employees which it feels erroneous. So far as this objection is based on an interpretation of the 1936 oral contract to require old employees to maintain their membership, it is answered by prior portions of this opinion. The employer's refusal to admit these old employees to work on and after April 5th is properly remedied by reinstating them in their position and granting them back pay.\n There is a different basis, however, of rthe objection to the reinstatement of the new employees. This is that under any interpretation of the oral clause of the 1936 contract, these men must become members of the Affiliates and therefore the employer's refusal to take them back on their jobs is proper, even though the April 3rd arrangement is invalid. The Board answers that the April 3rd arrangement was an abandonment of the earlier oral clause and that consequently the discharges made pursuant to the later invalid closed shop arrangements are improper. The abandonment, the Board finds, was intentional and therefore the subsequent invalidation of the later arrangement did not revive the vitality of the earlier oral contract.\n This finding of abandonment of the 1936 membership clause was an inference drawn by the Board from the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the April 3rd arrangement. It is an inference the Board is entitled to \n\n[315 \nU.S. 685, 697]\n\u00a0\n make when supported by material evidence. To the Board, the Congress has entrusted the appraisal of the evidence and the drawing of such inferences. 49 Stat. 454,  10(e), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(e); National Labor Relations Board v. Waterman S.S. Co., \n309 \nU.S. 206, 209\n, 60 S.Ct. 493, 496; National Labor Relations Board v. Link-Belt Co., \n311 \nU.S. 584, 597\n, 61 S.Ct. 358, 365. The lack of positive evidence of the abandonment is natural. It was found abandoned by the Board because of the actions of the parties, the employer and the Affiliates, looking to the creation of a new, all embracing closed shop contract. While the Board found the 1936 oral clause had covered only new employees, the Affiliates issued a notice to their members dated March 31st saying the 'solution to the problem (i.e., 'the situation that resulted in the closing of the plant') is proper enforcement of the present agreement, and that no one be allowed to resume work unless affiliated with these organizations.' On April 3, 1937, the employer notified its employees that in 1936 'it was agreed that we employ only persons affiliated with said crafts' (the Affiliates). Such interpretation of the old clause, varying so radically from that adopted by the Board is not conducive to clear-cut evidence of the purpose of the substitute closed shop arrangement of April 3rd. Considered against the background of coercion of old employees, the strike difficulties and the closing of the plant, all affected at least by the United's membership campaign, we are not willing to say that the Board's finding that 'In substance, though not in form, the arrangement effected between the respondent and the A.F. of L. Affiliates on or about April 3, 1937, was an abandonment of the oral agreement as insufficient to meet the exigencies of the situation and its replacement by a closed-shop agreement,' is unsupported by substantial evidence.\n We have noted the employer's objection to the burden of back pay placed upon it because of the Board's alleged \n\n[315 \nU.S. 685, 698]\n\u00a0\n delay in entering the final order. Handling of complaints as quickly as is consistent with good administration is of course essential. It is important both to the employer who may have to pay back wages and to the employee who must live without his job. Unfortunately this cause took from June 10, 1937, to December 31, 1939. There is nothing in the record, beyond a failure of the Board to file an intermediate report, which would tend to justify us, however, in shortening the period for compensation. This error was admitted and corrected by the Board. We cannot penalize the employees for this happening.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed with directions to enforce the order of the Board except as to reimbursement of federal, state and local work-relief projects. It is so ordered.\n Reversed with directions.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS is of the opinion the judgment should be affirmed for the reasons stated in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals, 6 Cir., 120 F.2d 611. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Certain clauses of the order relating to reimbursement of federal, state and local work-relief prejects are abandoned by the Board and should be eliminated.

The Circuit Court of Appeals refused to enforce the Board's order on the ground that its findings were without substantial support in the evidence. 10 Cir., 122 F.2d 587.\n Examination of the record discloses that there was substantial evidence from which the Board could have concluded that respondent's refusal to employ the men was motivated by its belief that they had engaged or threatened to engage in destruction of respondent's property and had threatened to injure some of respondent's managerial employees and members of their families. There was also substantial evidence from which the Board could have concluded, as it did, that respondent's motive for refusing the employment was discouragement of membership in a labor union. The possibility of drawing either of two inconsistent inferences from the evidence did not prevent the Board from drawing one of them, as the court below seems to have thought.\n We have repeatedly held that Congress, by providing,  10(c), (e) and ( f), of the National Labor Relations Act, that the Board's findings 'as to the Facts, if supported by \n\n[316 \nU.S. 105, 107]\n\u00a0\n evidence, shall be conclusive', precludes the courts from weighing evidence in reviewing the Board's orders, and if the findings of the Board are supported by evidence the courts are not free to set them aside even though the Board could have drawn different inferences.

The Board had considered the effect of a possible shift in membership, alleged to have occurred subsequent to Lorillard's unfair labor practice. But it had reached the conclusion that in order to effectuate the policies of the Act, Lorillard must remedy the effect of its prior unlawful refusal to bargain by bargaining with the union shown to have had a majority on the date of Lorillard's refusal to bargain.

Williams, of Fargo, N.D., for appellees Public Service Commission of North Dakota and others.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n This is an appeal from a decree of the District Court, 41 F.Supp. 439, dismissing a suit to set aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, Minneapolis Traffic Association v. Chicago & North Western Railway Company, 245 I.C.C. 11, requiring the appellant railroads to cease and desist from maintaining certain absorption rules and practices found to be unduly discriminatory and unreasonable and therefore offensive to the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.  1(6), 3(1), 15(1), 49 U.S.C.A.  1(6), 3(1), 15(1).\n Upon complaint of the Minneapolis Traffic Association, representing grain interests in Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Duluth, Minnesota, and Superior, Wisconsin, the Commission instituted an inquiry into the practices of the rail carriers at the complaining markets with respect to absorption of connecting-line switching charges on so-called noncompetitive or local shipments (i.e., originating at points served by only one railroad) of grain, grain products, and seeds. After extensive hearings the Commission found that at the complaining markets the railroads generally absorbed the switching charges on competitive traffic ( i.e., originating at points served by more than one rail- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 346, 348]\n\u00a0\n road) but not on noncompetitive or local traffic, while at all other markets in central-western territory the carriers absorbed the switching charges on both competitive and noncompetitive shipments. This practice, the Commission concluded, was wholly at variance with the general purpose of the grain-rate structure to bring about 'an adjustment under which the rates to and from all western markets would be on relatively the same level, or an adjustment under which the rates to and from the markets would approximate a mileage parity.' 245 I.C.C. 11, 13. It was further found that the carriers' absorption practices at the complaining markets were supported neither by revenue considerations nor sound transportation factors, and that the widespread absorption of switching charges on noncompetitive traffic at other important markets was strong evidence of the reasonableness of such practice and of the unreasonableness of the carriers' refusal to absorb such charges at the complaining markets. Upon the basis of these findings the Commission entered the order challenged on this appeal.\n Neither the validity of the Commission's findings nor its compliance with procedural safeguards is assailed here. The order is attacked on the ground that the Commission has exceeded its constitutional and statutory powers.\n Section 1(6) of the Interstate Commerce Act requires common carriers subject to the Act 'to establish, observe, and enforce ... just and reasonable regulations and practices affecting classifications, rates, or tariffs, ... and all other matters relating to or connected with the receiving, handling, transporting, storing, and delivery of property ... which may be necessary or proper to secure the safe and prompt receipt, handling, transportation, and delivery of property ... upon just and reasonable terms, and every unjust and unreasonable classification, regulation, and practice is prohibited and declared to be un- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 346, 349]\n\u00a0\n lawful.' Section 3(1) makes it unlawful for common carriers to give 'any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person , ... locality, ... region, district, territory, or any particular description of traffic, in any respect whatsoever; or to subject any particular person, ... locality, ... region, district, territory, or any particular description of traffic to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever ....' Section 15(1) authorizes and empowers the Commission, upon finding that a practice of carriers is 'unjust or unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory', to make an appropriate cease-and-desist order.\n We are of opinion that these statutory provisions furnish ample authority for the order made here by the Commission. The findings sufficiently support the Commission in undertaking to remove a discrimination as between grain shippers and markets. As was noted only the other day in Board of Trade v. United States, \n314 \nU.S. 534, 548\n, 62 S. Ct. 366, 372, 86 L.Ed. --, involving another phase of the elaborate and delicately balanced grain rate structure, 'We certainly have neither technical competence nor legal authority to pronounce upon the wisdom of the course taken by the Commission.' Since the action of the Commission was based upon relevant transportation considerations and the Constitutional contentions are plainly without merit, the order will not be set aside.

MISSEL(1942)\nNo. 939\nArgued: Decided: June 8, 1942\n\n\n\n\n[316 \nU.S. 572, 573]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. Ninian Beall, of Washington, D.C., and John R. Norris, of Baltimore, Md., for petitioner.\n Messrs. George A. Mahone, William O. Tydings, and W. Hamilton Whiteford, all of Baltimore, Md., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the application of the overtime section of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 19381 to an employee working irregular hours for a fixed weekly wage. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 572, 574]\n\u00a0\n Respondent, Missel, was an employee of the petitioner, Overnight Motor Transportation Company, a corporation engaged in interstate motor transportation as a common carrier. He acted as rate clerk and performed other incidental duties, none of which were connected with safety of operation. The work for which he was employed involved wide fluctuations in the time required to complete his duties. The employment of respondent began before the effective date of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. A.  201 et seq., October 24, 1938, and terminated October 19, 1940. Until November 1, 1938, his salary was $25.50 per week and thereafter $27.50. Time records are available for only a third of the critical period, and these show an average workweek of 65 hours, with a maximum of 80 for each of two weeks in the first year of the Act's operation and a maximum of 75 hours in each of three weeks in the second year. Nothing above the weekly wage was paid, because these maximum workweeks, computed at the statutory minimum rates with time and a half for overtime for the years in question, would not require an addition to the weekly wage.\n Respondent brought a statutory action to recover alleged unpaid overtime compensation in such sum as might be found due him, an additional equal amount as liquidated damages, and counsel fee. \n2\n The trial court, refus- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 572, 575]\n\u00a0\n ing to hear evidence on the precise amount claimed, decided in favor of the petitioner on the ground that an agreement for a fixed weekly wage for irregular hours satisfied the requirements of the Act. Under such circumstances the court was of the view that pay would be adequate which amounted to the required minimum for the regular hours and time and a half the minimum for overtime. 40 F.Supp. 174. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed with directions to enter judgment for the plaintiff in accordance with its opinion, an order which we interpret as authorizing a hearing in the trial court as to the amounts due. 126 F.2d 98. As the questions involved were important in the administration of the Fair Labor Standards Act, we granted certiorari. \n315 \nU.S. 791\n, 62 S.Ct. 641, 86 L.Ed. --.\n Petitioner renews here its contentions that the private right to contract for a fixed weekly wage with employees in commerce is restricted only by the requirement that the wages paid should comply with the minimum wage schedule of the Fair Labor Standards Act, section 6, 29 U.S.C.A.  206, with overtime pay at time and a half that minimum, that in any event the Act does not preclude lump sum salaries in excess of the minimum, and that a contrary interpretation of the statute would render it unconstitutional.\n It is plain that the respondent as a transportation worker was engaged in commerce within the meaning of the Act,3 and unless specifically exempted was entitled to whatever benefits the overtime provisions conferred.\n While now conceding that United States v. Darby, \n312 \nU.S. 100, 657\n, 61 S.Ct. 451, 132 A.L.R. 1430, settles the constitutional power of Congress to \n\n[316 \nU.S. 572, 576]\n\u00a0\n legislate against labor conditions detrimental to a minimum standard of living required for the general well-being of workers, petitioner argues that there is no power under the Constitution to regulate the hours or wages of workers whose pay, in every instance, at least equals the minimum and whose hours are not injurious to health. Freedom of contract between employer and employee, it is urged, is destroyed by such an interpretation. 4 But hours or wages not patently burdensome to health may yet be subject to regulation to achieve other purposes. We assume here the statutory objectives discussed later, i.e., that the act is aimed at hours as well as wages. The commerce power is plenary,5 may deal with activities in connection with production for commerce6 and as said in the Darby case, may extend 'to those activities intrastate which so affect interstate commerce or the exercise of the power of Congress over it as to make regulation of them appropriate means to the attainment of a legitimate end, the exercise of the granted power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce.' 312 U.S. at page 118, 61 S.Ct. at page 459, 132 A. L.R. 1430. Long hours may impede the free interstate flow of commodities by creating friction between production areas with different length workweeks, by offering opportunities for unfair competition through undue extension of hours, and by inducing labor discontent apt to lead to interference with commerce through interruption of work. Overtime pay probably will not solve all problems of overtime work, but Congress may properly use it to lessen the irritations. Substandard labor conditions were deemed by Congress to be 'injurious to the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 572, 577]\n\u00a0\n commerce and to the states from and to which the commerce flows.' United States v. Darby, \n312 \nU.S. 100, 115\n, 657 S., 61 S.Ct. 451, 457, 132 A.L.R. 1430. To protect that commerce from the consequences of production of goods under substandard conditions, it may choose means reasonably adapted to those ends, including regulation of intrastate activities, 312 U.S. at page 121, 61 S.Ct. at page 460, 132 A.L.R. 1430, by minimum wage and maximum hour requirements, 312 U.S. at page 123, 61 S.Ct. at page 461, 132 A.L.R. 1430. Compare Santa Cruz Fruit Packing Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n303 \nU.S. 453, 466\n, 58 S.Ct. 656, 660. If overtime pay may have this effect upon commerce, private contracts made before or after the passage of legislation regulating overtime cannot take the overtime transactions 'from the reach of dominant constitutional power.' Norman v. Baltimore & O. R. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 240\n, 306-311, 55 S.Ct. 407, 416, 95 A.L.R. 1352. If in the judgment of Congress time and a half for overtime has a substantial effect on these conditions it lies with Congress' power to use it to promote the employees' well-being.\n Statutory Construction. The petitioner attacks the basic conceptions upon which the Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the compensation paid by the respondent violated section 7(a) of the act. \n7\n That court felt that 'one of the fundamental purposes of the Act was to induce worksharing and relieve unemployment by reducing hours of work.' (126 F.2d 98, 103.) We agree that the purpose of the act was not limited to a scheme to raise substandard wages first by a minimum wage and then by increased pay for overtime work. Of course, this was one effect of the time and a half provision, but another and an intended effect was to require extra pay for overtime work by those covered by the act even though their hourly wages exceeded the statutory minimum. The provision of section 7(a) requiring this extra pay for overtime is clear and unambiguous. It calls for 150% of the regular, not the minimum, wage. By this requirement, although overtime was not flatly prohibited, \n\n[316 \nU.S. 572, 578]\n\u00a0\n financial pressure was applied to spread employment to avoid the extra wage and workers were assured additional pay to compensate them for the burden of a workweek beyond the hours fixed in the act. In a period of widespread unemployment and small profits, the economy inherent in avoiding extra pay was expected to have an appreciable effect in the distribution of available work. Reduction of hours was a part of the plan from the beginning. 'A fair day's pay for a fair day's work' was the objective stated in the Presidential message which initiated the legislation. \n8\n That message referred to a 'general maximum working week', 'longer hours on the payment of time and a half for overtime' and the evil of 'overwork' as well as 'underpay.' The message of November 15, 1937, calling for the enactment of this type of legislation referred again to protection from excessive hours. \n9\n Senate Report No. 884 just cited, page 4, the companion House Report10 and the Conference report11 all spoke of maximum hours as a separately desirable object. Indeed, the form of the act itself in setting up two sections of standards, Section 6 for wages and Section 7 for hours, emphasizes the duality of the Congressional purpose. The existence of such a purpose is no less certain because Congress chose to use a less drastic form of limitation than outright prohibition of overtime. We conclude that the act was designed to require payment for overtime at time and a half the regular pay, where that pay is above the minimum, as well as where the regular pay is at the minimum. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n[316 \nU.S. 572, 579]\n\u00a0\n We now come to the determination of the meaning of the words 'the regular rate at which he is employed.' Since we have previously determined in this opinion, in the discussion of petitioner's objection to the application of the Act on the ground of unconstitutionality, that the scope of the commerce power is broad enough to support federal regulation of hours, we are concerned at this point only with the method of finding the regular rate under the contract with respondent. Congress might have sought its objective of clearing the channel of commerce of the obstacles of burdensome labor disputes by minimum wage legislation only. We have seen that it added overtime pay. The wages for minimum pay are expressed in terms of so much an hour. Sec. 6(a)(1)-'Not less than 25 cents an hour' with raises for succeeding years or by order of the Administrator under Sec. 8. Cf. Opp Cotton Mills v. Administrator, \n312 \nU.S. 126, 657\n, 61 S.Ct. 524. Neither the wage, the hour nor the overtime provisions of sections 6 and 7 on their passage spoke specifically of any other method of paying wages except by hourly rate. \n13\n But we have no doubt that pay by the week, to be reduced by some method of computation to hourly rates, was also covered by the act. \n14\n It is likewise abundantly clear from the words of section 7 that the unit of time under that section within which to distinguish regular from overtime is the week. 'No employer shall ... employ any of his employees ... (1) for a workweek longer that forty-four hours ....' Sec. 7(a)(1).15 \n\n[316 \nU.S. 572, 580]\n\u00a0\n No problem is presented in assimilating the computation of overtime for employees under contract for a fixed weekly wage for regular contract hours which are the actual hours worked,16 to similar computations for employees on hourly rates. Where the employment contract is for a weekly wage with variable or fluctuating hours the same method of computation produces the regular rate for each week. As that rate is on an hourly basis, it is regular in the statutory sense inasmuch as the rate per hour does not vary for the entire week, though week by week the regular rate varies with the number of hours worked. It is true that the longer the hours the less the rate and the pay per hour. This is not an argument, however, against this method of determining the regular rate of employment for the week in question. Apart from the Act if there is a fixed weekly wage regardless of the length of the workweek, the longer the hours the less are the earnings per hour. This method of computation has been approved by each circuit court of appeals which has considered such problems. See Warren-Bradshaw Drilling Co. v. Hall, 5 Cir., 124 F.2d 42, 44; Bumpus v. Continental Baking Co., 6 Cir., 124 F.2d 549, 552, cf. Carleton Screw Products Co. v. Fleming, 8 Cir., 126 F.2d 537, 541. It is this quotient which is the 'regular rate at which an employee is employed' under contracts of the types described and applied in this paragraph for fixed weekly compensation for hours, certain or variable. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n[316 \nU.S. 572, 581]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner invokes the presumption that contracting parties contemplate compliance with law and contends that accordingly there is no warrant for construing the contract as paying the employee only his base pay or 'regular rate,' regardless of hours worked. It is true that the wage paid was sufficiently large to cover both base pay and fifty per cent additional for the hours actually worked over the statutory maximum without violating section six. But there was no contractual limit upon the hours which petitioner could have required respondent to work for the agreed wage, had he seen fit to do so, and no provision for additional pay in the event the hours worked required minimum compensation greater than the fixed wage. Implication cannot mend a contract so deficient in complying with the law. This contract differs from the one in Walling v. A. H. Belo Corp., \n316 \nU.S. 624\n, 62 S.Ct. 1223, 86 L.Ed. --, decided today, where the contract specified an hourly rate and not less than time and a half for overtime, with a guaranty of a fixed weekly sum, and required the employer to pay more than the weekly guaranty where the hours worked at the contract rate exceeded that sum.\n In the Circuit Court of Appeals18 it was held that the liquidated damages provision, section 16(b) of the Act, 52 Stat. 1069, was mandatory on the courts, regardless of the good \n\n[316 \nU.S. 572, 582]\n\u00a0\n faith of the employer or the reasonableness of his attitude. Petitioner attacks this conclusion as a denial of due process because if the damage provision is mandatory, the employer is 'without opportunity to test the issues before the courts,' citing Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123\n, 28 S.Ct. 441, 13 L.R.A.,N.S., 932, 14 Ann.Cas. 764, Wadley Southern R. Co. v. Georgia, \n235 \nU.S. 651\n, 35 S.Ct. 214, and other similar cases. Petitioner points out that if there was a failure to pay the statutory overtime, it resulted from an inability to determine whether the employee was covered by the Act.\n Section 13(b)(1)19 exempts from section 7 employees for whom the Interstate Commerce Commission has power to establish maximum hours of service. This exemption was derived from the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 543, 49 U.S.C.A.  304, which authorized the Commission to regulate 'maximum hours of service of employees.' A definitive order leaving employees with the duties of respondent subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act was not passed by the Commission until March 4, 1941,20 after respondent's employment ended. This conclusion, however, was foreshadowed by the ruling of the Commission, December 29, 193721 that it would limit regulations concerning maximum hours to employees whose functions affected the safety of operations. Other orders, bulletins and opinions pointing to the final conclusion intervened. \n22\n These various determinations now make it clear that respondent \n\n[316 \nU.S. 572, 583]\n\u00a0\n was subject at all times since the effective date of the Fair Labor Standards Act to its provisions. The Interstate Commerce Commission never had the power to regulate his hours.\n Perplexing as petitioner's problem may have been, the difficulty does not warrant shifting the burden to the employee. The wages were specified for him by the statute,23 and he was no more at fault than the employer. The liquidated damages for failure to pay the minimum wages under sections 6(a) and 7(a) are compensation, not a penalty or punishment by the Government. \n24\n Cf. Huntington v. Attrill, \n146 \nU.S. 657, 667\n, 668 S., 674, 681, 13 S.Ct. 224, 227, 228, 230, 233; Cox v. Lykes Brothers, 237 N.Y. 376, 143 N.E. 226. The retention of a workman's pay may well result in damages too obscure \n\n[316 \nU.S. 572, 584]\n\u00a0\n and difficult of proof for estimate other than by liquidated damages. Atchison, etc., R. Co. v. Nichols, \n264 \nU.S. 348, 351\n, 44 S.Ct. 353, 354; James-Dickinson Farm Mortg. Co. v. Harry, \n273 \nU.S. 119\n, 47 S. Ct. 308. Nor can it be said that the exaction is violative of due process. It is not a threat of criminal proceedings or prohibitive fines, such as have been held beyond legislative power by the authorities cited by petitioner. Even double damages treated as penalties have been upheld as within constitutional power. \n25\n\u00a0\n\nAFFIRMED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE concurs in the result.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS dissents. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 7.

The Joint Resolution of June 26, 1940, for work relief and relief for the fiscal year 1941, Sec. 3(f) deals with piece work in Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands. 54 Stat. 611, 616, 29 U.S. C.A.  206(a)(5). \n[\nFootnote 14\n] Any other interpretation would render almost useless the exemptions from the act of employees in 'executive, administrative, professional, or local retailing capacity, or in the capacity of outside salesman.' Sec. 13(a)(1). Such employees are rarely paid by the hour. \n[\nFootnote 15\n] The legislative history of the Fair Labor Standards Act is inconclusive as to the intended meaning of the words 'the regular rate at which he is employed.' The committee reports do not discuss them. The bill which came out of the Conference and was adopted changed 'regular hourly rate' of previous bills (S. 2475, introduced May 24, 1937; H.R. 7200, introduced May 24, 1937; and S. 2475 in the Senate, April 20, Calendar Day May 25, 1938) to 'regular rate.' Conference Report, 83 Cong.Rec. 9247, 75th Cong., 3rd Sess. 'Hourly' may have been omitted as not descriptive of piecework or salary payments. \n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] Wage divided by hours equals regular rate. Time and a half regular rate for hours employed beyond statutory maximum equals compensation for overtime hours. \n[\nFootnote 17\n] This has been the Administrator's interpretation of the Act. Interpretative Bulletin No. 4 issued October 21, 1938, revised November, 1940. While the interpretative bulletins are not issued as regulations under statutory authority, they do carry persuasiveness as an expression of the view of those experienced in the administration of the Act and acting with the advice of a staff specializing in its interpretation and application.

Alabama Asphaltic Limestone Co., \n315 \nU.S. 179\n, 62 S.Ct. 540, 86 L.Ed. --, decided this day. This, too, was an insolvency reorganization, though a different procedure was employed to consummate it. The old corporation had outstanding about $ 300,000 face amount of first mortgage bonds, secured by a lien on its realty. The property, which was an hotel, was leased to an operating company. In 1931, as a result of transactions not relevant here, one Pinney became the sole stockholder of the old corporation and of the operating company. The furniture and fixtures in the hotel were owned by the operating company. They were covered by a chattel mortgage which, together with the lease on the hotel, were assigned and pledged as part of the security for the bond issue. In 1931 both companies were in financial difficulties and insolvent, at least in the equity sense. A bondholders' committee was formed which received deposits of more than half of the face amount of the bonds. Petitioner was formed in 1932. Pursuant to the plan of reorganization six shares of petitioner's preferred stock and four shares of its common stock were issued to assenting bondholders for each $ 1000 bond. In addition all of petitioner's remaining common stock was issued to one Lacoe in return for his agreement to pay the costs of incorporating petitioner up to $1000 and for his agreement to lend money to petitioner. Before the actual issuance of \n\n[315 \nU.S. 185, 187]\n\u00a0\n any of the shares, Lacoe agreed to transfer 1,000 shares of the common stock to Pinney, the sole stockholder of the two companies, for his services in the reorganization and as an inducement to him to continue as manager of the hotel. None of the stock of petitioner, however, was issued to any stockholder or former stockholder of either of the companies for any rights any of them had as stockholders. In May, 1932, the indenture trustee declared the principal of the bonds due and payable. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture, the trustee sold all of the properties of the old corporation, including the lease and chattel mortgage, to petitioner, the highest bidder. The bid price was $61,800. It was satisfied by the payment of about $18,700 in cash and by the delivery to the trustee of bonds of a face amount of $292,000 for the balance. Foreclosure proceedings against the old corporation and the operating company were then instituted. At the foreclosure sale the furniture and fixtures, comprising all of the property of the operating company, were bought in by petitioner.\n The Commissioner, in determining a deficiency in petitioner's income and excess profits tax for the fiscal year ended May 31, 1936, disallowed depreciation deductions on both the realty and personal property on the basis of cost to the old corporation and operating company. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[315 \nU.S. 185, 188]\n\u00a0\n He used as the basis the cost of the assets to petitioner plus the cost of additions. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the Commissioner's determination with respect to the personal property but rejected it with respect to the realty. The Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the Commissioner on both points. 9 Cir., 119 F.2d 846.\n Though the petition for certiorari raised the question, petitioner now concedes that the acquisition of the furniture and fixtures from the operating company was not a 'reorganization' within the meaning of  112(i)( 1)(A) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 513. So we do not reach that issue. As respects the assets acquired from the old corporation, we think there was a 'reorganization' within the meaning of  112(i)(1)(A) of the 1932 Act. That provision is the same in the 1932 Act as in the 1928 Act which was involved in Helvering v. Alabama Asphaltic Limestone Co., supra. That case is determinative of this controversy. The transaction fits the literal language of the statute. The new corporation acquired the assets directly at the trustee's and the foreclosure sales. The legal procedure employed by the creditors is not material. The critical facts are that the old corporation was insolvent and that its creditors took steps to obtain effective com- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 185, 189]\n\u00a0\n mand over its property. For the reasons stated in Helvering v. Alabama Asphaltic Limestone Co., supra, the creditors at that time acquired the equivalent of the proprietary interest of the old equity owner. Accordingly, the continuity of interest test is satisfied.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 113(a)(7) of the 1932 Act, 47 Stat. 169, 198, 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev.Acts, page 516, provides in part:\n'(a) Basis (Unadjusted) of Property.-The basis of property shall be the cost of such property; except that-\n\n'(7) Transfers to corporation where control of property remains in same persons. If the property was acquired after December 31, 1917, by a corporation in connection with a reorganization, and immediately after the transfer an interest or control in such property of 50 per centum or more remained in the same persons or any of them, then the basis shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferor, increased in the amount of gain or decreased in the amount of loss recognized to the transferor upon such transfer under the law applicable to the year in which the transfer was made.'\n\n That provision is applicable here. See,  114(a),  113(b), 113(a)(12) of the Revenue Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 680, 26 U.S.C.A Int.Rev.Acts, pages 701, 700. The property here involved was acquired after February 28, 1913, in a taxable year prior to January 1, 1934, as required by  113(a)(12). Respondent argues that this transaction was not a 'reorganization' within the meaning of  113(a) (7). And he points out that 'control' was not in the participating creditors since the majority of the new common stock had been distributed, for a consideration other than an exchange of bonds, to Lacoe and Pinney. But he does not contend that assuming there was a 'reorganization', an 'interest' in the property of 50 per cent or more did not remain in the same persons (the bondholders) immediately after the transfer. \n\n\n\n\n","92":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEARCE v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1942)\nNo. 306\nArgued: February 5, 1942Decided: March 9, 1942\n\n\n\n\n\n[315 \nU.S. 543, 545]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Gordon S. P. Kleeberg, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Gordon B. Tweedy, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner and her husband separated in 1913. There was an agreement providing for monthly payments by the husband for her support. That agreement was amended in 1916 so as to provide monthly payments to her of $ 500 for life. Her husband, however, was given an option to terminate the arrangement by purchasing an annuity contract from a life insurance company which would pay petitioner $500 a month for the rest of her life. In 1917 petitioner obtained an absolute divorce in Texas, her husband entering a personal appearance. Neither alimony nor a property settlement was mentioned in the divorce decree. There were no children. Several months after the divorce Mr. Pearce purchased an annuity from an insurance company for petitioner's benefit. The annuity provided for a payment of $ 500 per month during her life.\n Neither petitioner nor Mr. Pearce included the $6000 received by her under the annuity contract in their federal \n\n[315 \nU.S. 543, 546]\n\u00a0\n income tax returns for 1935 and 1936. The Commissioner sent deficiency notices to both of them. Each appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals. At the hearing the Commissioner contended that the payments were income of petitioner. The Board upheld that contention. 42 B.T.A. 91. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Board, one judge dissenting. 2 Cir., 120 F.2d 228. We granted the petition for certiorari, \n314 \nU.S. 593\n, 62 S.Ct. 98, 86 L.Ed. --, because of the manner in which that court applied the rule of Helvering v. Fitch, \n309 \nU.S. 149\n, 60 S.Ct. 427, and Helvering v. Leonard, \n310 \nU.S. 80\n, 60 S.Ct. 780, in case the ex-wife rather than the husband was sought to be taxed on alleged alimony payments.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reached the conclusion that petitioner was liable by the following line of reasoning. The determination of the Commissioner that the monthly payments were income of petitioner was presumptively correct; the burden to show error rested on petitioner. Welch v. Helvering, \n290 \nU.S. 111, 115\n, 54 S.Ct. 8, 9. Error might be shown by submitting 'clear and convincing proof' (Helvering v. Fitch, supra, 309 U.S. page 156, 60 S.Ct. page 430) that the payments were made pursuant to a continuing obligation of her former husband to provide for her support, so as to make the rule of Douglas v. Willcuts, \n296 \nU.S. 1\n, 56 S.Ct. 59, 101 A.L.R. 391, applicable. The burden of establishing error is not sustained by a divorced wife merely by showing that an obligation of her former husband might have continued despite the divorce. Since it is doubtful and uncertain under Texas law whether petitioner's former husband was discharged of his marital obligation by the settlement in question, petitioner failed to show that the presumptively correct determination that she was liable was erroneous.\n We do no think that that was a correct application of the rule of the Fitch and Leonard cases. Those cases hold that the income is taxable to the former husband not only \n\n[315 \nU.S. 543, 547]\n\u00a0\n where it is clear that payments to his ex-wife were made pursuant to a continuing liability created by his contract or by local law but also where his undertaking or local law makes that question doubtful or uncertain. Those cases, like Douglas v. Willcuts, supra, involved situations where the divorced husband was sought to be taxed on payments to his ex-wife. But the rule which they express supplies the criteria for determining, in absence of a different statutory formula, whether payments received by the ex-wife are properly taxable to her or to her divorced husband. If the Commissioner proceeds against the ex-wife, she sustains her burden of rebutting his presumptively correct determination merely by showing doubts and uncertainties as to whether the payments were made pursuant to her former husband's continuing obligation to support her. If the Commissioner proceeds against her former husband he sustains his burden by submitting clear and convincing proof that the payments were not made pursuant to any such continuing obligation. Helvering v. Fuller, \n310 \nU.S. 69\n, 60 S.Ct. 784. The other course would make the liability of the divorced wife or the divorced husband wholly dependent on the election of the Commissioner to proceed against one rather than the other where, for example, local law was uncertain. But the rule of Douglas v. Willcuts, supra, rests on a more substantial basis. Its roots are in local law and the undertakings of the husband. It calls for the use of the same criteria whether the husband or the wife is sought to be taxed.\n We think, however, that petitioner has not maintained her burden in this case. Her former husband was not under a continuing contractual obligation to contribute to her support. For the agreement made in 1916 provided for the termination of his personal obligation to make payments to her in the event that he purchased \n\n[315 \nU.S. 543, 548]\n\u00a0\n the designated annuity. And so far as Texas law is concerned, she has not maintained her burden. Her showing as to Texas law is illustrated by the following.\n By statute in Texas alimony may be awarded during the pendency of a suit for a divorce 'until a final decree shall be made in the case'. Vernon's Ann.Civ.St. Art. 4637. 'This statute is exclusive in its very nature, and no alimony can be decreed by any court in this state except under its express terms.' Martin v. Martin, Tex.Com.App., 17 S.W.2d 789, 791, 792. It has been broadly stated in Phillips v. Phillips, Tex.Civ.App., 203 S.W. 77, 79 that, 'In this state the legal duty of the husband to support his wife ceases upon the severance of the marital bonds, nor has a court the power to decree that a husband or his property may be subjected to such support after divorce. Permanent alimony is not provided for by Texas statutes.' And see Pape v. Pape, 13 Tex.Civ.App. 99, 35 S.W. 479; Boyd v. Boyd, 22 Tex.Civ.App. 200, 54 S.W. 380. It is, however, provided by statute that the divorce court shall order 'a division of the estate of the parties in such a way as the court shall deem just and right, having due regard to the rights of each party and their children, if any.' Vernon's Ann.Civ.St. Art. 4638. That power extends not only to community property but to the separate property of the husband. Ex parte Scott, 133 Tex. 1, 123 S.W.2d 306; Clark v. Clark, Tex.Civ.App., 35 S.W.2d 189; Berg v. Berg, Tex.Civ.App., 115 S.W.2d 1171; Keton v. Clark, Tex.Civ.App., 67 S. W.2d 437. At times the divorce court has made such a division of the estate as apparently to impose on the husband a personal obligation to make stated payments to his wife. Wiley v. Wiley, 33 Tex. 358. Furthermore, a divorce decree which does not settle the rights of the parties to community property may not preclude a subsequent suit by the wife to establish her rights in it. See Gray v. Thomas, 83 Tex. 246, 18 S.W. 721. And the decree may \n\n[315 \nU.S. 543, 549]\n\u00a0\n be corrected to conform to the intention of the parties. Keller v. Keller, 135 Tex. 260, 141 S.W.2d 308. The power of the court to modify a property settlement previously approved, so as to give the wife an interest in property not covered by the earlier decree, has been denied in absence of fraud or mistake. Cannon v. Cannon, Tex.Civ.App., 43 S.W.2d 134. Petitioner challenges the reliability of the latter case because on appeal the case was dismissed for want of jurisdiction (121 Tex. 634), which meant either disagreement with the reasoning but approval of the result, or lack of jurisdiction. Vernon's Ann.Civ.St. Art. 1728. And see Republic Ins. Co. v. Highland Park Independent School Dist., 133 Tex. 545, 125 S.W. 2d 270.\n We need not, however, endeavor to resolve that doubt. Nor need we speculate as to the power of the court at some future time to order a division of property in this case and as an incident thereto to impose on petitioner's husband a personal obligation as was apparently done by the divorce decree in Wiley v. Wiley, supra. See 6 Tex.L.Rev. 344 discussing Helm v. Helm, Tex.Civ.App., 291 S.W. 648. For even though petitioner established that the divorce court retained that broad power, not specifically reserved, and even though we assume that the power to make a division of property is the equivalent of a power to provide permanent alimony, she has not maintained her burden of rebutting the presumptively correct determination of the Commissioner that the income from this annuity contract was taxable to her. In order to maintain that burden she would have to show that it was at least doubtful and uncertain whether the Texas court, as an incident of its power to require the husband to support his wife, retained control over this annuity contract or the income from it. That at least is the result unless we are to broaden the base on which the Fitch, Fuller, and Leonard cases rest. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 543, 550]\n\u00a0\n Those cases involved so-called alimony trusts. In each the trust was irrevocable. In each the husband had an obligation to support his wife.\n In the Fitch case the trust provided that the wife was to receive during her life $600 a month from the income of the trust property; the husband, the balance. We held that the husband had not shown by 'clear and convincing proof' that 'in Iowa divorce law the court has lost all jurisdiction to alter or revise the amount of income payable to the wife from an enterprise which has been placed in trust. For all that we know it might retain the power to reallocate the income from that property even though it lacked the power to add to or subtract from the corpus or to tap other sources of income. If it did have such power, then it could be said that a decree approving an alimony trust of the kind here involved merely placed upon the pre-existing duty of the husband a particular and specified sanction.' 309 U.S. at page 156, 60 S.Ct. at page 430. And in speaking of the alimony trust involved in Douglas v. Willcuts, supra, we stated (309 U.S. pages 151, 152, 60 S.Ct. page 428 ): 'It is plain that there the alimony trust, which was approved by the divorce decree, was merely security for a continuing obligation of the taxpayer to support his divorced wife. That was made evident not only by his agreement to make up any deficiencies in the $15,000 annual sum to be paid her under the trust. It was also confirmed by the power of the Minnesota divorce court subsequently to alter and revise its decree and the provisions made therein for the wife's benefit. Likewise consistent with the use of the alimony trust as a security device was the provision that on death of the divorced wife the corpus of the trust was to be transferred back to the taxpayer.'\n In the Leonard case income from the trust was to be paid to the wife for her life which together with income from other property was estimated at $30,000 a year. A separa- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 543, 551]\n\u00a0\n tion agreement provided that the husband would pay his wife an additional $ 35,000 each year during her life so that her aggregate net income for the maintenance of herself and her children would be $65,000 a year. The separation agreement also provided that in the event the husband's ability to make the annual payment of $35,000 became impaired he might apply to a court for a reduction of his obligation of not less than $10,000 a year. We held that the husband had not sustained his burden of showing that 'local law and the alimony trust' gave him 'a full discharge' from his obligation to support his wife. 310 U.S. page 86, 60 S.Ct. page 784. The trust and the undertaking in the separation agreement were integral parts of an arrangement by which the 'maintenance and support' of the wife 'were secured'. 310 U.S. page 85, 60 S.Ct. page 783. We noted that it was not clear under New York law whether or not such a settlement could be remade by the court, though there was some authority which indicated that the divorce court's reserved power might be exercised 'where the provision in the separate agreement, approved by the decree, is for support and maintenance'. 310 U.S. pages 86, 87, 60 S.Ct. page 784. In view of that fact and the nature of the settlement, we concluded that the husband had not shown that the trust was not mere security for his continuing obligation to support his wife.\n In the Fuller case it was clear under Nevada law that the court retained no control over the divorce decree which approved the trust settlement. Since there was no such reserved power and since the trust contained no contractual undertaking by the husband for support of the wife, we concluded that his obligation to support had been pro tanto discharged. We held, however, that the husband was taxable on a $40 weekly payment which he had agreed to make to his wife. But that fact did not make him taxable on income from the trust also, since the provision for weekly payments and the trust 'were not so interrelated or interdependent as to make the trust a security for the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 543, 552]\n\u00a0\n weekly payments.' 310 U.S. page 73, 60 S.Ct. page 786. We also noted (310 U.S. page 76, 60 S.Ct. page 787) that though 'the divorce decree extinguishes the husband's pre-existing duty to support the wife, and though no provision of the trust agreement places such obligation on him, that agreement may nevertheless leave him with sufficient interest in or control over the trust as to make him the owner of the corpus for purposes of the federal income tax' under the rule of Helvering v. Clifford, \n309 \nU.S. 331\n, 60 S.Ct. 554.\n Thus a property settlement made for the purpose of maintaining or supporting the wife may be treated for income tax purposes as mere security for the husband's continuing obligation dependent on such considerations as whether it contains, or is interrelated with, contractual obligations of the husband for her support; whether the court has a reserved power to alter or modify it; or whether the husband retains any substantial interest in the property conveyed. Where the settlement carries some of the earmarks of a security device, then the power of the court to add to the husband's personal obligations may be especially significant. See Helvering v. Leonard, supra. But where, as here, the settlement appears to be absolute and outright and on its face vests in the wife the indicia of complete ownership, it will be treated as that which it purports to be in absence of evidence that it was only a security device for the husband's continuing obligation to support. There may be difficulty in placing a particular case on one side of the line rather than the other. But as stated by Mr. Justice Holmes in Irwin v. Gavit, \n268 \nU.S. 161, 168\n, 45 S.Ct. 475, 476, 'That is the question in pretty much everything worth arguing in the law.' And see Harrison v. Schaffner, \n312 \nU.S. 579, 583\n, 61 S.Ct. 759, 762\n\n\n As we have said, petitioner has made no showing whatsoever that the Texas court retained the power to reallocate the income from this annuity contract or to control it in any way as an incident of its power to require the husband \n\n[315 \nU.S. 543, 553]\n\u00a0\n to support the wife. She has not shown that the divorce court imposed any personal obligation on the husband in respect to the settlement in question. And she is not aided by those cases which enforce agreements of the husband to make periodic payments to the wife. See Johnson v. Johnson, Tex.Com.App., 14 S.W.2d 805. There is no such agreement here. Proof that the Texas court might add to the husband's personal obligations as an incident to a future property settlement is no substitute for proof that the court had the power to remake this property settlement after it was consummated. Hence there is no ground for concluding that this settlement which is absolute on its face is mere security for an obligation of a husband to support his wife.\n'The correct ground for refusing to tax such income to the husband is merely that it is the lump sum which discharges him and not the future income received by the wife.' Paul, Five Years with Douglas v. Willcuts, 53 Harv.L.Rev. 1, 17, note 44. We noted in Helvering v. Fuller, supra, 310 U.S. page 74, 60 S.Ct. page 787, that outright transfers of property to the wife, though providing for her maintenance and support, were no different from cases 'where any debtor, voluntarily or under the compulsion of a court decree, transfers securities, a farm, an office building, or the like, to his creditor in whole or partial payment of his debt.' We do not think that it would be proper to extend the rule of Douglas v. Willcuts, supra, to such a situation. The possibility that the divorce court might add to the husband's personal obligation does not alter the result. As in the Fuller case, the transfer of property to the wife might result only in a partial discharge of the husband's obligation. If the husband undertook, or was directed, to make other payments, he might be taxable on them. But the fact that he is taxable on a part of the payments received by the wife does not necessarily make him taxable on all. Helvering v. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 543, 554]\n\u00a0\n Fuller, supra, 310 U.S. page 73, 60 S.Ct. page 786. Hence the statement in Helvering v. Fitch, supra, 309 U.S. page 156, 60 S.Ct. page 430, that it must be clear 'that local law and the alimony trust have given the divorced husband a full discharge and leave no continuing obligation however contingent' is to be read in light of the fact that the alimony trust in that case was deemed to be a mere security device for the husband's continuing obligation to support. For the husband was relieved from payment of the tax on income from the property settlement in the Fuller case though he had a continuing obligation to pay the wife $40 a week.\n\n If the rule of Douglas v. Willcuts, supra, is not to be extended to this type of case, then on the showing which has been made the husband would have sustained his burden in case the Commissioner had proceeded against him. Cf. Mitchell v. Commissioner, 38 B.T.A. 1336. Clearly then, the wife may not escape.\n Such cases as Helvering v. Horst, \n311 \nU.S. 112\n, 61 S.Ct. 144, 131 A.L.R. 655, Helvering v. Eubank, \n311 \nU.S. 122\n, 61 S.Ct. 149, and Harrison v. Schaffner, supra, are not opposed to this result. Those cases dealt with situations where the taxpayer had made assignments of income from property. He was held taxable on the income assigned by reason of the principle 'that the power to dispose of income is the equivalent of ownership of it and that the exercise of the power to procure its payment to another, whether to pay a debt or to make a gift, is within the reach' of the federal income tax law. Harrison v. Schaffner, supra, 312 U.S. page 580, 61 S.Ct. page 760. But in those cases the donor or grantor had 'parted with no substantial interest in property other than the specified payments of income'. Id., 312 U.S. page 583, 61 S.Ct. page 762. Here he has parted with the corpus. And 'the tax is upon income as to which, in the general application of the revenue acts, the tax liability attaches to ownership.' Blair v. Commissioner, \n300 \nU.S. 5, 12\n, 57 S.Ct. 330, 333. Finally, there is no barrier under the income tax laws to taxing the holder of \n\n[315 \nU.S. 543, 555]\n\u00a0\n an annuity on the income received, however his interest in the fund which produces the income may be described. Cf. Irwin v. Gavit, supra.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, dissenting.\n The social fact that a husband is normally under a responsibility to provide for his wife even after they are divorced is the basis for the rule that monies received by a wife under a divorce settlement are presumed to be in discharge of a continuing obligation of the husband. I therefore agree with the decision of the Court to the extent that it reinforces this rule as a rule of policy, and not one of caprice varying with the sex of the taxpayer against whom the Commissioner chooses to proceed. I agree that if the Commissioner proceeds against the wife, 'she sustains her burden of rebutting his presumptively correct determination merely by showing doubts and uncertainties as to whether the payments were made pursuant to her former husband's continuing obligation to support her', and that if, on the other hand, the Commissioner determines that the payments are taxable to the husband, the latter sustains his burden only 'by submitting clear and convincing proof that the payments were not made pursuant to any such continuing obligation.' But I do not agree that the petitioner has failed to make the showing which is required under the rule professed by the Court.\n Local law may provide that the transfer of property under a divorce settlement finally and definitively terminates a husband's obligation to support his wife, and that, once such a settlement is made, the wife loses her right to apply to a court for an order requiring the husband to support her. If the local law gives the settlement such effect, it is immaterial what the nature of the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 543, 556]\n\u00a0\n transferred property is. For in such a case the income derived from the property cannot be regarded as conferring any benefit upon the husband, and it is therefore taxable to the wife. On the other hand, local law may provide that even though a husband has made a complete, irrevocable transfer of property, he has nevertheless not obtained a full discharge of his marital obligations to his wife, and that, where circumstances in the future may warrant, a court can order the husband to make further contributions to her support. In such a case the husband is still under a 'continuing obligation however contingent', Helvering v. Fitch, \n309 \nU.S. 149, 156\n, 60 S.Ct. 427, 430; Helvering v. Leonard, \n310 \nU.S. 80, 84\n, 60 S.Ct. 780, 783, and since the income received by the wife from the property contributes to her support and thus serves to discharge the obligation which under local law the husband still owes her, the income should be taxable to him. 'The dominant purpose of the revenue laws is the taxation of income to those who earn or otherwise create the right to receive it and enjoy the benefit of it when paid.' Helvering v. Horst, \n311 \nU.S. 112, 119\n, 61 S.Ct. 144, 148, 131 A.L.R. 655; and see Harrison v. Schaffner, \n312 \nU.S. 579\n, 61 S.Ct. 759.\n The fact that the wife may, years after the settlement, have to go to court for an order requiring the husband to make additional payments for her support is of no legal consequence if the husband may be required to make such payments. A legal obligation may continue even though its burden is contingent upon future judicial action. A wife's receipt of income from property settled upon her may make it unnecessary to her ever to apply for a court order. But it does not follow that unless and until she goes to court for such an order, her husband is under no legal obligation to support her. If the income from the property should dwindle to the point where the wife can no longer maintain herself, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 543, 557]\n\u00a0\n and the law has continued its hold upon the husband so that he may be required to make further contributions to her support, then plainly the husband is still under a 'continuing obligation however contingent'. The determinative fact is that the law has continued its hold upon the husband, not that it has reserved the power to modify the particular settlement.\n It is utterly immaterial whether the property transferred was an irrevocable trust, as in the Fitch and Leonard cases, or an annuity contract, as we have here. For the annuity is taxable income, Irwin v. Gavit, \n268 \nU.S. 161\n, 45 S.Ct. 475, and the procurement, by the husband's purchase, of its payment to his wife renders the annuity taxable income to him if it is in discharge of his obligation, quite as much as if he had procured the payment by creating a trust of his property. Harrison v. Schaffner, supra.\n In every case the decisive inquiry is whether the husband's obligation subsists after the divorce settlement, or whether, as a result of the settlement, he is quits of his wife, once and for all, for better or for worse. If he is under a continuing obligation, the property transferred, whether it be an irrevocable trust or an annuity contract, is a security device only in the sense that it operates to secure the fulfillment of the obligation. If the fact that the husband has divested himself of control over the transferred property were determinative, certainly the Fitch and Leonard cases, at least, would have been decided the other way. For in each of these cases the husband conveyed an absolutely irrevocable trust, over which he had no greater control than the husband has over the annuity in the case before us. These cases show that if a husband is under a continuing obligation to support his wife, income from the property is taxable to him not because he has retained any interest in or control over the property, but because the income dis- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 543, 558]\n\u00a0\n charges pro tanto a legal obligation which he owes and thus confers a taxable benefit upon him. The ultimate criterion of taxability, therefore, is not whether a state court has reserved power to control the property transferred by a husband under a divorce settlement, but whether 'the court lacks the power to add to his personal obligations'. Helvering v. Leonard, \n310 \nU.S. 80, 87\n, 60 S.Ct. 780, 784.\n In law as in life lines have to be drawn. But the fact that a line has to be drawn somewhere does not justify its being drawn anywhere. The line must follow some direction of policy, whether rooted in logic or experience. Lines should not be drawn simply for the sake of drawing lines.\n The decisions of this Court dealing with the question before us have turned upon whether local law was uncertain as to the existence of a continuing obligation on the part of the husband to support the wife. The opinion of the Court now introduces another element, namely, whether the local law is uncertain as to the power of the state courts to remake the particular settlement. This, it seems to me, has no valid relation to the basic principle of tax liability that 'he who receives benefits should be taxed'. Whether a husband is benefited from the payment of monies to his divorced wife depends upon his obligation to her which the payment of the monies served to discharge, not upon the nature of the wife's interest in the property he has transferred to her. To introduce such an unwarranted refinement is to clog the administration of the revenue laws.\n But, in any event, all of the judges of the Circuit Court of Appeals were agreed that 'the law of Texas is uncertain as to whether the taxpayer's husband discharged himself of his marital liability by the settlement at bar.' 2 Cir., 120 F.2d 228, 230. This general uncertainty as to Texas law is \n\n[315 \nU.S. 543, 559]\n\u00a0\n controverted now not by controlling Texas authority but by extended argumentation and speculation. The Court suggests that had the Commissioner gone against the husband, he would have sustained the burden as heretofore defined, namely of showing, 'by submitting clear and convincing proof', that under local law he was under no continuing obligation. Support for the proposition is drawn not from any Texas authority, whether statute or decision, but from a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, Mitchell v. Commissioner, 38 B.T.A. 1336. But in that case there was a division of property between husband and wife, which included property belonging to the wife under an earlier arrangement entirely unrelated to the husband's marital obligations. The Board held that the income from such property could not, therefore, be taxed to the husband. As its opinion shows, the decision did not turn on the Texas law of divorce: 'We think that the trust income which was paid to her (the wife ) ... was her separate income. It was not paid in satisfaction of any legal obligation of J. A. Mitchell (the husband) and it is not taxable to him.' 38 B.T.A. at page 1342.\n The Court's exegesis of Texas law shows it to be no less uncertain than was the Iowa law in the Fitch case or the New York law in the Leonard case. The effect of the Court's ruling that the wife, in order to escape tax liability, must clearly establish that the state court has reserved the power to modify the terms of the particular property settlement is to reject the rule of policy enunciated earlier in its opinion. For there is no clear Texas authority, and under the rule of the Fitch and Leonard cases, which the Court does not purport to modify, the husband would be unable to show, 'not by mere inference and conjecture but by 'clear and convincing proof\" (Helvering v. Leonard, supra, 310 U.S. at page 86, 60 S. Ct. at page 784; see Helvering v. Fitch, supra, 309 U.S. at page 156, 60 S.Ct. at page 430), that the payments made to his wife did not discharge a con- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 543, 560]\n\u00a0\n tinuing obligation which he owed her. Therefore, liability under the tax law is made actually to depend upon whether the Commissioner elects to go against the husband or the wife. Having closed the front door to determination of tax liability by caprice, the Court allows caprice to enter through the back door of 'presumption'.\n We brought this case here in order to clarify an important question arising under the federal revenue laws, not to re-examine the correctness of the lower court's finding regarding the uncertainty of Texas law as applied to this case. The general uncertainty of Texas law with respect to control over divorce settlements is conceded-and that is the decisive factor for our purpose. The absence of specific Texas authority dealing with such an annuity settlement as we have here does not lessen or remove that uncertainty, or justify us in making assumptions regarding the Texas law affecting such a settlement. Where prophecy as to a state court's ruling on its local law is not imperatively required of us, experience counsels abstention from prophecy. No ruling of ours can make Texas law.\n I believe therefore that the judgment below should be reversed because of the ruling on federal law as to which we all agree, and that Texas law should be left where the Circuit Court of Appeals found it.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE joins in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","93":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPECHEUR LOZENGE CO. v.

There was diversity of citizenship and the bill of complaint alleged that 'this suit arises under the Trademark Laws of the United States' and that petitioner's wrapper design 'was registered in the United States Patent Office by the plaintiff on May 1, 1936, under the No. 47748'. It prayed treble damages 'in accordance with the provisions of the Trademark Law of 1905', 15 U.S.C.A.  96, and was amended to allege registration of a second wrapper design in the Patent Office under the No. 46862.\n A decree for petitioner, D.C., 36 F.Supp. 730, was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 122 F.2d 318. Both courts below having failed to consider or apply local law, we granted certiorari, \n314 \nU.S. 603\n, 62 S.Ct. 182, 183, 86 L.Ed. --, in order to determine whether local law or federal law should \n\n[315 \nU.S. 666, 667]\n\u00a0\n have been applied in a suit for infringement of a trademark registered under the Trade-Mark Act of 1905, 33 Stat. 724, 15 U.S.C.A.  81 et seq., and we requested counsel 'to present their views as to whether State law governs and, if so, what the applicable State law is.'\n The opinions below, the printed record and the petition for certiorari give no indication that the suit was not founded upon a trademark registered under the 1905 Act, as the bill of complaint had make it appear. But an examination of the original exhibits, not printed in the record, and of petitioner's brief on the merits here, discloses that the registration referred to is that of petitioner's labels under the Copyright Law of the United States, 17 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq., and not registration under the Trademark Law. It thus appears that petitioner has alleged no cause of action unde the Copyright Law and is not entitled to the benefits of registration under the Trademark Law. The only cause of action that this record could possibly support is for unfair competition and common law 'trademark infringement', to which local law applies. See Fashion Guild v.

Demuth, of Washington, D.C., for respondent. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 332, 333]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was begun in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin by the petitioner, a widow, as sole beneficiary of a policy of United States Government life insurance issued to her deceased husband, Doctor Lawrence W. Pence. The only contested issue was raised by the Government's affirmative defense that the policy had been reinstated as the result of fraudulent representations in Doctor Pence's application for reinstatement of the policy after it had lapsed for nonpayment of premium.\n At the close of the evidence in the trial court the Government moved for a directed verdict in its favor. The trial judge withheld a ruling on the motion under Rule 50(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, and submitted the case to the jury, which returned a general verdict for the petitioner. The Government then moved under Rule 50(b) for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and, in the alternative, for a new trial. The trial judge denied both motions and entered judgment on the verdict for the petitioner. The Government appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which held, with one judge dissenting, that the evidence was insufficient to establish a case for the consideration of the jury and that there was no independent ground requiring that a new trial be granted. It reversed the judgment of the District Court and remanded the cause for further proceedings in harmony with its opinion. 121 F.2d 804. We granted certiorari. \n314 \nU.S. 602\n, 62 S. Ct. 185, 86 L.Ed. --.\n Petitioner contends that the evidence raised a question of fact for the consideration of the jury, and that the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 332, 334]\n\u00a0\n decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals therefore denies her the right to trial by jury. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Doctor Pence had been a physician and medical officer in the military service of the United States from August 7, 1918, to January 9, 1919. While in the service he obtained a $10,000 policy of yearly renewable War Risk term insurance, which he allowed to lapse on March 2, 1920, for nonpayment of the premium due on February 1, 1920. In 1925 he gave up a private medical practice to accept employment as a physician with the Government, acting thereafter as a specialist in eye, ear, nose, and throat diseases at various veterans' hospitals and homes maintained by the Government. On June 21, 1927, Pence applied for reinstatement and conversion of the lapsed term policy. The policy was accordingly reinstated and converted, effective July 1, 1927; and, except for the question of fraud,2 was in force at the time of his death on September 21, 1934\n\n\n In this application for reinstatement Pence categorically denied, among other things, that he had ever been treated for any disease of the throat, heart or stomach. So also did he deny that since the lapse of the policy he had consulted any physician in regard to his health, or had been ill or prevented by ill health from attending to his usual occupation.\n At the trial there was submitted in evidence a communication from the Regional Medical Officer at Sioux Falls, South Dakota, to the Manager of the Veterans' Administration in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and dated Decem- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 332, 335]\n\u00a0\n ber 9, 1931. This reported that a gastro-intestinal X-ray examination had been made of Pence at the Sioux Falls Veterans' Hospital on April 6, 1925, and had resulted in a diagnosis of 'suspected duodenal pathology.' Pence made several statements, subsequent to the reinstatement of his insurance and in support of claims for disability benefits from the Government, that this examination had been made at his request. Mrs. Pence admitted that she knew that such an examination had been made.\n About fifteen months after his application for reinstatement, and on August 27, 1928, Pence applied to the Government for disability compensation, claiming that he was disabled by chronic sinusitis, ethmoiditis, atrophic rhinitis, and by myocarditis. On September 7, 1928, he executed and submitted a sworn statement in support of his application for disability compensation that he suffered from the following disabilities: 'sinusitis, frontal, ethmoiditis, chronic, atrophic rhinitis, chronic, with loss of sense of smell, myocarditis, chronic ... incurred ... on or about October 1918.' He also stated 'That a physician was called in to treat me on Jan. 1927, when he pronounced my disability sinusitis, frontal, acute exacerbation and prescribed serum and local treatment tending to induce drainage. Treatment was carried out by myself. Was confined to bed for 8 days.' Together with this he submitted a supporting 'Physician's Affidavit,' by Doctor L. Grant Glickman, a practicing physician stationed at the time of the asserted examination at the National Home at Leavenworth, Kansas, where Pence was stationed; and employed at the time of the trial by the Veterans' Administration at Fort Snelling, Minnesota. 3 \n\n[316 \nU.S. 332, 336]\n\u00a0\n In 1931 and 1933 Pence made statements in support of other claims for benefits similar to those set forth above in that they contradicted the representations made in his application for reinstatement involved in this case. On November 28, 1931, he submitted a statement in support of an application for retirement, to the effect that in 1918 a camp physician by whose authority he remained in barracks under special care while in service examined his heart and told him it was 'shot'; that he had acute myocarditis and a severe gastric upset which 'turned out to be a forerunner of duodenal ulcer which perforated in 1920 and again in 1925'; and that because of distress and certain symptoms he later requested a gastro-intestinal examination at the Veterans' Bureau office at Sioux Falls, South Dakota. He concluded his statement: 'I never had a day of sickness in my life before this and I do not believe I have had an entirely well one since.' On December 8, 1933, he submitted a sworn application for pension for disability resulting from active military service, stating that since the beginning of service one civilian physician had treated him for sinusitis and myocarditis; and four others for sinusitis alone. One of the latter examinations was stated to have been made by Doctor Glickman in 1926, and another was stated to have been made at a time after the lapse of the policy in suit.\n Doctor Glickman was produced at the trial as a witness for the Government, in whose employ he still was at the time. The trial judge ruled out as improper, questions by petitioner's counsel bearing upon the question whether \n\n[316 \nU.S. 332, 337]\n\u00a0\n disciplinary action had been taken against Glickman and others because of the execution of affidavits in support of Pence's claim for disability compensation and other of his claims. Upon being asked whether he had an independent recollection of the examination referred to, he stated that he had copies of 'records', but not the 'originals.' The Government's attorney then asked: 'Well, Doctor, do you have a recollection of your examination-refresh your recollection of your examination of Dr. Lawrence Pence in January, 1927.' Glickman answered 'I do.' The Government could not locate the record of the treatment made on Glickman's report as officer of the day-apparently the only record made of the treatment-and it was not produced at the trial.\n Glickman testified further as follows: Pence called upon him for treatment on January 16, 1927, while he was acting as officer of the day. He concluded that Pence was suffering from sinusitis and ethmoiditis. Pence knew what his findings were, and stated that he was suffering from a recurrence of a chronic condition. Glickman treated Pence at Pence's home on two or three occasions between January 16 and January 25. Mrs. Pence was at home then, although perhaps not on all occasions. Pence had no cold, but Glickman prescribed a cold serum for him, and also some argyrol packs.\n Mrs. Pence testified, however, that: She had no knowledge that her husband had consulted a physician. She was close to him, and constantly with him, and believed that he would have told her of anything seriously the matter with him. He never told her, however, of consulting a physician, or that he suffered from sinusitis, ethmoiditis, or myocarditis. Her husband led an active, vigorous, life, and was never confined to bed except by occasional colds, and suffered from no other sickness. It appeared from her testimony, however, that she was unable to differentiate between a 'cold' and a sinus infection. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 332, 338]\n\u00a0\n Pence's two sons and two friends also testified to his active life and apparent good health.\n With the evidence in this condition, the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the District Court erred in refusing to withdraw the case from the jury.\n The Government, which the Circuit Court of Appeals held was entitled to a directed verdict, had the burden of proof on the issue of fraud. Under the circumstances we have recited, the credibility of Doctor Glickman, its witness, was clearly for the jury. The evidence of the gastrointestinal examination was likewise insufficient to sustain the direction of a verdict. We assume without deciding that the jury could not have refused to believe that such an examination had been made. Yet the jury could have properly refused to deduce from this all the necessary elements of the defense of fraud, established by our decisions to be: (1) a false representation (2) in reference to a material fact (3) made with knowledge of its falsity (4) and with the intent to deceive (5) with action taken in reliance upon the representation. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The case of the Government for a directed verdict rests, therefore, upon the statements of Pence made after the reinstatement of his insurance and contradicting the representations in his application for reinstatement. Their admissibility as against the beneficiary-plaintiff, Mrs. Pence, is not in issue on this record, for they were introduced by the Government and received in evidence without objection. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[316 \nU.S. 332, 339]\n\u00a0\n Pence('s representations in the application were not evidence of their own veracity. \n6\n His later contrary statements were repeated, and usually under oath; they are in no way improbable, and are the statements of one who, being himself a doctor, spoke with knowledge of the subject and bearing of his statements. His admissions left no room for conjecture as to the falsity of the previous statements in the application, and of his knowledge of such falsity. From these facts the requisite intent to defraud is presumed,7 and therefore need not be proven in the absence of countervailing evidence. Materiality and reliance were conclusively established by evidence introduced at the trial, if indeed such proof were needed. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 332, 340]\n\u00a0\n No evidence in the case served in any way to contradict, qualify, or explain Pence's admissions. \n8\n We are of opinion that in the absence of any such evidence his admissions established so overwhelming a case in favor of the Government as to require the direction of a verdict in its favor,9 and the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals is, therefore,\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY, dissenting.\n In view of the high value and importance attached by custom and tradition to the right of jury trial as a feature of our federal jurisprudence, and the significant emphasis provided by the Federal and state constitutions, scrupulous care should be exercised by courts and judges to avoid rulings, on motions for the direction of a verdict, which in effect wrongfully deprive a litigant of the cherished right. On such a motion our function is not to evaluate the evidence for the purpose of determining whether fraud has been committed. I am unable to agree with the opinion of the Court because I think there was sufficient evidence to justify submitting the issue of fraud to the jury.\n The opinion of the Court recognizes that the testimony of Glickman and the evidence of the gastro-intestinal examination were insufficient to sustain the direction of a \n\n[316 \nU.S. 332, 341]\n\u00a0\n verdict, and correctly states the issue thus: 'The case of the Government for a directed verdict rests, therefore, upon the statements of Pence made after the reinstatement of his insurance and contradicting the representations in his application for reinstatement'. So stated, the case presents a controverted question of fact, and, in view of the evidence in this case, it was for the jury to find the answer by resolving the conflict between the two contrary sets of self-serving statements made by Pence.\n It is admitted that 'Pence's representations in the application were not evidence of their own veracity'. As an abstract matter one would suppose that Pence's later conflicting statements were likewise 'not evidence of their own veracity'. However, it is said that reasonable men have no choice but to admit the truth of those later statements because they 'were repeated, and usually under oath; they are in no way improbable, and are the statements of one who, being himself a doctor, spoke with knowledge of the subject and bearing of his statements'. These factors might be persuasive to a jury that the later statements were true, but it is quite a different thing to hold that they absolutely compel belief. On the basis of the record an equally plausible premise is that the statements in the application were the true ones. Pence was never absent from work for any appreciable period of time. The reports of his physical examinations from 1928 to his death were not altogether consistent, and any defect disclosed was evidently thought insufficient to warrant allowing any of his various claims for disability benefits, etc. His widow testified that they were 'pretty close to one another', that she believed he would have told her if anything was seriously wrong with him, and that she had no knowledge of any serious ailment or consultation with a physician on his part. All this casts doubt on the truth of Pence's statements made after his application for the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 332, 342]\n\u00a0\n reinstatement of his insurance and entitled the jury to pass judgment on them.\n Whether Pence was a malingerer or not, disavowing and then asserting injury and disease as a means of collecting different benefits from the Government, is not for us to decide. Suspicion that such was the case does not justify usurping the jury's function of determining, in the light of all the evidence, which of Pence's statements were true and which were false. The case was properly submitted to the jury.

RUBERT HERMANOS, INC.(1942)\nNo. 96\nArgued: Decided: March 16, 1942\n\n\n\n\n[315 \nU.S. 637, 638]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. Cattron Rigby, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Henri Brown, of San Juan, P.R., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BYRNES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By Joint Resolution of May 1, 1900, the Congress provided that 'every corporation hereafter authorized to engage in agriculture (in Puerto Rico) shall by its charter be restricted to the ownership and control of not to exceed five hundred acres of land.' \n1\n This limitation was carried over into the present Organic Act of Puerto Rico enacted on March 2, 1917.2 In 1935 the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico enacted two laws to provide the means of enforcing the Congressional prohibition. Act No. 33 conferred upon the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico exclusive original jurisdiction over quo warranto proceedings instituted for violations of the 500 acre law. \n3\n Act No. 47 authorized the Attorney General of Puerto Rico or any district attorney to bring such quo warranto proceedings in the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico against any corporation violating the Organic Act, and provided further that when any corporation is 'unlawfully holding ... real estate in Puerto Rico, the People of Puerto Rico may, at its option, through the same proceedings, institute in its behalf the confiscation of such property, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 637, 639]\n\u00a0\n or the alienation thereof at public auction, within a term of not more than six months counting from the date on which final sentence is rendered.' \n 4\n\u00a0\n\n This is a quo warranto proceeding brought in 1937 against respondent corporation by the Attorney General of Puerto Rico under these statutes. The complaint alleged that respondent corporation was organized in 1927 under the laws of Puerto Rico for the purpose of acquiring and working sugar cane farms and plantations, that its articles of incorporation restricted it to the acquisition of 500 acres, that it nevertheless had acquired, and that it owned and was working at the time of the filing of the complaint, some 12,188 acres of land. The answer conceded that the 500 acre restriction was contained in the articles and that the respondent had nevertheless acquired the 12,188 acres, but interposed several defenses. On July 30, 1938 the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico entered judgment for the petitioner. It ordered 'the forfeiture and cancellation' of the license and articles of incorporation of respondent, 'the immediate dissolution and winding up of the affairs' of the corporation, and the payment of a $ 3000 fine and costs. On the same day, petitioner moved that a receiver be appointed to handle the dissolution and disposition of the respondent's property, pursuant to subsections 4 and 5 of  182 of the Puerto Rico Code of Civil Procedure. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[315 \nU.S. 637, 640]\n\u00a0\n The motion for the appointment of a receiver was held in abeyance pending an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. That Court reversed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico on the ground that Acts Nos. 33 and 47 exceeded the authority of the Legislative Assembly under the Organic Act. 106 F.2d 754. We granted certiorari, \n309 \nU.S. 642\n, 60 S.Ct. 467, and on March 25, 1940 reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals and reinstated that of the Supreme Court of the Island. \n309 \nU.S. 543\n, 60 S.Ct. 699.\n The mandate of this Court reached the clerk of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico on May 13. On the same day the Attorney General entered a request for a hearing on petitioner's pending motion for the appointment of a receiver. The respondent then filed its answer and briefs were submitted by both parties. In its answer and brief respondent raised numerous objections to the appointment of a receiver. Chief among these objections were: (a) that on March 28, 1940, respondent corporation had been dissolved by vote of its stockholders and its property conveyed to a partnership consisting of all the stockholders, so that nothing remained to be done; and (b) \n\n[315 \nU.S. 637, 641]\n\u00a0\n that the statutes applicable to this case are certain sections of the Private Corporations Law6 rather than  182 \n\n[315 \nU.S. 637, 642]\n\u00a0\n of the Code of Civil Procedure,7 that under the terms of the former 'the directors shall be the trustees ... pending the liquidation' of any dissolved corporation, and that the court was consequently without jurisdiction to appoint a receiver under  182. The insular court resolved all the issues in petitioner's favor, appointed a receiver of all the property of the respondent, and directed the receiver to handle the property as a going concern until the People of Puerto Rico should exercise the option granted to them by  2 of Act No. 47 of August 7, 1935 either to confiscate the real estate unlawfully held by respondent or to have it sold at public auction. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n[315 \nU.S. 637, 643]\n\u00a0\n From this order respondent took a second appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, making the two contentions which have been noted as well as many others which require no discussion here. The Circuit Court of Appeals disposed of several of these contentions unfavorably to the respondent. However, it reversed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico on the ground that the order appointing the receiver was 'improvidently issued'. In the opinion of the Circuit Court,  27, 28 and 30 of the Private Corporation Law are unquestionably applicable to the dissolution of a corporation by court order as a result of a violation of its charter and the laws, although the insular court had declared them 'applicable only to a voluntary dissolution agreed upon by the shareholders of a corporation or by expiration of the term fixed for its duration.' With respect to  182 of the Code of Civil Procedure, upon which the lower court relied, the Circuit Court of Appeals determined that it permitted the appointment of a receiver only 'upon proper showing by an interested party, agreeably to the usages of courts of equity.' It concluded that the option granted by Act No. 47 of 1935 did not afford the People of Puerto Rico an interest sufficient for this purpose. It observed that the option relates only to the excess acreage, whereas the order had sought to place the receiver in charge of all the property of the respondent, both real and personal. If the People of Puerto Rico should elect to have the land sold at public auction,9 the Circuit Court asserted, a master can be appointed for that purpose, and in the meantime a \n\n[315 \nU.S. 637, 644]\n\u00a0\n notice of lis pendens which was filed with the Registry of Property will prove adequate to protect the People's interest.\n The Circuit Court's opinion leaves it uncertain whether it meant to hold that the insular court wholly lacked power to appoint a receiver for a judicially dissolved corporation or merely that it abused its discretion in this case. In any event, the questions for our determination seem to be these: (1) does it lie within the power of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico to appoint a receiver for the assets of a corporation whose dissolution has been judicially ordered because it has violated its articles of incorporation and the laws of Puerto Rico and the United States; (2) did that court abuse its discretion in appointing a receiver under the circumstances of this case; and (3) did the scope of the order exceed the court's authority?\n First: Whether or not it is within the power of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico to place a receiver in control of the property of a corporation which has been dissolved for violation of law is a question whose answer must be found in the statutes of the Island. As we have said ,  182 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides: 'A receiver may be appointed by the court in which an action is pending or has passed to judgment, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 637, 645]\n\u00a0\n or by the judge thereof: ... (4) In the case when a corporation has been dissolved, or is insolvent, or in immediate danger of insolvency, or has forfeited its corporate rights. (5) In all other cases where receivers have heretofore been appointed by the usages of courts of equity.' It seems hardly debatable that if nothing more were shown, these provisions would strongly support the assertion of power by the insular court to appoint a receiver for respondent's property. But respondent urges that the provisions of  27, 28, 29 and 30 of the Private Corporations Law compel the opposite conclusion. Section 27 provides that 'all corporations, whether they expire through the limitation contained in articles of incorporation or are annulled by the Legislature, or otherwise dissolved, shall be continued as bodies corporate for the purpose of prosecuting and defending suits by or against them, and of enabling them to settle and close their affairs, to dispose of and convey their property and to divide their capital; but not for the purpose of continuing the business for which they were established.' Section 28 declares that 'upon the dissolution in any manner of a corporation, the directors shall be the trustees thereof pending the liquidation.' And Section 30 authorizes the appropriate district court of Puerto Rico, 'on application of any creditor or stockholder, ... at any time either (to) continue the directors as trustees as aforesaid, or (to) appoint one or more persons to be liquidators of such corporation to take charge of the assets and effects thereof ....' Again, if nothing more than these sections were before us, we think it clear enough that upon the dissolution of a corporation 'in any manner,' the directors would remain in charge of the assets as trustees until some 'creditor or stockholder' moved a district court-not the Supreme Court of the Island-to remove them. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 637, 646]\n\u00a0\n A frank recognition that the statutes appear on their face to conflict and to overlap permits us to avoid the lengthy and technical arguments which have been advanced by both parties in this Court and in the courts below. The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico resolved this conflict in favor of its power to appoint a receiver by holding that the pertinent sections of the Private Corporations Law do not apply to judicially ordered dissolutions but that  182 of the Code of Civil Procedure does apply. In recent years we have had occasion to announce that the decisions of the courts of Puerto Rico with respect to the interpretation of the Island's statutes and to matters of local law are to be accorded the greatest weight. Sancho Bonet v. Yabucoa Sugar Co., \n306 \nU.S. 505\n, \n307 \nU.S. 613\n, 59 S.Ct. 626; Sancho Bonet v. Texas Company, \n308 \nU.S. 463\n, 60 S.Ct. 349. We cannot say that an interpretation placed by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico upon statutes whose meaning is so open to doubt is plainly incorrect. Accordingly, though the interpretation suggested by the Circuit Court of Appeals may be equally plausible, it erred in reversing the judgment of the insular court.\n Second: Assuming that under  182 the insular Supreme Court has the power to appoint a receiver for a judicially dissolved corporation, the question remains whether it has abused its discretion in appointing a receiver in this case. The Circuit Court of Appeals, after indicating its belief that the power to appoint a receiver is a drastic one and that it should be sparingly employed, concluded that its use was not warranted by the circumstances of this case. Its reasoning was that the sole interest of the petitioner was its option either to confiscate the excess acreage or to have it sold at public auction. 'The People do not need a receiver to protect the option. If and when the time comes for the court to decree a sale of the land at public auction a master can be appointed to carry through the sale. The land will still \n\n[315 \nU.S. 637, 647]\n\u00a0\n be there. Meanwhile, the interest of the People is protected by a lis pendens notice which was entered in the Registry of Property shortly after the institution of the quo warranto proceedings, which notice the corporation unsuccessfully sought to have cancelled.' 118 F.2d 752, at pages 759, 760.\n It may be true that the procedure suggested by the Circuit Court would have been adequate to the needs of the case. It may even be true that an injunction restraining the directors of respondent from disposing of the property pending the People's choice would have been sufficient. But the same considerations that compel restraint on the part of appellate courts where the question is one of power, apply with double force where the question merely concerns the propriety of its exercise. The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico was in the best position to determine what the situation demanded. The attempted transfer of the corporate assets on March 28, 1940 may have been a bona fide effort to comply with the carlier decree of dissolution, as respondent insists. But the fact that the transfer was made to a partnership whose members had been the stockholders of the dissolved corporation might suggest a disposition on the part of the directors to obstruct the effective exercise of the option afforded the People by Act No. 47. Certainly it would not have been unreasonable for the insular court to suspect that this was so. No doubt the lis pendens notice would prevent the directors from conveying an interest in any of the property which would be superior to that of a purchaser at a subsequent public auction conducted pursuant to Act No. 47. But the sale and resale of the property, or its encumbrance, could only result in confusion, misunderstanding and needless litigation. It was clearly within the discretion of the Supreme Court of the Island to avert these difficulties.\n Third: Respondent insists and the Circuit Court held, finally, that the order was too broad to be sustained. It is \n\n[315 \nU.S. 637, 648]\n\u00a0\n argued that it was not confined to the land which was actually in excess of the 500 acre maximum but included all the properties of the respondent, and that it authorized the continued operation of the business by the receiver for an indefinite period. To treat the latter objection first, an examination of the order appointing the receiver reveals that paragraph 7 specifically contemplates the exercise of its option by the People of Puerto Rico. A fair reading of the order requires us to conclude that the period of the receivership was definite enough, since it was clearly regarded as a preliminary to the exercise of the option. The receiver was expressly directed to surrender the properties whenever the People had indicated its choice. As to the provision of the order consigning the whole of respondent's properties to the receiver, it is enough to say that everyone concedes that the properties constitute a working unit in growing, cutting and grinding sugar. To separate the land from the machinery and other personalty pending the People's election between alternative procedures would have been inexcusable economic waste. It was altogether proper for the Supreme Court to recognize these realities and to permit the receiver to preserve the enterprise as a going concern pending a final settlement. Nothing in  182, upon which it relied for authority to appoint the receiver, requires that it limit the receivership in the manner suggested by respondent.\n The order of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico should be sustained in full.\nREVERSED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice ROBERTS are of the opinion that the court below correctly held, for reasons stated in detail in Judge Magruder's opinion, 1 Cir., 118 F.2d 752, that the appointment of a receiver by the Insular court in the circumstances of this case was an abuse of discretion and that it was the duty of the Circuit Court of Appeals in the exercise of its appellate authority to set the appointment aside. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n]  3, 31 Stat. 715. \n[\nFootnote 2\n]  39, 39 Stat. 951, 964, U.S.C., Title 48,  752, 48 U.S.C.A.  752. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Act of July 22, 1935, Laws of Puerto Rico, Special Session, 1935, p. 418. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Act of August 7, 1935, Laws of Puerto Rico, Special Session, 1935, pp. 530-532. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] 'Section 182.-(564 Cal.)

Appendix to Code of Commerce of Puerto Rico (1932 ed.) p. 327, at p. 355. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] See note 5, supra. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] Section 2 provides, in part:\n'When any corporation by itself or through any other subsidiary or affiliated entity or agent is unlawfully holding, under any title, real estate in Puerto Rico, The People of Puerto Rico may, at its option, through the same proceedings, institute in its behalf the confiscation of such property, or the alienation thereof at public auction, within a term of not more than six months counting from the date on which final sentence is rendered.\n\n'In every case, alienation or confiscation shall be through the corresponding indemnity as established in the law of eminent domain.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] According to the Circuit Court's opinion, on August 28, 1940, after the order appointing the receiver had been entered, the Attorney General filed with the insular court the following statement: 'Therefore, The People of Puerto Rico elects to have all the lands in the possession of the respondent sold at public auction, and prays this Court to order the sale at public auction of the said real property by the receiver already appointed by this Court, after the same is assessed in conformity with the provisions of the Condemnation Proceedings Act now in force.' (118 F.2d 752, 760.) In the Circuit Court, the respondent argued that the option provided by Act No. 47 could not be exercised in this manner but only by an Act of the Legislative Assembly. We share the Circuit Court's view that this and other problems relating to the actual exercise of the option must first be passed upon by the Puerto Rican Supreme Court. \n\n\n\n\n","96":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO v.

Cattron Rigby, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. George M. Wolfson, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is whether a statute of Puerto Rico impairs the obligation of certain contracts in violation of the Island's organic law. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The respondent's predecessor in title, Fortuna Estates, as owner or lessee of lands adjacent to the Jacaguas River, enjoyed under Spanish law, and respondent, as successor, still enjoys, rights appurtenant to the lands to draw from the river 12,612.1 acre feet of water per year for irrigation.\n Puerto Rico adopted a law in 19082 which authorized an irrigation system, as part of which a dam was to be erected in Jacaguas River above Fortuna's intakes. Fortuna's lands were not within or a part of the irrigation district. Although the operation of the system would interfere with Fortuna's water rights they were not condemned, as the statute permitted, nor were they voluntarily surrendered.\n By an amendatory law adopted in 19133 it was provided: 'In the case of any land carrying a water right or concession of which the source of supply is destroyed or impaired by the construction or operation of the irrigation system, which shall not have been relinquished or surrendered to the People of Porto Rico, such land shall be entitled to receive from the irrigation system an amount of water which is the reasonable equivalent in value of the said water right \n\n[315 \nU.S. 610, 612]\n\u00a0\n or concession.' This Act empowered the Commissioner of the Interior to make agreements with holders of such rights fixing the amount and the time, place, and conditions of delivery, of water to be received as the equivalent of the rights suspended.\n In the exercise of this authority the Commissioner executed contracts with Fortuna which called for the suspension of its rights appurtenant to two large tracts during the life of the contracts and assured delivery of a specified amount of water at Fortuna's intakes as the fair equivalent of the rights suspended.\n Each contract enmerated the rights to take water appurtenant to a described tract of land which would be impaired or interrupted by the operation of the irrigation system; recited that the amount of water taken by Fortuna under its rights varied throughout the year, due to differences in rainfall, so that it was impossible to determine in advance the amount of water to which it would be entitled in any given period; and that Porto Rico was willing to deliver from the Jacaguas River the water to which Fortuna was entitled, but, in order to make the operation of the system more certain, desired to agree upon a fixed and regular amount which should be received by Fortuna as the fair equivalent in value for irrigation purposes of the water it would ordinarily take and use under its existing rights.\n The contract then stated the agreement of the parties as to the quantities of water which, delivered in equal daily instalments, were to be considered such fair equivalents and the petitioner covenanted to deliver these quantities to Fortuna. It was also agreed that Fortuna might exercise its preexisting rights for ten days in each year to prevent their loss by nonuser.\n Under the Irrigation Law, lands in a district were subjected to a uniform annual assessment per acre to discharge the cost of construction, maintenance, and operation of \n\n[315 \nU.S. 610, 613]\n\u00a0\n the system. Sales were also made of surplus waters and the proceeds used for maintenance.\n Shortly after the contracts were made, a controversy arose between petitioner and respondent with respect to Puerto Rico's right to sell surplus waters. Litigation ensued which terminated in a decree restraining the insular government from diverting certain surplus waters to which the respondent was held to be entitled under the contracts. The decision also upheld the validity of the contracts. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Thereupon the legislature adopted, July 8, 1921, 'An Act Fixing a Tax on Certain Lands using water from the Southern Coast Public Irrigation System, on which lands no Tax Whatever was Levied under the Public Irrigation Law, and for Other Purposes.' \n5\n This is the statute enforcement of which is asserted to impair the obligation of the contracts. By this act a special tax is imposed on all lands supplied which, under existing law, contribute nothing to the expense of the maintenance of the system. The Treasurer of Puerto Rico is directed to compute the tax by finding the aggregate acreage receiving water from the system including lands, like those of respondent, outside the district but receiving the equivalents of their pre-existing rights under contracts. He is to assess a prorata share of the total expense against the lands of respondent and others similarly circumstanced. The Act, as is admitted, was aimed only at those who, like respondent, had contracted for the receipt of water in lieu of that to which they were of right entitled and whose lands were not a part of the irrigation district.\n Action was instituted by petitioner in an insular court for the recovery of several years taxes so imposed. \n6\n The \n\n[315 \nU.S. 610, 614]\n\u00a0\n cause was removed to the United States District Court, where a motion to remand was denied and a judgment entered for the respondent on the merits. The judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit,7 but was reversed by this court for want of diversity of citizenship on which jurisdiction of the federal courts depended. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n After remand, the case was tried in the insular district court and the complaint was dismissed on the merits, on the ground that Act No. 49 of 1921, was an invalid impairment of the obligation of the 1914 contracts. The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico reversed and rendered judgment for the petitioner. \n9\n The Circuit Court of Appeals in turn reversed and reinstated the judgment of the insular district court. \n10\n We granted certiorari as the case presents an important question arising under the Insular Organic Act. \n314 \nU.S. 589\n, 62 S.Ct. 61, 86 L.Ed. --. We hold that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals was right.\n By the Act of 1908,11 the people of Puerto Rico undertook the construction of a public irrigation system. This necessitated the erection of a dam for impounding and storage of part of the waters of the Jacaguas River above the respondent's intakes, and the creation of an irrigation district. The statute recognized the necessity of providing a method for the acquisition of the rights of riparian owners whose land lay below the dam. Section 12 authorized the condemnation of existing water rights and the payment of their fair value to the owners. By the amendatory Act of 1913, the owners of lands which fell within the irrigation district court release their preexisting rights, have them valued, and be paid the value by credits against \n\n[315 \nU.S. 610, 615]\n\u00a0\n their proportionate share of the expense of the construction and operation of the system. \n12\n By Section 13 owners of lands having water rights, whose source of supply would be destroyed or impaired by the construction or operation of the system, who had not surrendered or relinquished their rights, were declared entitled to receive from the irrigation system an amount of water which would be the reasonable equivalent in value of the right or concession so destroyed or impaired. The Commissioner was authorized to negotiate contracts to this end with such owners.\n It is evident that it was thought that lands such as those of the respondent could not be included within the proposed district. It is idle to speculate concerning the reasons for this decision, though it is clear that in order to realize the Government's purpose it was deemed necessary to reach an accommodation concerning preexisting valid water rights of land owners whose lands could not or should not be included in the irrigation district. In the case of such persons the purpose was to substitute a fair equivalent for the rights theretofore exercised. Such an arrangement offered mutual advantages to Puerto Rico and to the owners. Whereas Fortuna had, prior to the erection of the dam, the right to take over 12,000 acre-feet of water per year for irrigation, a proportation of surplus waters, and certain torrential waters, the supply was uneven and uncertain due to the irregularity of rainfall. It was, therefore, an advantage to the respondent's predecessor to surrender its maximum rights in consideration of an agreement that there should be delivered to it, equally and evenly throughout the year, something less than the maximum it was entitled to take under preexisting conditions. On the other hand, it was an advantage to the irrigation system that it should not be obliged at any time to deplete its storage waters by furnishing the respondent \n\n[315 \nU.S. 610, 616]\n\u00a0\n the maximum amount which, if the water were available, it was entitled to receive.\n The Insular Supreme Court held that the exaction is not precluded by the contracts and works no impairment of their obligation. It held the exaction is a tax; that the rights which the respondent owned prior to the construction of the irrigation system were taxable, and that the privileges it enjoys under the contract are equally so; that the contract contains no covenant not to tax these rights or privileges and, if it did, it would be beyond the power of the Commissioner. We cannot agree.\n The assessment contemplated by Act No. 49 of 1921 is not a general tax laid for the support of government upon a property right or a franchise. This is expressly admitted by the petitioner in brief and in oral argument. In the brief it is said: 'The special taxes or assessments here in question, if and when collected, will simply accrue to the special fund for the current operation and maintenance of the irrigation district, and thus serve only to lower the assessments upon other lands now taxed for such operation and maintenance. The insular Treasury can derive no direct benefit.' And, in oral argument, counsel for petitioner frankly conceded that the money to be raised is not taxes in any way but merely an assessment against the respondent's land for the cost of delivering the water. If Puerto Rico had essayed to tax respondent's lands or its water rights by a general law, quite distinct questions would arise which we need not discuss.\n Treated as an assessment of part of the cost of maintenance of the irrigation system, the petitioner insists that the exaction does not violate the obligation of the 1914 contracts. It asserts that the agreements were only that a given amount of water would be released, or made available, or allotted to respondent and therefore The \n\n[315 \nU.S. 610, 617]\n\u00a0\n People of Puerto Rico are free to charge to respondent the cost of delivering the water; and, further, that if the contracts, by their terms, precluded the imposition upon the respondent of this cost they are beyond the power of the Commissioner.\n Section 13 of the Act of 1913 authorizes the Commissioner 'to enter into agreements with such owner or owners as to the amount of water and the time, place and conditions of delivery thereof, which shall be delivered to the lands to which the said water rights or concessions are appurtenant as the fair equivalent in value thereof, ... .' We think it evident from this language that the Commissioner was not limited to agreeing to allot to the land-owner a certain amount of water but was empowered to stipulate that at certain times he would cause to be delivered, at specified places, the water which respondent was to receive as the equivalent of that which it had formerly been entitled to take at its intakes along the river. That the Commissioner so construed his authority is plain from the terms of the contracts.\n Each contract describes the rights appurtenant to the lands in question, acknowledges their validity, states the amounts of water the respondent's predecessor is entitled to take, and, in consideration of the mutual covenants of the parties, stipulates 'that the quantities of water specified' in the agreement, 'delivered uniformly through the year, subject to the terms and conditions specified in this agreement, ... are the fair equivalent in value of the water which the said Fortuna Estates takes under and pursuant to the concessions and water rights claimed by it, and The People of Porto Rico will, subject to the conditions and limitations hereinafter specified and at the times, places and subject to the conditions of delivery hereinafter provided for, make delivery' of the amounts of water specified in the agreement. Each contract further provides that 'The People of \n\n[315 \nU.S. 610, 618]\n\u00a0\n Porto Rico will deliver the said water as follows'. One agreement covenants that the water deliverable for some of the tracts shall be at the intakes provided by the owner, and that water deliverable to another tract shall in part be deliverable at such an intake and in part at a pumping station on the bank of the river. The right is reserved, upon notice by The People of Porto Rico, to change the place of delivery of certain of the water. It is further provided that if delivery at the points designated is temporarily interrupted, Porto Rico will deliver an equivalent amount of water at some other point. It is agreed that the presence of water in the river bed at the opening of the described intakes, sufficient to permit the owner to take the quantities specified in the agreement, shall be deemed a delivery within the meaning of the contract. A clause provides that should the owner desire to take water for certain of the tracts at places other than the present intakes, Porto Rico will deliver the water at such other places but that 'all extra expenses occasioned by such delivery shall be borne by' the owner.\n The obligation of Porto Rico to deliver the named quantities is recognized in many clauses of the contracts. As applied to the petitioner, the word 'deliver' appears ten times in each contract, the word 'delivery' nine times, and the word 'deliverable' four times, in one of the documents. From the four corners of the agreements it is clear that, in consideration of the suspension of the rights of Fortuna, and its successor, the respondent, the insular government agreed not merely to allot, but to deliver, at specified places, certain quantities of water. Prior to the execution of the contracts, Fortuna was under no obligation to the government to pay it any cost or expense for the bringing of the water to its intakes. The contract clearly contemplates that it is to be under none with respect to the water agreed to be \n\n[315 \nU.S. 610, 619]\n\u00a0\n delivered to it in lieu of that which it formerly had the right to take. This fact is emphasized by the provision that, if it desires delivery at other places than those specified in the contracts, it shall bear the expense entailed by the change.\n The deficit in the maintenance cost of the system was met, for some time, by the sale of surplus water. The contract gives the respondent the right to a portion of such surplus water over and above the specified amounts to be delivered by the petitioner. The respondent sued to enjoin the petitioner from selling the surplus water to which it claimed to be entitled. The suit resulted in an injunction. The Government being thus deprived of the revenue theretofore used towards the maintenance of the system adopted the Act of 1921 with the evident purpose of recouping a portion of that expense from the respondent and others with whom it had made contracts in 1914 for the delivery of the stipulated amount of water to them without charge therefor. The history of the legislation shows that the proposed exaction was not a general tax but was an effort to collect from persons whose land was not in the irrigation system a portion of the expense of maintaining that system, whereas the contracts exempted them from contributing to such cost as a condition of receiving the stipulated amount of water from the system. This was a clear violation of the obligation of the contracts.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n There was no provision whatsoever in the grant of these water rights exempting them from any form of taxation. Hence if no contract had been made and the irrigation system had been constructed and respondent's lands had been serviced in precisely the same way as \n\n[315 \nU.S. 610, 620]\n\u00a0\n was done here, I should think that there would be no doubt but that the assessment would be valid. The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico relied for the validity of the assessment on such cases as Knowles v. New Sweden Irrigation District, 16 Idaho 217, 235, 101 P. 81, 87, and Bleakley v. Priest Rapids Irrigation District, 168 Wash. 267, 11 P.2d 597. Those cases hold that under certain circumstances the owner of a water right may be brought into an irrigation district and forced to pay an assessment. As stated in the Knowles case, 16 Idaho at page 241, 101 P. at page 89: 'Under our irrigation law as it existed at the time of the organization of this district and the assessments referred to were made, if the land of the plaintiff was properly included in said irrigation district, it was subject to assessment for benefits, provided it received any, whether the owner of said land owned a water right in connection therewith or not, for a person in an irrigation district may receive certain benefits, regardless of whether the owner has a water right in connection therewith or not.'\n The reasons which permit the owner of a water right to be brought into an irrigation district are equally cogent here. For the impact of this assessment is not more rigorous than the assessment attendant on membership in an irrigation district. In fact, it is less, since respondent is being assessed only for a pro rata share of the cost of maintenance and operation of the system, not its construction.\n It was clear and undisputed that respondent obtained substantial benefits from the irrigation system. (1) The quantity of water received by respondent from the system is 19% larger than what previously had been available from the earlier limited flow of the river. (2) The storage reservoir impounds flood waters which would be largely lost to respondent. The dam not only increases the amount of water available but makes possible regu- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 610, 621]\n\u00a0\n lar and more continuous deliveries of the water. (3) The irrigation system has tapped new sources of water which feed the reservoir. No separation of that additional supply of water from the old supply is possible. As a result respondent obtains additional advantages especially in dry years. ( 4) By reason of the construction and operation of the irrigation system the water is available at several different distribution points through canals rather than at the river bed alone.\n In that posture of the case we would be faced with a determination by the legislature of Puerto Rico that respondent's lands were benefited and that respondent should pay an assessment. It has long been held that such a 'determination is conclusive upon the owners and the courts'. Spencer v. Merchant, \n125 \nU.S. 345, 356\n, 8 S.Ct. 921, 926, 927. And see Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 \nU.S. 97\n; Walston v. Nevin, \n128 \nU.S. 578\n, 9 S.Ct. 192. As stated in Fallbrook Irrigation District v. Bradley, \n164 \nU.S. 112, 176\n, 177 S., 17 S.Ct. 56, 69, 70, 'the fact of the amount of benefits is not susceptible of that accurate determination which appertains to a demonstration in geometry'; the choice of methods employed 'is one of those matters of detail in arriving at the proper and fair amount and proportion of the tax that is to be levied on the land with regard to the benefits it has received, which is open to the discretion of the state legislature, and with which this court ought to have nothing to do.' And see French v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co., \n181 \nU.S. 324\n, 21 S.Ct. 625; Milheim v. Moffat Tunnel Improvement District, \n262 \nU.S. 710, 721\n, 43 S.Ct. 694, 698; Roberts v. Richland Irrigation District \n289 \nU.S. 71\n, 53 S.Ct. 519; Chesebro v. Los Angeles County Flood Control District, \n306 \nU.S. 459\n, 59 S.Ct. 622.\n The existence of the contracts does not call for a different result. The statute in question provided that owners of water rights such as respondent 'shall be entitled to receive from the irrigation system an amount of \n\n[315 \nU.S. 610, 622]\n\u00a0\n water which is the reasonable equivalent in value of the said water right or concession.' The Commissioner of the Interior was authorized 'to enter into agreements with such owner or owners as to the amount of water and the time, place and conditions of delivery thereof, which shall be delivered to the land to which the said water rights or concessions are appurtenant as the fair equivalent in value thereof'. Act No. 128,  13, August 8, 1913, L.1914, pp. 54-84. The contracts, as well as the statute speak of 'delivery' of the water. But the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico interpreted the contracts as meaning that respondent 'agreed to receive ( italics supplied) from the irrigation system a certain quantity of water in exchange' for its water rights. I do not think that that construction is unwarranted.\n\n\n (1)\n The contracts themselves make plain that as respects certain intakes on the river 'the presence of water in the river bed ... in quantities sufficient to permit the taking at the said intakes of the amounts of water specified shall be deemed to be deliveries.' That provision alone demonstrates that the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico was justified in interpreting 'delivery' in these contracts differently than might be warranted in case of contracts for the cartage of goods. 'The word 'deliver' has perhaps as many different shades of meaning ascertained by judicial interpretation as any other term known to the law.' United States v. McCready, C.C., 11 F. 225, 234. The problems of operation of an irrigation system are unique in many respects. Manipulation of the gates at the dam determines the flow of water through the various channels. Puerto Rico's undertaking in each instance was to 'deliver' water at specified intakes provided by respondent. Those intakes were in the river or in designated reservoirs provided by respondent. It seems reasonable to conclude that Puerto Rico's \n\n[315 \nU.S. 610, 623]\n\u00a0\n undertaking was to make the specified quantities of water available so that they would be received at those intakes. To enforce the present tax is not to renig on that undertaking. The fact that respondent was to bear 'all extra expenses' in case water was delivered at intakes other than the designated ones seems to me hardly more than a provision that respondent was to bear the cost in case the irrigation system had to be partially relocated to meet its requirements. In any event, it does no more than raise a doubt as to the correct interpretation of the contract-a doubt which, as subsequently pointed out should not be resolved against the power of Puerto Rico to impose this tax.\n\n\n (2)\n It seems to me tolerably clear that such a construction of the contracts comports with the purpose of the arrangement. The contracts state that Puerto Rico 'in order to facilitate and make more certain the operation of the said dam and the irrigation system of which it is a part, desires to determine and agree upon an amount of water which, delivered regularly, may, under all attending circumstances, be considered to be fair equivalent in value for irrigation purposes of the amount of water which the Fortuna Estates would under ordinary circumstances take and use under the said water rights and concessions'. The amount of water actually obtained by respondent before the dam was erected apparently fell far below the amount to which it was entitled under their water rights. The contracts were designed to substitute for that latter theoretical figure one which would represent a 'fair equivalent in value for irrigation purposes' of the amount of water which respondent would 'under ordinary circumstances take and use' under its water rights. From Puerto Rico's point of view such a determination was important so that the demands on the dam could be reduced to known requirements and so that the erection of the dam would not \n\n[315 \nU.S. 610, 624]\n\u00a0\n result in a windfall to respondent. The latter certainly would transpire if the dam gave respondent an amount of water which it had not been able to obtain on its own without the irrigation system. Thus the specification in the contracts of the 'fair equivalent' of the amount of water which respondent ordinarily would obtain under its water rights was nothing more than a determination of the then worth of the water rights in terms of acre feet of water. Under that view, the contracts did not raise the water rights to a higher constitutional dignity than they previously enjoyed.\n\n\n (3)\n No express exemption from this form of taxation is to be found in the contracts. If that exemption exists, it is implied. But even though it be assumed arguendo that Puerto Rico's representative had the authority constitutionally to bargain away its taxing power, the exemption should not be inferred. Chief Justice Marshall stated in Providence Bank v. Billings, 4 Pet. 514, 561, that a relinquishment of a power to tax 'is never to be assumed'; 'its abandonment ought not to be presumed, in a case in which the deliberate purpose of the state to abandon it does not appear.' If there are doubts, they must be resolved in favor of the government. Wells v. Savannah, \n181 \nU.S. 531\n, 21 S.Ct. 697; Chicago Theological Seminary v. Illinois, \n188 \nU.S. 662\n, 23 S.Ct. 386; Metropolitan Street Ry. Co. v. New York State Board of Tax Com'rs, \n199 \nU.S. 1, 35\n, 36 S., 25 S.Ct. 705, 708, 4 Ann.Cas. 381. As stated in Wells v. Savannah, supra, 181 U.S. at pages 539, 540, 21 S.Ct. at page 700, a contract of exemption from taxation must 'be clearly proved. It will not be inferred from facts which do not lead irresistibly and necessarily to the existence of the contract. The facts proved must show either a contract expressed in terms, or else it must be implied from facts which leave no room for doubt that such was the intention of the parties and that a valid consideration existed for the contract. If there be any doubt on these matters, the contract has not been proven and the exemption does not exist.' \n\n[315 \nU.S. 610, 625]\n\u00a0\n That rule should be applied to this situation. It is clear that respondent is one of the beneficiaries of the irrigation system, even though the additional amount of water which the erection of the dam enabled it to obtain be disregarded. The meaning of the word 'delivery' as used in the contracts is at best ambiguous. Hence, we should strictly adhere to the presumption against exemption from taxation. To resolve all ambiguities in the contracts in respondent's favor and against Puerto Rico is to forsake a canon of construction which has long obtained.\n In conclusion, Puerto Rico has not treated respondent the same as landowners who have no water rights. The latter have to pay for the construction of the irrigation system as well as for its maintenance and operation. Respondent on the other hand is merely required to contribute towards the cost of maintenance and operation of the system. On these facts that favored treatment is sufficient respect for the integrity of respondent's property rights. To free it from all burden is to give it a windfall. Only under the compulsion of plain and unambiguous language should we permit a beneficiary of such a project to escape his fair share of the costs. There is no such compulsion here. Hence we should refuse to let the contract clause of Puerto Rico's organic law produce an inequitable, unfair, and harsh result.\n Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice MURPHY, and Mr. Justice BYRNES join in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'No law impairing the obligation of contracts shall be enacted.' 48 U.S.C.  737, 48 U.S.C.A.  737. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Act of September 18, 1908, Laws of Porto Rico, 1909, p. 152. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Act of August 8, 1913, Laws of Porto Rico, 1914, p. 54,  13. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] People of Porto Rico v.

RAILWAY EXPRESS AGENCY(1942)\nNo. 903\nArgued: Decided: May 25, 1942\n\n\n\n Mr. Robert L. Peyton pro se.\n Mr. Harry S. Marx and Mr. Charles C. Evans, both of New York City, for respondents.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n Petitioner brought this suit in the District Court for the Western District of Texas, alleging that respondent, known to be an interstate carrier, had negligently failed to deliver to the addressee in California a package shipped from Waco, Texas, and claiming damages in the sum of $ 750,000. The trial court ordered petitioner to attach to his complaint a copy of the express receipt which he received \n\n[316 \nU.S. 350, 351]\n\u00a0\n upon delivering the package to respondent. This receipt contained a $50 valuation. Thereupon the court granted respondent's motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the amount in controversy was less than the $ 3,000 necessary to sustain jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  41(1), 28 U.S.C. A.  41(1), Jud.Code  24(1). The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. We granted certiorari to inquire whether the suit could be maintained under 28 U.S.C.  41(8), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(8), Jud.Code  24(8), granting the district courts jurisdiction 'Of all suits and proceedings arising under any law regulating commerce', irrespective of the amount involved.\n The pertinent act of Congress is 49 U.S.C.  20(11), 49 U.S.C.A.  20( 11), originally the Carmack Amendment of 1906, 34 Stat. 593, since amended several times to its present form. The section requires an interstate common carrier receiving property for shipment to issue a receipt or bill of lading. The carrier is made liable to the holder 'for any loss, damage, or injury to such property caused by it' or connecting carriers. If the injury does not occur on the initial carrier's line, but it responds in damages, it is entitled to recover over from the responsible carrier. Further, the initial carrier is made liable to the shipper for full damages sustained, notwithstanding any limitation of liability in the receipt or bill of lading, with the exception, important here, that where a carrier by authority or direction of the Interstate Commerce Commission maintains rates dependent upon the value of the property declared in writing by the shipper, such declaration also limits liability of the carrier for loss or damage to an amount not in excess of the declared value.\n Following the Carmack Amendment, this Court in several cases upheld the power of the receiving carrier to limit its liability to an agreed valuation, made to obtain the lower of two or more rates. See Adams Express Co. v. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 350, 352]\n\u00a0\n Croninger, \n226 \nU.S. 491\n, 33 S.Ct. 148, 44 L.R.A.,N.S., 257; Missouri, K. & T. Ry. v.

The socalled First Cummins Amendment of March 4, 1915, 38 Stat. 1196, 49 U.S.C.A.  20(11), prohibited in general any such limitation of liability. By the Second Cummins Amendment of August 9, 1916, 39 Stat. 441, 49 U.S.C.A.  20(11), Congress adopted the present provisions authorizing limitation of liability in the manner already noted, and substantially restored the rule of Adams Express Co. v. Croninger, supra.\n Respondent, confessing error, asserts that under  20(11) as it now stands, a suit brought against a single interstate carrier for its negligent non-delivery, is one not merely to enforce a common-law liability limited by an Act of Congress; but that petitioner's cause of action has its origin in and is controlled by such act, and so 'arises under' it. Any doubts as to the correctness of this position,1 are resolved by the Act of January 20, 1914, c. 11, 38 Stat. 278, 28 U.S.C.  71, 28 U.S.C.A.  71, regulating removal to the federal courts of suits brought under the Carmack Amendment in the state courts.\n After the Carmack Amendment a conflict of decisions had developed in the lower federal courts on the question whether suits for damages brought against interstate carriers under the amendment were suits 'arising under' an act regulating commerce, so that their removal from state to federal district courts would be permitted.

The deci- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 350, 353]\n\u00a0\n sion in the McGoon case, sustaining removal jurisdiction irrespective of the amount in controversy, was followed by the removal of many small suits against carriers to the federal district courts. Congress ended this practice by the Act of January 20, 1914, which forbade removal of suits under the Carmack Amendment involving less than $3,000.\n The report of the House Judiciary Committee on H.R. 9994, 63d Cong.2d Sess. (which was the same in substance as S. 3484, which became the 1914 law) expressly recognized the effect and authority of the decision in the McGoon case. In prohibiting removals where less than $3,000 is in controversy, instead of imposing the $3,000 limitation directly on all suits brought in the federal courts under the Carmack Amendment, Congress recognized that such suits arise under a law regulating commerce within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.  41(8), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(8), and sanctioned the exercise of original jurisdiction by the district courts in such cases. See H.Rep. No. 120, 63d Cong., 2d Sess.; also 51 Cong.Rec. 1327, 1544-1548.\n Whether a suit arises under a law of the United States must appear from the plaintiff's pleading, not the defenses which may be interposed to, or be anticipated by it. Petitioner's pleading, which we have summarized, satisfies this requirement since it adequately discloses a present controversy dependent for its outcome upon the construction of a federal statute.

Tobin, of Elgin, Ill., for respondents. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 144, 145]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This certiorari, \n315 \nU.S. 795\n, 62 S.Ct. 915, 916, brings here certain rulings on the right of petitioner, a farmer-debtor, to have reviewed the orders of a conciliation commissioner1 under Section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  203. This section deals with Agricultural Compositions and Extensions. A conflict of circuits as to whether the ten day period for filing a petition for review of a commissioner's order was a limitation on the power of the reviewing court to act or on the right of an aggrieved party to appeal,2 impelled us to grant our writ. In re Pfister, 7 Cir., 123 F.2d 543, 548; Thummess v. Von Hoffman, 3 Cir., 109 F.2d 291, and In re Albert, 2 Cir., 122 F.2d 393.\n In addition to this point numerous other questions as to the right to review are presented which may be fairly subsumed under petitioner's allegations of error below (1) because the courts did not apply the limitation in the proviso of 75, sub. s3 instead of that in 39, sub. c; (2) because \n\n[317 \nU.S. 144, 146]\n\u00a0\n petitions for rehearing of a conciliation commissioner's orders, which petitions were entertained and denied, were not held to extend the period for review and (3) because the order of stay approved by the Commissioner under 75, sub. s(2) was for less than the statutory period of three years from the entry of the stay order.\n After failing to obtain a composition or extension under Section 75, sub. a to sub. r of the Bankruptcy Act, the petitioner, a farmer, sought relief under Section 75, sub. s. In due course on August 10, 1940, he petitioned the Commissioner to fix his rent, permit him to retain his property and establish a stay or moratorium. In the petition he stated that his moratorium began to run on April 26, 1940. On August 13, 1940, the Commissioner, after hearing evidence upon its amount, ordered that the rental be fixed at a sum named, and directed a stay from April 26, 1940, as the petitioner suggested. An appraisal was approved by a separate order on the same day, August 13. On September 7, 1940, orders were entered for the sale of certain property, chiefly livestock, stipulated by the debtor to be perishable under Section 75, sub. s(2). After the ten days fixed for review under 39, sub. c, petitions for rehearing on the orders fixing \n\n[317 \nU.S. 144, 147]\n\u00a0\n rental, granting stay and directing sale, were filed with the Commissioner. The basis of these petitions and the reasons for their denial by the Commissioner are detailed in division II of this opinion.\n Petitions for review were filed which were timely if petitioner was right in his contention that the Commissioner's action on the petitions for rehearing extended the time for appeal for ten days from the entry of the Commissioner's order denying rehearing. The two numbers, 26 and 27, of our docket, refer to these two petitions for review consolidated for hearing. The District Court denied each of the petitions for review on the ground that there was no jurisdiction in it to review, since the petitions for review were filed after the ten days provided by 39, sub. c, and the rules of the District Court and since the denial of the petitions for rehearing did not extend the time. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment on the grounds that 39, sub. c, governed, that the time for review was not extended by the petitions for rehearing, that there was no basis for reversing the Commissioner's action on the petitions for review and that the 'petitions for review were not filed in time.' (123 F.2d 548) We disagree with the Court of Appeals upon the last ground on the assumption that the language meant that the District Court was without 'power' to review the orders. We agree with the Court of Appeals upon the first three grounds and therefore affirm the judgment.\n I. The proviso of subsection 75, sub. s, note 3 supra, is, we think, limited in its effect to steps before commissioners authorized by the provisions of Section 75, sub. s, which precede the proviso. Congress evidently intended to allow adequate time for reflection and preparation before appeal by parties aggrieved by the basic and difficult finding of value. The provisions of Section 75, sub. s, following the proviso authorize orders setting aside exemptions, leaving the ap- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 144, 148]\n\u00a0\n praised property in the hands of the debtor and fixing rentals therefor, staying judicial proceedings, selling perishable property, directing reappraisals, and final sale of the estate. It is obvious that this proviso, couched in terms of appeal, could not have been intended to control the review of the manifold activities of a commissioner engaged in handling an estate through three or more years of bankruptcy. To hold the proviso generally applicable would leave unregulated reviews of orders entered more than four months after the commissioner approves the appraisal. The section applicable to these reviews is Section 39, sub. c. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n II. The petitions for review of the Commissioner's orders of August 13, 1940, and September 7, 1940, which were filed November 28, 1940, and October 9, 1940, no extension having been granted, were out of time under Section 39, sub. c5 unless, in accordance with the petitioner's con- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 144, 149]\n\u00a0\n tentions, the time for review was to run from the entry of the orders of the Commissioner denying the petitions for rehearing of the order of August 13, which petition was filed September 16, 1940, and of the orders of September 7, which petition was filed September 20, 1940. These orders of the Commissioner denying the petitions for rehearing were entered November 28, 1940, and September 30, 1940\n\n\n Where a petition for rehearing of a referee's order is permitted to be filed, after the expiration of the time for a petition for review, and during the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings, as here, they may be acted on,6 that is, they may be granted 'before rights have vested on the faith of its action,' and the foundations of the original order may be reexamined. Wayne United Gas Co. v. Owens-Illinois Glass Co., \n300 \nU.S. 131, 137\n, 57 S.Ct. 382, 385.7 When such a petition for rehearing is granted and the issues of the original order are re-examined and an order is entered, either denying or allowing a change in the original order, the time for review under 39, sub. c, begins to tun from that entry. Bowman v. Lopereno, \n311 \nU.S. 262, 266\n, 61 S.Ct. 201, 203; Wayne United Gas Co. v. Owens-Illinois Glass Co., \n300 \nU.S. 131, 137\n, 138 S., 57 S.Ct. 382, 385, 386. The reason for taking the later date for beginning the running of the time for review is that the opening of the earlier order by the court puts the basis of that earlier order again in issue. A refusal to modify the original order, however, requires the appeal to be from the original order, even though the time is counted from the later order refusing to modify the original. An appeal does not lie from \n\n[317 \nU.S. 144, 150]\n\u00a0\n the denial of a petition for rehearing. Conboy v. First Nat. Bk. of Jersey City, \n203 \nU.S. 141, 145\n, 27 S.Ct. 50, 52; Bowman v. Lopereno, \n311 \nU.S. 262, 266\n, 61 S.Ct. 201, 203; Brockett v. Brockett, 2 How. 238; Roemer v. Bernheim, \n132 \nU.S. 103\n, 10 S.Ct. 12; Jones v. Thompson, 8 Cir., 128 F.2d 888; State of Missouri v. Todd, 8 Cir., 122 F.2d 804.\n On the other hand, where out of time petitions for rehearing are filed and the referee or court merely considers whether the petition sets out, and the facts if any are offered support, grounds for opening the original order and determines that no grounds for a reexamination of the original order are shown, the hearing upon or examination of the grounds for allowing a rehearing does not enlarge the time for review of the original order. This result follows from the well-established rule that where an untimely petition for rehearing is filed which is not entertained or considered on its merits the time to appeal from the original order is not extended. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n If a consideration of the reasons for allowing a rehearing out of time which are brought forward by the petition for rehearing were sufficient to resurrect the original order, the mere filing of an out of time petition would be enough. Of course, the court must examine the petition to see whether it should be granted. Indeed the examination given a motion to file such a petition might just as well be said to justify the advancement of the time for review. It is quite true that in a petition for review upon the ground of error in law in the original order, the examination of the grounds of the petition for rehearing is equivalent to a reexamination of the basis of the original decree. But in such a case the order on the petition for review would control. It would show either a refusal to allow the petition for rehearing or a refusal to modify the \n\n[317 \nU.S. 144, 151]\n\u00a0\n original order. Cf. Wayne United Gas Co. v. Owens-Illinois Glass Co., \n300 \nU.S. 131, 137\n, 138 S., 57 S.Ct. 382, 385, 386. Whether time for appeal would be enlarged or not would depend upon what the order showed the court did.\n In the present case it is quite plain the denial was grounded upon a failure of the petitions for rehearing to establish adequate grounds for the reexamination of the original orders. The petition for rehearing of the order of August 13, relating to rent, sought to produce evidence that the rental fixed was too high, raised a question of law that a full three years stay was not allowed and alleged a lack of representation by counsel. A motion to dismiss the petition for rehearing as out of time was denied. The Commissioner examined the petition for rehearing and determined that the debtor had had full opportunity to present his evidence at the hearing and that the stay was in accordance with the debtor's motion and that counsel for the debtor appeared at each hearing and knew of each order. He therefore concluded 'that there is no equity or merit in the petition for rehearing' and denied the petition. The petition for rehearing of the orders of September 7 was similarly handled. They were orders for sales of perishable property,  75, sub.  (2), stipulated to be perishable by counsel for the debtor. Rehearing was sought because of lack of representation by counsel and lack of notice of the orders. The Commissioner's decision on the petition for rehearing sets out the record facts showing representation and notice. We therefore conclude that the Commissioner did not reexamine the basis of any of the original orders and that time for filing the petitions for review was not extended.\n III. Since the petitions for rehearing, in our opinion, did not extend the time for review, we are brought to examine the question as to whether Section 39, sub. c, supra note 2, is a limitation on the power of the District Court to act \n\n[317 \nU.S. 144, 152]\n\u00a0\n or on the right of a party to seek review. Courts of bankruptcy are courts of equity without terms. Commissioners, like referees, masters and receivers, supervise estates under the eyes of the court with their orders subject to its review. The entire process of rehabilitation, reorganization or liquidation is open to reexamination out of time by the District Court, in its discretion, and subject to intervening rights. Cf. Wayne United Gas Co. v. Owens-Illinois Glass Co., \n300 \nU.S. 131, 137\n, 57 S. Ct. 382, 385; Bowman v. Lopereno, \n311 \nU.S. 262, 266\n, 61 S.Ct. 201, 203.\n Prior to the adoption of 39, sub. c, General Order in Bankruptcy No. XXVII, 9 now abrogated,10 governed review of referee's orders but it prescribed no time limitations. It was held that petitions should be filed within a reasonable time. \n11\n Some local court rules therefore specified time limitations. Where such rules imposed definite limits on the time within which a petition for review could be filed, with extensions to be granted on cause shown, out of time petitions nevertheless were entertained and considered if cause was shown. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n Section 39, sub. c, was intended to establish definitely and clearly the proceeding for review of a referee's order in the interest of certainty and uniformity but the legislative history reveals no intention to change the preexisting rule as to power. \n13\n Indeed, the Chandler Act by the amend- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 144, 153]\n\u00a0\n ment to Section 2(10)14 sought to conform the act to the prevailing practice as to the bankruptcy court's exercise of its appellate jurisdiction over referee's orders. \n15\n We do not think Section 39, sub. c, was intended to be a limitation on the sound discretion of the bankruptcy court to permit the filing of petitions for review after the expiration of the period. The power in the bankruptcy court to review orders of the referee is unqualifiedly given in Section 2(10). The language quoted from Section 39, sub. c, is rather a limitation on the 'person aggrieved' to file such a petition as a matter of right. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n The review out of time of the Commissioner's orders is then a matter for the discretion of the District Court. As that Court was of the opinion it was 'without jurisdiction' by virtue of Section 39, sub. c, its discretion was not exercised. However, as we are of the view that the petitions for rehearing were not supported by adequate facts justifying a reexamination of the bases for the orders of August 13 and September 7, 1940, and no others are alleged, and that therefore the District Court should not have entered into an out of time review of these original orders, there is no reason for a reversal of the judgments. The Commissioner upheld the petitions for rehearing against a motion \n\n[317 \nU.S. 144, 154]\n\u00a0\n to dismiss because they were out of time. He thereupon heard and passed upon the petition's merits as bases for rehearings. His reasons for refusing to open the original orders complained of are adequate and amply supported by the record. The appraisal was made and the time of stay fixed pursuant to the debtor's motion, he was represented by one or more counsel at each meeting, had opportunity to present evidence and stipulated to the perishable character of the property ordered sold. See the last paragraph of division II.\n IV. On account of debtor's motion, requesting the running of the moratorium of three years from April 26, 1940, the day of his adjudication in bankruptcy under 75, sub. s, we do not consider the correctness of a stay of less than three years under other circumstances. In this instance it was correct.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The referee appointed by the District Court for handling agricultural compositions is known as a conciliation commissioner.  75, subs. a-r.

(s). 'Any farmer failing to obtain the acceptance of a majority in number and amount of all creditors whose claims are affected by a composition and\/or extension proposal, or if he feels aggrieved by the composition and\/or extension, may amend his petition or answer, asking to be adjudged a bankrupt. Such farmer may, at the same time, or at the time of the first hearing, petition the court that all of his property, wherever located, whether pledged, encumbered, or unencumbered, be appraised, and that his unencumbered exemptions, and unencumbered interest or equity in his exemptions, as prescribed by State law, be set aside to him, and that he be allowed to retain possession, under the supervision and control of the court, of any part or parcel or all of the remainder of his property, including his encumbered exemptions, under the terms and conditions set forth in this section. Upon such a request being made, the referee, under the jurisdiction of the court, shall designate and appoint appraisers, as provided for in this Act (title). Such appraisers shall appraise all of the property of the debtor, wherever located, at its then fair and reasonable market value. The appraisals shall be made in all other respects with rights of objections, exceptions, and appeals, in accordance with this Act (title): Provided, That in proceedings under this section, either party may file objections, exceptions, and take appeals within four months from the date that the referee approves the appraisal.'\n Six other subdivisions of subsection  follow, numbered (1) to (6) inclusive, and relate chiefly to proceedings after appraisal. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The legislative history of the proviso indicates the soundness of this conclusion. It appears first in the earlier subsection s, 48 Stat. 1289, which was held unconstitutional in Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, \n295 \nU.S. 555\n, 55 S.Ct. 854, 97 A.L.R. 1106. The preceding provisions were substantially the same as the present ones but the proviso read 'That in case of real estate either party may file objections, exceptions, and appeals within one year from date of order approving the appraisal.' The specification of real estate, of course, excluded the proviso from any generality of scope. When the section was amended after the Radford case, the committee reports treated the paragraph of sub.  as quoted in note 3 separately from the succeeding numbered paragraphs and the language connotes the idea that the proviso relates only to appeals from the appraisal. The comment is as follows: 'It provides that the referee, under the jurisdiction of the court, shall designate and appoint appraisers, to appraise all of the property of the debtor, at its then fair and reasonable market value. The appraisal is made in all other respects, with rights of objections, exceptions, and appeals, in accordance with the Bankruptcy Act; and either party may file objections, exceptions, or take such appeals within 4 months.

It assigned the bond and mortgage without consideration to Prudence Bonds Corporation, also a wholly owned subsidiary of New York Investors, Inc.

The guaranty of Prudence Company, which was referred to in the participation certificates, was of payment of the bond interest when due and of the principal when due or within eighteen months thereafter.\n Each certificate declares that the purchaser is entitled to an undivided share in the mortgage of a specified amount equal to the sum paid for it by the original pur- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 89, 91]\n\u00a0\n chaser. Each provides that the share in the bond and mortgage represented by it is not subordinate to any other shares or subject to any prior interest, and each reserves to Prudence Bonds the right 'to be the holder or pledgee of similar shares' in the bond and mortgage. The mortgage indebtedness was later reduced to.$390,000, leaving an undivided share of $ 7,200 of which Prudence Company was the equitable owner, for which no participation certificate had been issued.\n In 1938 an order of the bankruptcy court, in which Prudence Company and Prudence Bonds were then being reorganized, directed a transfer to Prudence Company of the $7,200 interest, as part of a settlement and adjustment of mutual claims between the two companies, and Prudence Company has continued to be the owner of this share of the mortgage indebtedness. It has also acquired by purchase from certificate holders $ 816.67 in certificates of participation in the mortgage.\n On foreclosure of a second mortgage on the Zo-Gale property, Amalgamated Properties, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Prudence Company, acquired title to the property from the mortgagor, and later went into a bankruptcy reorganization. Upon approval by the court of a plan of reorganization of the Zo-Gale certificate issue, the title to the mortgaged property was transferred to respondent Geist as trustee for the benefit of the certificate holders. In confirming the plan for reorganization of Amalgamated, the court reserved for future decision the question whether the Prudence Company was entitled to payment of its two claims in the mortgage pro rata with the other certificate holders.\n As provided by the reorganization plan of Prudence Company, petitioner Prudence Realization Corporation was organized to take over the assets from the trustees of Prudence Company and to liquidate them for the benefit of creditors under the direction of the bankruptcy \n\n[316 \nU.S. 89, 92]\n\u00a0\n court. Petitioner has thus acquired certificates issued in the Amalgamated reorganization proceeding, representing the interest of Prudence Company in the Zo-Gale bond and mortgage. The claims against Prudence Company recognized by its plan of reorganization amounted to $133,723,000, including its guaranties of mortgages amounting to $12,523,000; guaranties of bonds issued by Prudence Bonds for $58,833,000; and guaranties of mortgage participation certificates issued by Prudence Bonds (including the Zo-Gale mortgage certificates) for $50,858,000.\n The present proceeding was begun by respondent's petition in the consolidated reorganization of Prudence Company and Amalgamated Properties in the Eastern District of New York for an order directing that petitioner was not entitled to any distribution on account of the Prudence Company's interest in the Zo-Gale mortgage until the other certificate holders were paid in full. The district court granted the order, which the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. 122 F.2d 503. Both courts applied the rule of the New York Court of Appeals, see Matter of Title & Mortgage Guaranty Co., 275 N.Y. 347, 9 N.E.2d 957, 115 A.L.R. 35; Pink v. Thomas, 282 N.Y. 10, 24 N.E.2d 724; Matter of People (Union Guarantee & Mortgage Co.), 285 N.Y. 337, 34 N.E.2d 345, that a guarantor of mortgage certificates, who also has an interest in the mortgage, cannot share in the proceeds of its collection until the certificate holders are paid, unless there is a clear reservation in the certificate of the right of the guarantor to share on a parity with other certificate holders. The Circuit Court of Appeals by a divided court held that it was bound to apply the rule announced in the New York cases cited, which it deemed to be a rule of construction of the guaranty of the certificates. We granted certiorari, \n315 \nU.S. 606\n, 62 S.Ct. 479, 86 L.Ed. --, because of the importance in bankruptcy administration of the questions raised. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 89, 93]\n\u00a0\n The court below recognized the implication of the requirement that a plan of reorganization under former  77B, sub. f(1) of the Bankruptcy Act, see 11 U.S.C.  621(2), 11 U.S.C.A.  621(2), be one which (122 F.2d 505) 'is fair and equitable and does not discriminate unfairly in favor of any class of creditors', see Southern Pacific Co. v. Bogert, \n250 \nU.S. 483, 492\n, 39 S.Ct. 533, 537; Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Co., \n308 \nU.S. 106\n, 60 S.Ct. 1, and that  65, sub. a, 11 U.S.C.A.  105, sub. a, requires that in liquidations a distribution of 'dividends of an equal per centum' shall be made 'on all allowed claims, except such as have priority or are secured', see Globe Bank & Trust Co. v. Martin, \n236 \nU.S. 288, 305\n, 35 S.Ct. 377, 383; Moore v. Bay, \n284 \nU.S. 4\n, 52 S.Ct. 3, 76 A.L.R. 1198. It recognized also that the equity powers of the bankruptcy court may be exerted to subordinate the claims of one claimant to those of others of the same class where his conduct in acquiring or asserting his claim is contrary to established equitable principles. See Taylor v. Standard Gas & Electric Co., \n306 \nU.S. 307, 618\n, 59 S.Ct. 543; Pepper v. Litton, \n308 \nU.S. 295\n, 60 S.Ct. 238; In re Bowman Hardware & Electric Co., 7 Cir., 67 F.2d 792.\n But the court found it unnecessary to choose between such competing considerations, and rested its decision on the ground that Prudence Company's guaranty of the certificates was under state law to be interpreted as impliedly agreeing that any claim of its own to the mortgage indebtedness was to be subordinated to those of other certificate holders. After referring to cases in which the New York Court of Appeals had directed such a subordination, the court said (122 F.2d 505): 'An important issue herein is whether this is primarily a rule of construction of the guaranty in the certificates or is a rule of administration of insolvent estates which violates bankruptcy principles of equal distribution of a bankrupt estate among creditors. If it is a rule of construction, we would follow it ...', citing Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A.L.R. 1487. 'And if we thus found the guarantee to amount to an actual agreement between two creditors that \n\n[316 \nU.S. 89, 94]\n\u00a0\n the claim of one against the debtor should be subordinated to that of the other, we should give effect to it ....'\n The only evidence of the actual intent of the parties to which the court referred was the fact that Prudence Company, unlike Prudence Bonds, had not reserved the right in the certificates to be the holder of 'similar shares' in the bond and mortgage. But there is no contention that in the absence of such a provision in the certificates, Prudence Company was not free to acquire certificates or hold an interest in the guaranteed mortgage in its own right. Consequently, its ownership of the $816.67 in certificates and $7,200 of the uncertificated indebtedness evidences no actual intention to subordinate those interests in a liquidation. And neither the terms of the guaranty nor of the certificates give any indication of such an intent of the parties.\n The court arrived at its conclusion that the Prudence Company had agreed to subordinate its claims, not from an examination of the relevant documents read in the light of the surrounding circumstances, except as we have noted, but from its reading and application of the opinions of the New York Court of Appeals. These recognize that the guarantor of a mortgage, who is also a part owner of it, is free to stipulate that he may share in a liquidation on an equal footing with other owners of the mortgage despite his default on his guaranty, and that effect will be given to such a stipulation. See Matter of Title & Mortgage Guaranty Co., supra, 275 N.Y. at page 352, 9 N.E.2d 957, 115 A.L.R. 35; Pink v. Thomas, supra, 282 N.Y. at page 12, 24 N.E.2d 724; Matter of People (Union Guarantee & Mortgage Co.), supra, 285 N.Y. at page 343, 34 N.E.2d 345. On the other hand, some of them have found visible evidence, in the terms of the certificates, of an actual intention of the parties to subordinate the guarantor's interest. To that extent they are inapplicable to the certificates in this case, which afford no such evidence. See Matter of Title & Mortgage Guaranty Co., supra, 275 N.Y. at page 355, 9 N.E.2d 957, 115 A.L.R. 35; Matter of People (Union Guarantee & Mortgage Co.), supra, 285 N.Y. at page 345, 34 N.E.2d 345. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 89, 95]\n\u00a0\n But so far as the New York cases, without evidence of the actual intent of the parties, subordinate the guarantor on grounds of 'presumed intention', or 'the existence of special equities', or the 'natural equities' involved, Title Guarantee & Trust Co. v. Mortgage Commission, 273 N.Y. 415, 426, 7 N.E.2d 841, 846; Matter of Title & Mortgage Guaranty Co., supra, 275 N.Y. at page 355, 9 N.E.2d 957, 115 A.L.R. 35; Pink v. Thomas, supra, 282 N.Y. at page 12, 24 N.E.2d 724; Matter of People (Union Guarantee & Mortgage Co.), supra, 285 N.Y. at page 343, 34 N.E.2d 345; Matter of Lawyers Title & Guaranty Co., 287 N.Y. 264, 272, 39 N.E.2d 233, we are unable to say that the rule laid down is other than one of state law governing the relative rights of claimants in a state liquidation. Nothing decided in Erir Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, supra, requires a court of bankruptcy to apply such a local rule governing the liquidation of insolvent estates. The bankruptcy act prescribes its own criteria for distribution to creditors. In the interpretation and application of federal statutes, federal not local law applies. See Awotin v. Atlas Exchange Bank, \n295 \nU.S. 209\n, 55 S.Ct. 674; Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co. v. Martin, \n283 \nU.S. 209, 212\n, 213 S., 51 S.Ct. 453, 454, 455; Board of Com'rs v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 343, 349\n, 350 S., 60 S. Ct. 285, 287, 288; Deitrick v. Greaney, \n309 \nU.S. 190, 200\n, 60 S.Ct. 480, 484; Royal Indemnity Co. v. United States, \n313 \nU.S. 289, 296\n, 61 S.Ct. 995, 997. The court of bankruptcy is a court of equity to which the judicial administration of the bankrupt's estate is committed, Securities and Exchange Commission v. United States Realty & Improvement Co., \n310 \nU.S. 434, 455\n, 457 S., 60 S.Ct. 1044, 1053, 1054, and it is for that court-not without appropriate regard for rights acquired under rules of state law-to define and apply federal law in determining the extent to which the inequitable conduct of a claimant in acquiring or asserting his claim in bankruptcy requires its subordination to other claims which, in other respects, are of the same class. Cf. Taylor v. Standard Gas & Electric Co., supra; Pepper v. Litton, supra.\n But the question remains whether there is any equity arising from the Prudence Company's failure to perform \n\n[316 \nU.S. 89, 96]\n\u00a0\n its contract of guaranty which a bankruptcy court should recognize as requiring the subordination of the company's interest in the mortgage to the claims of the other mortgage creditors. It is a familiar equity rule applied by the federal courts in liquidation proceedings under federal statutes that a solvent guarantor or surety of an insolvent's obligation will not be permitted, either by taking indemnity from his principal or by virtue of his right of subrogation, to compete with other creditors payment of whose claims he has undertaken to assure, until they are paid in full. If the surety were allowed to prove his own claim before the creditor is paid, he would to that extent diminish the creditor's dividends upon his claim, and thus defeat the purpose for which he had given the indemnity. United States v. National Surety Co., \n254 \nU.S. 73, 76\n, 41 S.Ct. 29, 30; Jenkins v. National Surety Co., \n277 \nU.S. 258\n, 48 S.Ct. 445; American Surety Co. v. Westinghouse Electric Mfg. Co., \n296 \nU.S. 133\n, 56 S.Ct. 9; Peoples v. Peoples Bros., D.C., 254 F. 489; United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Union Bank & Trust Co., 6 Cir., 228 F. 448, 455. For like reasons equity requires the surety who holds security of the insolvent principal to give the benefit of it to the creditor for whom he is surety until the debt is paid. Keller v. Ashford, \n133 \nU.S. 610\n, 10 S.Ct. 494; see Chamberlain v. St. Paul, etc., R., \n92 \nU.S. 299\n, 306; Hampton v. Phipps, \n108 \nU.S. 260, 263\n, 2 S.Ct. 622, 623; 4 Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence, 5th Ed.,  1419\n\n\n But we think the equitable basis for requiring the surety or guarantor to postpone the assertion of rights which he derives from or are incidental to his suretyship, to the rights of creditors whom he has undertaken to secure, is wanting here. The rights asserted by Prudence Company in the mortgage are not those of a subrogee; they were acquired independently of its guaranty. They are not derived from or an incident to it. Their assertion is in no way inconsistent with any duty or obligation it assumed by its contract of guaranty. By that \n\n[316 \nU.S. 89, 97]\n\u00a0\n contract the guarantor pledged only its personal obligation for the payment of the certificates. It gave to the certificate holders no lien upon, or other priority right in its interest in the mortgage more than to its other assets.\n Postponement of its rights in the mortgage to those of the other certificate holders is not justifiable as operating to avoid circuity of action. The Prudence Company is not solvent. Its property is being liquidated in bankruptcy where all the claimants on its present and other guaranty obligations are entitled to share equally in its unpledged assets. Denial of the right to prove its claim, which is an asset in which all of Prudence's creditors are otherwise entitled to share, will serve only to divert this asset from all creditors to one class of creditors, the Zo- Gale certificate holders, and thus give to them the exclusive benefit of a security for which they have not bargained. Allowance of the Prudence Company's claim does not involve any breach of its duty as guarantor. Nor does it deprive certificate holders of their right to share in this asset pari passu with the other creditors, or of any right, legal or equitable, to which they are entitled to virtue of their position as guaranteed creditors. See Hampton v. Phipps, supra; Prairie State Nat. Bank v. United States, \n164 \nU.S. 227\n, 17 S.Ct. 142; Henningsen v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., \n208 \nU.S. 404\n, 28 S.Ct. 389.\n Since the New York rule, in the absence of an actual agreement to subordinate the guarantor, is merely a general rule of law governing insolvency proceedings, it is not controlling in bankruptcy. And since in the circumstances of the present case we find no agreement and no equitable basis for depriving the Prudence Company and its creditors of the benefits of the usual bankruptcy rule of equality, the judgment below must be reversed.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","100":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPURCELL v. U.S.(1942)\nNo. 803\nArgued: February 11, 1942Decided: March 2, 1942\n\n\n\n On Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the District of Maryland.\n Messrs. Clarence W. Miles and Joseph Sherbow, both of Baltimore, Md., for appellants.\n Mr. James C. Wilson, of Washington, D.C., for appellees, The United States and Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. C. M. Clay, of Washington, D.C., for appellees, The Confluence and Oakland R. Co., and others. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 381, 382]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A federal district court, composed of three judges in accordance with 28 U.S.C.  47, 28 U.S.C.A.  47, dismissed the appellants' bill which prayed for the annulment of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission. 41 F.Supp. 309. The order permitted the Confluence and Oakland Railroad Company, as owner, and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, as lessee, to abandon a railroad line approximately 20 miles long and to discontinue service entirely in the area now served: a semi-mountainous section along the Youghiogheny River between Confluence and Oakland Junction, Pennsylvania, and Kendall, Maryland. The appellants, who also appeared as protestants before the Interstate Commerce Commission, are the Public Service Commission of Maryland and the McCullough Coal Corporation, a coal mining company which alleges it will be forced out of business if railroad service is discontinued.\n The application to the Commission for abandonment was not made because the line had been operating at a loss. On the contrary, the Commission concluded that there was no evidence that the line had theretofore been a burden on the Baltimore and Ohio system of which it was a part; or that a predictable decline in the volume of traffic would make it one in the future, if it were allowed to continue in existence undisturbed. Confluence & Oakland R. Co. Abandonment, 244 I.C.C. 451, 458; Id., 247 I.C.C. 399, 401. But continued undisturbed existence would be an impossibility in view of a flood control project already begun by the War Department under authority of an Act of Congress. 52 Stat. 1215-1216. This project entails the construction of a dam which will create a reservoir covering an area in which twelve miles of the line are now located. It is conceded that unless a new connecting section is built, the sections of the line not to be inundated-a detached six mile segment above the dam, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 381, 383]\n\u00a0\n and a one mile segment connecting with the main line of the Baltimore and Ohio below it-would serve no practical purpose justifying continued operation.\n The appellants do not challenge the statutory authority of the War Department to submerge the line as it proposes to do. Nor do they suggest that the Commission could or should take any action to deter completion of the project. Nevertheless, they contend that since 'the sole reason for the abandonment was the flood control project, the application should have been denied forthwith by the Commission because of lack of jurisdiction to grant an abandonment on such ground.' But under Section 1(18) of the Interstate Commerce Act the standard prescribed for the Commission in cases of this kind is whether 'the present or future public convenience and necessity permit of such abandonment.' 49 U.S.C.  1(18), 49 U.S.C.A.  1(18). It is difficult to imagine what consideration of present or future public convenience could reasonably impel the Commission to decline to authorize abandonment of a line admittedly doomed to be rendered inoperable regardless of what action the Commission might take. And the appellants suggest none. We must dismiss the appellants' contention on this point as without merit. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The appellants make the further argument that even if the Commission did not err in permitting abandonment of the line, its order cannot stand because of the failure to \n\n[315 \nU.S. 381, 384]\n\u00a0\n impose a condition that substitute service be provided by relocating the line. \n2\n After hearing testimony on the probable cost of relocation and the probable cost of maintaining a relocated line, the Commission (41 F.Supp. 312) concluded that 'considering the expenditure necessarily incident to that relocation and the increased costs of operating the line that will be caused thereby ... we are not justified by the public convenience and necessity in taking action herein that will require the relocation of the line.' The appellants do not contest the Commission's finding, amply supported by evidence, that the relocated line would require increased operating expenses. If the Commission had based its conclusion on this finding alone, there would seem to be no adequate ground for setting its order aside in judicial proceedings. The Commission did consider relocation costs, however, and the appellants contend that this was an improper consideration which invalidates its order.\n In making this attack on the order, the appellants contend that under the statute authorizing the War Department to construct flood control projects, the cost of relocation would have to be borne by the government rather than the railroad. Cost thus borne would not affect the financial condition of the railroad itself, the appellants urge, and therefore there could be no such weakening of the railroad's capital structure as would adversely affect the transportation system. Hence, the argument continues, in that balancing of the interests of those now served by the present line on the one hand, and the interests of the carrier and the transportation system on the other which a proper disposition of abandon- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 381, 385]\n\u00a0\n ment applications requires, Colorado v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 153\n, 46 S. Ct. 452, the former interests must prevail.\n As the court below pointed out, however, 'an uneconomic outlay of funds would not be in the interests of transportation even though the money be derived from the national government.' This Court has recognized that operation of the national railway system without waste was one of the purposes the Transportation Act of 1920, 49 U.S.C.A.  71 et seq., was intended to further. Texas v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 522, 530\n, 54 S.Ct. 819, 824; Texas & P.R. Co. v. Gulf, etc., R. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266, 277\n, 46 S.Ct. 263, 266. And a stated purpose of the Transportation Act of 1940, in the light of which Congress prescribed that the 'Act shall be administered and enforced' is 'to promote ... adequate, economical, and efficient service and foster sound economic conditions in transportation and among the several carriers.' 54 Stat. 899. When materials and labor are devoted to the building of a line in an amount that cannot be justified in terms of the reasonably predictable revenues, there is ample ground to support a conclusion that the expenditures are wasteful whoever foots the bill. The fostering care of the railroad system intrusted to the Commission is not so circumscribed as to leave it without authority to pass on the economic advisability of relocation in a situation where someone other than the carrier provides the money. The weight to be given to cost of a relocated line as against the adverse effects upon those served by the abandoned line is a matter which the experience of the Commission qualifies it to decide. And under the statute, it is not a matter for judicial redecision. Nor is there any indication in the Flood Control Act of 1938, 33 U.S.C.A.  701b et seq., that Congress desires to take away from the Commission any of the powers to make decisions of this kind which the Interstate Commerce Act had previously granted it.\n The judgment of the court below is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Where projected inundation of a line made discontinuation of operations over it compulsory, the Commission has consistently given its authorization for abandonment. See Los Angeles & S.L.R. Co. Abandonment, 212 I.C.C. 597, 598: 'It is apparent from the record that under the circumstances stated above the proposed abandonment is compulsory, and will not result in public inconvenience.' In some such situations the Commission has attached the condition of relocation. E.g., St. Louis-S.F. Ry. Co. Trustees Abandonment, 244 I.C.C. 485. In others, it has not. E.g., Southern Ry. Co. Abandonment, 217 I.C.C. 764. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Commission is empowered to attach conditions by Section 1(20) of the Interstate Commerce Act which provides in part: 'The commission ... may attach ... such terms and conditions as in its judgment the public convenience and necessity may require.' 49 U.S.C.  1(20), 49 U.S.C. A.  1(20). \n\n\n\n\n","101":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPYLE v. STATE OF KANSAS(1942)\nNo. 50\nArgued: Decided: December 7, 1942\n\n\n\n Mr. Joseph P. Tumulty, Jr., of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Jay Kyle, of Topeka, Kan., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner seeks to review an order of the Supreme Court of Kansas denying his application for writ of habeas corpus. In 1953 petitioner was convicted by a jury in a Kansas state court upon an information charging him \n\n[317 \nU.S. 213, 214]\n\u00a0\n with the crimes of murder and robbery. A motion for a new trial was overruled, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment under his conviction for murder, and to a term of from 10 to 21 years for robbery. On appeal the judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Kansas. State v. Pyle, 143 Kan. 772, 57 P.2d 93.\n On November 20, 1941, petitioner, a layman acting in his own behalf, filed an original application for writ of habeas corpus in the Supreme Court of Kansas. The crude allegations of this application charge that his imprisonment was the result of a deprivation of rights guaranteed him by the Constitution of the United States, in that the Kansas prosecuting authorities obtained his conviction by the presentation of testimony known to be perjured, and by the suppression of testimony favorable to him. Filed with this application were a brief and an abstract, also apparently prepared by petitioner himself, which are part of the record before us. These documents elaborate the general charges of the application, and specifically allege that 'one Truman Reynolds and coerced and threatened by the State to testify falsely against the petitioner and that said testimony did harm to the petitioner's defense'; that 'one Lacy Cunningham who had been previously committed to a mental institution was threatened with prosecution if he did not testify for the State'; that the testimony of one Roy Riley, material to petitioner's defense, 'was repressed under threat and coercion by the State'; that Mrs. Roy Riley and Mrs. Thelma Richardson were intimidated and their testimony suppressed; and, that the record in the trial of one Merl Hudson for complicity in the same murder and robbery for which petitioner was convicted, held about six months after petitioner's direct appeal from his conviction, reveals that the evidence there presented is inconsistent with the evidence presented at petitioner's trial, and clearly exonerates petitioner. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 213, 215]\n\u00a0\n Certain exhibits accompanied the application; among these were copies, sworn by petitioner to be true and correct copies of the originals, of an affidavit executed by Truman Reynolds in 1940, and a letter dated February 28, 1941, from the former prosecuting attorney who represented the State at petitioner's trial. The affidavit contained a statement that affiant 'was forced to give perjured testimony against Harry Pyle under threat by local authorities at St. John, Kansas and the Kansas State Police, of a penitentiary sentence for burglary if I did not testify against Mr. Pyle'. The letter stated, 'Your conviction was a grave mistake', and further that, 'The evidence at the trial of Murl Hudson certainly shattered the conclusions drawn from the evidence produced at your trial.'\n In connection with his application petitioner moved for the appointment of counsel to represent him, for subpoenas duces tecum to bring up the records in the trials of Merl Hudson and one Bert (Bud) Richardson, for the subpoenaing of certain witnesses allegedly material to his case, and for his presence in court. The record does not show what disposition, if any, was made of these various motions.\n No return was made to the application for the writ. On December 11, 1941, the court below entered an order 'that said petition be filed and docketed without costs, and thereupon, after due consideration by the court, it is ordered that said petition for writ of habeas corpus be denied'. There was no opinion. A motion to rehear was also denied without opinion. We brought the case here on certiorari, \n316 \nU.S. 654\n, 62 S.Ct. 1045, because of the constitutional issues involved.\n Habeas corpus is a remedy available in the courts of Kansas to persons imprisoned in violation of rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States. Cochran v. Kansas, \n316 \nU.S. 255, 258\n, 62 S.Ct. 1068. Petitioner's papers are \n\n[317 \nU.S. 213, 216]\n\u00a0\n inexpertly drawn, but they do set forth allegations that his imprisonment resulted from perjured testimony, knowingly used by the State authorities to obtain his conviction, and from the deliberate suppression by those same authorities of evidence favorable to him. These allegations sufficiently charge a deprivation of rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution, and, if proven, would entitle petitioner to release from his present custody. Mooney v. Holohan, \n294 \nU.S. 103\n, 55 S.Ct. 340, 98 A.L.R. 406. They are supported by the exhibits referred to above, and nowhere are they refuted or denied. The record of petitioner's conviction, while regular on its face, manifestly does not controvert the charges that perjured evidence was used, and that favorable evidence was suppressed with the knowledge of the Kansas authorities.

UNITED STATES(1942)\nNo. 619\nArgued: May 5, 1942Decided: June 1, 1942\n\n\n\n Messrs. Claude K. Wingate and John M. Daniel, both of Columbia, S.C., for petitioners.\n Mr. Samuel O. Clark, Jr., Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondents. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 486, 487]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A statute of South Carolina imposes a license tax for the privilege of selling tobacco products, playing cards, soft drinks, and other enumerated articles. 1 The United States and two Army officers brought this suit against the members of the South Carolina Tax Commission to enjoin enforcement of this statute with respect to activities of United States Army Post Exchanges located within the state. The bill alleged that post exchanges are instrumentalities of the United States, operating as voluntary unincorporated organizations under the direction and supervision of the United States Army and in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by the Secretary of War; that the respondents had ordered that the tax be applied to the purchase and sale of commodities by the exchanges; that enforcement would inflict immediate and irreparable damage for which the complainants were without any plain, speedy, and efficient remedy in the courts of South Carolina; that the Congressional consent given by a recent federal statute (54 Stat. 1059, 4 U.S.C.A.  12 et seq.) for the imposition of certain kinds of state taxes within 'Federal areas' did not extend to the imposition of taxes on the purchases and sales of commodities by post exchanges; and that the threatened application of the South Carolina statute would interfere with the activities of the United States Government and would be repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. The respondents' answer admitted the threatened enforcement and the absence of remedy in the South Carolina courts, but denied that post exchanges are instrumentalities of the United States and that application of the statute to them would be repugnant to the United States Constitution. With respect to the federal statute \n\n[316 \nU.S. 486, 488]\n\u00a0\n referred to in the complaint, the answer stated: '... no consent of Congress is necessary to permit the State to levy its lawful tax ..., the territorial immunity having been removed by Public Act No. 819, 76th Congress.'\n A Federal District Court of three judges. satisfying the requirements of Section 266 of the Judicial Code,2 heard the case and granted the injunction sought by the complainants. 37 F.Supp. 972. The opinion accompanying the decree stated, however, that the three judges were of the view that a district judge alone had exclusive jurisdiction to pass upon the case; and that the decree should therefore be considered 'not as the decree of a three-judge court but as his decree, from which appeal lies to the Circuit Court of Appeals and not to the Supreme Court.' Nevertheless, all three judges signed the decree 'so that in the event that it should hereafter be determined that the case was one for three judges under the statute, an appropriate decree will have been entered.' 37 F.Supp. 972, 977. The Circuit Court of Appeals, of the same view on the question of jurisdiction, granted an appeal and affirmed. 4 Cir., 121 F.2d 631.\n If no more than a question of construction of a federal statute had been involved, there would have been no necessity for a three-judge court pursuant to Section 266. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 486, 489]\n\u00a0\n In re Buder, \n271 \nU.S. 461, 466\n, 467 S., 46 S.Ct. 557, 558, 559. As a basis for its conclusion that a court of one District Judge was the appropriate forum here, the District Court stated that the 'question involved is whether under the provisions of Public Act No. 819, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., ... the taxes imposed by ... the state statute, are applicable to and collectible from the United States Army Post Exchange at Fort Jackson, Richland County, South Carolina.' \n3\n And both courts below thought that disposition of the case required only a determination of the statute of post exchanges within the meaning of the federal statute. D.C., 37 F.Supp. 972, 973, 977; 4 Cir., 121 F.2d 631, 632. But the complainants sought to restrain the state officers from enforcing the state statute upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of the threatened application. Not only was unconstitutionality the ground asserted by the complaints for the relief sought, but it appears that the relief awarded was predicated on the same ground. Cf. Wilentz v. Sovereign Camp, \n306 \nU.S. 573, 576\n, 59 S. Ct. 709, 711.\n For the federal act so far as here relevant merely declares that 'no person shall be relieved from liability' for certain State taxes 'on the ground that the sale or use, with respect to which such tax is levied, occurred in whole or in part within a Federal area.' A proviso adds that the 'Act (title) shall not be deemed to authorize the levy or collection of any tax on or from the United States or any instrumentality thereof.' The complainants assert- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 486, 490]\n\u00a0\n ing that the post exchange is a federal instrumentality to which the statutory consent does not apply, rest their entire case upon a non- statutory ground: the immunity from state taxation which they contend must be given, under the Constitution, to the post exchange as an instrumentality of the United States. And notwithstanding its assertion that only the meaning of the federal statute was involved, the District Court nevertheless found it necessary to include in the opinion accompanying the decree a statement that the threats and attempts to enforce the State statute 'constitute an interference with the activities of the United States and are unconstitutional.'\n Here a substantial charge has been made that a state statute as applied to the complainants violates the Constitution. Under such circumstances we have held that relief in the form of an injunction can be afforded only by a three-judge court pursuant to Section 266. Stratton v. St. Louis S.W.R. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 10\n, 51 S.Ct. 8; Ex parte Bransford, \n310 \nU.S. 354, 361\n, 60 S.Ct. 947, 951. And this is not, like Phillips v. United States, \n312 \nU.S. 246\n, 61 S.Ct. 480, a case in which the state officials threatened to engage in conduct which state law could not reasonably be construed to authorize. The complainants in this case sought interlocutory and permanent injunctions against 'the enforcement, operation, or execution' of a 'statute of a State'; they sought to restrain the action of officers 'of such State in the enforcement or execution of such statute'; and their attack was based entirely 'upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of such statute.'\n Since there was such complete satisfaction of the conditions which make Section 266 applicable, the cause was a proper one for a three-judge court and appeal did not lie to the Circuit Court of Appeals. But a direction by us to the Circuit Court of Appeals to dismiss the appeal \n\n[316 \nU.S. 486, 491]\n\u00a0\n which the petitioners brought to it would, without more, terminate the litigation. For the time within which a direct appeal might have been brought to this Court under Section 266 has elapsed. In the present circumstances, however, we think the petitioners' right to such an appeal should be preserved. Cf. Phillips v. United States, supra, \n312 \nU.S. 254\n, 61 S.Ct. 484. The judgment below is therefore vacated and the cause remanded to the district court for the entry of a fresh decree from which a timely appeal may be taken if the petitioners so desire. It is so ordered.\n Judgment vacated. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Code of Laws of South Carolina (1932) Vol. II, Sections 2527-2557. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 28 U.S.C.  380, 28 U.S.C.A.  380. This section provides in part: 'No interlocutory injunction suspending or restraining the enforcement, operation, or execution of any statute of a State by restraining the action of any officer of such State in the enforcement or execution of such statute ... shall be issued or granted ... unless the application for the same shall be presented to ... and shall be heard and determined by three judges, of whom at least one shall be a justice of the Supreme Court or a circuit judge, and the other two may be either circuit or district judges, and unless a majority of said three judges shall concur in granting such application. ... An appeal may be taken direct to the Supreme Court of the United States from the order granting or denying ... an interlocutory injunction in such case.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] There was a stipulation between the parties that if the complainants should prevail with respect to the post exchanges at Fort Jackson, the relief granted should be applicable to certain other post exchanges, ships' stores, and officers' clubs. Both courts below proceeded on the assumption, which we accept here, that all of these organizations were located in 'Federal areas.' To this extent, if any, that this assumption is incorrect, Public Act No. 819 has no relevance whatsoever. \n\n\n\n\n","103":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nREEVES v. BEARDALL(1942)\nNo. 841\nArgued: Decided: May 11, 1942\n\n\n\n Mr. Daniel Burke, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Charles R. Scott, of Jacksonville, Fla., and Charles P. Dickinson, of Orlando, Fla., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The sole question presented by this case is whether the Circuit Court of Appeals is whether the Circuit Court of Appeals \n\n[316 \nU.S. 283, 284]\n\u00a0\n from the District Court on the ground that the judgment in question was 'not final'.\n The jurisdiction of the District Court was invoked on the basis of diversity of citizenship. The complaint contained three counts. Count I contained a claim on a promissory note executed by respondent's decedent. Count II contained a claim on an alleged contract between petitioner and respondent's decedent whereby the latter agreed not to change her will in consideration of petitioner's return of certain securities and petitioner's agreement not to press for payment of the note. Specific performance or in the alternative damages equal to the net value of the estate was sought. Count III contained a claim against one Hamer who was alleged to hold certain assets of decedent to which petitioner was entitled by reason of the contract on which Count II was based. The prayer was for an accounting against Hamer. Respondent moved to dismiss Counts II and III. The motion was granted with permission to the petitioner to amend. Counts II and III were amended in respects not material here. Respondent then moved to dismiss Count II. Petitioner having announced that she did not desire to amend, the court granted the motion and ordered that 'final judgment' be entered on Count II in favor of respondent. An appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals was dismissed without opinion on the ground that it 'was taken from a judgment that is not final'. We granted the petition for certiorari because of an apparent conflict between that decision and such cases from other circuits as Collins v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corp., 2 Cir., 106 F.2d 83.\n In this type of case the Circuit Court of Appeals has appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal only 'final decisions'. Judicial Code  128, 28 U.S.C.  225, 28 U.S.C.A.  225. The Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, provide: 'When more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, the court at any \n\n[316 \nU.S. 283, 285]\n\u00a0\n stage, upon a determination of the issues material to a particular claim and all counterclaims arising out of the transaction or occurrence which is the subject matter of the claim, may enter a judgment disposing of such claim. The judgment shall terminate the action with respect to the claim so disposed of and the action shall proceed as to the remaining claims. In case a separate judgment is so entered, the court by order may stay its enforcement until the entering of a subsequent judgment or judgments and may prescribe such conditions as are necessary to secure the benefit thereof to the party in whose favor the judgment is entered.' Rule 54(b). That rule, the joinder provisions (see Rules 13, 14, 18, 20) and the provision of Rule 42 which permits the court to order a separate trial of any separate claim or issue indicate a 'definite policy' (Collins v. Metro- Goldwyn Pictures Corp., supra, 106 F.2d page 85) to permit the entry of separate judgments where the claims are 'entirely distinct'. 3 Moore, Federal Practice, Cum.Supp. 1941, p. 96. Such a separate judgment will frequently be a final judgment and appealable, though no disposition has been made of the other claims in the action. Bowles v. Commercial Casualty Ins. Co., 4 Cir., 107 F.2d 169, 170. That result promotes the policy of the Rules in expediting appeals from judgments which 'terminate the action with respect to the claim so disposed of', though the trial court has not finished with the rest of the litigation. See Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Proceedings of Institutes, Washington & New York (1938), p. 329.\n The Rules make it clear that it is 'differing occurrences or transactions, which form the basis of separate units of judicial action.' Atwater v. North American Coal Corp., 2 Cir., 111 F.2d 125, 126. And see Moore, op.cit., 92-101; 49 Yale L. Journ. 1476. If a judgment has been entered which terminates the action with respect to such a claim, it is final for purposes of appeal under  128 of the Judicial \n\n[316 \nU.S. 283, 286]\n\u00a0\n Code. The judgment here in question meets that test. The claim against respondent on the promissory note was unrelated to the claim on the contract not to change the will. Those two claims arose out of wholly separate and distinct transactions or engagements. And the question as to Hamer's liability to account to petitioner would arise only in the event that the claim on the contract not to change the will was sustained. Hence no question is presented here as respects the appealability of a judgment dismissing a complaint as to one of several defendants alleged to be jointly liable on the same claim. See Hunteman v. New Orleans Public Service, Inc., 5 Cir., 119 F.2d 465. After the entry of the judgment on Count II the claim based on the contract not to change the will was terminated and could not be affected by any action which the Court might take as respects the remaining claims. Nothing remained to be done except appeal.\n The judgment therefore was final.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","104":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRIGGS v. DEL DRAGO(1942)\nNo. 30\nArgued: Decided: November 9, 1942\n\n\n\n\n[317 \nU.S. 95, 96]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Davis and Otis T. Bradley, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Henry Cohen and Ludwig M. Wilson, both of New York City, for respondents del Drago.\n Mr. Anthony J. Caputo, of New York City, for respondent Byron Clark, Jr., Executor.\n Mr. Harold W. Hastings, of New York City, for respondent Harold W. Hastings, Special Guardian.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is whether  124 of the New York Decedent Estate Law, Consol.Laws c. 13,1 which provides in effect that, except as otherwise directed by the decedent's will, the burden of any federal death taxes paid by the executor or administrator shall be spread proportionately among the distributees or beneficiaries of the estate, is unconstitutional because in conflict with the federal estate tax law, Internal Revenue Code,  800 et seq., 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  800 et seq. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 95, 97]\n\u00a0\n Testatrix, a resident of New York, died on October 8, 1937, leaving a will dated March 27, 1934, which, after certain gifts of personal effects and small sums of cash, bequeathed $300,000 outright to respondent Giovanni del Drago and created a trust of $200,000 for the benefit of respondent Marcel del Drago during his life, with remainder over upon his death. The residue of testatrix's estate was left in trust for the benefit of Giovanni during his life, with remainder over upon his death. The will contained no reference to the payment of estate or inheritance taxes.\n The executors paid approximately $230,000 on account of the federal estate tax and then asked the Surrogate, in a petition for the settlement of their account, to determine whether that payment should be equitably apportioned among all the persons beneficially interested in the estate pursuant to  124 of the Decedent Estate Law. Giovanni and Marcel del Drago answered, raising objections to the constitutionality of  124. Petitioner, who was appointed special guardian to represent the interests of the infant remaindermen under the residuary trust, urged that the tax be apportioned. The Surrogate overruled the constitutional objections and directed apportionment. \n2\n The New York Court of Appeals by a divided court reversed, holding  124 repugnant to the federal estate tax law- particularly to  826(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Code,  826(b)-and in violation of the supremacy (Art. VI, cl. 2) and the uniformity (Art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 1) clauses of the Constitution. \n3\n The importance of the question moved us to grant certiorari.\n We are of opinion that Congress intended that the federal estate tax should be paid out of the estate as a whole \n\n[317 \nU.S. 95, 98]\n\u00a0\n and that the applicable state law as to the devolution of property at death should govern the distribution of the remainder and the ultimate impact of the federal tax; accordingly,  124 is not in conflict with the federal estate tax law. This conclusion is based upon the provisions of the Revenue Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 756, and subsequent acts, their legislative history and their administrative interpretation.\n In the Act of 1916 Congress turned from the previous century's inheritance tax upon the receipt of property by survivors (see Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41\n, 20 S.Ct. 747; Scholey v. Rew, 23 Wall. 331) to an estate tax upon the transmission of a statutory 'net estate' by a decedent. That act directed payment by the executor in the first instance,  207, but provided also for payment in the event that he failed to pay,  208. It did not undertake in any manner to specify who was to bear the burden of the tax. Its legislative history indicates clearly that Congress did not contemplate that the Government would be interested in the distribution of the estate after the tax was paid, and that Congress intended that state law should determine the ultimate thrust of the tax. \n4\n That Congress from \n\n[317 \nU.S. 95, 99]\n\u00a0\n 1916 onward has understood local law as governing the distribution of the estate after payment of the tax (with the limited exceptions created by  826(c) and (d) of the Internal Revenue Code, to be discussed presently) is confirmed by  812(d) of the Code, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  812(d), dealing with charitable deductions, which recognizes that estate taxes may be payable in whole or in part out of certain bequests, etc. 'by the law of the jurisdiction under which the estate is administered'.5 The administrative interpretation has been in accord,6 and that has been the understanding of the federal courts,7 and of some state courts. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n[317 \nU.S. 95, 100]\n\u00a0\n In reaching a contrary result, the court below relied primarily upon  826(b). 9 But that section does not direct how the estate is to be distributed, nor does it determine who shall bear the ultimate burden of the tax. As pointed out before, while the federal statute normally contemplates payment of the tax before the estate is distributed,  822(b) of the Code, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  822(b), provision is made for collection of the tax if distribution should precede payment.  826(a). If any distributee is thus called upon to pay the tax,  826(b) provides that such person 'shall be entitled to reimbursement out of any part of the estate still undistributed or by a just and equitable contribution by the persons whose interest in the estate of the decedent would have been reduced if the tax had been paid before the distribution of the estate'. By that section Congress intended to protect a distributee against bearing a greater burden of the tax than he would have sustained had the \n\n[317 \nU.S. 95, 101]\n\u00a0\n tax been carved out of the estate prior to distribution; any doubt that this is the proper construction is removed by the concluding clause of the section specifically stating that it is 'the purpose and intent of this subchapter that so far as is practicable and unless otherwise directed by the will of the decedent the tax shall be paid out of the estate before its distribution'. Section 826(b) does not command that the tax is a non- transferable charge on the residuary estate; to read the phrase 'the tax shall be paid out of the estate' as meaning 'the tax shall be paid out of the residuary estate' is to distort the plain language of the section and to create an obvious fallacy. For in some estates there may be no residue or else one too small to satisfy the tax; resort must then be had to state law to determine whether personalty or realty, or general, demonstrative or special legacies abate first. In short,  826(b), especially when cast in the background of Congressional intent discussed before, simply provides that, if the tax must be collected after distribution, the final impact of the tax shall be the same as though it had first been taken out of the estate before distribution, thus leaving to state law the determination of where that final impact shall be.\n Respondents also rely on  826(c),10 authorizing the executor to collect the proportionate share of the tax from the beneficiary of life insurance includable in the gross estate by reason of  811(g), and  826( d), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  811(f, g), 826(d),11 authorizing similar action against a person receiving property subject to a power which is taxable under  811(f), as forbidding further apportionment by force of state law against other \n\n[317 \nU.S. 95, 102]\n\u00a0\n distributees. \n12\n But these sections deal with property which does not pass through the executor's hands and the Congressional direction with regard to such property is wholly compatible with the intent to leave the determination of the burden of the estate tax to state law as to properties actually handled as part of the estate by the executor.\n Since  124 of the New York Decedent Estate Law is not in conflict with the federal estate tax statute, it does not contravene the supremacy clause of the Constitution. Nor does the fact that the ultimate incidence of the federal estate tax is governed by state law violate the requirement of georgraphical uniformity. Cf. Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 \nU.S. 589, 602\n, 51 S.Ct. 608, 613\n\n\n The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Chapter 709, Laws of 1930. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 175 Misc. 489, 23 N.Y.S.2d 943. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 287 N.Y. 61, 38 N.E.2d 131. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Congressman Cordell Hull, one of the supporters of the 1916 Act and its reputed draftsman, declared: 'Under the general laws of descent the proposed estate tax would be first taken out of the net estate before distribution, and distribution made under the same rule that would otherwise govern it. Where the decedent makes a will he can allow the estate tax to fasten on his net estate in the same manner, or if he objects to this equitable method of imposing it upon the entire net estate before distribution he can insert a residuary clause or other provision in his will, the effect of which would more or less change the incidence of the tax.' 53 Cong.Rec. 10657.\n Congressman Kitchin, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, stated: 'We levy an entirely different system of inheritance tax. We levy the tax on the transfer of the flat or whole net estate. We do not follow the beneficiaries and see how much this one gets and that one gets, and what rate should be levied on lineal and what on collateral relations, but we simply levy on the net estate.

James A. Branch, Robert S. Sams, and Aaron Finger were on the brief, for petitioners.[ Riley v. New York Trust Co. \n315 \nU.S. 343\n (1942) ]\n\n\n[315 \nU.S. 343, 345]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Marion Smith, of Atlanta, Ga., for respondents.\n Mr. Mortimer M. Kassell, of Albany, N.Y., for State Tax Commission of New York, as amicus curiae by special leave of Court.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Coca-Cola International Corporation, incorporated in Delaware, filed a bill of interpleader in a Delaware Court of Chancery against Julian Riley and Hughes Spalding, petitioners here, the Executors of Mrs. Julia M. Hungerford, with letters testamentary issued by the Court of Ordinary of Fulton County, Georgia, and against The New York Trust Company, the respondent, a New York corporation, as temporary administrator (afterward administrator c.t.a.) of the same decedent, appointed by the Surrogate's Court for New York County, New York.\n The Georgia executors and the New York administrator each claim the right to have transferred to them in their representative capacity stock in the Coca-Cola corporation now on its books in the name of the decedent. The outstanding certificates are in Georgia in the hands of the Georgia executors. The parties are agreed, and it \n\n[315 \nU.S. 343, 346]\n\u00a0\n is therefore assumed that Delaware is the situs of the stock. In accordance with the prayer of the bill, the Delaware court directed the adversary claimants to interplead between themselves as to their respective claims.\n The Georgia executors assert that original domiciliary probate of Mrs. Hungerford's will in solemn form was obtained by them in Georgia with all beneficiaries and heirs at law of testatrix, including her husband, Robert Hungerford, actual parties by personal service. These, it is conceded, were all the parties under the law of Georgia entitled to be heard on the probate of the will. The respondent administrator c.t.a. was not a party. The record of probate includes a determination by special finding, over the objection of the caveator, the husband, that the testatrix was domiciled in Georgia. The special finding was specifically approved as an essential fact to determine the jurisdiction of the Court of Ordinary by the highest court of Georgia in its affirmance of the probate. Hungerford v. Spalding, 183 Ga. 547, 189 S.E. 2.\n These facts were alleged by petitioners in their statement of claim to the stock filed below in response to the decree of interpleader. Exemplified copies of the probate record of the several Georgia courts were pleaded and proven as were the applicable Georgia statutes governing domiciliary probate. From the facts alleged, petitioners inferred the conclusive establishment of the place for domiciliary distribution against 'all persons' and prayed the issue to them of new certificates. An offer was made to pay all Delaware taxes or charges on the stock. At the trial petitioners relied upon Article IV, Section 1, of the Federal Constitution, 1 the full faith and credit clause, as determinative of their right to the new certificates. The \n\n[315 \nU.S. 343, 347]\n\u00a0\n pleading and trial contention adequately raised the Constitutional question. Tilt v. Kelsey, \n207 \nU.S. 43, 50\n, 28 S.Ct. 1, 3.\n Respondent admitted that all parties entitled under the law of Georgia to be heard in opposition to probate were actually before the Georgia courts. It denied that Mrs. Hungerford was domiciled in Georgia or that the Georgia judgment of domicile and probate was binding on it, and averred testatrix' domicile at death was New York. It further averred that there were New York creditors of the estate interested in the proper and lawful administration of the estate, and that New York had certain claims for inheritance and estate taxes. Its own subsequent appointment by the Surrogate's Court of New York County, New York, on the suggestion of testatrix' husband and the State Tax Commission, was pleaded with applicable provisions of New York probate and estate tax law. By stipulation it was established that petitioners and the heirs and beneficiaries of testatrix, except her husband who was an actual party, were notified of the New York proceedings for probate only by publication or substituted service of the citation in Georgia and did not appear. As a domiciliary administrator c.t.a. the respondent prayed the issue to it of new certificates for the stock in controversy.\n The trial court concluded from the evidence adduced at the hearings that the testatrix was domiciled in Georgia. It was therefore, as the court stated, unnecessary for it to consider the binding effect of the Georgia judgment. \n2\n The Supreme Court of Delaware reversed this finding of fact, determined that New York was testatrix' domicile and denied petitioners' contention that Article IV, Section 1, of the Constitution required the award of the certificates of stock to the Georgia executors. The Coca-Cola \n\n[315 \nU.S. 343, 348]\n\u00a0\n Corporation was directed to issue its stock certificate to the respondent, the New York administrator c.t.a. New York Trust Co. v. Riley, Del.Sup., 16 A.2d 772. Because of the importance of issues previously undecided by this Court, certiorari was granted to review the alleged error, to wit, the asserted denial of full faith and credit to the Georgia judgment. \n313 \nU.S. 555\n, 61 S.Ct. 1105.\n The constitutional effect of the Georgia decree on a claim in his own name in another state by a party to the Georgia proceedings is not here involved. \n3\n The question we are to decide is whether this Georgia judgment on domicile conclusively establishes the right of the Georgia executors to demand delivery to them of personal assets of their testatrix which another state is willing to surrender to the domiciliary personal representative4 when another representative, appointed by a third state, asserts a similar domiciliary right. For the purpose of this review the conclusion of Delaware that the testatrix was in fact domiciled in New York is accepted. The answer to the question lies in the extent to which Article IV, section 1, of the Constitution, as made applicable by R.S.  905,5 nevertheless controls Delaware's action.\n This clause of the Constitution brings to our Union a useful means for ending litigation. Matters once decided between adverse parties in any state or territory are at rest. Were it not for this full faith and credit provision, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 343, 349]\n\u00a0\n so far as the Constitution controls the matter, adversaries could wage again their legal battles whenever they met in other jurisdictions. Each state could control its own courts but itself could not project the effect of its decisions beyond its own boundaries. Cf. Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 \nU.S. 714\n, 722. That clause compels that controversies be stilled so that where a state court has jurisdiction of the parties and subject matter, its judgment controls in other states to the same extent as it does in the state where rendered. Roche v. McDonald, \n275 \nU.S. 449, 451\n, 48 S.Ct. 142, 53 A.L.R. 1141. This is true even though the cause of action merged in the judgment could not have been enforced in the state wherein the enforcement of the judgment is sought. Christmas v. Russell, 5 Wall. 290, 302; Fauntleroy v. Lum, \n210 \nU.S. 230, 236\n, 28 S.Ct. 641, 643.6 By the Constitutional provision for full faith and credit, the local doctrines of res judicata, speaking generally, become a part of national jurisprudence, and therefore federal questions cognizable here.\n The Constitution does not require, McElmoyle v. Cohen, 13 Pet. 312, 328; Milwaukee County v. M. E. White Co., \n296 \nU.S. 268, 276\n, 56 S.Ct. 229, 233, nor does Delaware provide that the judgments of Georgia have the force of those of her own courts. A suit in Delaware must precede any local remedy on the Georgia judgment. Subject to the Constitutional requirements, Delaware's decisions are based on Delaware jurisprudence. Her sovereignty determines personal and property rights within her territory. Subject to Constitutional limitations, it was her prerogative to distribute the property located in Delaware or to direct its transmission to the domiciliary representative of the deceased. State of Iowa v. Slimmer, \n248 \nU.S. 115, 121\n, 39 S.Ct. 33, 34. The full faith and credit clause allows Delaware in disposing of local assets to determine the question of domicile anew for any inter- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 343, 350]\n\u00a0\n ested party who is not bound by participation in the Georgia proceeding. Thormann v. Frame, \n176 \nU.S. 350, 356\n, 20 S.Ct. 446, 448; Overby v. Gordon, \n177 \nU.S. 214, 227\n, 20 S.Ct. 603, 608; Burbank v. Ernst, \n232 \nU.S. 162\n, 34 S.Ct. 299; Baker v. Baker, Eccles & Co., \n242 \nU.S. 394, 400\n, 37 S.Ct. 152, 154. It must be admitted that this reexamination may result in conflicting decisions upon domicile, but that is an inevitable consequence of the existing federal system which endows its citizens with the freedom to choose the state or states within which they desire to carry on business, enjoy their leisure or establish their residences. Worcester County Co. v. Riley, \n302 \nU.S. 292, 299\n, 58 S.Ct. 185, 187.7 But while allowing Delaware to determine domicile for itself, where any interested party is not bound by the Georgia proceedings, the full faith and credit clause and R.S.  905, note 5, supra, do require that Delaware shall give Georgia judgments such faith and credit 'as they have by law or usage' in Georgia.\n We note but need not discuss at length the respondent's contention that our application of Georgia law is limited to the statutes, decisions and usages of that state pleaded or proven in the Delaware proceedings8 and that \n\n[315 \nU.S. 343, 351]\n\u00a0\n for such further rules of law, as may be needed to reach a conclusion here, we must necessarily, in reviewing a Delaware judgment, rely upon the law which, in the absence of proof of other Georgia law, properly guided the state courts, that is the Delaware law. \n9\n At any rate, the cases relied upon by petitioners to establish the Georgia law, Tant v. Wigfall, 65 Ga. 412, and Wash v. Dickson, 147 Ga. 540, 94 S.E. 1009, are cited in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Georgia pleaded in these proceedings. We think they may be considered by us under the Delaware law. No objection below was made by respondent to the citations. The opinion of the Georgia Supreme Court was properly in the record and, in the absence of a contrary ruling by Delaware, we are of the view that they may be properly considered here. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n[315 \nU.S. 343, 352]\n\u00a0\n We find nothing in either of these cases, however, which would lead to the conclusion that in Georgia, the New York administrator c.t.a. was in privity, so far as the sequestration of assets for the payment of death taxes or indebtedness of decedent or her estate is concerned, with any parties before the Georgia court, or that the New York representative could not take steps in Georgia courts which might result in its getting possession of any assets which under the Georgia law of administration would be properly deliverable to a foreign domiciliary administrator. In the Tant case, Georgia refused to permit a collateral attack on a judgment of probate allegedly entered without jurisdiction of the subject matter. It was held that such attack must be made in the court where judgment was rendered. The effect of a judgment entered without jurisdiction of the persons whose rights were purportedly affected was not discussed. In the Wash case, there was simply a ruling that a judgment of the court of ordinary could not be collaterally attacked by parties or privies, unless the record negatived the existence of necessary 'jurisdictional facts.' Whom the court would classify as 'privies' to a judgment in personam does not appear, and the opinion of the court below makes it amply plain that there was no privity under Delaware law. Hence, if the Georgia judgment is to bind the New York administrator, it can be considered to do so only in rem.\n By Section 113-602, Georgia Code of 1933, set up by petitioner as a basis for his contention as to the finality of the Georgia judgment in Delaware, it is provided that the Court of Ordinary is given exclusive jurisdiction over the probate of wills and that 'such probate is conclusive upon \n\n[315 \nU.S. 343, 353]\n\u00a0\n all the parties notified, and all the legatees under the will who are represented in the executor.' All the parties entitled to be heard in opposition to the probate, including Mr. Hungerford, were actually before the Court of Ordinary. It may be assumed that the judgment of probate and domicile is a judgment in rem and therefore as 'an act of the sovereign power,' 'its effect cannot be disputed' within the jurisdiction. \n11\n But this does not bar litigation anew by a stranger of facts upon which the decree in rem is based. \n12\n Hence it cannot be said, we think, that because respondent would have no standing in Georgia to contest the probate of a will and, we assume, the preliminary determination of domicile, held necessary in Hungerford v. Spalding, 183 Ga. 547, 550, 189 S.E. 2, 3, thereafter respondent could not file a claim in Delaware, dependent upon domiciliary representation of testatrix, for assets in the latter state. While the Georgia judgment is to have the same faith and credit in Delaware as it does in Georgia, that requirement does not give the Georgia judgment extra-territorial effect upon assets in other states. So far as the assets in Georgia are concerned the Georgia judgment of probate is in rem; so far as it affects personalty beyond the state, it is in personam and can bind only parties thereto or their privies. This is the result of the ruling in Baker v. Baker, Eccles & Co., \n242 \nU.S. 394, 400\n, 37 S.Ct. 152, 154.13 Phrased \n\n[315 \nU.S. 343, 354]\n\u00a0\n somewhat differently, if the effect of a probate decree in Georgia in personam was to bar a stranger to the decree from later asserting his rights, such a holding would deny procedural due process.\n It seems quite obvious that the administrator c.t.a. appears in Delaware as an agency of the State of New York, and not as the alter ego of the beneficiaries of the Hungerford estate. In its answer to the petitioners' statement of claim it established its status by alleging \n\n[315 \nU.S. 343, 355]\n\u00a0\n that not merely the beneficiaries but creditors residing in New York and the State of New York were interested in the estate, that its appointment as temporary administrator had been sought by the New York Tax Commissioner 'to protect the claim of the State of New York to inheritance and succession taxes,' that the State of New York was asserting such claims in substantial amount on the theory that the domicile was New York, and that under New York law, as evidenced by statutes likewise pleaded, an administrator was 'vested by law with the right to possession and control over and to exercise all manner of dominion over all of the goods and chattels and personal property of every kind and description of the estate of a decedent.'\n A state is interested primarily not in the payment of particular creditors, nor in the succession of heirs or beneficiaries, as such, but in the administration of the property of its citizens, wherever located, and that of strangers within its boundaries. In a society where inheritance is an important social concept, the managing of decedents' property is a sovereign right which may not be readily frustrated.\n Georgia and New York might each assert its right to administer the estates of its domiciliaries to protect its sovereign interests and Delaware was free to decide for itself which claimant is entitled to receive the portion of Mrs. Hungerford's personalty within Delaware's borders.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE.\n I concur upon the single ground that the New York administrator was not bound by the Georgia judgment. He was not a party to the Georgia proceedings, nor was he represented by any of those who were parties. As administrator appointed under the New York statutes he \n\n[315 \nU.S. 343, 356]\n\u00a0\n was charged with the duty of administering the estate of the decedent and paying inheritance taxes upon it. His interest so far as he owes duties to the state is therefore adverse to that of the husband and the next of kin, who alone were parties to the Georgia proceeding. To have bound him by representation of those so adverse in interest would have been a denial of due process. Hansberry v. Lee, \n311 \nU.S. 32\n, 61 S.Ct. 115, 132 A.L.R. 741. A judgment so obtained is not entitled to full faith and credit with respect to those not parties. Pink v. A.A.A. Highway Express, \n314 \nU.S. 201\n, 62 S.Ct. 241, 86 L.Ed. --, 137 A.L.R. 957; Baker v. Baker, Eccles & Co., \n242 \nU.S. 394\n, 37 S.Ct. 152; Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1, 18\n, 48 S.Ct. 410, 416. Any other conclusion would foreclose New York from litigating its right to collect taxes lawfully due, by the simple expedient of a probate by the next of kin of the will of the decedent as the domiciled resident of another state, without notice to any representative of New York or opportunity to be heard.\n It is unnecessary to consider the other questions discussed by the opinion.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER and Mr. Justice JACKSON concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and Judicial Proceedings of every other State.

The question certified relates to the power of the Court of Appeals to stay the enforcement of an order of the Federal Communications Commission pending determination of an appeal taken under  402(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 1064, 1093, 47 U.S.C.A.  402(b). \n\n[316 \nU.S. 4, 5]\n\u00a0\n The circumstances which induced the Court to certify the question are these: On October 10, 1939, the Commission granted without hearing the application of WCOL, Inc., licensee of Station WCOL, Columbus, Ohio, for a construction permit to change its frequency from 1210 to 1200 kilocycles and to increase its power from 100 to 250 watts. The appellant, Scripps- Howard Radio, Inc., which is the licensee of Station WCPO, Cincinnati, Ohio, operating on a frequency of 1200 kilocycles with power of 250 watts, filed a petition for 'hearing or rehearing' requesting the Commission to vacate its previous order and set the WCOL application for hearing. The Commission denied this petition on March 29, 1940, and an appeal followed. In its statement of 'reasons for appeal', the appellant claimed that the Commission could not lawfully grant the WCOL application without hearing; that in granting the application theCommission departed from its rules and standards of good engineering practice; that the appellant was entitled to a hearing in order to show that the Commission's action did not serve the public interest since it would result in materially reducing the coverage of Station WCPO and thereby deprive a substantial number of listeners of 'the only local regional non-network service' available to them; and that in granting the WCOL application without hearing, the Commission violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n The appellant asked the Court of Appeals to stay the Commission's order pending the disposition of its appeal. Even though the Court 'had consistently over a long period of years, and without objection on the part of the Commission, issued stay orders' in cases where such orders were found to be necessary, the Commission opposed the issuance of a stay order in this case on the ground that the Court was without power to grant a stay. The application was heard before the Court sitting with \n\n[316 \nU.S. 4, 6]\n\u00a0\n three judges, which, with one judge dissenting, upheld the Commission's contention. A motion for rehearing before all six members of the Court was granted. The judges being equally divided on the question of the Court's power to grant a stay, the following question was certified to us:\n'Where, pursuant to the provisions of Section 402(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, an appeal has been taken, to the United States Court of Appeals, from an order of the Federal Communications Commission, does the court, in order to preserve the status quo pending appeal, have power to stay the execution of the Commission's order from which the appeal was taken, pending the determination of the appeal?'\n\n The Commission suggests that the certificate should be dismissed because of the generality of the question. Lowden v. Northwestern Nat. Bank, \n298 \nU.S. 160\n, 56 S.Ct. 696. Read in the light of the preliminary statement certifying the facts which presented the question, Hill v. United States ex rel. Wampler, \n298 \nU.S. 460, 464\n, 56 S.Ct. 760, 762, the question is limited to the type of order made by the Commission in this case. It is therefore sufficiently specific.\n The Communications Act of 1934 is a hybrid. By that Act, 47 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., Congress established a comprehensive system for the regulation of communication by wire and radio. To secure effective execution of its policy of making available 'a rapid, efficient, Nation- wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges', Congress created a new agency, the Federal Communications Commission, to which it entrusted authority previously exercised by several other agencies. Under the Radio Act of 1927, 44 Stat. 1162, 47 U.S.C.A.  81 et seq., the Federal Radio Commission had broad powers over the licensing and regulation of radio facilities. The Mann-Elkins Act of 1910, 36 Stat. 539, 49 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq., gave the Interstate Commerce Commission general regulatory authority over telephone and telegraph carriers. In addition, the Post- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 4, 7]\n\u00a0\n master General was empowered, under the Post Roads Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 221, 47 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq., to fix rates on government telegrams. \n1\n The Communications Act of 1934 was designed to centralize this scattered regulatory authority in one agency. See Message from the President to Congress, February 26, 1934, Sen.Doc. No. 144, 73d Cong., 2d Sess.; Sen. Rep. No. 781, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 1; H.Rep. No. 1850, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 3-4.\n The provisions for judicial review in the Act of 1934 reflect its mixed origins. Section 402(a) makes the provisions of the Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22, 1913, 38 Stat. 208, 219, 28 U.S.C.A.  41( 28), pertaining to judicial review of orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission, applicable to 'suits to enforce, enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend any order of the Commission under this Act (chapter) (except any order of the Commission granting or refusing an application for a construction permit for a radio station, or for a radio station license, or for renewal of an existing radio station license, or for modification of an existing radio station license)'. 48 Stat. 1064, 1093, 47 U.S.C.A.  402(a). The Urgent Deficiencies Act, which is thus incorporated in  402(a) of the Communications Act of 1934, provides for review in a specially constituted district court, with direct appeal to this Court. That Act authorizes the district court, in cases 'where irreparable damage would otherwise ensue to the petitioner', to allow a temporary stay of the order under review, subject to specified safeguards. 38 Stat. 208, 220, 28 U.S.C. A.  47. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 4, 8]\n\u00a0\n Section 402(b) of the Communications Act of 1934 provides for review of the orders excepted from  402(a). It gives an appeal 'from decisions of the Commission to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia in any of the following cases: (1) By any applicant for a construction permit for a radio station, or for a radio station license, or for renewal of an existing radio station license, or for modification of an existing radio station license, whose application is refused by the Commission. (2) By any other person aggrieved or whose interests are adversely affected by any decision of the Commission granting or refusing any such application.' 48 Stat. 1064, 1093. This section follows  16 of the Radio Act of 1927, 44 Stat. 1162, as amended in 1930, 46 Stat. 844, 47 U.S.C.A.  96, the relevant portions of which are set forth in the margin. \n2\n See Sen.Rep.No. 781, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 9; H. Report No. 1918, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 49-50; remarks of Senator Dill, in charge of the measure in the Senate, 78 Cong.Rec. 8825, and of Representative Rayburn, who occupied the same role in the House, 78 Cong.Rec. 10314.\n Thus, in both the Radio Act of 1927 and the Communications Act of 1934, orders granting or denying applications for construction permits or station licenses and for renewal or modification of licenses were made reviewable by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[316 \nU.S. 4, 9]\n\u00a0\n And with respect to such appeals, both  16 of the Radio Act and  402(b) of the Communications Act were silent with respect to the power of the Court of Appeals to stay orders pending appeal. It is upon this silence in the Communications Act that the Commission bases its contention, made for the first time when this litigation arose in 1940, that the Court is without such power.\n No court can make time stand still. The circumstances surrounding a controversy may change irrevocably during the pendency of an appeal, despite anything a court can do. But within these limits it is reasonable that an appellate court should be able to prevent irreparable injury to the parties or to the public resulting from the premature enforcement of a determination which may later be found to have been wrong. It has always been held, therefore, that, as part of its traditional equipment for the adminis- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 4, 10]\n\u00a0\n tration of justice, 4 a federal court can stay the enforcement of a judgment pending the outcome of an appeal. In re Claasen, \n140 \nU.S. 200\n, 11 S.Ct. 735; In re McKenzie, \n180 \nU.S. 536\n, 21 S.Ct. 468.\n Generally speaking, judicial review of administrative orders is limited to determining whether errors of law have been committed. Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 125, 139\n, 140 S., 59 S. Ct. 754, 761, 762. Because of historical differences in the relationship between administrative bodies and reviewing courts and that between lower and upper courts, a court of review exhausts its power when it lays bare a misconception of law and compels correction. Federal Communications Commission v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., \n309 \nU.S. 134, 144\n, 145 S., 60 S.Ct. 437, 442. If the administrative agency has committed errors of law for the correction of which the legislature has provided appropriate resort to the courts, such judicial review would be an idle ceremony if the situation were irreparably changed before the correction could be made. The existence of power in a reviewing court to stay the enforcement of an administrative order does not mean, of course, that its exercise should be without regard to the division of function which the legislature has made between the administrative body and the court of review. 'A stay is not a matter of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise result to the appellant. In re Haberman Manufacturing Co., \n147 \nU.S. 525\n, 13 S.Ct. 527. It is an exercise of judicial discretion. The propriety of its issue is dependent upon the circumstances of \n\n[316 \nU.S. 4, 11]\n\u00a0\n the particular case.' Virginian Ry. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 672\n, 673 S., 47 S.Ct. 222, 227, 228; see Merchants' Warehouse Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 501, 513\n, 514 S., 51 S.Ct. 505, 509, 510\n\n\n These controlling considerations compel the assumption that Congress would not, without clearly expressing such a purpose, deprive the Court of Appeals of its customary power to stay orders under review. It is urged that such a manifestation appears in the provisions for judicial review contained in the Communications Act of 1934. Specifically, the Commission contends that since  402(a) incorporates the provisions of the Urgent Deficiencies Act of 1913 which explicitly authorize and regulate the issuance of stay orders, the ommission of any reference in  402(b) to a power to stay orders under review reflects a deliberate Congressional choice to deprive the Court of Appeals of this power.\n The search for significance in the silence of Congress is too often the pursuit of a mirage. We must be wary against interpolating our notions of policy in the interstices of legislative provisions. Here Congress said nothing about the power of the Court of Appeals to issue stay orders under  402(b). But denial of such power is not to be inferred merely because Congress failed specifically to repeat the general grant of auxiliary powers to the federal courts. The Commission argues that the silence of Congress, in view of the legislative history of the Act and the nature of the orders reviewable under the Act, qualifies this general authority and is as commanding as if Congress had expressly withheld from the Court of Appeals the power to stay orders appealed under  402(b).\n The legislative history can furnish no support for this contention. Neither the committee reports nor the hearings nor the debates contain any reference to the power to stay Commission orders on appeal. Significance is found in H.R. 7716, 72d Congress, a bill which was passed by both houses in 1933 but which failed of enactment be- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 4, 12]\n\u00a0\n cause of a pocket veto. That bill proposed to amend  16 of the Radio Act of 1927 so as to vest concurrent jurisdiction (with the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia) of revocation cases in the circuit courts of appeals, rather than in the district courts. The bill also provided that the reviewing court, whether a circuit court of appeals or the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, could enter a stay order 'upon the giving of a bond by the party applying for the stay in such amount and with such terms and conditions' as the court deemed proper.\n It is suggested that if Congress had intended in the Act of 1934 to authorize the Court of Appeals to issue stay orders in appeals under  402( b), it would not have remained silent when only the year before it had attempted to enact into law a specific provision conferring that power. But H.R. 7716 and the Communications Act of 1934 were not parallel legislative proposals. The former was not a comprehensive legislative scheme for the unification of federal regulatory authority over communications. It proposed merely to amend the Radio Act of 1927 in several minor particulars. See H.Rep. No. 221, 72d Cong. 1st Sess., p. 7; Sen.Rep. No. 564, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., p. 7; Sen.Rep. No. 1004, 72d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 9. The enactment of the Communications Act of 1934, however, came after a message to Congress from the President on February 26, 1934, recommending the creation of a single authority over communication by wire and radio. Sen.Doc. No. 144, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. Earlier in 1934 an interdepartmental committee had made a study of the entire communications situation. Extensive public hearings on the question of regulating the whole field of communications were held by both the Senate and House Committees on Interstate Commerce. It is obvious, therefore, that what Congress undertook to do by the Communications Act of 1934 was entirely different from what it tried to do the previous year in H.R. 7716. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 4, 13]\n\u00a0\n We are told that in drafting  402 Congress had before it and relied extensively upon H.R. 7716, and reference is made to the citations to that bill in the statement of the House managers. H.Rep. No. 1918, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 47-49. But whatever reliance was placed upon H.R. 7716 by the framers of the 1934 legislation was without relation to its provisions for judicial review. For in that same statement (p. 47) it is said that 'provisions of the Radio Act of 1927 relating to judicial review have been included' in the bill. And, as has previously been noted, even though the Radio Act of 1927 contained no provisions dealing with the authority of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to stay orders of the Commission on appeal, the Court had been issuing stays as a matter of course wherever they were found to be appropriate, without objection by the Commission. Boston Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Radio Commission, 62 App.D.C. 299, 67 F.2d 505, decided June 19, 1933.\n It is indisputable that, at least since 1930, the Court of Appeals has been staying orders both of the Federal Radio Commission, under  16 of the Radio Act of 1927, and of the Federal Communications Commission, under  402(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, whenever stays were regarded as necessary. To be sure, in only one case, the Boston Broadcasting decision, supra, did the Court of Appeals even refer to the granting of a stay order. The explanation is not hard to find. The power to stay was so firmly imbedded in our judicial system, so consonant with the historic procedures of federal appellate courts, that there was no necessity for the Court of Appeals to justify its settled practice. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[316 \nU.S. 4, 14]\n\u00a0\n The considerations of policy which are invoked are as fragile as the legislative materials are inapposite. It is said that the nature of the orders reviewable under  402(b) makes the grant of a stay order manifestly inappropriate since a stay would in effect involve the judicial exercise of an administrative function. An example is adduced of an appeal from an order denying an application for a construction permit or a station license, or for modification or renewal of a license. Of course, no court can grant an applicant an authorization which the Commission has refused. No order that the Court of Appeals could make would enable an applicant to go on the air when the Commission has denied him a license to do so. A stay of an order denying an application would in the nature of things stay nothing. It could not operate as an affirmative authorization of that which the Commission has refused to authorize. But this is no reason for denying the Court the power to issue a stay in a situation where the function of the stay is to avoid irreparable injury to the public interest sought to be vindicated by the appeal.\n The Communications Act of 1934 did not create new private rights. The purpose of the Act was to protect the public interest in communications. By  402(b) (2) Congress gave the right of appeal to persons 'aggrieved or whose interests are adversely affected' by Commission action. 48 Stat. 1064, 1093. But these private litigants have standing only as representatives of the public interest. Federal Communications Commission v. Sanders Bros. Radio Station, \n309 \nU.S. 470, 477\n, 642 S., 60 S.Ct. 693, 698, 1037. Compare National Licorice Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n309 \nU.S. 350, 362\n, 363 S., 60 S.Ct. 569, 576. That \n\n[316 \nU.S. 4, 15]\n\u00a0\n a court is called upon to enforce public rights and not the interests of private property does not diminish its power to protect such rights. 'Courts of equity may, and frequently do, go much farther both to give and withhold relief in furtherance of the public interest than they are accustomed to go when only private interests are involved.' Virginian Ry. v. System Federation, \n300 \nU.S. 515, 552\n, 57 S.Ct. 592, 601. An historic procedure for preserving rights during the pendency of an appeal is no less appropriate-unless Congress has chosen to withdraw it- because the rights to be vindicated are those of the public and not of the private litigants. Unless Congress explicitly discloses such an intention we should not lightly attribute to it a desire to withhold from a reviewing court the power to save the public interest from injury or destruction while an appeal is being heard. To do so would stultify the purpose of Congress to utilize the courts as a means for vindicating the public interest. Courts and administrative agencies are not to be regarded as competitors in the task of safeguarding the public interest. United States v. Morgan, \n307 \nU.S. 183, 190\n, 191 S., 59 S.Ct. 795, 799; Federal Communications Commission v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., \n309 \nU.S. 134\n, 60 S.Ct. 437. Courts no less than administrative bodies are agencies of government. Both are instruments for realizing public purposes.\n It is urged that the orders reviewable under  402(a), as to which the power to grant stays is undeniable, are intrinsically different from those reviewable under  402(b). But while the two sections route appeals to different courts, the differentiation was in large measure the product of Congressional solicitude for the convenience of litigants. It had no relation to the scope of the judicial function which the courts were called upon to perform. For example, if the Commission on its own motion modifies a station license, review is had under  402(a) in the appropriate district court. However, if it grants an application for modification of a license, an appeal lies under  402( \n\n[316 \nU.S. 4, 16]\n\u00a0\n b) to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Both cases give rise to the same kind of issues on appeal. Both orders are equally susceptible of being stayed on appeal. As the legislative history of the Act plainly shows, Congress provided the two roads to judicial review only to save a licensee the inconvenience of litigating an appeal in Washington in situations where the Commission's order arose out of a proceeding not instituted by the licensee. \n 6\n\u00a0\n\n Judged by its own terms, its history, and he practice under it, the Communications Act of 1934 affords no warrant for depriving the Court of Appeals of the conventional power of an appellate court to stay the enforcement of an order pending the determination of an appeals challenging its validity. Indirect light is sometimes cast upon legislation by provisions dealing with the same problem in related enactments. No such light is shed here. The numerous law in which Congress has established administrative agencies for the exercise of its regulatory powers do not disclose any general legislative policy regarding the power to stay administrative orders pending review. Some statutes are wholly silent;7 some turn a court review into an automatic stay;8 some provide that the commencement of a suit shall not operate as a stay unless the court specifically so provides;9 some authorize the reviewing \n\n[316 \nU.S. 4, 17]\n\u00a0\n court to grant a stay where necessary. \n10\n Significantly, the recent Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 explicitly denies the power of the reviewing court to enjoin enforcement of the administrative orders. Pub. Law 421, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 50 U.S.C.A. appendix  901 et seq.\n The various enactments in which the staying power is made explicit, as well as the statutes that are silent about it, afford debating points but no reliable aids in construing the Act before us. One thing is clear. Where Congress wished to deprive the courts of this historic power, it knew how to use apt words-only once has it done so and in a statute born of the exigencies of war.\n We conclude that Congress by  402(b) of the Communications Act of 1934 has not deprived the Court of Appeals of the power to stay-a power as old as the judicial system of the nation. We do not of course go beyond the question put to us. We merely recognize the existence of the power to grant a stay. We are not concerned here with the criteria which should govern the Court in exercising that power. Nor do we in any way imply that a stay would or would not be warranted upon the showing made by the appellant in this case.\n The question certified to us is answered in the affirmative. So ordered.\n Question answered in affirmative. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 4, 18]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice BLACK took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n Congress has provided through  402(a) of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C.A.  402(a), that in appeals from certain classes of orders of the Federal Communications Commission the appellate court may issue a stay. The order here involved is of a class which is expressly excepted from  402(a). Sec. 402(b) which provides for an appeal from this class of order contains no provision whatsoever for a judicial stay. Where Congress in one section of an Act has provided for a stay of certain orders but not of others, it has not remained silent on the subject. It has drawn a line. And that line should not be obliterated by us in absence of plain and compelling indications that the purpose of Congress was different from what the fact of the statute reveals. There are no such reasons here.\n The legislative history gives no comfort to the view of the majority. In drafting  402 Congress had before it H.R. 7716, 72d Congress. That bill, designed to amend the Radio Act of 1927, had been passed by both houses in 1933 but had failed of enactment because of a pocket veto. Under  16(f) of that bill orders of the type here in question could be stayed by the appellate court. Congress relied extensively on that earlier bill in drafting  402. H.Rep. No. 1918, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 47-49. If Congress had intended the appellate court to have the power to stay this type of order, it hardly seems likely, as the Commission points out, that Congress would have failed to include it, when only the year before it had attempted to write into the statute a specific provision conferring that power. But if we disregard that circumstance and turn to other parts of the legislative history, there are no indications that the line which Congress drew \n\n[316 \nU.S. 4, 19]\n\u00a0\n between  402(a) and  402(b) was inadvertent or accidental.\n Nor are we justified in rewriting the statute to iron out possible logical inconsistencies in the classification of orders which Congress has made in  402(a) and  402(b). If we were a legislative committee, perhaps we would not retain in  402(a) orders which are made by the Commission on its own motion and which modify a station license, since such orders if made pursuant to an application are covered by  402(b). But to seize on that lack of symmetry here is to miss the forest for the trees. The nature of the run of the orders excepted from the stay provisions of  402(a) demands respect for the words of the Act. The instant case is a good illustration. Federal Communications Commission v. Sanders Bros. Radio Station, \n309 \nU.S. 470, 642\n, 60 S.Ct. 693, 1037, holds that a competitor such as appellant has no private property interest which may be protected on appeal. 'The policy of the Act is clear that no person is to have anything in the nature of a property right as a result of the granting of a license.' Id., 309 U.S. page 475, 60 S.Ct. page 697, 1037. Any injury to an existing station as is alleged here 'is not a separate and independent element to be taken into consideration by the Commission in determining whether it shall grant or withhold a license.' Id., 309 U.S. page 476, 60 S.Ct. page 698, 1037. Thus it is manifest that the failure of Congress to extend the stay provisions of  402(a) to the run of orders of this type makes sense. The Urgent Deficiencies Act, which is incorporated into  402(a), allows a temporary stay 'where irreparable damage would otherwise ensue to the petitioner'. 38 Stat. 208, 220, 28 U.S.C.A.  47. But where appeals under  402(b) (2), as in the instant case, are not shown to involve private rights, analogies to situations where the power to issue a stay is implied because irreparable damage may be done an appellant whose individual interest has been unlawfully invaded are inapposite. For the same reason, statistics as to the presence of this power in statutes of other administrative agencies \n\n[316 \nU.S. 4, 20]\n\u00a0\n are irrelevant, in absence of a showing that in the precise situations there involved no private rights were at stake.\n And that leads to a related reason why it will not do to lean on 'the historic procedures of federal appellate courts' so that an implied power to issue a stay in this type of case may be found. 'The office and jurisdiction of a court of equity, unless enlarged by express statute, are limited to the protection of rights of property.' In re Sawyer, \n124 \nU.S. 200, 210\n, 8 S.Ct. 482, 487. All constitutional questions aside (Muskrat v. United States, \n219 \nU.S. 346\n, 31 S.Ct. 250), we should require explicit, unequivocal authorization before we permitted an appellant who has no individual substantive right at stake in the litigation to obtain a stay to protect the public interest. Repeated attempts of private litigants to obtain a special stake in public rights have been consistently denied. See Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 447\n, 43 S.Ct. 597; Sprunt & Son v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 249\n, 50 S.Ct. 315; Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes, \n302 \nU.S. 464\n, 58 S. Ct. 300; Tennessee Electric Power Co. v. Tennessee Valley Authority, \n306 \nU.S. 118\n, 59 S.Ct. 366; City of Atlanta v. Ickes, \n308 \nU.S. 517\n, 60 S.Ct. 170; Singer & Sons v. Union Pacific R. Co., \n311 \nU.S. 295\n, 61 S.Ct. 254. The attempt to obtain a stay is but another manifestation, albeit oblique, of that same endeavor. Hence, instead of starting from the premise that an 'historic power' to issue a stay in this type of case will be readily implied, we should assume just the contrary. Not even long acquiescence or approval on the part of the Commission should lead us to make such a departure from those historic, accepted principles. For that reason alone  402(b) should be read narrowly and restrictively.\n But it is said that Congress entrusted the vindication of the public interest to private litigants. The Sanders case properly construed merely means that the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction of appeals by a 'person aggrieved' or by one 'whose interests are adversely affected' by the Commission's decision.  402(b). But \n\n[316 \nU.S. 4, 21]\n\u00a0\n that does not mean that an appellant has a cause of action merely because he has a competing station. Unless he can show that his individual interest has been unlawfully invaded, there is merely damnum absque injuria and no cause of action on the merits. Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes, supra; Greenwood County v. Duke Power Co., 4 Cir., 81 F.2d 986, 999. And see Duke Power Co. v. Greenwood County, \n302 \nU.S. 485\n, 58 S.Ct. 306. Congress could have said that the holder of a radio license has an individual substantive right to be free of competition resulting from the issuance of another license and causing injury. In that event, unlike the situation in Muskrat v. United States, supra, there would be a cause of action for invasion of a substantive right. But as we said in the Sanders case Congress did not create such a substantive right. And no facts are shown here which would bring this appeal outside the rule of that case. On that assumption I fail to see how an appeal statute constitutionally could authorize a person who shows no case or controversy to call on the courts to review an order of the Commission. A fortiori he would have no standing to obtain a stay.\n Furthermore, the power to issue a stay in this type of case cannot be found in the 'all writs' statutes. Judicial Code,  262, 28 U.S.C.A.  377; District of Columbia Code (1940 ed.)  11-208. As we stated in Federal Communications Commission v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., \n309 \nU.S. 134\n, page 144, 60 S.Ct. 437, page 442, the relationship between the Court of Appeals and the Commission is not that of federal courts inter se. '... to assimilate the relation of these administrative bodies and the courts to the relationship between lower and upper courts is to disregard the origin and purposes of the movement for administrative regulation and at the same time to disregard the traditional scope, however far-reaching of the judicial process. Unless these vital differentiations between the functions of judicial and administrative tri- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 4, 22]\n\u00a0\n bunals are observed, courts will stray outside their province and read the laws of Congress through the distorting lenses of inapplicable legal doctrine.' The Commission not the courts is the ultimate guardian of the public interest under this Act. The appellate court is limited to a correction of 'errors of law'. Id., 309 U.S. page 145, 60 S.Ct. page 442. The judgment of the Commission not the court determines whether the public interest will be served by an application. Id., 309 U.S. pages 144, 145, 60 S.Ct. page 442. Hence the power of the courts in this situation to issue writs under the 'all writs' statutes should be limited to the protection of its jurisdiction. If, as here, construction of a new station is completed pending appeal by another licensee, the court's jurisdiction is not impaired, though we assume that it has jurisdiction of the appeal and that appellant has a cause of action on the merits. If the Commission has committed an error of law, it must bow to the decree of the court and revise its order. But to allow the court to go beyond that and find an implied power to issue a stay in this type of case is to distort the statutory scheme. 12 Air L.Rev. 224. Jealous regard for the administrative role and function in this field will leave to Congress any enlargement within constitutional limits of the judicial power.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY joins in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] A summary of the authority vested in the Federal Radio Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Postmaster General, and of the extent to which such authority was actually exercised, is contained in Appendix A, Historical Background of the Communications Act of 1934, of the Monograph of the Attorney General's Committee on Administrative Procedure dealing with the Federal Communications Commission, Sen.

The reason for this differentiation appears in the following statement of Senator Dill, who steered the bill in the Senate:\n'I desire to call attention to what I think is an important fact to consider in this appeal provision. Those owners of radio broadcasting stations living long distances from the District of Columbia should not be required to come to Washington to prosecute an appeal from a decision for which they were not responsible. When I say 'were not responsible' I mean a decision which was granted against them or affecting them when they did not bring the case into court. ... So we provide that where the decisions of the commission are made in cases wherein the stations took no part in beginning the suits, appeal may be taken in the three-judge district courts in the jurisdictions where the stations are located. But in the case where the applicant for the license or the permit, or whatever it may be, comes to the commission and asks for a change in his license or asks for a new license, or asks for something to be done by the commission, then if the commission makes a decision from which he desires to appeal he must make his appeal in the courts of the District of Columbia.' 78 Cong.

This provision appeared in the very first Judiciary Act, 1 Stat. 73, 81-82.

Niebell, both of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Charles R. Denny, Jr., of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question presented for decision is whether the United States remains under any obligation to the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 310, 311]\n\u00a0\n Seminole Nation with respect to Article III of the Treaty of March 21, 1866, 14 Stat. 755, 756, which provides in part: '... The United States having obtained by grant of the Creek nation the westerly half of their lands, hereby grant to the Seminole nation the portion thereof hereafter described, which shall constitute the national domain of the Seminole Indians. Said lands so granted by the United States to the Seminole nation are bounded and described as follows, to wit: Beginning on the Canadian river where the line dividing the Creek lands according to the terms of their sale to the United States by their treaty of February 6, 1866, following said line due north to where said line crosses the north fork of the Canadian river; thence up said north fork of the Canadian river a distance sufficient to make two hundred thousand acres by running due south to the Canadian river; thence down said Canadian river to the place of beginning. In consideration of said cession of two hundred thousand acres of land described above, the Seminole nation agrees to pay therefor the price of fifty cents per acre, amounting to the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, ....'\n Petitioner's claim is for just compensation for the alleged taking by the United States of an asserted deficiency in the tract granted by this Article.\n Late in 1866, before the boundaries of the Seminole domain had been located, the Seminoles moved to what was assumed to be their treaty land. \n1\n The first survey \n\n[316 \nU.S. 310, 312]\n\u00a0\n of the line dividing the Creek and the Seminole territories, made by one Rankin, in 1868, under a contract with the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, was not approved by the Department of the Interior. In 1871 one Bardwell re-serveyed the dividing line and placed it seven miles west of the Rankin line. Two months later, at the direction of the Government, one Robbins ran the western boundary of the Seminole lands so as to include 200,000 acres from the Bardwell line. According to Robbins' calculations 200,000.03 acres were included between the Canadian river on the south, the north fork of the Canadian river on the north, the Bardwell line on the east and the Robbins line on the west. The Bardwell and Robbins surveys were both approved by the Secretary of the Interior on February 5, 1872.\n Meanwhile, pursuant to Article I of the Treaty of February 27, 1867, 15 Stat. 531,2 the Pottawatomie tribe selected a tract bounded 'by the West line of the Seminole lands', and on November 9, 1870, the Secretary of the Interior approved that selection. In 1872, after the location of the Robbins line, the Pottawatomies occupied the territory immediately west of that line. Subsequently, the Government allotted and patented the lands west of the Robbins line to the Pottawatomies in severalty, or sold and \n\n[316 \nU.S. 310, 313]\n\u00a0\n patented them to settlers and turned the purchase price into the Treasury as public money. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The Bardwell survey disclosed that a considerable area east of the Seminole-Creek dividing line had been occupied by the Seminoles, who had made substantial improvements on this land. In order that the Seminoles might retain the lands which they had improved, Congress authorized negotiations for the purchase of these lands east of the Bardwell line. Act of March 3, 1873, 17 Stat. 626. An agreement was entered into on February 14, 1881, with the Creek Nation whereby that Nation ceded land east of the Bardwell line to the United States, the agreement providing that the eastern boundary of the land ceded was to be drawn so that the tract would aggregate 175,000 acres. Creek Nation v. United States, 93 Ct. Cl. 561, 566. The Creeks received $175,000 for this tract. Act of August 5, 1882, 22 Stat. 257, 265. This land became a part of the Seminole domain and was disposed of either by allotment to members of the tribe or by sale for the account of the tribe.\n The possibility of a deficiency in the original 200,000 acre tract was first suspected in 1900.4 By an amended \n\n[316 \nU.S. 310, 314]\n\u00a0\n petition filed in the Court of Claims in 19375 the Seminole Nation alleged that owing to an error in the location of the Robbins line, the territory enclosed between the Robbins and Bardwell lines was 11,550.54 acres short of 200,000 acres, and that the United States took from the Seminoles 11, 550.54 acres west of the Robbins line when the Government patented that land to individuals in 1892 and subsequent years. Judgment was prayed against the United States for value at the time of taking of the 11,550.54 acres, with interest at the rate of five percent per annum. The Court of Claims made no finding as to whether a shortage in fact existed in the tract between the Bardwell and Robbins lines but held that in any event the Seminole Nation was more than compensated for the alleged shortage by the Government's purchase for the Seminoles of 175,000 acres of land from the Creek Nation. The court also stated that even if petitioner were entitled to recover for any deficit in the 200,000 acre tract, the Government would be entitled to offset the value of the 175,000 acre tract as a gratuitous expenditure under the Act of August 12, 1935, 49 Stat. 571, 596, a value assumed to be far in excess of the value of whatever deficit there may have been. We granted certiorari, \n315 \nU.S. 791\n, 62 S.Ct. 639, 86 L.Ed. --, because of the close connection between this case and Seminole Nation v. United States, \n316 \nU.S. 286\n, 62 S.Ct. 1049, 86 L.Ed. --, No. 348 this Term, decided today. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment of the Court of Claims cannot be sustained on either of the grounds advanced. The Government in this Court agrees to this proposition and \n\n[316 \nU.S. 310, 315]\n\u00a0\n suggests that the cause be remanded to the Court of Claims.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n Underlying the denial of recovery for any deficit in the 200,000 acre tract because petitioner was compensated therefor 'fifteen-fold' by the receipt of an additional 175,000 acres, is the theory that the acquisition of land by the Seminoles under the Treaty of 1866 and the acquisition of additional land to the east by transfer from the Creeks in 1882 were but two parts of an integral transaction, intended to give the Seminoles 200, 000 acres of land and thus discharge the obligation of the Treaty of 1866. However, the facts do not support that theory for in 1882 the suggestion that a shortage existed in the supposed 200,000 acre tract between the Bardwell and Robbins lines had not yet been advanced. There was therefore no thought at the time the transfer of the 175,000 acre tract was made that the Government thereby fulfilled its treaty obligation by compensating the Seminoles for a deficiency in the original tract.\n\n\n II.\n\n\n The Act of August 12, 1935, 49 Stat. 571, 596, 25 U.S.C.A.  475a, directs the Court of Claims in suits by an Indian tribe or band 'to consider and to offset against any amount found due the said tribe or band all sums expended gratuitously by the United States for the benefit of the said tribe or band.' This language plainly requires the Court of Claims to find first that money is due from the United States, to consider then whether the United States has gratuitously spent sums for the benefit of the tribe and, if it finds such gratuitous expenditures, to offset them against the amount found due.\n In allowing the gratuity offset here the Court of Claims fell short of complying with the requirements of the offset \n\n[316 \nU.S. 310, 316]\n\u00a0\n statute. There was no finding that the United States was under any liability to the Seminole Nation; the Court stated only that the value of the 175,000 acre tract was 'far in excess of the value of whatever deficit there may have been.' The shortcomings of this approach are evident. As we said in Seminole Nation v. United States, No. 348 this Term, decided today, gratuity offsets resemble a fund in a bank, to be drawn on by the Government as needed. If the Government owes nothing, it is entitled to a dismissal on that ground, and should not be compelled to use its gratuity offsets. If liability exists on the Government's part, the exact amount of gratuitous expenditures utilized to extinguish that liability, in whole or in part, should be precisely found and designated. The Government should not be held to satisfy its liability by the use of gratuity expenditures in excess of the liability. Conversely, the Indian tribe is entitled to have an exact determination of the amount owed it by the United States in order that an amount of gratuity expenditures equal to the liability may be exhausted, or that, if the available offsets are insufficient, it receive a money judgment for the difference. Otherwise confusion and the possibility of a double credit for a single offset arise, as this case and No. 348 abundantly demonstrate. In the latter case a gratuity offset in the amount of $165,847.17 on account of the purchase of the 175,000 acre tract from the Creeks was allowed, and here the assumed value of that tract is the offset employed by the Court of Claims.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded to the Court of Claims with directions to consolidate it with No. 348; to determine whether a shortage exists in the 200,000 acre tract; to determine whether the Government is liable therefor, and the amount of such liability, if a shortage exists; and, to find and designate the precise gratuitous expenditures used to offset the total liability, \n\n[316 \nU.S. 310, 317]\n\u00a0\n if any, arising from this claim and from Items Two and Five of No. 348. So ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n Mr. Justice JACKSON, dissents. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Although negotiations were in progress with the Creeks at time the Seminole treaty was made and a treaty was signed with them on February 6, 1866, the Creek treaty was not concluded until June 14, 1866. See 14 Stat. 785. The dividing line between the two halves of the Creek country was not settled until the Bardwell survey was approved in 1872. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] By that Article the United States agreed that a delegation from the Pottawatomies should accompany a government commission to the Indian country '... in order to select, if possible, a suitable location for their people without interfering with the locations made for other Indians; and if such location shall be found satisfactory to the Pottawatomies, and approved by the Secretary of the Interior, such tract of land, not exceeding thirty miles square, shall be set apart as a reservation for the exclusive use and occupancy of that tribe; and upon the survey of its lines and boundaries, and ascertaining of its area, and payment to the United States for the same, as hereinafter mentioned and set forth, the said tract shall be patented to the Pottawatomie nation.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Provision was made for allotting the lands to the Pottawatomies in severalty by Act of May 23, 1872, 17 Stat. 159, and Act of February 8, 1887, 24 Stat. 388, 25 U.S.C.A.  331 et seq. By an agreement ratified by Act of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 989, 1016-1017, the Pottawatomies ceded to the Government the tract assigned to them. It was stipulated in the agreement that all allotments in severalty, made or to be made, should be completed and confirmed, and that other allotments in severalty could be made until February 8, 1891. The ratifying act provided that the remaining lands were to be opened to settlement as public lands. 26 Stat. 1026. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Letter from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior, dated February 5, 1900.\n Letter from the Acting Secretary of the Interior to the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes, dated October 16, 1900. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The original petition was filed in 1930.

Denny, Jr., of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit to adjudicate certain claims of the Seminole Nation against the United States growing out of various treaties, agreements, and acts of Congress is now before us for the second time. After we reversed, \n299 \nU.S. 417\n, 57 S.Ct. 283, for want of jurisdiction in the Court of Claims a previous \n\n[316 \nU.S. 286, 289]\n\u00a0\n judgment of that court awarding the Seminole Nation $1,317,087.27, 1 the jurisdictional barrier was removed by statute,2 and the Seminole Nation then filed a second amended petition in the Court of Claims reasserting the six items of claim previously denied by this Court on jurisdictional grounds. \n3\n The Court of Claims thereupon disallowed three items in their entirety, allowed one in full and allowed the remaining two in part, deciding that the Seminole Nation was entitled to $18,388.30, against which the United States was entitled to gratuity offsets in the amount of $ 705,337.33.4 Accordingly, the second amended petition was ordered dismissed. \n5\n We granted certiorari on a petition challenging the correctness of the decision below on each of the five items disallowed in whole or in part, and as to numerous items which the court included in its list of gratuity offsets. \n314 \nU.S. 597\n, 62 S.Ct. 105, 86 L.Ed. --. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 286, 290]\n\u00a0\n I.\n We are of opinion that petitioner, the Seminole Nation, is entitled to no additional allowance on Items One, Three, and Four of its claim.\nItem One.\n This item is a claim for $61,563.42, based on Article VIII of the Treaty of August 7, 1856, 11 Stat. 699, 702, whereby the Government promised the Seminole Nation: 'to provide annually for ten years the sum of three thousand dollars for the support of schools; two thousand dollars for agricultural assistance; and two thousand two hundred dollars for the support of smiths and smith shops ....'\n The Court of Claims found that Congress annually made the necessary appropriation of $7,200 to discharge this obligation during the fiscal years from 1858 to 1867, inclusive; that only $10,436.58 was actually expended for the purposes specified in the Treaty; and that the balance ($ 61,563.42) was diverted and disbursed by the Government prior to June 30, 1866, for the purpose of clothing and feeding refugee and destitute Indians driven from their homes during the Civil War because of their loyalty to the Union.\n Petitioner's claim to the diverted balance was properly disallowed because petitioner released its claim by Article VIII of the Treaty of March 21, 1866, 14 Stat. 755, 759, which provides:\n'The stipulations of this treaty are to be a full settlement of all claims of said Seminole nation for damages and losses of every kind growing out of the late rebellion, and all expenditures by the United States of annuities in clothing and feeding refugee and destitute Indians since \n\n[316 \nU.S. 286, 291]\n\u00a0\n the diversion of annuities for that purpose, consequent upon the late war with the socalled confederate states. And the Seminoles hereby ratify and confirm all such diversions of annuities heretofore made from the funds of the Seminole nation by the United States. And the United States agree that no annuities shall be diverted from the objects for which they were originally devoted by treaty stipulations with the Seminoles, to the use of refugee and destitute Indians, other than the Seminoles or members of the Seminole nation, after the close of the present fiscal year, June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and sixty-six.'\n\n It is unnecessary to consider petitioner's contention that by this Article it did not ratify the diversions in question because they were made from the funds of the United States and not from funds of the Seminole Nation. The first sentence of Article VIII of Treaty of 1866, quoted above, constitutes a release to the United States of all expenditures of annuities diverted for the purpose of clothing and feeding refugee Indians. There is no requirement that the annuities there referred to must be derived 'from the funds of the Seminole nation', and there is no indication that the releases contained in the first sentence of Article VIII are dependent upon the ratification contained in the second sentence. The payments due the Seminole Nation under Article VIII of the Treaty of 1856 clearly come within the scope of the release-being annual payments, they were annuities, and they were diverted for the purpose of clothing and feeding refugee Indians.\nItem Three.\n This claim for $61,347.20 grows out of Article III of the Treaty of 1866 in which the Government agreed to estab- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 286, 292]\n\u00a0\n lish a $50,000 trust fund for the Seminole Nation and to pay thereon annual interest of 5% ($2,500) for the support of schools.\n During the period from 1867 to 1874 the Government only partially discharged this annual obligation, disbursing only $16,902.80 of the $20, 000 appropriated for that purpose. It is here undisputed that, as the Court of Claims held, petitioner is entitled to the deficiency of $3,097. 20.\n The Court of Claims correctly disallowed the balance of this Item. During the twenty-three years from 1875 to 1898 the annual payments, amounting in all to $57,500, were paid directly to the tribal treasurer. Since that official disbursed annually not less than $2,500 in excess of amounts he was otherwise obligated to expend for the maintenance of schools,6 there is no need to inquire whether payment to that official was authorized. The schools actually received the benefit of the money. That satisfied the obligation of the Treaty and defeats recovery.\n The remainder of this Item, $750, was paid to the United States Indian Agent for the Seminoles in 1907. Such payment was proper under Section 11 of the Act of April 26, 1906, c. 1876, 34 Stat. 137, 141,7 and nothing in the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 286, 293]\n\u00a0\n applicable jurisdictional act8 indicates any intention on the part of Congress to override or repeal the Act of 1906.\n The Government agreed in Article VI of the Treaty of 1866 to construct, 'at an expense not exceeding ten thousand ($10,000) dollars, suitable agency buildings' on the Seminole reservation. In 1870 and 1872 $ 931.76 was expended for agency buildings and repairs. Petitioner's claims for the difference of $9,068.24 between this sum and $10,000 is without merit. In 1872 Congress appropriated $10,000 to fulfill this treaty obligation;9 $9,030.15 of this appropriation was expended for some undisclosed purpose, as only $969.85 was returned to surplus. The Court of Claims found that an agency building was erected on the Seminole reservation in 1873.10 Petitioner makes no claim that the building erected was unsuitable. Since the Government's promise was not to expend $10,000, but to erect suitable buildings at a cost not in excess of $10,000, it follows that there was no violation of the treaty provision, and hence no right of recovery.\n\n\n II.\n\n\n With respect to Items Two and Five we are of opinion that the cause must be remanded to the Court of Claims for further material findings of fact.\nItem Two.\n This is a claim for $154,551.28 based on one of the provisions of Article VIII of the Treaty of 1856, namely, the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 286, 294]\n\u00a0\n Government's promise to establish a $500,000 trust fund (originally two funds of $250,000 each), the annual interest therefrom ($25,000) to be paid over to the members of the Seminole Nation per capita as an annuity. The findings of the Court of Claims show that although Congress appropriated $25,000 annually for each of the fiscal years in controversy ( 1867-1898, 1907-1909), the Government did in fact fail to make direct per capita disbursements of a portion of the funds appropriated in 1867-1874, 1876, and 1879, the underpayments for those years totalling $92,051.28, and that one-half the appropriation in 1907 and the entire appropriation in 1908 and 1909 ($62,500 in all), instead of being paid directly to the individual Seminoles, was paid to the United States Indian Agent for the Seminole Nation.\n The Court of Claims reduced petitioner's claim for $154,551.28, based on these underpayments and alleged mispayments to $13,501.10, allowing the Government three setoffs, consisting of (a) overpayments of $12,127.54 made in 1875, 1877, 1880, 1882, and 1883; (b) payment of $62,500 made to the United States Indian Agent for the Seminoles in 1907, 1908, and 1909; and (c) payments of $66,422.64 made pursuant to requests of the Seminole General Council during the period from 1870 to 1874.\n The overpayments were rightly deducted, cf. Wisconsin Central R. Co. v. United States, \n164 \nU.S. 190\n, 17 S.Ct. 45, and petitioner does not contend otherwise. Nor is petitioner entitled to any part of the $ 62,500 paid directly to the Indian Agent, for such payments were proper under the Act of 1906, 34 Stat. 137, 141, which, as pointed out in the discussion of Item Three, ante, was not repealed by the jurisdictional act, 43 Stat. 133. There is thus left for consideration only the payments from 1870 to 1874 made pursuant to requests of the Seminole General Council and totalling $66,422.64; of this amount $37,500 was \n\n[316 \nU.S. 286, 295]\n\u00a0\n paid directly to the tribal treasurer, and the remaining $28,922.64 to designated creditors.\n The Government contends that since those payments were made at the request of the tribal council, the governing body of a semiautonomous political entity, possessing the power to enter into treaties and agreements with the United States, the tribe is not now entitled to receive payment a second time, and that, despite the fact that the Treaty of 1856 provided that the payments were to be made per capita for the benefit of each individual Indian, these payments at the request of the General Council discharged the treaty obligation because the agreement was one between the United States and the Seminole Nation and not one between the United States and the individual members of the tribe.\n The argument for the Government, however sound it might otherwise be, fails to recognize the impact of certain equitable considerations and the effect of the fiduciary duty of the Government to its Indian wards. The jurisdictional act, 43 Stat. 133, expressly confers jurisdiction on the Court of Claims to adjudicate 'all legal and equitable claims', arising under treaty or statute, which the Seminole National may have against the United States, and the second amended petition avers:\n'That since the passage of the Act of April 15, 1874, it was reported by the officers of the defendant (the United States) that the Seminole tribal officials were misappropriating the Seminole tribal funds entrusted to them, and robbing the members of the tribe of an equal share of the tribal income. That the reports of the Dawes Commission show conclusively that the governments of the Five Civilized Tribes were notoriously and incurably corrupt, that every branch of the service was infested with favoritism, graft and crookedness, and that by such methods the tribal officers acquired large fortunes, while the other \n\n[316 \nU.S. 286, 296]\n\u00a0\n members entitled to share in the tribal income received little benefit therefrom.'\n\n It is a well established principle of equity that a third party who pays money to a fiduciary for the benefit of the beneficiary, with knowledge that the fiduciary intends to misappropriate the money or otherwise be false to his trust, is a participant in the breach of trust and liable therefor to the beneficiary. Cf. Duncan v. Jaudon, 15 Wall. 165; Manhattan Bank v. Walker, \n130 \nU.S. 267\n, 9 S.Ct. 519. See Bogert, Trusts and Trustees (1935), vol. 4,  901, 955; Scott, Trusts (1939), vol. 3,  321.1; American Law Institute, Restatement of the Law of Trusts (1935),  321. The Seminole General Council, requesting the annuities originally intended for the benefit of the individual members of the tribe, stood in a fiduciary capacity to them. Consequently, the payments at the request of the Council did not discharge the treaty obligation if the Government, for this purpose the officials administering Indian affairs and disbursing Indian moneys, actually knew that the Counsel was defrauding the members of the Seminole Nation.\n Furthermore, this Court has recognized the distinctive obligation of trust incumbent upon the Government in its dealings with these dependent and sometimes exploited people. E.g., Cherokee Nation v. State of Georgia, 5 Pet. 1; United States v. Kagama, \n118 \nU.S. 375\n, 6 S.Ct. 1109; Choctaw Nation v. United States, \n119 \nU.S. 1\n, 7 S.Ct. 75; United States v. Pelican, \n232 \nU.S. 442\n, 34 S.Ct. 396; United States v. Creek Nation, \n295 \nU.S. 103\n, 55 S.Ct. 681; Tulee v. State of Washington, \n316 \nU.S. 681\n, 62 S.Ct. 862, 86 L.Ed . --. In carrying out its treaty obligations with the Indian tribes the Government is something more than a mere contracting party. Under a humane and self imposed policy which has found expression in many acts of Congress11 and \n\n[316 \nU.S. 286, 297]\n\u00a0\n numerous decisions of this Court, it has charged itself with moral obligations of the highest responsibility and trust. Its conduct, as disclosed in the acts of those who represent it in dealings with the Indians, should therefore be judged by the most exacting fiduciary standards. Payment of funds at the request of a tribal council which, to the knowledge of the Government officers charged with the administration of Indian affairs and the disbursement of funds to satisfy treaty obligations, was composed of representatives faithless to their own people and without integrity would be a clear breach of the Government's fiduciary obligation. \n12\n If those were the circumstances, either historically notorious so as to be judicially noticed or otherwise open to proof, when the $66,422.64 was paid over at the request of the Seminole General Council during the period from 1870 to 1874, the Seminole Nation is entitled to recover that sum, minus such amounts as were actually expended for the benefit of the Nation by the Council.\n Having formulated the proper rule of law, we must examine the facts of this case. Although the Court of \n\n[316 \nU.S. 286, 298]\n\u00a0\n Claims had jurisdiction of this issue, for such an action for breach of fiduciary duty growing out of treaty obligations is clearly an equitable claim within the meaning of the jurisdictional act, 43 Stat. 133, the court did not consider, and hence made no findings on this issue. We think the issue material. During the period in question, 1870-1874, the administration of Indian affairs and the disbursement of Indian moneys were lodged with the Department of the Interior. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs, under the general supervision of the Secretary of the Interior, actively supervised these matters. \n13\n There are ample indications in the record before us that the Seminole General Council was mulcting the Nation and that the proper Government officials may well have had knowledge thereof at the time some, at least, of the payments were made. For about this time the Commissioner of Indian Affairs received several warnings from his subordinates that 'injustice to the majority' of the Seminoles existed,14 that the chiefs were in the habit 'of taking out what amount they \n\n[316 \nU.S. 286, 299]\n\u00a0\n chose' from the annuities,15 that the Seminoles were 'in bad hands',16 and that the chiefs intended 'to 'gobble' the next money for the purpose of keeping up their government'.17 And the Acting Commissioner of Indian affairs was evidently aware in 1872 of the possibility that the Council was faithless for he declined to change the method of payment at the request of the Seminole Chiefs 'until the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 286, 300]\n\u00a0\n Department shall be fully satisfied that a proper disposition will be made of the funds if paid in the manner proposed by the Chiefs'.18\n We do not say that all this establishes liability on the part of the Government for it is not our function, in reviewing judgments of the Court of Claims, to make basic findings of fact. When the Court of Claims fails to make findings on a material issue, it is proper to remand the case for such findings. Cf. Universal Battery Co. v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 580, 584\n, 585 S., 50 S.Ct. 422, 423. We do think, however, that the matter outlined above was sufficient to require the Court of Claims to make findings on this material issue, that is, findings as to whether the Seminole General Council, during the years 1870 to 1874, was corrupt, venal, and false to its trust; whether the appropriate Government officials charged with the duty of administering Indian affairs and disbursing funds to the Seminoles knew of that corruption, venality, and faithlessness, if such in fact existed, when any of the payments in question were made at the request of the Council; and, if so, whether the Nation received the benefit of any of those payments. Accordingly, this phase of the case must be remanded so that the Court of Claims can consider such relevant evidence and other data as may be brought to its attention, make the necessary findings of fact, and thus determine whether this case fits into the rule which we have enunciated.\n\n\n[316 \nU.S. 286, 301]\n\u00a0\n Item Five.\n This is a claim for the moneys, $864,702.58 in all, paid to the Seminole tribal treasurer after the passage of the Curtis Act of June 28, 1898, c. 517, 30 Stat. 495, 502. The payments were made during the fiscal years 1899 to 1907 and consisted of the following items: (a) $212,500 paid to discharge the per capita obligation under Article VIII of the Treaty of 1856 (see Item Two ante); (b) $29,750 paid to discharge the obligation of Article III of the Treaty of 1866 providing for the support of schools ( see Item Three, ante) and for the support of the Seminole Government; (c) $ 622,156.87 paid pursuant to Section 12 of the Act of March 2, 1889, c. 412, 25 Stat. 980, 1004, providing for the payment of interest at five per centum per annum on $1,500,000 'to be paid semiannually to the treasurer of said nation'; and, (d) $295.71, the 'proceeds of labor'.\n Section 19 of the Curtis Act, 30 Stat. 495, 502, 25 U.S.C.A.  117 note, provides:\n'That no payment of any moneys on any account whatever shall hereafter be made by the United States to any of the tribal governments or to any officer thereof for disbursement, but payments of all sums to members of said tribes shall be made under direction of the Secretary of the Interior by an officer appointed by him; and per capita payments shall be made direct to each individual in lawful money of the United States, and the same shall not be liable to the payment of any previously contracted obligation.'\n\n Petitioner insists that this section prohibited the Government from making the payments in question to the Seminole treasurer, and that it is entitled to recover the sums illegally so paid.\n Assuming, without deciding, that Section 19 is applicable to the Seminole Nation and that an action could be brought by the Nation for payments made in violation thereof, there can be no recovery here because none of \n\n[316 \nU.S. 286, 302]\n\u00a0\n the payments contravened Section 19. The text of that section and its legislative history demonstrate that it prohibits only payments to tribal officers which are 'for disbursement'-i.e., payments to be distributed by them to members of the tribe. If the first clause of Section 19 is construed as prohibiting all payments to the tribe or its officers, then the later clauses, providing only for payments to members and per capita payments, are inadequate to dispose of the problems raised by the first clause. For then no provision is made for the expenses of maintaining and conducting the tribal government, despite the fact that the Seminole tribal government was not only to continue after the Curtis Act but was in fact relieved of the necessity of securing Presidential approval of its legislation19 by an agreement ratified three days after the passage of that statute. See 30 Stat. 567, 569. Section 19, as originally introduced in the House, provided that payments of 'all expenses incurred in transacting their business' were to be made under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior. \n20\n The deletion of this clause is persuasive that Congress intended that tribal officers should retain the right to disburse their funds for the expenses of their respective tribal governments. For these reasons we think Section 19 prohibits payment by the Government to the tribal \n\n[316 \nU.S. 286, 303]\n\u00a0\n treasurer only when such payments are to be distributed by him to members of the tribe. It has no application to money earmarked for educational or tribal purposes, and money intended for any purpose the tribe may designate.\n None of the payments in question were for disbursement to the individual members of the Seminole Nation. While the sum of $212,500 was paid pursuant to Article VIII of the Treaty of 1856, and while that obligation was originally an annuity payable per capita to the individual Seminoles, the character and purpose of this interest payment were by agreement changed into a payment for the benefit of the Seminole Nation itself, and this before the payment of the $212,500 from 1899 to 1907. The Act of April 15, 1874, c. 97, 18 Stat. 29, authorized the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, with the sanction of the Secretary of the Interior and the President, to pay this annuity into the treasury of the Seminole Nation, provided $5,000 was annually appropriated out of the annuity by the General Council for the school fund, and provided 'that the consent of said tribe to such expenditures and payment shall be first obtained'. By act of the Seminole General Council on April 2, 1879, the Seminole Nation accepted the provisions of the Act of 1874, and consented that all annuities due or to become due under Article VIII of the Treaty of 1856 should be paid into the Seminole treasury, to be used as the tribal council should provide. This was a consensual conversion of the Government's obligation from payments to individuals to paymets to the tribe, and Section 19 of the Curtis Act is inapplicable to the $212,500 paid pursuant to this converted agreement.\n While none of the payments were in violation of Section 19 of the Curtis Act and there can therefore be no recovery on that score, the Government is not necessarily relieved of all liability for this $864,702. 58 claim. There remains \n\n[316 \nU.S. 286, 304]\n\u00a0\n for consideration the fiduciary duty of the Government, as discussed in Item Two, ante. During this period, 1899 to 1907, as from 1870 to 1874, the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs supervised Indian matters and the disbursement of Indian moneys. Apparently, it was the practice of the Department of the Interior to deposit the Seminole funds with the Assistant Treasurer of the United States at St. Louis to the credit of the tribal treasurer; the Indian agent for the Five Civilized Tribes did not disburse the Seminole payments although he did distribute moneys to the other tribes. \n21\n Shortly before the payments in question were made the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes22 pointedly described in its annual reports to the Secretary of the Interior and Congress the unbridled corruption of the various tribal governments, without singling out any particular government for unenviable distinction. Thus:\n'Corruption of the grossest kind, openly and unblushingly practiced, has found its way into every branch of the service of the tribal governments. All branches of the governments are reeking with it, and so common has it become that no attempt at concealment is thought necessary. The governments have fallen into the hands of a few able and energetic Indian citizens, nearly all mixed blood and adopted whites, who have so administered their affairs and have enacted such laws that they are enabled \n\n[316 \nU.S. 286, 305]\n\u00a0\n to appropriate to their own exclusive use almost the entire property of the Territory of any kind that can be rendered profitable and available.' 23\n\n And again:\n'The Commission is compelled by the evidence forced upon them during their examination into the administration of the so-called governments in this Territory to report that these governments in all their branches are wholly corrupt, irresponsible, and unworthy to be longer trusted with the care and control of the money and other property of Indian citizens, much less their lives, which they scarcely pretend to protect.'24\n\n While these warnings were of a general nature, specific complaints of misgovernment, venality, and fraudulent conduct on the part of the Seminole leaders were brought to the attention of the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. By a letter to the Secretary of the Interior, dated January 24, 1898, certain Seminoles remonstrated against the ratification of the agreement concluded with the Seminole leaders on December 16, 1897. The remonstrance alleged misgovernment and the participation by these leaders in a land swindle at the expense of the tribe. The Secretary laid this protest before Congress. 25 During much of the period \n\n[316 \nU.S. 286, 306]\n\u00a0\n in question, 1899-1907, and for some time prior thereto, two half-breed brothers were principal chief and treasurer, respectively, of the Seminole Nation. Together they ran a trading store in the Seminole country and extended credit by giving due bills, good only in trade at their store, to individual Seminoles in the amount of annuities or other payments owing those individuals. The activities of these brothers, and their system of credit in particular, were attacked on the floor of Congress in 1896 and 1897,26 and severely criticized by an investigator for the Department of Justice in 1905, part of whose report was set forth in a letter from the Acting Commission of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior, dated November 11, 1905.27 \n\n[316 \nU.S. 286, 307]\n\u00a0\n All this tends to show that the Seminole tribal officers might have been faithless to their trust during the period in question, and that the Government officials administering Indian affairs and disbursing Seminole funds might have been aware of that faithlessness at the time payments were made to the Seminole treasurer. Here again the Court of Claims did not address itself to, and made no findings on this material issue. As we said in the discussion of Item Two, ante, it is not our function to make basic findings of fact. Again we do not say that the showing with respect to this Item establishes breach of the Government's fiduciary obligation, but we are of opinion that it is sufficient to justify remanding this branch of the case to the Court of Claims for further findings, in the light of such evidence as may be brought to its atten- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 286, 308]\n\u00a0\n tion, as to whether the Seminole tribal officers were mulcting the Nation from 1899 to 1907; whether, if such were the case, the appropriate Government officials administering Indian affairs and disbursing moneys to the Seminoles had knowledge thereof at the time any of the payments to the tribal treasurer were made; and, if so, whether the Seminole Nation received the benefit of any sums expended by the tribal treasurer. On the basis of these findings the Court of Claims can then determine whether there was a breach of the Government's fiduciary obligation, as defined in the discussion of Item Two, ante, and if there was a breach, the resultant liability.\n\n\n III.\n\n\n Petitioner asserts that the Court of Claims committed numerous errors with respect to the items which it included in the list of gratuitous offsets, and the Government admits that the court erred in a few instances. However, since the case must be remanded to determine whether the Government has any further obligation on Items Two and Five, we deem it unnecessary to consider in detail the challenged offsets.\n One phase of this question does require attention. In Seminole Nation v. United States, \n316 \nU.S. 310\n, 62 S.Ct. 1061, 86 L.Ed. -- No. 830 this Term, decided today, petitioner asserted that the Court of Claims gave the Government credit there for an offset which it had employed in the instant case, thus allowing a double credit. To avoid this confusion the Court of Claims should find and designate the precise gratuitous expenditures to be offset against the Government's liability, instead of finding generally all the items which the Government may ever be entitled to use. Gratuity offsets resemble a fund in a bank, to be drawn upon by the Government in successive Indian claims cases until exhausted. Since they may be needed in future cases, it becomes important to know pre- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 286, 309]\n\u00a0\n cisely what items have been employed to extinguish liability in a particular case, as the instant case and No. 830 demonstrate. The disadvantage of the alternative, to treat as binding in subsequent suits involving the same parties the findings of the Court of Claims that the Government has total offsets in a certain amount, is evident because it may require this Court to do a vain thing, that is, to examine offsets which might never be needed and which, even if disapproved, would not change the result reached by the Court of Claims.\n The judgment below is reversed, with the exception of the disposition of Items One, Three and Four which is in all respects affirmed, and the entire cause is remanded to the Court of Claims with directions to make further findings with respect to Items Two and Five; to determine the additional liability of the Government, if any, thereon; and, to find and designate the particular gratuitous expenditures to be offset against the Government's total liability.\n Upon the remand the Court of Claims will be free to consider any legal or equitable defenses which the Government may interpose to the claims asserted there by petitioner.\n So ordered.\n Affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. CJ Mr. Justice JACKSON dissents. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 82 Ct.Cl. 135. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Act of August 16, 1937, c. 651, 50 Stat. 650, conferred jurisdiction on the Court of Claims to reinstate and retry on the merits claims of the Five Civilized Tribes previously dismissed because set up by amended petition after the expiration of the time limit fixed in the respective jurisdictional acts. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Seven items, amounting to $1,307,478.02, were considered by this Court in \n299 \nU.S. 417\n, 57 S.Ct. 283.

Heretofore, as I have reported, the chiefs have been in the habit of taking out what amount they chose, allowing the balance to be paid per capita. This is an injustice, as few receive the bulk of their annuities.' Report of the Secretary of the Interior, 41st Cong., 3d Sess. (1870-71), vol. 1, pp. 766-767. \n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] The report of John P. C. Shanks, Special Commissioner, to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, dated August 9, 1875, states:\n'These claims are enormous in amount, and show too clearly that the Seminoles are in bad hands. These parties who had these claims (except Harjo, who is an assignee) are or have been officials in the Nation. Robert Johnson is a negro, and is interpreter to the Chief; Chupco is present chief; John Jumper was former chief; James Factor, a half breed, is treasurer; E. J. Brown is a white man, formerly U.S. Indian Agent of the Seminole Nation, since has had the address to procure his admission as a member of the tribe.\n\n'These men have evidently stood together in the wrong, of procuring such allowances, and did stand together in refusing to relinquish the claims, or a part of them, except a deduction for present payment upon claims which did not bear interest.' \n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] On November 20, 1878, special agent Meacham wrote the Commissioner of Indian Affairs that 'Some of the Band Chiefs are tyrants and despots, holding their people under abject fear and in some instances of actual servitude.' The letter also referred to the intention of the Chiefs 'to 'gobble' the next money for the purpose of keeping up their government.' \n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] On January 5, 1872, the Acting Commissioner of Indian Affairs wrote the United States Indian Agent for the Seminoles:\n'In reply to your letter of the 20 Dec. last, and to the request of the Seminole Chiefs that their National funds be hereafter paid to the Treasurer of the Nation instead of per capita, I have to say that it is not deemed advisable to change the manner in which payment of annuities to these Indians has heretofore been made until the Department shall be fully satisfied that a proper disposition will be made of the funds if paid in the manner proposed by the Chiefs.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] Act of June 7, 1897, c. 3, 30 Stat. 62, 84. \n[\nFootnote 20\n] Section 19, as originally introduced, was as follows: '... that no payments of any moneys, on any account whatever, be made to any of the tribal governments or to any officer thereof for disbursement, but payments of all expenses incurred in transacting their business and of all sums to members of said tribes shall be made under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior by an officer appointed by him; and per capita payments shall be made direct to each individual in lawful money of the United States, and the same shall not be liable to the payment of any previously contracted obligation.'

It should be condemned because it keeps these Indians in a constant state of poverty. They do not realize that these due bills are in fact money, and the result is that they are squandered without care. I am not informed as to whether the Department of the Interior has knowledge of this state of affairs. It should be brought to its attention, so that, if possible, it may take steps looking to the breaking up of the system, which can be done by having the appropriations distributed in some other manner.'\n\n Wm. L. Bowie, Special Investigator for the Interior Department, reported to the Superintendent for the Five Civilized Tribes in 1916 that:\n'Governor Brown and his brother have been in the mercantile business in the Seminole Nation for many years. It is a fact much commented upon by those acquainted with Seminole tribal affairs, that for a number of years Governor Brown held the dual relationship to the members of the Seminole tribe of governor and paymaster on the one hand, and Indian trader on the other hand.'\n\n'... In my opinion Governor Brown has shown in his transactions with John Smith and Lizzie Yahola, that he has little regard for the welfare and protection of Indians in general, and it is unfortunate that he occupies a position which enables him by reason of the confidence placed in him as such official to impose upon them.'\n\n On the basis of reports from subordinates Assistant Commissioner of Indian Affairs Merrit recommended to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, by a letter dated July 20, 1916, that the Seminole tribal government be abolished as 'the only way to prevent Brown and Crain from continuing to use their official positions to advance their personal interests at the expense of the Indians under their authority'. \n\n\n\n\n","109":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSHARPE v.

Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice Byrnes delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action to recover compensation for some 5 1\/2 million acres of land allegedly taken from the petitioner tribe in 1879 and 1884. The suit was initiated under the Act of June 3, 1920, 41 Stat. 738, permitting petitioner to submit to the Court of Claims any claims arising from the asserted failure of the United States to pay money or property due, without regard to lapse of time or statutes of limitation. The Court of Claims denied recovery and we brought the case here on certiorari. \n315 \nU.S. 790\n, 62 S.Ct. 631, 86 L.Ed. --.\n The facts as found by the Court of Claims are as follows:\n In 1868 the United States and the Sioux Tribe entered into the Fort Laramie Treaty, 15 Stat. 635. By Article II of this treaty a certain described territory, known as the Great Sioux Reservation and located in what is now South \n\n[316 \nU.S. 317, 319]\n\u00a0\n Dakota and Nebraska, was 'set apart for the absolute and undisturbed use and occupation' of the Tribe. The United States promised that no persons, other than government officers and agents discharging their official duties, would be permitted 'to pass over, settle upon, or reside in the territory described in this article, or in such territory as may be added to this reservation for the use of said Indians.' For their part, the Indians relinquished 'all claims or right in and to any portion of the United States or Territories, except such as is embraced within the limits aforesaid.' No question arises in this case with respect to the lands specifically included within the Reservation by this treaty.\n The eastern boundary of the Great Sioux Reservation, as constituted by the Ft. Laramie Treaty, was the low water mark on the east bank of the Missouri River. 1 The large tract bordering upon and extending eastward from the east bank of the river remained a part of the public domain open to settlement and afforded easy access to the Reservation. As a result great numbers of white men 'infested' the region for the purpose of engaging in the liquor traffic. Anxiety over this development led the Commissioner of Indian Affairs on January 8, 1875 to suggest to the Secretary of the Interior that he request the President to issue an executive order withdrawing from sale and setting apart for Indian purposes a certain large tract of the land along the eastern bank of the Missouri River. In the Commissioner's letter to the Secretary of the Interior, and in the latter's letter of January 9th to the President, the reason advanced for the proposed executive order was that it was 'deemed necessary for the suppression of the liquor traffic with the Indians upon the Missouri River.' On \n\n[316 \nU.S. 317, 320]\n\u00a0\n January 11, 1875, the President signed the suggested order. It described the territory affected and provided that it 'be, and the same hereby is, withdrawn from sale and set apart for the use of the several tribes of Sioux Indians as an addition to their present reservation.' On two occasions thereafter, once in February and again in May, white persons who had settled on the land in question prior to the issuance of the executive order and who feared that its effect was to deprive them of their holdings, were informed by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs that the object of the executive order was 'to enable the suppression of the liquor traffic with the Indians on the Missouri River,' that it did not affect the existing rights of any persons in the area, that it was not 'supposed that the withdrawal will be made permanent,' and that no interference with the peaceful occupancy of the territory had been intended.\n On March 13, 1875, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs addressed another letter to the Secretary of the Interior. In it he recommended that the Secretary request the President to withdraw from sale and set apart for Indian purposes another tract of land bordering the Great Sioux Reservation, this time to the north and northeast. The reason given was similar to that for which the first order had been sought: 'viz.: the suppression of the liquor traffic with Indians at the Standing Rock Agency'. As a 'further reason for said request' the Commissioner stated that 'the Agency buildings, as no located at Standing Rock, are outside the reservation as defined by (the Fort Laramie) treaty ... but are included in the tract proposed to be withdrawn.' The Secretary forwarded the Commissioner's report to the President with his concurrence, repeating that the 'enlargement of the Sioux reservation in Dakota' was 'deemed necessary for the suppression of the liquor traffic with the Indians at the Standing Rock Agency.' On March 16, 1875 the President issued a second executive order describing the tract \n\n[316 \nU.S. 317, 321]\n\u00a0\n of land involved and declaring that it 'be, and the same hereby is, withdrawn from sale and set apart for the use of the several tribes of the Sioux Indians as an addition to their present reservation in said Territory.'\n In mid-May of 1875 the Secretary of War transmitted to the Secretary of the Interior a letter from the officer in command of the Southern District of the Military Department of Dakota in which it was pointed out that a small tract of land along the eastern bank of the Missouri River opposite the southern corner of the Sioux Reservation was still open to settlement and afforded 'a very nice point for whiskey sellers and horse thieves'. Upon the basis of this letter, the Commissioner recommended to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary recommended to the President the issuance of still a third executive order withdrawing the described tract from settlement. On May 20, 1875 the executive order was issued in the same form as its two predecessors.\n Finally upon a similar complaint from the Acting Agent of the Standing Rock Agency that a small piece of land to the north of the reservation was being used as a base of operations by persons selling liquor and ammunition to the Sioux Indians, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and the Secretary of the Interior recommended a further order to 'effectually cut off these whiskey dealers'. In his letter to the Secretary dated November 24, 1876, the Commissioner stated: 'It is not proposed to interfere with the vested rights, or the legitimate business of any settler who may be upon this tract.' The President issued a fourth executive order in the usual form on November 28, 1876. On December 13, 1876 the Commissioner notified the agent at Standing Rock that the order had been issued, and added that it was 'not intended to interfere with the vested rights of any settler upon the tract or with the legitimate business pursuits of any person lawfully residing within its limits.' \n\n[316 \nU.S. 317, 322]\n\u00a0\n About two and a half years after the last of these four executive orders withdrawing lands from sale and setting them apart for the use of the Sioux, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs submitted to the Secretary of the Interior a report upon a suggestion that the orders be modified so as to permit the return of the lands to the public domain. The report, dated June 6, 1879, reviewed the problems arising from the liquor trade during the years following the Fort Laramie treaty, recalled that the purpose of the four executive orders of 1875 and 1876 had been to eliminate this traffic, observed that they had 'to a great extent accomplished the object desired, viz: the prevention of the sale of whiskey to the Indians', and concluded that any change in the boundaries established by the executive orders would 'give renewed life to this unlawful traffic, and be detrimental to the best interests of the Indians'.\n Three weeks later, however, upon reconsideration, the Commissioner informed the Secretary that in his opinion the lands included in the executive orders of 1875 and 1876 might be 'restored to the public domain, and the interests of the Indians still be protected.' In explanation he stated:\n'These lands were set apart for the purpose, as alleged, of preventing illegal liquor traffic with the Indians. At the time, said lands were set apart there was no law providing a punishment for the sale of liquor to Indians, 'except to Indians in the Indian country', but, by the Act of February 27, 1877, (19 Stat. 244) persons who now engage in liquor traffic with Indians, no matter in what locality, are liable to a penalty of $300, and two years imprisonment, and, therefore, the necessity for so large a reservation for the protection of these Indians, in this repsect (sic) does not now exist.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[316 \nU.S. 317, 323]\n\u00a0\n Accordingly, he recommended that the lands withdrawn from sale by the President in 1875 and 1876 be returned to the public domain with the exception of three small tracts directly opposite the Cheyenne, Grand River, and Standing Rock agencies. On August 9, 1879 an executive order to this effect was promulgated and the land with the exceptions indicated was 'restored to the public domain'. Five years later the Commissioner informed the Secretary that the Grand River Agency had ceased to exist and that the agents at Cheyenne and Standing Rock considered it no longer necessary to withhold the tracts opposite their agencies from the public domain 'for the purpose for which they have thus far been retained.' Consequently, an executive order was prepared and signed by the President on March 20, 1884, restoring these three small pieces of land to the public domain, 'the same being no longer needed for the purpose for which they were withdrawn from sale and settlement.'\n\n One additional event remains to be noted. In the Indian Appropriation Act for 1877, approved August 15, 1876, 19 Stat. 176, 192, Congress provided: '... hereafter there shall be no appropriation made for the subsistence of said Indians (i.e., the Sioux), unless they shall first agree to relinquish all right and claim to any country outside the boundaries of the permanent reservation established by the treaty of eighteen hundred and sixty-eight (the Fort Laramie treaty) for said Indians; and also so much of their said permanent reservation as lies west of the one hundred and third meridian of longitude (the western boundary set by the Fort Laramie treaty had been the 104th meridian), and shall also grant right of way over said reservation to the country thus ceded for wagon or other roads, from convenient and accessible points on the Missouri River ....' On September 26, 1876-a date subsequent to the first three of the four executive orders setting apart additional \n\n[316 \nU.S. 317, 324]\n\u00a0\n lands for the use of the Sioux, but about two months prior to the last of those orders-the Sioux Tribe signed an agreement conforming to the conditions imposed by Congress in the Indian Appropriation Act and promised to 'relinquish and cede to the United States all the territory lying outside the said reservation, as herein modified and described ....' 3\n Petitioner's position is that the executive orders of 1875 and 1876 were effective to convey to the Tribe the same kind of interest in the lands affected as it had acquired in the lands covered by the Fort Laramie Treaty, that the executive orders of 1879 and 1884 restoring the lands to the public domain deprived petitioner of this interest, and that it is entitled to be compensated for the fair value of the lands as of 1879 and 1884. The government defends on several grounds: First, that in general the President lacked authority to confer upon any individual or group a compensable interest in any part of the public domain; second, that even if he had the power to convey such a compensable interest, the President did not purport to do so in this case; and third, that in any event by the treaty of 1876 the Sioux relinquished whatever rights they may have had in the lands covered by the first three of the four executive orders.\n Section 3 of Article IV of the Constitution confers upon Congress exclusively the 'Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.' Nevertheless, 'from an early period in the history of the government it has been the practice of the President to order, from time to time, as the exigencies of the public service required, parcels of land belonging to the United States to be reserved from sale and set apart for public uses.' Grisar v. McDowell, 6 Wall. 363, 381. As long ago as 1830 Con- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 317, 325]\n\u00a0\n gress revealed its awareness of this practice and acquiesced in it. \n4\n By 1855 the President had begun to withdraw public lands from sale by executive order for the specific purpose of establishing Indian reservations. \n5\n From that date until 1919,6 hundreds of reservations for Indian occupancy and for other purposes were created by executive order. Department of the Interior, Executive Orders Relating to Indian Reservations, passim; United States v. Midwest Oil Co., \n236 \nU.S. 459, 469\n, 470 S., 35 S.Ct. 309, 311, 312. Although the validity of these orders was occasionally questioned,7 doubts were quieted in United States v. Midwest Oil Co., supra. In that case it was squarely held that even in the absence of express statutory authorization, it lay within the power of the President to withdraw lands from the public domain. Cf. Mason v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 545\n, 43 S.Ct. 200.\n The government therefore does not deny that the executive orders of 1875 and 1876 involved here were effective to withdraw the lands in question from the public domain. It contends, however, that this is not the issue presented by this case. It urges that instead we are called upon to determine whether the President \n\n[316 \nU.S. 317, 326]\n\u00a0\n had the power to bestow upon the Sioux Tribe an interest in these lands of such a character as to require compensation when the interest was extinguished by the executive orders of 1879 and 1884. Concededly, where lands have been reserved for the use and occupation of an Indian Tribe by the terms of a treaty or statute, the tribe must be compensated if the lands are subsequently United States, \n299 \nU.S. 476\n, 57 S.Ct. 244, 81 United States, \n299 \nU.S. 476\n; United States v. Shoshone Tribe, \n304 \nU.S. 111\n, 58 S.Ct. 794; United States v. Klamath and Moadoc Tribes, \n304 \nU.S. 119\n, 58 S.Ct. 799. Since the Constitution places the authority to dispose of public lands exclusively in Congress, the executive's power to convey any interest in these lands must be traced to Congressional delegation of its authority. The basis of decision in United States v. Midwest Oil Co. was that, so far as the power to withdraw public lands from sale is concerned, such a delegation could be spelled out from long continued Congressional acquiescence in the executive practice. The answer to whether a similar delegation occurred with respect to the power to convey a compensable interest in these lands to the Indians must be found in the available evidence of what consequences were thought by the executive and Congress to flow from the establishment of executive order reservations. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n[316 \nU.S. 317, 327]\n\u00a0\n It is significant that the executive department consistently indicated its understanding that the rights and interests which the Indians enjoyed in executive order reservations were different from and less than their rights and interests in treaty or statute reservations. The annual reports of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs during the years when reservations were frequently being established by executive order contain statements that the Indians had 'no assurance for their occupation of these lands beyond the pleasure of the Executive,'9 that they 'are mere tenants at will, and possess no permanent rights to the lands upon which they are temporarily permitted to remain,'10 and that those occupying land in executive \n\n[316 \nU.S. 317, 328]\n\u00a0\n order reservations 'do not hold it by the same tenure with which Indians in other parts of the Indian Territory possess their reserves.' \n11\n\u00a0\n\n Although there are abundant signs that Congress was aware of the practice of establishing Indian reservations by executive order, there is little to indicate what it understood to be the kind of interest that the Indians obtained in these lands. However, in its report in 1892 upon a bill to restore to the public domain a portion of the Colville executive order reservation, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs expressed the opinion that under the executive order 'the Indians were given a license to occupy the lands described in it so long as it was the pleasure of the Government that they should do so, and no right, title, or claim to such lands had vested in the Indians by virtue of this occupancy.' \n12\n\u00a0\n\n Petitioner argues that its position finds support in Section 1 of the General Allotment Act of February 8, 1887, 25 U.S.C.A.  331,13 which provides: 'That in all cases where any tribe or band of Indians has been, or shall hereafter be, located upon any reservation created for their use, either by treaty stipulation or by virtue of an act of Congress or executive order setting apart the same for their use, the President of the United States be, and he hereby is, authorized ... to cause said reservation ... to be surveyed ... and to allot the lands in said reservation in severalty to any Indian Located thereon ....' By Section 5, 25 U.S.C.A.  348, provision was made for issuance of patents to the allottees by which the United States promised to hold the lands in trust for the allottees and their heirs for 25 years \n\n[316 \nU.S. 317, 329]\n\u00a0\n and thereafter to convey to them full title. Petitioner urges that by including executive order reservations within the provisions of this Act, Congress revealed its belief that the degree of ownership enjoyed by Indian tribes is identical whether the reservation is created by treaty, statute, or executive order. But there is much to contradict this interpretation. For example, during the course of the debate on the measure Senator Dawes, a member of the Committee reporting the bill, frequently distinguished between the character of title enjoyed by the Indians on statute and treaty reservations and that enjoyed by those on executive order reservations, and no exception was taken to his remarks. 17 Cong.Rec. 1559, 1630, 1631, 1763. Moreover, in its 1892 report on the bill to abolish a portion of the Colville reservation, to which we have referred, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs explained: 'An erroneous idea seems to have grown up, that the Indian allotment act (of 1887) and its amendments have given additional sanctions to executive reservations, and operated to confer titles upon the Indians occupying them they did not before possess. ... At the time of the enactment of this statute, there were fifty-six executive reservations, embracing perhaps from 75,000,000 to 10,000,000 acres of the public lands, in which the Indians had no right or claim of title and which could be extinguished by act of the President. It would be preposterous to place such a construction upon the language of this act as would divest the United States of its title to these lands.' \n14\n This statement by the Committee which reported the general Allotment Act of 1887, made within five years of its passage, is virtually conclusive as to the significance \n\n[316 \nU.S. 317, 330]\n\u00a0\n of that Act. We think that the inclusion of executive order reservations meant no more than that Congress was willing that the lands within them should be allotted to individual Indians according to the procedure outlined. It did not amount to a recognition of tribal ownership of the lands prior to allotment. Since the lands involved in the case before us were never allotted-indeed, the executive orders of 1879 and 1884 terminated the reservation even before the Allotment Act was passed,-we think the Act has no bearing upon the issue presented. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 317, 331]\n\u00a0\n from the sale of the lands be used for the benefit of the Indians. But both acts contained an explicit proviso: 'That nothing herein contained shall be construed as recognizing title or ownership of said Indians to any part of said ... Reservation, whether that hereby restored to the public domain or that still reserved by the government for their use and occupancy.' Consequently, the granting of compensation must be regarded as an act of grace rather than a recognition of an obligation.\n We conclude therefore that there was no express constitutional or statutory authorization for the conveyance of a compensable interest to petitioner by the four executive orders of 1875 and 1876, and that no implied Congressional delegation of the power to do so can be spelled out from the evidence of Congressional and executive understanding. The orders were effective to withdraw from sale the lands affected and to grant the use of the lands to the petitioner. But the interest which the Indians received was subject to termination at the will of either the executive or Congress and without obligation to the United States. The executive orders of 1879 and 1884 were simply an exercise of this power of termination and the payment of compensation was not required.\nAFFIRMED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Great Sioux Reservation also included two small theretofore existing reservations located on the east bank of the river.

But cf. Indian Reservations, 1882, 17 Op.Atty.Gen. 258. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] This question is an open one. It is true that language appearing in two decisions of this Court suggests that the tribal title to a reservation is the same whether the reservation has been created by statute or treaty or by executive order. Re Wilson, \n140 \nU.S. 575, 577\n, 11 S.Ct. 870, 871; Spalding v. Chandler, \n160 \nU.S. 394, 403\n, 16 S.Ct. 360, 364. Cf. C. N. Cotton, 12 L.D. 205 (1890); William F. Tucker et al., 13 L.D. 628 (1891). In Re Wilson, however, it was conceded by all concerned that an executive order reservation was 'Indian country' within the meaning of that term as it appeared in certain statutes defining the criminal jurisdiction of United States courts and territorial courts. No question was raised by the case with respect to the character of the tribe's interest in the reservation. Moreover, the dictum referred to was based upon the assumption that the Allotment Act of 1887, 24 Stat. 388, amounted to a Congressional recognition of tribal title to executive order reservations. The invalidity of this assumption is demonstrated in a later portion of our opinion. The issue in Spalding v. Chandler concerned the effect of the Pre-emption Act of September 4, 1841, 5 Stat. 453, upon an Indian reservation created by treaty and preserved by executive order and did not involve a determination of whether the Indians enjoyed a compensable interest in an executive order reservation. And twenty-eight years thereafter when the Attorney General ruled, on the authority of United States v. Midwest Oil Co., that executive order reservations were not a part of the public domain for purposes of the General Leasing Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 437, 30 U.S.C.A.  181 et seq., he took occasion to remark: 'Whether the President might legally abolish, in whole or in part, Indian reservations once created by him, has been seriously questioned (12 L.D. 205; 13 L.D. 628) and not without strong reasons; for the Indian rights attach when the lands are thus set aside; and moreover, the lands then at once become subject to allotment under the General Allotment Act. Nevertheless, the President has in fact, and in a number of instances, changed the boundaries of executive order Indian reservations by excluding lands therefrom, and the question of his authority to do so has not apparently come before the courts.' Executive Order Indian Reservations-Leasing Act, 34 Op.Atty.Gen. 171, 176 (emphasis added). \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Annual Report of Commissioner of Indian Affairs (1872), H.R.Exec.

Perhaps the most striking proof of the belief shared by Congress and the executive that the Indians were not entitled to compensation upon the abolition of an executive order reservation is the very absence of compensatory payments in such situations. It was a common practice during the period in which reservations were created by executive order for the President simply to terminate the existence of a reservation by cancelling or revoking the order establishing it. That is to say, the procedure followed in the case before us was typical. No compensation was made, and neither the government nor the Indians suggested that it was due. 15 It is true that on several of the many occasions when Congress itself abolished executive order reservations, it provided for a measure of compensation to the Indians. In the Act of July 1, 1892, restoring to the public domain a large portion of the Colville reservation16 and in the Act of February 20, 1893 restoring a portion of the White Mountain Apache Indian Reservation, 17 Congress directed that the proceeds \n[\nFootnote 15\n] See, e.g., Department of the Interior, Executive Orders Relating to Indian Reservations, Vol. I, pp. 5, 6, 21, 30, 37, 43, 44, 48-50; Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Committee on Indian Affairs on S. 1722 and S.3159, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 104, 105. \n[\nFootnote 16\n] 27 Stat. 62, 63. \n[\nFootnote 17\n] 27 Stat. 469. 470. \n\n\n\n\n","111":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSKINNER v. STATE OF OKL. EX REL. WILLIAMSON(1942)\nNo. 782\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1942\n\n\n\n\n[316 \nU.S. 535, 536]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. J. Hulsey, H. I. Aston, and Guy L. Andrews, all of McAlester, Okl., for petitioner.\n Mr. Mac Q. Williamson, Atty. Gen. of Oklahoma, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case touches a sensitive and important area of human rights. Oklahoma deprives certain individuals of a right which is basic to the perpetuation of a race-the right to have offspring. Oklahoma has decreed the enforcement of its law against petitioner, overruling his claim that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment. Because that decision raised grave and substantial constitutional questions, we granted the petition for certiorari.\n The statute involved is Oklahoma's Habitual Criminal Sterilization Act. Okl.St.Ann. Tit. 57,  171, et seq.; L.1935, p. 94 et seq. That Act defines an 'habitual criminal' as a person who, having been convicted two or more times for crimes 'amounting to felonies involving moral turpitude' either in an Oklahoma court or in a court of any other State, is thereafter convicted of such a felony in Oklahoma and is sentenced to a term of imprisonment in an Oklahoma penal institution.  173. Machinery is provided for the institution by the Attorney General of a proceeding against such a person in the Oklahoma courts for a judgment that such person shall be rendered sexually sterile.  176, 177. Notice, an opportunity to be heard, and the right to a jury trial are provided.  177-181. The issues triable in such a proceeding are narrow and con- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 535, 537]\n\u00a0\n fined. If the court or jury finds that the defendant is an 'habitual criminal' and that he 'may be rendered sexually sterile without detriment to his or her general health', then the court 'shall render judgment to the effect that said defendant be rendered sexually sterile'  182, by the operation of vasectomy in case of a male and of salpingectomy in case of a female.  174. Only one other provision of the Act is material here and that is  195 which provides that 'offenses arising out of the violation of the prohibitory laws, revenue acts, embezzlement, or political offenses, shall not come or be considered within the terms of this Act.'\n Petitioner was convicted in 1926 of the crime of stealing chickens and was sentenced to the Oklahoma State Reformatory. In 1929 he was convicted of the crime of robbery with fire arms and was sentenced to the reformatory. In 1934 he was convicted again of robbery with firearms and was sentenced to the penitentiary. He was confined there in 1935 when the Act was passed. In 1936 the Attorney General instituted proceedings against him. Petitioner in his answer challenged the Act as unconstitutional by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment. A jury trial was had. The court instructed the jury that the crimes of which petitioner had been convicted were felonies involving moral turpitude and that the only question for the jury was whether the operation of vasectomy could be performed on petitioner without detriment to his general health. The jury found that it could be. A judgment directing that the operation of vasectomy be performed on petitioner was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma by a five to four decision. 189 Okl. 235, 115 P.2d 123.\n Several objections to the constitutionality of the Act have been pressed upon us. It is urged that the Act cannot be sustained as an exercise of the police power in view \n\n[316 \nU.S. 535, 538]\n\u00a0\n of the state of scientific authorities respecting inheritability of criminal traits. \n1\n It is argued that due process is lacking because under this Act, unlike the act2 upheld in Buck v. Bell, \n274 \nU.S. 200\n, 47 S.Ct. 584, the defendant is given no opportunity to be heard on the issue as to whether he is the probable potential parent of socially undesirable offspring. See Davis v. Berry, D.C., 216 F. 413; Williams v. Smith, 190 Ind. 526, 131 N.E. 2. It is also suggested that the Act is penal in character and that the sterilization provided for is cruel and unusual punishment and violative of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Davis v. Berry, supra. Cf. State v. Feilen, 70 Wash. 65, 126 P. 75, 41 L.R.A.,N.S., 418, Ann.Cas.1914B, 512; Mickle v. Henrichs, D.C., 262 F. 687. We pass those points without intimating an opinion on them, for there is a feature of the Act which clearly condemns it. That is its failure to meet the requirements of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n We do not stop to point out all of the inequalities in this Act. A few examples will suffice. In Oklahoma grand larceny is a felony. Okl.St. Ann. Tit. 21,  1705 ( 5). Larceny is grand larceny when the property taken exceeds $20 in value. Id.  1704. Embezzlement is punishable 'in the manner prescribed for feloniously stealing property of the value of that embezzled.' Id.  1462. Hence he who embezzles property worth more than $ 20 is guilty of a felony. A clerk who appropriates over $20 from his employer's till (id.  1456) and a stranger who steals the same \n\n[316 \nU.S. 535, 539]\n\u00a0\n amount are thus both guilty of felonies. If the latter repeats his act and is convicted three times, he may be sterilized. But the clerk is not subject to the pains and penalties of the Act no matter how large his embezzlements nor how frequent his convictions. A person who enters a chicken coop and steals chickens commits a felony (id.  1719); and he may be sterilized if he is thrice convicted. If, however, he is a bailee of the property and fraudulently appropriates it, he is an embezzler. Id.  1455. Hence no matter how habitual his proclivities for embezzlement are and no matter how often his conviction, he may not be sterilized. Thus the nature of the two crimes is intrinsically the same and they are punishable in the same manner. Furthermore, the line between them follows close distinctions-distinctions comparable to those highly technical ones which shaped the common law as to 'trespass' or 'taking'. Bishop, Criminal Law, 9th Ed., Vol. 2,  760, 799, et seq. There may be larceny by fraud rather than embezzlement even where the owner of the personal property delivers it to the defendant, if the latter has at that time 'a fraudulent intention to make use of the possession as a means of converting such property to his own use, and does so convert it'. Bivens v. State, 6 Okl. Cr. 521, 529, 120 P. 1033, 1036. If the fraudulent intent occurs later and the defendant converts the property, he is guilty of embezzlement. Bivens v. State, supra; Flohr v. Territory, 14 Okl. 477, 78 P. 565. Whether a particular act is larceny by fraud or embezzlement thus turns not on the intrinsic quality of the act but on when the felonious intent arose-a question for the jury under appropriate instructions. Bivens v. State, supra; Riley v. State, 64 Okl.Cr. 183, 78 P.2d 712.\n It was stated in Buck v. Bell, supra, that the claim that state legislation violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is 'the usual last resort of constitutional arguments.' 274 U.S. page 208, 47 S.Ct. page 585. Under our con- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 535, 540]\n\u00a0\n stitutional system the States in determining the reach and scope of particular legislation need not provide 'abstract symmetry'. Patsone v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 138, 144\n, 34 S.Ct. 281, 282. They may mark and set apart the classes and types of problems according to the needs and as dictated or suggested by experience. See People of State of New York ex rel. Bryant v. Zimmerman, \n278 \nU.S. 63\n, 49 S.Ct. 61, 62 A.L.R. 785, and cases cited. It was in that connection that Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for the Court in Bain Peanut Co. v. Pinson, \n282 \nU.S. 499, 501\n, 51 S.Ct. 228, 229, stated, 'We must remember that the machinery of government would not work if it were not allowed a little play in its joints.' Only recently we reaffirmed the view that the equal protection clause does not prevent the legislture from recognizing 'degrees of evil' (Truax v. Raich, \n239 \nU.S. 33, 43\n, 36 S.Ct. 7, 11, L.R.A.1916D, 545, Ann.Cas.1917B, 283) by our ruling in Tigner v. Texas, \n310 \nU.S. 141, 147\n, 60 S.Ct. 879, 882, 130 A.L.R. 1321, that 'the Constitution does not require things which are different in fact or opinion to be treated in law as though they were the same.' And see Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. v. Browning, \n310 \nU.S. 362\n, 60 S. Ct. 968. Thus, if we had here only a question as to a State's classification of crimes, such as embezzlement or larceny, no substantial federal question would be raised. See Moore v. Missouri, \n159 \nU.S. 673\n, 16 S.Ct. 179; Hawker v. New York, \n170 \nU.S. 189\n, 18 S. Ct. 573; Finley v. California, \n222 \nU.S. 28\n, 32 S.Ct. 13; Patsone v. Pennsylvania, supra. For a State is not constrained in the exercise of its police power to ignore experience which marks a class of offenders or a family of offenses for special treatment. Nor is it prevented by the equal protection clause from confining 'its restrictions to those classes of cases where the need is deemed to be clearest'. Miller v. Wilson, \n236 \nU.S. 373, 384\n, 35 S.Ct. 342, 344, L.R.A.1915F, 829. And see McLean v. Arkansas, \n211 \nU.S. 539\n, 29 S.Ct. 206. As stated in Buck v. Bell, supra, 274 U.S. page 208, 47 S.Ct. page 585, '... the law does all that is needed when it does all that it can, indicates a policy, applies it to all within the lines, and seeks to bring within the lines all similarly situated so far and so fast as its means allow.' \n\n[316 \nU.S. 535, 541]\n\u00a0\n But the instant legislation runs afoul of the equal protection clause, though we give Oklahoma that large deference which the rule of the foregoing cases requires. We are dealing here with legislation which involves one of the basic civil rights of man. Marriage and procreation are fundamental to the very existence and survival of the race. The power to sterilize, if exercised, may have subtle, farreaching and devastating effects. In evil or reckless hands it can cause races or types which are inimical to the dominant group to wither and disappear. There is no redemption for the individual whom the law touches. Any experiment which the State conducts is to his irreparable injury. He is forever deprived of a basic liberty. We mention these matters not to reexamine the scope of the police power of the States. We advert to them merely in emphasis of our view that strict scrutiny of the classification which a State makes in a sterilization law is essential, lest unwittingly or otherwise invidious discriminations are made against groups or types of individuals in violation of the constitutional guaranty of just and equal laws. The guaranty of 'equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws.' Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356, 369\n, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 1070. When the law lays an unequal hand on those who have committed intrinsically the same quality of offense and sterilizes one and not the other, it has made as an invidious a discrimination as if it had selected a particular race or nationality for oppressive treatment. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, supra; Gaines v. Canada, \n305 \nU.S. 337\n, 59 S.Ct. 232. Sterilization of those who have thrice committed grand larceny with immunity for those who are embezzlers is a clear, pointed, unmistakable discrimination. Oklahoma makes no attempt to say that he who commits larceny by trespass or trick or fraud has biologically inheritable traits which he who commits embezzlement lacks. Oklahoma's line between larceny by fraud and embezzlement is determined, as we have noted, 'with reference to the time when the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 535, 542]\n\u00a0\n fraudulent intent to convert the property to the taker's own use' arises. Riley v. State, supra, 64 Okl.Cr. page 189, 78 P.2d page 715. We have not the slightest basis for inferring that that line has any significance in eugenics nor that the inheritability of criminal traits follows the neat legal distinctions which the law has marked between those two offenses. In terms of fines and imprisonment the crimes of larceny and embezzlement rate the same under the Oklahoma code. Only when it comes to sterilization are the pains and penalties of the law different. The equal protection clause would indeed be a formula of empty words if such conspicuously artificial lines could be drawn. See Smith v. Wayne Probate Judge, 231 Mich. 409, 420, 421, 204 N.W. 140, 40 A.L.R. 515. In Buck v. Bell, supra, the Virginia statute was upheld though it applied only to feebleminded persons in institutions of the State. But it was pointed out that 'so far as the operations enable those who otherwise must be kept confined to be returned to the world, and thus open the asylum to others, the equality aimed at will be more nearly reached.' 274 U.S. page 208, 47 S.Ct. page 585. Here there is no such saving feature. Embezzlers are forever free. Those who steal or take in other ways are not. If such a classification were permitted, the technical common law concept of a 'trespass' (Bishop, Criminal Law, 9th Ed., vol. 1,  566, 567) based on distinctions which are 'very largely dependent upon history for explanation' (Holmes, The Common Law, p. 73) could readily become a rule of human genetics.\n It is true that the Act has a broad severability clause. \n3\n But we will not endeavor to determine whether its applica- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 535, 543]\n\u00a0\n tion would solve the equal protection difficulty. The Supreme Court of Oklahoma sustained the Act without reference to the severability clause. We have therefore a situation where the Act as construed and applied to petitioner is allowed to perpetuate the discrimination which we have found to be fatal. Whether the severability clause would be so applied as to remove this particular constitutional objection is a question which may be more appropriately left for adjudication by the Oklahoma court. Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 \nU.S. 286\n, 44 S.Ct. 323. That is reemphasized here by our uncertainty as to what excision, if any, would be made as a matter of Oklahoma law. Cf. Smith v. Cahoon, \n283 \nU.S. 553\n, 51 S.Ct. 582. It is by no means clear whether if an excision were made, this particular constitutional difficulty might be solved by enlarging on the one hand or contracting on the other (cf. Mr. Justice Brandeis dissenting, National Life Insurance Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 508, 534\n, 535 S., 48 S.Ct. 591, 598) the class of criminals who might be sterilized.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE concurring.\n I concur in the result, but I am not persuaded that we are aided in reaching it by recourse to the equal protection clause.\n If Oklahoma may resort generally to the sterilization of criminals on the assumption that their propensities are transmissible to future generations by inheritance, I seriously doubt that the equal protection clause requires it to apply the measure to all criminals in the first instance, or to none. See Rosenthal v. New York, \n226 \nU.S. 260, 271\n, 33 S. Ct. 27, 30; \n\n[316 \nU.S. 535, 544]\n\u00a0\n Keokee Coke Co. v. Taylor, \n234 \nU.S. 224, 227\n, 34 S.Ct. 856; Patsone v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 138, 144\n, 34 S.Ct. 281, 282.\n Moreover, if we must presume that the legislature knows-what science has been unable to ascertain-that the criminal tendencies of any class of habitual offenders are transmissible regardless of the varying mental characteristics of its individuals, I should suppose that we must likewise presume that the legislature, in its wisdom, knows that the criminal tendencies of some classes of offenders are more likely to be transmitted than those of others. And so I think the real question we have to consider is not one of equal protection, but whether the wholesale condemnation of a class to such an invasion of personal liberty, without opportunity to any individual to show that his is not the type of case which would justify resort to it, satisfies the demands of due process.\n There are limits to the extent to which the presumption of constitutionality can be pressed, especially where the liberty of the person is concerned (see United States v. Carolene Products Co., \n304 \nU.S. 144\n, 152, n. 4, 58 S.Ct. 778, 783) and where the presumption is resorted to only to dispense with a procedure which the ordinary dictates of prudence would seem to demand for the protection of the individual from arbitrary action. Although petitioner here was given a hearing to ascertain whether sterilization would be detrimental to his health, he was given none to discover whether his criminal tendencies are of an inheritable type. Undoubtedly a state may, after appropriate inquiry, constitutionally interfere with the personal liberty of the individual to prevent the transmission by inheritance of his socially injurious tendencies. Buck v. Bell, \n274 \nU.S. 200\n, 47 S.Ct. 584. But until now we have not been called upon to say that it may do so without giving him a hearing and opportunity to challenge the existence as to him of the only facts which could justify so drastic a measure. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 535, 545]\n\u00a0\n Science has found and the law has recognized that there are certain types of mental deficiency associated with delinquency which are inheritable. But the State does not contend-nor can there be any pretense- that either common knowledge or experience, or scientific investigation,1 has given assurance that the criminal tendencies of any class of habitual offenders are universally or even generally inheritable. In such circumstances, inquiry whether such is the fact in the case of any particular individual cannot rightly be dispensed with. Whether the procedure by which a statute carries its mandate into execution satisfies due process is a matter of judicial cognizance. A law which condemns, without hearing, all the individuals of a class to so harsh a measure as the present because some or even many merit condemnation, is lacking in the first principles of due process. Morrison v. California, \n291 \nU.S. 82, 90\n, 54 S.Ct. 281, 284; and cases cited; Taylor v. Georgia, \n315 \nU.S. 25\n, 62 S.Ct. 415, 86 L.Ed. --. And so, while the state may protect itself from the demonstrably inheritable tendencies of the individual which are injurious to society, the most elementary notions of due process would seem to require it to take appropriate steps to safeguard the liberty of the individual by affording him, before he is condemned to an irreparable injury in his person, some opportunity to show that he is without such inheritable tendencies. The state is called on to sacrifice no permissible end when it is required to reach its objective by a reasonable and just procedure adequate to safeguard rights of the individual which concededly the Constitution protects. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 535, 546]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON, concurring.\n I join the CHIEF JUSTICE in holding that the hearings provided are too limited in the context of the present Act to afford due process of law. I also agree with the opinion of Mr. Justice DOUGLAS that the scheme of classification set forth in the Act denies equal protection of the law. I disagree with the opinion of each in so far as it rejects or minimizes the grounds taken by the other.\n Perhaps to employ a broad and loose scheme of classification would be permissible if accompanied by the individual hearings indicated by the CHIEF JUSTICE. On the other hand, narrow classification with reference to the end to be accomplished by the Act might justify limiting individual hearings to the issue whether the individual belonged to a class so defined. Since this Act does not present these questions, I reserve judgment on them.\n I also think the present plan to sterilize the individual in pursuit of a eugenic plan to eliminate from the race characteristics that are only vaguely identified and which in our present state of knowledge are uncertain as to transmissibility presents other constitutional questions of gravity. This Court has sustained such an experiment with respect to an imbecile, a person with definite and observable characteristics where the condition had persisted through three generations and afforded grounds for the belief that it was transmissible and would continue to manifest itself in generations to come. Buck v. Bell, \n274 \nU.S. 200\n, 47 S.Ct. 584\n\n\n There are limits to the extent to which a legislatively represented majority may conduct biological experiments at the expense of the dignity and personality and natural powers of a minority-even those who have been guilty of what the majority define as crimes.

JEFFERSON ELECTRIC CO.(1942)\nNo. 45\nArgued: October 23, 1942Decided: December 7, 1942\n\n\n\n Messrs. J. Bernhard Thiess, Leslie W. Fricke, and Sidney Neuman, all of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. Thomas H. Sheridan, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for our decision is whether a patent licensee, by virtue of his license agreement, is estopped to challenge a price-fixing clause in the agreement by showing that the patent is invalid, and that the price restriction is accordingly unlawful because not protected by the patent monopoly.\n Respondent brought the present suit in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, asserting di- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 173, 174]\n\u00a0\n versity of citizenship, and alleging that it was the owner op Patent No. 1777256 for improvements in an electrical transformer; that it had entered into a license contract granting petitioner a nonexclusive license to manufacture and sell the patented transformers throughout the United States, its territories, dependencies and possessions, on payment of a stipulated royalty upon each transformer so manufactured and sold. The contract provided that the license was granted on condition that the 'prices, terms, and conditions of sale, for use or sale' throughout the licensed territory should not be more favorable to petitioner's customers than those prescribed from time to time by respondent for its own sales and those of its other licensees. Respondent sought recovery of unpaid royalties and also an injunction restraining further sales except in conformity to the terms of the license agreement.\n Petitioner by its answer admitted that it had manufactured two types of transformers, one covered by certain narrow claims of the patent, claims 8, 14 and 19, the validity of which it does not challenge, the other alleged to be covered by certain broader claims. Petitioner also filed a counterclaim alleging that the broad claims are invalid for want of novelty, as it asserted had been recognized in the Sixth Circuit in France Mfg. Co. v. Jefferson Electric Co., 106 F.2d 605; and that respondent by reason of the price control provisions of the licensing contract and the invalidity of the broad claims was not entitled to recover royalties upon those transformers covered only by the broad claims. Petitioner accordingly prayed a declaratory judgment that most of the claims except 8, 14 and 19, are invalid, and for other relief.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court's order dismissing the counterclaim, 125 F.2d 322, ruling that petitioner, having accepted a license under the patent, was estopped to deny its validity. And, treating the patent as valid, it held \n\n[317 \nU.S. 173, 175]\n\u00a0\n that the stipulation for control of the sales price of the patented articles manufactured by the licensee was a lawful exercise of the patent monopoly. We granted certiorari, \n316 \nU.S. 652\n, 62 S.Ct. 946, the question being of importance to the administration of the patent laws and the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.\n The Circuit court of appeals, in holding that petitioner as a licensee was estopped to challenge the validity of the patent, did not say whether it considered that it was applying a rule of federal or of state law, and it cited no decisions of either the federal or the Illinois courts. Where no pricefixing stipulation was involved in the license contract, this rule of estoppel, which was not questioned by counsel, was applied without discussion in United States v. Harvey Steel Co., \n196 \nU.S. 310\n, 25 S.Ct. 240; cf. Kinsman v. Parkhurst, 18 How. 289. We need not decide whether in such a case the rule is one of local law, cf. Dale Tile Mfg. Co. v. Hyatt, \n125 \nU.S. 46, 53\n, 54 S., 8 S.Ct. 756, 758, 759, or whether, if it be regarded as a rule of federal law because the construction and application of the patent laws are involved, it was rightly applied in United States v. Harvey Steel Co., supra. For here a different question is presented-whether the doctrine of estoppel as invoked below is so in conflict with the Sherman Act's prohibition of price-fixing that this Court may resolve the question even though its conclusion be contrary to that of a state court.\n The present license contract contemplates and requires that petitioner, on sales of the licensed transformers throughout the United States, shall conform to the prices fixed by respondent for the sale of competing patented articles by other licensees and by respondent. Such a restriction on the price of articles entering interstate commerce is a violation of the Sherman Act save only as it is within the protection of a lawfully granted patent monopoly. See United States v. Univis Lens Co., \n316 \nU.S. 241, 250\n, 62 S.Ct. 1088, 1093, and cases cited; United States v. Masonite Corp., \n\n[317 \nU.S. 173, 176]\n\u00a0\n \n316 \nU.S. 265, 275\n, 277 S., 62 S.Ct. 1070, 1076, 1077. Agreements fixing the competitive sales price of articles moving interstate, not within the protection of a patent, are unlawful because prohibited by the Sherman Act.\n It is familiar doctrine that the prohibition of a federal statute may not be set at naught, or it benefits denied, by state statutes or state common law rules. In such a case our decision is not controlled by Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A.L.R. 1487. There we followed state law because it was the law to be applied in the federal courts. But the doctrine of that case is inapplicable to those areas of judicial decision within which the policy of the law is so dominated by the sweep of federal statutes that legal relations which they affect must be deemed governed by federal law having its source in those statutes, rather than by local law. Royal Indemnity Co. v. United States, \n313 \nU.S. 289, 296\n, 61 S.Ct. 995, 997; Prudence Realization Corp. v. Geist, \n316 \nU.S. 89, 95\n, 62 S.Ct. 978, 982; Board of Com'rs of Jackson County v.

When a federal statute condemns an act as unlawful the extent and nature of the legal consequences of the condemnation, though left by the statute to judicial determination, are nevertheless federal questions, the answers to which are to be derived from the statute and the federal policy which it has adopted. To the federal statute and policy, conflicting state law and policy must yield. Constitution, Art. VI, cl. 2; Awotin v. Atlas Exchange Nat. Bank, \n295 \nU.S. 209\n, 55 S.Ct. 674; Deitrick v.

See, in the case of federal statutes governing interstate freight rates, Pittsburgh, C.C. & St. L. Ry. Co. v. Fink, \n250 \nU.S. 577, 582\n, 583 S., 40 S.Ct. 27, 28; Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. v.

National Harrow Co., \n186 \nU.S. 70, 88\n, 22 S.Ct. 747, 754. And it has proceeded on the assumption that whether the parties to an agreement in violation of the Act are in pari delicto is a question of federal, not state, law. Harriman v. Northern Securities Co., \n197 \nU.S. 244\n, 25 S.Ct. 493; Eastman Kodak Co. v. Southern Photo Material Co., \n273 \nU.S. 359, 376\n, 378 S., 47 S.Ct. 400, 404, 405. It decided in Continental Wall Paper Co. v. Voight & Sons Co., \n212 \nU.S. 227\n, 29 S.Ct. 280, that a vendee of goods purchased from an illegal combination in pursuance of an illegal agreement, both in violation of the Sherman Act, can plead the illegality in defense to a suit for the purchase price. This decision went much further than it is necessary to go here to conclude that petitioner may assert the illegality of the price-fixing agreement and may offer any competent evidence to establish its illegality, including proof of the invalidity of the patent.\n Local rules of estoppel which would fasten upon the public as well as the petitioner the burden of an agreement in violation of the Sherman Act must yield to the Act's declaration that such agreements are unlawful, and to the public policy of the Act which in the public interest precludes the enforcement of such unlawful agreements.

NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD(1942)\nNo. 320\nArgued: Decided: April 6, 1942\n\n\n\n Messrs. Joseph W. Henderson and Randolph W. Childs, both of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioner.\n Mr. Robert B. Watts, of Washington, D.C., for respondent N.L.R.B. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 31, 32]\n\u00a0\n Mr.Wm. L. Standard, of New York City, for respondent, National Maritime Union of America.\n\n Mr. Justice BYRNES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Upon the petition of a union not a party to the present suit, the National Labor Relations Board ordered an election among petitioner's unlicensed employees to determine their collective bargaining representative. The elections were held on board seven of petitioner's vessels during October, 1937. In the case of the election on board the S.S. City of Houston, the labor organizations involved objected to the presence of any representative of the petitioner during the voting, and consequently none was admitted by the Board. No such objection was raised with respect to the subsequent balloting, and petitioner's representatives were present while the vote was taken on board the remaining six vessels. The National Maritime Union obtained a clear majority of all the votes cast. Because of the exclusion of its representative from the voting on the S.S. City of Houston, petitioner objected to the certification of the N.M.U. as the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees in the unit. On January 26, 1938, the Board rejected petitioner's contention, and issued a certification order. 4 N.L.R.B. 1140\n\n\n Six months later, on July 26, the N.M.U. filed charges against petitioner, which it amended on November 22. On November 23, the Board issued a complaint in which it accused petitioner of violations of Sections 8(1), (3) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act. U.S.C., Title 29, Section 158(1), (3)(5), 29 U.S.C.A.  158(1, 3, 5). The allegations of the complaint were that the N.M.U. had been certified in January as exclusive bargaining representative, that petitioner had con- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 31, 33]\n\u00a0\n sistently refused since that time to bargain with the Union, that as a result of this refusal to bargain a strike had occurred on July 18 aboard petitioner's S.S. City of Fort Worth while docked at Houston, Texas, that upon the City of Fort Worth's return to Philadelphia on July 25 five members of the crew1 were discharged because of their membership and activity in the Union and particularly because of their participation in the strike, and that as a result of these discharges other members2 of the crew of the Fort Worth had gone on strike while the vessel was at home dock in Philadelphia. In its answer to this complaint, petitioner generally denied these allegations and chiefly contended: first, that it had been under no obligation to bargain with the N.M.U. because the Board's refusal to permit petitioner to be represented at the election aboard the S.S. City of Houston rendered the entire certification proceedings void; and second, that the discharge of the five members of the City of Fort Worth was not an unfair labor practice because it was based upon their misconduct in striking on July 18 while under Shipping Articles, away from home port, and on board ship.\n After the usual proceedings, on April 22, 1940, the Board issued its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order. 23 N.L.R.B. 26. Its findings, which must be set out in some detail, follow:\n After the election and the certification of the N.M.U. in January, 1938, the Union made persistent efforts through its representatives to arrange a bargaining conference with officials of the petitioner. Every such attempt was frustrated by the latter, who refused even to answer the requests until August. In that month the Union was notified that petitioner would not undertake to bargain \n\n[316 \nU.S. 31, 34]\n\u00a0\n with it 'until the validity of the Board's certification was settled by the Board and the courts.'\n On July 17, while the City of Fort Worth was docked at Houston, thirteen unlicensed members of the crew met in a union hall. They decided to strike the next day to compel petitioner to recognize the Union and to issue to the Union's shore delegates the passes without which they could not board petitioner's vessels. At 8 o'clock the following morning the strike began. One of the men, Tracey, failed to turn the steam 'on deck' for use in loading the cargo. He was then asked by the first assistant engineer why he had failed to do so, and answered that a strike was on, explaining the strikers' demands. When the first assistant engineer turned on the steam himself, Tracey persuaded Braun, the fireman, to leave his post. And Ferguson, who came on duty just at that moment to replace Braun as fireman, also refused to tend the fires. The second assistant engineer then undertook to tend the fires himself, and Tracey, Ferguson and Braun went to the poop deck where the rest of the strikers were sitting. The poop deck is the usual meeting place of the crew when not on duty.\n From that time until evening the strikers sat quietly by, engaging in no violence and not interfering with the officers of the ship or the non- striking members of the crew who proceeded with the loading of the cargo. The strikers did not 'claim to hold the ship in defiance of the right of possession of the owner'.3 But when the captain \n\n[316 \nU.S. 31, 35]\n\u00a0\n ordered them to return to work, they refused. They continued to refuse after a deputy United States Shipping Commissioner came aboard and read to them that provision of their shipping articles in which they had promised 'to be obedient to the lawful commands' of the master. Late in the afternoon, although he had not been authorized to do so, petitioner's attorney in Houston promised the Union's attorney in that city that he would meet with the latter during the following week to negotiate an agreement and that he would recommend to petitioner that passes be granted to shore delegates. As a result of this promise, the strike was ended at about 7 p.m. and the ship sailed on schedule at about 9 p.m.\n The return voyage to Philadelphia was marked by no further difficulty. However, during the course of it the captain decided not to reship five of the strikers. \n4\n When the ship reached port on July 25 and the men signed off the shipping articles, these five were informed that they would not be reshipped. Most of them had been members of the City of Fort Worth's crew continuously for a considerable length of time. \n5\n It was the custom of petitioner to have the seamen sign new articles for the next voyage when signing off the old, but even when this was not done the men considered themselves employed for the next voyage unless notified to the contrary. Under these circumstances the Board found that the five men in question had actually been discharged and that their employment had \n\n[316 \nU.S. 31, 36]\n\u00a0\n not simply ended as of course when the shipping articles expired. Seven6 of the other men who had engaged in the Houston strike immediately struck again in protest against the discharge of their fellows. On the basis of this evidence the Board found that both the strike at Houston on July 18 and the strike at Philadelphia on July 25 were caused by petitioner's unfair labor practices. And it made a specific finding with respect to each of the five men that the discharge was based upon participation in the Houston strike. It concluded that petitioner had interfered with its employees' right to organize and bargain collectively, in violation of  8( 1); that it had discriminated with regard to tenure of employment, in violation of  8(3); and that it had refused to bargain with the authorized representative of its employees, in violation of  8(5).\n Consequently, it ordered petitioner to cease and desist: (a) from discouraging membership in the N.M.U. or any other labor organization by discriminating in regard to employment; (b) from refusing to bargain collectively with the N.M.U.; and (c) from interfering with, restraining, or coercing its employees in any way in the exercise of their right to organize and bargain collectively. In addition, and 'in order to effectuate the policies of the Act,' the order included the following affirmative requirements: (a) that petitioner bargain with the N.M.U.; (b) that it reinstate with back pay the five men discharged; (c) that, upon application, it offer immediate reinstatement to the July 25th strikers; and (d) that it post notices of its intention to conform to this order.\n Petitioner sought to have this order set aside by the Circuit Court of Appeals. The Circuit Court, however, sitting en banc, and with one judge dissenting, entered a decree enforcing the order with a single minor modifica- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 31, 37]\n\u00a0\n tion. \n7\n 3 Cir., 120 F.2d 505. We granted certiorari because of the importance of the matters involved, and because of an asserted conflict with decisions of this Court and of other Circuit Courts of Appeal.\n Petitioner's contentions in this Court are: (1) that the refusal by the Board to permit a company representative aboard the S.S. City of Houston during the voting vitiated the entire election and certification proceeding and absolved petitioner of any duty under the Act to bargain with the N.M.U.; (2) that the employment of the seamen involved automatically terminated when they signed off the shipping articles in Philadelphia, so that they cannot be said to have been 'discharged'; and ( 3) that participation in the Houston strike by the discharged seamen was misconduct of such a character that the Board cannot order their reinstatement.\n The first two of these arguments are without substance. The Board enjoys a wide discretion in determining the procedure necessary to insure the fair and free choice of bargaining representatives by employees. N.L.R. B. v. Waterman Steamship Corporation, \n309 \nU.S. 206, 226\n, 60 S.Ct. 493, 503; N.L.R.B. v. Falk Corporation, \n308 \nU.S. 453, 458\n, 60 S.Ct. 307, 310. It is wholly reasonable to remove any possibility of intimidation by conducting the election in the absence of the employer's representatives. With respect to whether the five men in question were actually discharged upon the ship's return to Philadelphia, petitioner concedes that the formal signing off of the shipping articles was not conclusive. The tenure of their employment must be determined in the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 31, 38]\n\u00a0\n light of all the evidence concerning petitioner's employment customs and practices. N.L.R.B. v. Waterman Stteamship Corp., \n309 \nU.S. 206, 218\n, 60 S. Ct. 493, 500. The argument here therefore comes to this, that this record does not warrant a finding that the tenure of employment survived the termination of the shipping articles. An examination of the record convinces us that the concurrent finding of the Board and the Circuit Court on this question should not be disturbed.\n The situation, then, is one in which an employer indulges in an unfair labor practice, a strike results, and several men are discharged for participating in the strike. If there were no more to the case, and the Board found that it would serve to effectuate the policies of the Act to reinstate the strikers, an order requiring reinstatement would undoubtedly be enforceable. National Labor Relations Board v. Stackpole Carbon Co., 3 Cir., 105 F.2d 167. But there is more to this case. The strike was conducted by seamen on board a vessel and away from home port. The question is whether this circumstance renders it an abuse of discretion for the Board to order the reinstatement of the strikers. We think that it does.\n Ever since men have gone to sea, the relationship of master to seaman has been entirely different from that of employer to employee on land. The lives of passengers and crew as well as the safety of ship and cargo are entrusted to the master's care. Every one and every thing depend on him. He must command and the crew must obey. Authority cannot be divided. These are actualities which the law has always recognized. On the one hand, it has imposed numerous prohibitions against conduct by seamen which destroys or impairs this authority. We shall consider in a moment the nature and scope of the criminal sanctions imposed in case of revolt and mutiny. But it is worth noting here that the form of the 'shipping articles' which the master \n\n[316 \nU.S. 31, 39]\n\u00a0\n and every member of the crew must sign prior to the voyage has been carefully prescribed by Congress, and that these articles contain this promise: 'And the said crew agree ... to be obedient to the lawful commands of the said master ... and of their superior officers in everything relating to the vessel, and the stores and cargo thereof, whether on board, in boats, or on shore ....' U.S.C., Title 46,  564, 713, 46 U.S.C.A.  564, 713. On the other hand, workers at sea have been the beneficiaries of extraordinary legislative solicitude, undoubtedly prompted by the limits upon their ability to help themselves. The statutes of the United States contain elaborate requirements with respect to such matters as their medicines, clothing, heat, hours and watches, wages, and return transportation to this country if destitute abroad. U.S.C.,, Title 46,  651-692, 1131, 46 U.S.C.A.  651-692, 1131. It is in this setting of fact and law that we must test the validity of the Board's order of reinstatement.\n Petitioner contends that the strike aboard the City of Fort Worth at the dock in Houston was mutiny and violated Sections 292 and 293 of the Criminal Code. Those sections provide:\n's 292. Inciting revolt or mutiny on shipboard. Whoever, being of the crew of a vessel of the United States, on the high seas, or any other waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States, endeavors to make a revolt or mutiny on board such vessel, or combines, conspires, or confederates with any other person on board to make such revolt or mutiny, or solicits, incites, or stirs up any other of the crew to disobey or resist the lawful orders of the master or other officer of such vessel, or to refuse or neglect their proper duty on board thereof, or to betray their proper trust, or assembles with others in a tumultuous and mutinous manner, or makes a riot on board thereof, or unlawfully confines the master or other commanding officer thereof, \n\n[316 \nU.S. 31, 40]\n\u00a0\n shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. U.S.C., Title 18,  483, 18 U.S.C.A.  483.\n\n's 293. Revolt or mutiny on shipboard. Whoever, being of the crew of a vessel of the United States, on the high seas, or on any other waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States, unlawfully and with force, or by fraud, or intimidation, usurps the command of such vessel from the master or other lawful officer in command thereof, or deprives him of authority and command on board, or resists or prevents him in the free and lawful exercise thereof, or transfers such authority and command to another not lawfully entitled thereto, is guilty of a revolt and mutiny, and shall be fined not more than $2,000 and imprisoned not more than ten years.' U.S.C., Title 18,  484, 18 U.S.C.A.  484.\n\n The Board's defense to this contention is two-fold. It argues, first, that the conduct of the strikers did not violate either of these sections, and second, that even if it did the violation does not bar their reinstatement.\n First. We think that the strike aboard the City of Fort Worth on July 18 was in violation of  292 and 293. It may hardly be disputed that each of the strikers resisted the captain and other officers in the free and lawful exercise of their authority and command, within the meaning of  293, or that they combined and conspired to that end, within the meaning of  292. Deliberately and persistently they defied direct commands to perform their duties in making ready for the departure from port. It is true that they did not engage in violence or prevent the other men and officers from proceeding with preparations for the voyage. \n8\n But short of that, they did what they could \n\n[316 \nU.S. 31, 41]\n\u00a0\n to prevent the ship from sailing. In the words of the striker Tracey, had they not believed that their demands had been satisfied, 'we would still be sitting there'. There is no doubt that they undertook to impose their will upon the captain and officers.\n None of these facts is denied by the respondents or by the Circuit Court. \n9\n Indeed it is admitted that had the strike occurred on the high seas, the participants would have been guilty of mutiny. But a distinction is said to lie between strikes at sea and at dock. To determine the validity of this distinction we turn first to the words of the statute. They are plain enough: 'Whoever, being of the crew of a vessel of the United States, on the high seas, or on any other waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States', etc. It has long been settled that the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States includes all navigable waters within the country. The Genesee Chief, 12 How. 443. 10 The water in the harbor of Houston is certainly navigable, and a boat at dock there is obviously within the territorial limits of the United States. The words of the statute alone, therefore, do not warrant an exception in the case of a vessel situated as the City of Fort Worth was when the strike occurred.\n Nor are we referred to the decision of any court in which such an exception has been implied. Under the original Mutiny Act of 1790,11 Justice Story held without hesitation that a refusal to work while a vessel was in an American harbor was a violation of the statute. \n12\n The act of 1790 \n\n[316 \nU.S. 31, 42]\n\u00a0\n was supplanted in 1835 by a statute which, with only minor changes, now appears as Sections 292 and 293 of the Criminal Code, set out above. \n13\n Since 1835, whenever the question has arisen, the courts have held that a mutiny may occur in a harbor, either foreign or domestic, as well as at sea. \n14\n It is true, however, that in none of these cases does it expressly appear that the vessel was tied to a dock as was the City of Fort Worth in this case. And in the Rees case, the court specifically reserved the question of whether the Mutiny Act bars a strike on board a vessel so situated. 95 F.2d 784, at page 792.\n It was therefore strictly accurate for the Circuit Court of Appeals to observe that 'the question of the right of seamen to strike under the circumstances of the case before us is still an open one.' (120 F.2d 510.) On this assumption, however, it proceeded to conclude that the necessity for absolute authority in the master is so considerably diminished when the ship is moored in a 'safe' port that a strike in such circumstances should not be held to violate the Act. This theory has been regarded with favor by a number of courts an \n\n[316 \nU.S. 31, 43]\n\u00a0\n commentators15 and is said to conform more closely to changed conceptions with respect to the freedom of workers on land or sea to organize, to bargain, and to use economic weapons to enforce their demands.\n The difficulty with the contention is that it ignores the plain Congressional mandate that a rebellion by seamen against their officers on board a vessel anywhere within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States is to be punished as mutiny. If this mandate is to be changed, it must be changed by Congress and not by the Courts. If further proof be needed of a Congressional belief that the requirements of discipline during a voyage do not vary with each change in circumstance, it may be found in the shipping articles to which we have already referred. For in those articles the members of the crew are obliged to promise to obey lawful commands 'whether on board, in boats, or on shore'. And before a seaman's certificate is issued by the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation the applicant must take an oath to '... carry out the lawful orders of my superior officers on shipboard.' \n16\n The lower court expressed the opinion, 'Upon reason, however, there is no sound basis for depriving seamen of this right (to strike) when as here their vessel is moored to the dock in a safe domestic port.' But the soundness or unsoundness of the reasoning is for the determination of Congress. As recently as 1939 two bills were introduced in the House of Representatives \n\n[316 \nU.S. 31, 44]\n\u00a0\n for the purpose of limiting the scope of Sections 292 and 293 to vessels 'under way on the high seas'. H.R. 3427, 3428, 76th Congress, 1st Session. The United States Maritime Commission Communicated to the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries its firm objection to the measures,17 and they were never enacted. When the legislative purpose is so plain, we cannot assume to do that which Congress has refused to do. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 31, 45]\n\u00a0\n In any event, a sweeping requirement of obedience throughout the course of a voyage is certainly not without \n\n[316 \nU.S. 31, 46]\n\u00a0\n basis in reason. The strategy of discipline is not simple. The maintenance of authority hinges upon a delicate complex of human factors, and Congress may very sensibly have concluded that a master whose orders are subject to the crew's veto in port cannot enforce them at sea. Moreover, it is by no means clear that a ship moored to a dock is 'safe' if the crew refuses to tend it, as the strikers did at Houston. At the very least, steam must be maintained to provide light and fire protection. \n18\n The damage to the Normandie is grim enough proof that the hazard of fire is ever present. \n19\n It is not enough to say that in the case before us the strikers did not prevent these precautions from being taken; only the efforts of others averted the dangers to which they opened the door.\n We conclude that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in holding that the strike at Houston did not violate Sections 292 and 293.\n Second. Assuming that the strike did violate these sections, the Board contends that the reinstatement provisions of its order were nevertheless valid. Section 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  160(c) permits the Board to require an employer who has committed an unfair labor practice to take 'such affirmative action, including reinstatement of employees ..., as will effectuate the policies of the Act (this chapter).' This authorization is of considerable breadth, and the courts may not lightly disturb the Board's choice of remedies. But it is also true that this discretion has its limits, and we have already begun to define them. National Labor Relations Board v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., \n306 \nU.S. 240\n, 59 S.Ct. 490, 123 A.L.R. 599; Republic Steel Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n311 \nU.S. 7\n, 61 S.Ct. 77. A complete definition of course was not and could not have been attempted in those cases. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 31, 47]\n\u00a0\n Nor will it be attempted here. It is sufficient for this case to observe that the Board has not been commissioned to effectuate the policies of the Labor Relations Act so single-mindedly that it may wholly ignore other and equally important Congressional objectives. Frequently the entire scope of Congressional purpose calls for careful accommodation of one statutory scheme to another, and it is not too much to demand of an administrative body that it undertake this accommodation without excessive emphasis upon its immediate task.\n This was the kind of consideration for which the present case called. To bolster its claim that it responded to this call, the Board relies upon what it asserts to have been the 'technical' nature of the violation of  292 and 293. Specifically, it points to the comparative safety of the ship when moored to the dock, the absence of volence, and the double character of the ship as the strikers' place of employment and their home during the course of the voyage. While we have no doubt that the danger to the vessel was considerably less than it would have been had the strike occurred at sea, we have already indicated that it was certainly present and that considerations other than immediate danger to the ship require maintenance of discipline throughout the voyage. Likewise, the absence of violence was a fortunate feature of the affair, but the flouting of the captain's authority was nevertheless deliberate and complete. Finally, for these strikers to remain aboard the ship was indeed an act of very different significance than for strikers at an industrial plant to remain inside a factory. But in one respect at least the comparison is unfavorable to the strikers here. As a practical matter, the City of Fort Worth was definitely wrested from the control of its officers. In an industrial plant the employer is confronted only with the necessity of placing new men at the machines. But under the law petitioner was required \n\n[316 \nU.S. 31, 48]\n\u00a0\n to furnish living quarters to any new crew whom it might have hired for the return voyage to Philadelphia. This meant the removal of the strikers from their quarters as well as their posts of duty. It is difficult to imagine that they would have surrendered their jobs and their quarters without a struggle. They asserted their right to occupy the quarters and to eat the food which the master was required to furnish them as members of the crew and yet to refuse to work or to obey his orders. See United States v. Albers, 2 Cir., 115 F.2d 833, at page 836. In fact, as we have noted, they intended, according to the witness Tracey, to 'still be sitting there' if petitioner had not capitulated to their demands.\n We cannot ignore the fact that the strike was unlawful from its very inception. It directly contravened the policy of Congress as expressed in  292 and 293, and it was more than a 'technical' violation of those provisions. Consequently, and despite the initial unfair labor practice which caused the strike, we hold that the reinstatement provisions of the order exceeded the Board's authority to make such requiremens 'as wll effectuate the policies of the Act (this chapter)'.20\n It should be stressed that the view we have taken does not prevent the redress of grievances under the Act. At any time following the certification of the N.M.U. in January, 1938, the union and the Board could have secured the assistance of the courts in forcing petitioner to bargain. The importance of seeking such assistance promptly is strikingly illustrated in this case. \n21\n Had the union and the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 31, 49]\n\u00a0\n Board done so, the unfortunate occurrence at Houston might have been averted. And what is more, nothing that we have said would prevent the union from striking, picketing or resorting to any other means of self- help, so long as the time and place it chooses do not come within the express prohibition of Congress.\n The case is remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals with instructions to limit its decree of enforcement to those provisions of the Board's order requiring petitioner to bargain with the N.M.U. and to post notices to that effect, but to eliminate the other provisions of the order.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice REED, dissenting.\n To support its judgment of reversal this Court relies upon the employees' violation of  292 and 293 of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.A.  483, 484, as justification for the Steamship Company's discharge of its seamen. If the seamen were discharged not for labor activity but because of the commission of serious crime, National Labor Relations Board v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., \n306 \nU.S. 240\n, 59 S.Ct. 490, 123 A.L.R. 599, would be authority for the Court's holding. It was there decided that  2(3) of the Labor Act did not preserve a striker's eligibility for reinstatement by the Board under  10(c), if the striker was discharged for reasons other than 'union activity or agitation for collective bargaining,' e.g., criminal acts. 306 U.S. at page 255, 59 S.Ct. at page 496, 123 A.L.R. 599. The Court recognizes that where 'an employer indulges in an unfair labor practice, a strike results and several men are discharged for participating in the strike,' and nothing more appears, the Labor Board may properly rein- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 31, 50]\n\u00a0\n state the strikers. It concludes, however, that where the strike provoked by the unfair practices is itself unlawful, the Board, regardless of the circumstances, loses its power to reinstate after discharge. This position, we think, unduly expands judicial review of the Board's discretionary power of reinstatement under  10(c), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(c) and is not supported by the Fansteel decision.\n This Court recognized in the Fansteel case that the Board had discretion over reinstatement. \n306 \nU.S. 258\n, 59 S.Ct. 497, 123 A.L.R. 599. It was thought that however wide that discretion might be, 'its limits were transcended' in that case. The ninety-five men in Fansteel were discharged 'for the seizure and retention of the buildings.' \n306 \nU.S. 252\n, 59 S.Ct. 494, 123 A.L.R. 599. But those men held the buildngs from February 17 until February 26. They disobeyed a court injunction order to surrender the factory, and successfully resisted by force the sheriff's efforts to enforce it. Only on his second attempt, with an increased number of deputies, did the sheriff accomplish their eviction and arrest. \n306 \nU.S. 248, 249\n, 59 S.Ct. 492, 493, 123 A.L.R. 599.\n Nothing approaching such disorder occurred here. The seamen's conduct did not affect the safety of the vessel. The only evidence of violation of the statutes is that the orders to load were ignored. We may assume, for this dissent, that this resultedin a violation of the criminal statutes. the Board found that the respondent refused to bargain collectively with the Union, that primarily this precipitated the strike, and that the respondent was not warranted in discharging any employee solely because of the strike. It further found that the strikers did not hold the ship in defiance of the owner nor did they trespass. The Board found in each instance that the discharges were not for disobeying orders but for striking, for peacefully, albeit unlawfully, resorting to self-help in retaliation against denial of their rights. \n1\n On the basis of \n\n[316 \nU.S. 31, 51]\n\u00a0\n these findings, supported by substantial evidence, the Board exercised its discretion to reinstate these men.\n We think that under these circumstances, it acted within its authority. We can see no justification for an iron rule that a discharge of a striker by his employer for some particular, unlawful conduct in furtherance of a strike is sufficient to bar his reinstatement as a matter of law. Fansteel teaches that there are extremes of conduct which leave no discretion to the Board. We think that the acts here fall on the other side of the line and that the Circuit Court of Appeals properly so determined\n Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MURPHY concur in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Warren, Tracey, Pfuhl, Smith and Ferguson. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Crassavaz, Reeves, Lathan, Burns, Hughes, Neeley and Holt. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Board found that the strikers were at no time ordered to leave the ship. It is true that three of the officers testified that they had neither given nor heard any of the officers give such an order. But despite a great reluctance to overturn a finding on such a pure matter of fact, we cannot square it with the affirmative and uncontradicted testimony of Tracey, one of the strikers, that petitioner's agent in Houston boarded the ship at least four times during the day, at least once in the company of the Captain, ordered the strikers to leave the ship within the next half hour, and announced that he was going to bring on a new crew (R. 140, 141, 161, 162). \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See note 1, supra. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Board's finding on this matter was that 'Tracey had been employed continuously over a period of 16 months, Ferguson for a period of 1 year, Pfuhl over a period of 8 months, Warren over a period of 6 weeks, and Smith over a period of 18 months. Each round-trip voyage of the City of Fort Worth is scheduled to take about 25 days.' (R. 27.) \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See note 2, supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The Board's order permitted petitioner to deduct from the back pay due any amounts that the discharged men might have earned during the period in question, but required it to reimburse any public work relief agency for sums paid to any of the men during that time. The latter phase of the order was eliminated by the Circuit Court of Appeals on the authority of Republic Steel Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n311 \nU.S. 7\n, 61 S.Ct. 77. The Board raises no objection to this modification of its order. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] It should be noted, however, that according to the second assistant engineer's testimony, when he told Tracey that he intended to put the steam on deck himself, Tracey replied, 'You had better not. You will be sorry.' No effort was made to carry out this threat. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The Board did not consider the question of whether the strike amounted to mutiny. \n[\nFootnote 10\n] On the jurisdiction of the United States over men and vessels in foreign waters, see United States v.

Land:\n'Under date of February 1, 1939, you requested the views and recommendations of the Commission with respect to H.R. 3427 and H.R. 3428.\n\n'The proposed bills would emasculate the present laws in respect of revolt or mutiny on shipboard. No conduct by members of the crew of a vessel of the United States would constitute a violation of the statutes unless the vessel were under way on the high seas and then only if actual force as distinguished from the lesser degrees of revolt or mutiny involving use of fraud or intimidation were used against the commanding officer. Moreover, the proposed amendments would reduce the maximum penalties by seventy-five per cent.\n\n'It is the Commission's considered opinion that there is no reason which would justify the Congress in lessening the authority of the masters on board vessels of the American merchant marine.\n\n'The crimes of endeavoring to incite to revolt or mutiny, or actually accomplishing revolt or mutiny, may be committed 'on the high seas, or on any other waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States'. It is well settled that this includes all such offenses committed on the vessels of the United States on navigable waters, including the ports, revers and harbors of foreign countries. (United States v. Flores, \n289 \nU.S. 137\n (53 S.Ct. 580).)\n\n'Seamen who sign articles to become members of the crew of a vessel of the United States enter into a relationship which, in the nature of things, is different from that assumed by persons employed on land. Both as 'wards of the admiralty' under the general maritime law and by special acts of Congress applying only to them, seamen enjoy many benefits not accorded to land workers. At the same time they must assume certain correlative duties not necessary to land occupations.\n\n'In the Economic Survey of the American Merchant Marine, the Commission said (p. 46):\n\n\"The sea is no place for divided authority. When a man puts foot on the deck of a ship, he becomes part of a disciplined organism subject to the navigation laws of the United States.' \n\n'It has been contended that the mutiny statutes do not apply unless the vessel is in actual danger and a fortiori there can be no mutiny in a safe harbor. This contention, not having met with success in the courts ( Rees v. United States; Hamilton v. United States) is brought before the legislative branch of the Government in the form of the proposed amendments. The fact that a vessel may be in a safe harbor does not, under existing law, and it is submitted, should not, give sanction to the offenses covered by the mutiny statutes. It is apparent to all those familiar with the sea that no vessel is safe unless she is, among other things, manned by a competent crew which means, in short, a crew alert to its duties and responsive at all times to the lawful commands of the master. A crew which does not meet this test is not competent and must, moreover, be lacking in that morale which is necessary to the safe preservation of the ship, her passengers and cargo. Because of the human factor involved, it is difficult to see how the morale of a crew which feels that it should be free to disobey the lawful commands of the master when the vessel is not 'under way on the high seas', can be revived with automatic regularity when the ship weighs anchor or crosses an imaginary line to the high seas.\n\n'Certainly there need be no fear, on the part of members of an orderly and competent crew, that they will run afoul of existing statutes governing discipline on board vessels of the United States. As there can be no escape from the necessities of such discipline, there should be no diminution of the authority required to meet those necessities.\n\n'The Commission is of the opinion that the proposed amendments, if enacted, would be harmful to the development of the American merchant marine and it is accordingly, opposed to the measures.\n\n'The Commission is advised by the Acting Director of the Bureau of the Budget that there would be no objection to the submission of this report to your Committee.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] Memorandum to Ship Operators dated December 10, 1941, Bureau of Marine Inspection, Department of Commerce. \n[\nFootnote 19\n] N.Y.

National Labor Relations Board, 5 Cir., 98 F.2d 411, 414. \n[\nFootnote 21\n] We do not question the Board's finding that petitioner refused to bargain with the N.M.U. after January 26, 1938. But the findings and the record indicate that the union was not markedly diligent. The Board found that one request for a conference was made by a union representative at Houston 'shortly after the certification'. 'In late January or early February', the union's business agent in Philadelphia made a similar request. He renewed it 'about the middle of February'. 'During the next month' he made two attempts to repeat his request by telephone. From that time until August 18, a month after the strike at Houston, he made only one other attempt, the date of which he was unable to fix. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'The evidence is plain that both Tracey and Ferguson were discharged because of the leading parts they played in the strike. Chief Engineer Norton testified that he did not recommend Ferguson's discharge merely because he had disobeyed orders. 'I would have overlooked that had he taken the fires until we got straightened out.' Captain Rudan testified that he discharged both these men upon Norton's complaint that 'they had been on which at the time of the commencement of this what I consider disobedience, and if they had gone on watch at the time, that the rest of the men probably would have followed. ...\n'Captain Rudan's testimony makes it abundantly clear that the motivating factor in the respondent's decision to discharge Pfuhl was his participation in the strike. ... \n\n'We entertain no doubt that an employee's intoxication provides ample reason for his discharge. We believe, however, that the respondent did not discharge warren for this reason, but rather that it seized upon his drinking proclivities to rid itself of an active union officer. ...\n\n'On cross-examination Sherry admitted that Smith was discharged because of his participation in the strike. ...' \n\n\n\n\n\n","114":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHPORT PETROLEUM CO. v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATION BOARD(1942)\nNo. 67\nArgued: January 5, 1942Decided: January 19, 1942\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied Feb. 16, 1942\n\n\n See \n315 \nU.S. 827\n, 62 S.Ct. 637, 86 L.Ed. --. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 100, 101]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Harry Dow and Morris D. Meyer, both of Houston, Tex., for petitioner.\n Mr. Robert B. Watts, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner, a Texas corporation, was ordered by the National Labor Relations Board in August of 1938 to cease and desist from unfair labor practices;1 to offer to \n\n[315 \nU.S. 100, 102]\n\u00a0\n reinstate three employees found to have been discriminatorily discharged, and to pay them back pay for the period from the time of discharge to the date of the offer of reinstatement, less earnings during such period; and to post certain notices at its Texas City refinery, where the unfair labor practices had been employed.\n The petitioner has never obeyed any of the affirmative directions of the order. In June of 1939 it entered into a written stipulation with the Board that it would obey the order except as it related to back pay, and the Board stipulated on its part that it would accept the performance so promised as sufficient compliance with its order. But the petitioner no more regarded its own promise than it had the Board's command. It finally ceased even to answer communications from the Board, and the latter in April of 1940 filed its petition with the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for enforcement of its order.\n The petitioner then began the pleas to that court, denial of which it says are errors. Nearly four months after the Board had filed its petition, the present petitioner filed an application under  10(e) of the National Labor Relations Act2 to adduce additional evidence before the Board. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 100, 103]\n\u00a0\n The application stated on the oath of petitioner's president that in June of 1939, three days after petitioner had executed the stipulation of obedience to the Board's order, it distributed all of its assets to its four stockholders as a liquidating dividend; and that the two stockholders who received the Texas City refinery conveyed it to a newly organized Delaware corporation whose stockholders were at no time stockholders of the Texas corporation. It asked that the court order that proof of these facts be taken before the Board or its agent and added to the transcript, and that the court thereupon dismiss the enforcement proceeding. In November of 1940, while this application was pending, it filed an answer to the petition for enforcement, attacking the findings and order of the Board on evidentiary grounds, and also praying that the petition be dismissed because petitioner had been formally dissolved on October 16, 1940, as evidenced by an attached copy of a certificate by the Texas Assistant Secretary of State. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[315 \nU.S. 100, 104]\n\u00a0\n The Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the Board's order and entered a decree directing that it be enforced, thus in effect denying the motion to dismiss and the application for leave to adduce additional evidence. 5 Cir., 117 F.2d 90. We granted certiorari limited to the question of the propriety of the denial of the latter because of the general importance of the question. \n313 \nU.S. 558\n, 61 S.Ct. 1113.\n We hold that the application for leave to adduce additional evidence pursuant to  10(e) of the National Labor Relations Act was addressed to the sound judicial discretion of the court and that the denial of petitioner's application under the circumstances disclosed by the record in this case was not error.\n To ensure that the applicable part of  10(e) would be used only for proper purposes, and not abused by resort to it as a mere instrument of delay, Congress provided that before the court might grant relief thereunder it must be satisfied of the materiality of the additional evidence, and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce it at the hearing before the Board. The decision below under  10(e) apparently resulted solely from a belief that \n\n[315 \nU.S. 100, 105]\n\u00a0\n the proffered evidence was not 'material.' Accordingly, we have no occasion to decide whether a Circuit Court of Appeals may in its discretion deny an application under  10(e) even though it be satisfied that the additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce it in the hearing before the Board. For the same reason we do not consider the question of the credibility of petitioner's allegations, viewed in the light of its conduct.\n The petitioner's conduct does, however, give point to omissions of pertinent facts from its allegations. The record makes it certain that it would gain delay by all honorable means and leaves it doubtful whether it has even stopped at that. The liquidation relied upon took place three days after it had entered into the stipulation of obedience. The purpose to liquidate was not communicated to the Board, nor was the Board advised of the action when taken, nor until nearly four months after the petition for enforcement was filed in the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The statements that the Texas corporation has discontinued operations and that the Delaware corporation has taken over the refinery did not call for recommitment by the Circuit Court of Appeals to the Board for reconsideration of that part of its order which required that the three employees be offered reinstatement. The allegation in the application that the 'owners of the stock of Southport Petroleum Company of Delaware, were never the owners of any of the stock of the respondent herein,' does not negative either the possibility that the stock in the Delaware corporation represents but an insubstantial part of its total capitalization, with the balance and real control being held by the Texas corporation or its stockholders, or that its stock was held by straw men. A sworn statement in the answer to the Board's petition that the Delaware corporation 'is a separate and distinct entity and the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 100, 106]\n\u00a0\n stockholders in respondent have no interest, and never had any interest, directly or indirectly, in the stock ownership of the said Delaware corporation, all as set out in respondent's motion heretofore filed herein,' if it adds anything, does not add enough to negative these possibilities, for the court was not required to be satisfied with such conclusions of the petitioner.\n Implicit in the reinstatement provision of the Board's order was a condition of the continued operation by the offending employer of the refinery to the employment of which the illegally discharged employees were to be restored. 4 Such operation might have continued under the old business form or under a disguise intended to evade this provision. If there was merely a change in name or in apparent control there is no reason to grant the petitioner relief from the Board's order of reinstatement; instead there is added ground for compelling obedience. Whether there was a bona fide discontinuance and a true change of ownership-which would terminate the duty of reinstatement created by the Board's order-or merely a disguised continuance of the old employer, does not clearly appear, and accordingly is a question of fact properly to be resolved by the Board on direct resort to it, or by the court if contempt proceedings are instituted. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The additional evidence was immaterial for the further reason that the Board's order ran not only to the petitioner, but also to its 'officers, agents, successors, and assigns.' \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[315 \nU.S. 100, 107]\n\u00a0\n Granting the truth of every one of petitioner's allegations, it still is possible that the Board's order may yet be the basis-and the indispensable basis-of liability on the part of any of these persons regardless of any present incapacity of petitioner to perform, or liability on its part for failure to perform, its duty of reinstatement. Of course we do not pass on the question whether any such liability actually exists; all we hold is that there has not been a sufficient showing by the petitioner to negative the possibility which we note.\n The petitioner's allegations are immaterial with respect to the back pay provision in the Board's order for like reasons and because some liability in this respect unquestionably exists, although for a disputed period of time. And from what we have said it is apparent that the petitioner has not shown that there has been any change in its relations to the refinery such as to indicate any alteration of the Board's order in respect of its requirements that petitioner post notices at 'its Texas City, Texas, refinery', and that it desist from unfair labor practices.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 100, 108]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice REED, dissenting.\n The record does not lead me to the conclusion that petitioner has taken any improper steps to secure leave to adduce additional evidence, the matter to which the certiorari was limited by our grant. It is plain that the Circuit Court of Appeals did not act on any such ground. Neither the record on that issue nor the Government's brief or argument make any such contention. Only after evidence before the Board would it seem proper for a court to form its opinion of that question.\n So far as we now know the petitioner sold its facilities in good faith, after the entry of the Board's order and prior to its motion to remand, thus divesting itself of all interest or control over its former properties. In that situation it asked a remand to the Board to present before the Board the change of conditions because of which it asked a dismissal of the proceedings.  10(e), 49 Stat. 453. There were two literally unconditional provisions of the order which petitioner, if its allegations are true, could not meet, 2(a) and (c):\n'2. Take the following affirmative action which the Board finds will effectuate the policies of the Act:\n\n\n (a)\n Offer to William Cornish, E. D. Richey, and Earl Gooch immediate and full reinstatement to their former positions, without prejudice to their seniority and other rights and privileges;\n\n\n (c)\n Post immediately notices in conspicuous places at its Texas City, Texas, refinery stating that the respondent will cease and desist in the manner aforesaid, and maintain said notices for a period of thirty (30) consecutive days from the date of posting;'\n In its brief respondent, it seems to me, admits the correctness of petitioner's view. It says: \n\n[315 \nU.S. 100, 109]\n\u00a0\n 'In its application to adduce evidence petitioner alleged that by reason of its distribution of assets and discontinuation of business it could not reinstate any employees. Thereafter in its petition for rehearing in the court below and petition for certiorari in this Court, petitioner maintained that it could not do so unless, as it suggested, the order required it to purchase and operate another refinery or otherwise resume business. Properly construed (cf. Federal Trade Commission v. Standard Education Society, \n302 \nU.S. 112\n, 117-118 (58 S.Ct. 113, 115, 116)), the order contains no such requirement. Its purpose was to remedy petitioner's violations of the Act by restoring the status quo as it existed prior to the violations, but only to the extent possible under the circumstances existing at the time of compliance, assuming that the circumstances were not changed through any bad faith on petitioner's part. See National Labor Relations Board v. Remington Rand, Inc., 2 Cir., 97 F. 2d 195, 196-197. That the men were to be offered reinstatement 'to their former positions' is express indication that the reinstatement provision was contingent upon continued operation of the Texas City refinery. This likewise appears to have been true of paragraph 2(c) of the order requiring the posting of notices 'at its Texas City, Texas, refinery.\"\n We cannot treat this suggestion as relieving this petitioner of the threat of contempt proceedings. The statement does not consent to the amendment of the order. Bad faith may still be claimed to exist. This should be determined by the Board. Consequently, I am of the opinion that the decree below should be reversed with directions to sustain the motion for a remand unless the Board agrees to eliminate sections 2(a) and (c) of the order in line with the Board's apparent concession in its brief.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE concurs in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 1 of the Board's order required that the petitioner cease and desist from:\n'(a) Discouraging membership in Oil Workers International Union, Local No. 227, or in any other labor organization of its employees, by discharging its employees or by otherwise discriminating in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment;\n\n'(b) In any other manner interfering with, restraining, or coercing its employees in the exercise of the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, or to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, as guaranteed in Section 7 of the Act (29 U.S.C.A.  157).'\n\n We do not consider the question whether, in the rather unusual circumstances of this case, the order should be modified as being unduly broad in this respect, see National Labor Relations Board v. Express Publishing Co., \n312 \nU.S. 426\n, 61 S.Ct. 693; since this question was not considered or raised in the court below or in the petition for certiorari. Alice State Bank v.

HELVERING(1942)\nNo. 581\nArgued: Decided: March 16, 1942\n\n\n\n Messrs. Walter Slack, of San Francisco, Cal., and Thomas M. Wilkins, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Arnold Raum, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n During 1934 and 1935, the petitioner, bought and sold stocks, bonds, and commodities. In connection with the sales, he paid selling commissions to brokers, and in his books these commissions were deducted from selling price before net profit or loss was determined. In his income tax returns for 1934 and 1935, he treated the commissions \n\n[315 \nU.S. 626, 627]\n\u00a0\n similarly, not making deductions for them as ordinary and necessary business expenses. In 1939, however, in the course of proceedings before the Board of Tax Appeals,1 the petitioner asserted that he was entitled to tax refunds for the reason that his failure to make deductions for the commissions had resulted in overpayment in both years. The Board sustained his contention in part, holding that the selling commissions could properly have been deducted as ordinary and necessary business expenses, that the refund claimed for 1935 should be allowed, but that the refund claimed for 1934 was barred by the applicable statute of limitations. 41 B. T.A. 1204. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the claimed deductions for selling commissions were not permissible, and finding it unnecessary therefore to determine whether the refund claim for 1934 was timely. Cir., 119 F.2d 667. Because of a conflict in decisions of Circuit Courts of Appeal,2 we granted certiorari, \n314 \nU.S. 600\n, 62 S.Ct. 130, 86 L. Ed. --, to consider the question: Are sales commissions paid by a taxpayer engaged in the business of buying and selling securities3 deductible as ordinary and necessary expenses under Section 23(a) of the Revenue Act of 1934,4 or are they to be treated as offsets against selling \n\n[315 \nU.S. 626, 628]\n\u00a0\n price relevant only to the determination of capital losses or gains?\n In Helvering v. Winmill, \n305 \nU.S. 79\n, 59 S.Ct. 45, we held that a taxpayer who bought and sold securities could not deduct the commissions paid on his purchases as a business expense. Although the Winmill case arose under the Revenue Act of 1932, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 482 et seq., the statutory provisions and regulations there relevant are identical with those again in controversy here. And the conclusion we reached there-that a general regulation5 designating 'commissions' as one of a long list of deductible business expenses is not controlling in the face of a specific regulation pertaining to commissions on securities transactions-is equally applicable here.\n The specific regulation pertaining to securities transactions provides: 'Commissions paid in purchasing securities are a part of the cost price of such securities. Commissions paid in selling securities, when such commissions are not an ordinary and necessary business expense, are an offset against the selling price. ...'6 If there is any justification for treating sales commissions differently from purchase commissions, it must depend upon the significance of the clause 'when such commissions are not an ordinary and necessary business expense.' This clause first appeared in Treasury Regulations 77, accompanying the Revenue Act of 1932. In the income tax regulations prior to that time, it was consistently prescribed that commissions paid on purchases and sales of \n\n[315 \nU.S. 626, 629]\n\u00a0\n securities were to be treated as part of the cost or selling price and were not otherwise to be deductible. \n7\n And in Helvering v. Union Pacific Co ., \n293 \nU.S. 282, 286\n, 55 S.Ct. 165, 167, this Court expressly recognized that such commissions have been 'consistently treated ... not as items of current expense, but as additions to the cost of the property or deductions from the proceeds of sale.'\n What, then, is the significance of the qualifying clause first appearing in the Regulations of 1932, and what effect is to be given to it? Prior to the formal adoption of the Regulations of 1932, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue permitted one exception to what appears to have been an otherwise uniform practise of treating commissions on the sales of securities as mere offsets against selling price. This exception was made in the case of the dealer in securities, one who 'as a merchant buys securities and sells them to customers with a view to the gains and profits that may be derived therefrom.' 8 It reflects the view that there are practical considerations of accounting convenience which make it as difficult for such dealers in many instances to set commissions off against the proceeds of individual sales as it would be for the merchant of other wares to treat his selling expenses only as a series of subtractions from the selling price realized on particular items of his stock. 9 Incorporation of the clause 'when such commissions are not an ordinary and necessary business expense' was intended to provide formal recognition for an established business usage, based on the peculiar \n\n[315 \nU.S. 626, 630]\n\u00a0\n necessities of securities dealers, a usage to which the Commissioner had already given informal acquiescence. \n10\n For the casual buyer and seller of securities, or even for the large scale trader on his own account, as here, the practical obstacles to treating sales commissions as offsets against selling price do not exist. In this very case, for example, the taxpayer apparently found it more convenient to follow this method in keeping his own business records.\n We therefore conclude that the clause 'when such commissions are not an ordinary and necessary business expense' was intended to be and is controlling only in the case of securities dealers. \n11\n In the case of a trader on his own account where there are no compelling practical grounds for treating sales commissions as such an expense, we find no persuasive reason for distinguishing, under the statute and regulations, between sales commissions like those before us and purchase commissions like those of the Winmill case. The judgment of the court below is accordingly affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice JACKSON took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] These proceedings had been initiated in connection with other issues, not relevant here. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] With the decision below and Commissioner v.

OF CALIFORNIA v. JOHNSON(1942)\nNo. 1125\nArgued: May 5, 1942Decided: June 1, 1942\n\n\n\n Messrs. Francis R. Kirkham and Felix T. Smith, both of San Francisco, Cal., for appellant.\n Mr. Adrian A. Kragen, of San Francisco, Cal., for appellee. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 481, 482]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The California Motor Vehicle Fuel License Tax Act1 imposes a license tax, measured by gallonage, on the privilege of distributing any motor vehicle fuel. Section 10 states that the Act is inapplicable 'to any motor vehicle fuel sold to the government of the United States or any department thereof for official use of said government.' The appellant, a 'distributor'2 within the meaning of the Act, sold gasoline to the United States Army Post Exchanges in California. The State levied a tax, and the appellant paid it under protest. The appellant then filed this suit in the Superior Court of Sacramento County seeking to recover the payment on two grounds: (1) That sales to the Exchanges were exempt from tax under Section 10; (2) that if construed and applied to require payment of the tax on such sales the Act would impose a burden upon instrumentalities or agencies of the United States contrary to the federal constitution. Holding against the appellant on both grounds, the trial court rendered judgment for the State. The Supreme Court of California affirmed. 19 Cal. 2d 104, 119 P.2d 329. Since validity of the State statute as construed was drawn in question on \n\n[316 \nU.S. 481, 483]\n\u00a0\n the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, we think the case is properly here on appeal under Section 237(a) of the Judicial Code, 28 U. S.C.A.  344(a).\n Since Section 10 of the California Act made the tax inapplicable 'to any motor vehicle fuel sold to the government of the United States or any department thereof', it was necessary for the Supreme Court of California to determine whether the language of this exemption included sales to post exchanges. If the court's construction of Section 10 of the Act had been based purely on local law, this construction would have been conclusive, and we should have to determine whether the statute so construed and applied is repugnant to the federal constitution. But in deciding that post exchanges were not 'the government of the United States or any department thereof', the court did not rely upon the law of California. On the contrary, it relied upon its determination concerning the relationship between post exchanges and the government of the United States, a relationship which is controlled by federal law. For post exchanges operate under regulations of the Secretary of War pursuant to federal authority. These regulations and the practices under them establish the relationship between the post exchange and the United States government, and together with the relevant statutory and constitutional provisions from which they derive, afford the data upon which the legal status of the post exchange may be determined. It was upon a determination of a federal question, therefore, that the Supreme Court of California rested its conclusion that, by Section 10, sales to post exchange were not exempted from the tax. Since this determination of a federal question was by a state court, we are not bound by it. We proceed to consider whether it is correct.\n On July 25, 1895, the Secretary of War, under authority of Congressional enactments3 promulgated regulations \n\n[316 \nU.S. 481, 484]\n\u00a0\n providing for the establishment of post exchanges. \n4\n These regulations have since been amended from time to time and the exchange has become a regular feature of Army posts. That the establishment and control of post exchanges have been in accordance with regulations rather than specific statutory directions does not alter their status, for authorized War Department regulations have the force of law. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Congressional recognition that the activities of post exchanges are governmental has been frequent. Since 1903,6 Congress has repeatedly made substantial appropriations to be expended under the direction of the Secretary of War for construction, equipment, and maintenance of suitable buildings for post exchanges. In 1933 and 1934, Congress ordered certain moneys derived from disbanded exchanges to be handed over to the Federal Treasury. \n7\n And in 1936, Congress gave consent to state taxation of gasoline sold by or through post exchanges, when the gasoline was not for the exclusive use of the United States. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n The commanding officer of an Army Post, subject to the regulations and the commands of his own superior officers, has complete authority to establish and maintain an exchange. He details a post exchange officer to manage its affairs. This officer and the commanding officers of the various company units make up a council which supervises exchange activities. None of these officers receives any compensation other than his regular salary. The object of the exchanges is to provide convenient and reliable sources where soldiers can obtain their ordinary needs at \n\n[316 \nU.S. 481, 485]\n\u00a0\n the lowest possible prices. Soldiers, their families, and civilians employed on military posts here and abroad can buy at exchanges. The government assumes none of the financial obligations of the exchange. But government officers, under government regulations, handle and are responsible for all funds of the exchange which are obtained from the companies or detachments composing its membership. Profits, if any, do not go to individuals. They are used to improve the soldiers' mess, to provide various types of recreation, and in general to add to the pleasure and comfort of the troops.\n From all of this, we conclude that post exchanges as now operated are arms of the government deemed by it essential for the performance of governmental functions. They are integral parts of the War Department, share in fulfilling the duties entrusted to it, and partake of whatever immunities it may have under the constitution and federal statutes. In concluding otherwise the Supreme Court of California was in error.\n Whether the California Supreme Court would have construed the Motor Vehicle Fuel License Act as applicable to post exchanges if it had decided the issue of legal status of post exchanges in accordance with this opinion, we have no way of knowing. Hence, a determination here of the constitutionality of such an application of the Act is not called for by the state of the record. Cf. State of Minnesota v. National Tea Co., \n309 \nU.S. 551, 557\n, 60 S.Ct. 676, 679.

In a foreclosure proceeding in an Indiana state court petitioner obtained judgment November 20, 1939, ordering that the property be sold to satisfy the debt. May 25, 1940, the sheriff sold the farm to the petitioner. The respondents, who had not redeemed, filed their petition under  75 on May 28, 1940, listing the farm in their schedules.\n June 1, 1940, the sheriff executed and delivered his deed to the petitioner and, June 30, 1940, petitioner filed, in the District Court, a motion to strike the farm from the schedules on the ground that, at the date of the petition, the respondents had no right or equity in the property as the period of redemption provided by State law expired at the time of the sheriff's sale. The court granted the motion and struck the property from the schedules. The Circuit Court of Appeals, by a divided court, reversed the judgment. 7 Cir., 124 F.2d 701.\n Section 75, sub. n, so far as pertinent, provides:\n'The filing of a petition ... praying for relief under this section, shall immediately subject the farmer and all his property, wherever located, for all the purposes of this section, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court, including all real or personal property, or any equity or right in any such property, including, among others ... the right or the equity of redemption where the period of redemption has not or had not expired, or where a deed of trust has been given as security, or where the sale has not or had not been confirmed, or where deed had not been delivered, at the time of filing the petition.\n\n'In all cases where, at the time of filing the petition, the period of redemption has not or had not expired, or where the right under a deed of trust has not or had not become absolute, or where the sale has not or had not been \n\n[317 \nU.S. 135, 137]\n\u00a0\n confirmed, or where deed had not been delivered, the period of redemption shall be extended or the confirmation of sale withheld for the period necessary for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this section.'\n\n The applicable statute of Indiana is Chapter 90 of the Acts of 1931.4 Although this statute appears not to have been construed by the State courts, it seems plain that under its provisions a sale in foreclosure can not be had until one year after the institution of the proceedings and that a sale, then made, cuts off all equity of redemption. The court below so conceded.\n The question then is, should  75, sub. n, be so read that, although the debtor has no interest or equity in the land which has been sold, and is at most a trustee of the bare legal title, the land is to be drawn into the bankruptcy if the sheriff has not delivered his deed at the date of the initiation of the proceedings. The respondents insist that the section literally so provides and should be given effect accordingly. The petitioner replies that the fair meaning of the section as a whole is that only if the debtor still retains an equity of redemption does the land come under the bankruptcy jurisdiction. It adds that if the language be of doubtful import the legislative history fully supports the construction for which it contends. We hold with the petitioner.\n Section 75, sub. n, after declaring that all the debtor's property shall come under the exclusive jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court, adds that any equity or right in such property shall be within the court's jurisdiction. It then attempts to detail such rights, by a clause opening with the phrase 'including, among others, ... the right or the equity of redemption where the period of redemption has not or had not expired, .... ' This language would seem adequate to vest in the trustee any unexpired equity of redemption and furnish the basis for dealing with the \n\n[317 \nU.S. 135, 138]\n\u00a0\n property subject to such equity of redemption. Apparently out of an excess of caution the sentence then proceeds to catalog certain instances where, under state law, some act or thing has not occurred whose occurrence is essential to the termination of the equity of redemption. Thus the section proceeds 'or where a deed of trust has been given as security, or where the sale has not or had not been confirmed, or where deed had not been delivered, at the time of filing the petition.' It is, of course, common knowledge that, in various states, one or other of the events mentioned is necessary finally to cut off the equity of redemption.\n The second paragraph of the section merely extends the period of redemption in cases where, at the time of filing the petition, the period of redemption has not or had not expired. Here again, however, in an excess of caution, the statute provides, after mentioning the expiration of the period of redemption, 'or where the right under a deed of trust has not or had not become absolute, or where the sale has not or had not been confirmed, or where deed had not been delivered, the period of redemption shall be extended ....' It seems clear that if no right of redemption exists there can be no period of redemption to extend.\n A fair reading of the entire section indicates a clear intent to extend the bankruptcy jurisdiction over all property which still remains subject to redemption under state law at the time of filing the petition. The section does not evidence any intent on the part of Congress to bring back into the bankruptcy proceeding property which was once owned by the bankrupt and as to which his ownership and interest has been extinguished, unless such intent can be drawn from the provisions qualifying the general words of the section. We think that if Congress intended that a bankruptcy might reach back into the past and bring under the court's jurisdiction a former interest in \n\n[317 \nU.S. 135, 139]\n\u00a0\n property, which, under state law, had irrevocably passed to a third person, it would have so stated in terms too clear to leave any doubt.\n If it be conceded that the construction of the section is doubtful, the legislative history is overwhelmingly in support of the view we have stated.\n Subsection n as originally enacted5 provided that the filing of a petition under  75 'shall subject the farmer and his property, wherever located, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court.' In administering this section the federal courts held diverse views as to their power to deal with the equity of redemption of a mortgagor after foreclosure. \n6\n When Congress came to amend the Act to meet the decision of this court in Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, \n295 \nU.S. 555\n, 55 S.Ct. 854, 97 A.L.R. 1106, it had in mind the fact that in many states a deed of trust is used as a method of giving real estate security for loans whereunder the trustee may make a sale; that in some states the equity of redemption exists until a deed has been delivered; that in others it expires with the actual sale under foreclosure; that in others it expires when the sale has been confirmed by the court and that in some, although all of these acts have been performed, the debtor has a right to relief during a specified period after confirmation of sale, delivery of deed and entry into possession by the purchaser. \n7\n The Committee Reports in the House and Senate8 with respect to the proposed amendment evince a purpose to amend the existing law so as to render it clear that, whatever the right of redemption under state law, the bankrupt and his estate were to have the benefit of that right. Referring, \n\n[317 \nU.S. 135, 140]\n\u00a0\n inter alia, to the amendments to subsection n, the House report states:\n'These other amendments are largely clarification, and have become necessary because of the diverse rulings and holdings of the various United States district courts in the construction of section 75. Some of these courts have held that the farmer debtor could not take advantage of the act after foreclosure sale, and during the period of redemption. Some of these courts have refused to permit the farmer in that position to file his petition, although under the law of his State he was in possession, entitled to rents and profits, and in full control of the property and could redeem it within the period allowed.\n\n'Again, other courts have held that the farmer could not take advantage of the act during the period of moratorium established by a State, while others have held that the debtor could not take advantage of the act after sale, but prior to confirmation, although in all of these cases if the debtor had the money, and were in a position to pay, he could redeem, and save the property.\n\n'It is clear that these courts are reasoning too technically, and have failed to carry out the intention of Congress, which was to protect the farmer's home and property, and at the same time to protect the creditor. On the other hand, other courts have held just the opposite, and have given full protection, and carried out the intent of Congress. Under this condition, we think it is admitted by all that there should be uniformity.'\n\n The language of the Senate Report goes into somewhat more detail but is of the same purport. When the amendments were before the Senate, Senator Borah, a member of the Committee, explained them to the Senate in the following language:9\n'In the first place, however, it ought to be said that we undertook to make some amendments in section 75 before \n\n[317 \nU.S. 135, 141]\n\u00a0\n we got to subsection (s). These amendments are for the purpose of clarifying section 75. Some of the courts have held that the farmer debtor could not take advantage of the act after foreclosure sale and during the period of redemption. The bill undertakes to clarify it so as to permit the farmer to take advantage of section 75 after foreclosure and during the period of redemption.\n\n'Some of the courts also refused to permit the farmer who was in that position to file his petition, although under the law of the State he was in possession and full control of the property and could redeem it during the period of moratorium established by the States. One of the amendments to section 75 takes care of that objection which was raised by the court.\n\n'Amended subsection (s) construes, interprets, and clarifies both subsections (n) and (o) of section 75. By reading subsections (n) and (o) as now enacted, it becomes clear that it was the intention of Congress, when it passed section 75, that the debtor and all of his property should come under the jurisdiction of the court of bankruptcy, and that the benefits of the act should extend to the farmer prior to confirmation of sale and during the period of redemption. In other words, the amendments provide that the farmer may avail himself of the act after foreclosure and during the period of redemption, and may also avail himself of the act during the period of the moratorium provided for him within the State.'\n\n The law of Indiana gives the debtor a year from the institution of foreclosure suit within which to redeem and terminates his right and interest in the property at the sale. The delivery of a deed by the sheriff, therefore, becomes a ministerial act which he can be compelled to perform. \n10\n Such delivery constitutes mere record evi- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 135, 142]\n\u00a0\n dence of the purchaser's title which is perfect from the date of sale. As the sale cut off all rights of the debtor  75, sub. n does not bring the property within the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.\n The petitioner urges that the construction given the section by the court below would render it unconstitutional. The view we take of the meaning of the statute makes it unnecessary to consider this contention.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court is affirmed.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY, dissenting.\n Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and I cannot agree with the opinion of the Court. Section 75, sub. n, 11 U.S.C.A.  203, sub. n, subjects to the exclusive jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court all property in which the petitioning farmer-debtor has any equity or right 'including, among others ... the right or the equity of redemption where the period of redemption has not or had not expired, ... or where deed had not been delivered, at the time of filing the petition'. Conceding that respondents' equity of redemption was cut off under Indiana law prior to the filing of their petition, the deed had not been delivered at the time of filing. Respondents thus come within the exact terms of  75, sub. n, and the property should not have been struck from their schedules.\n We have said that doubts in  75 are to be settled in the debtor's favor, and that it 'must be liberally construed to give the debtor the full measure of the relief afforded by Congress, ... lest its benefits be frittered away by narrow formalistic interpretations which disregard the spirit and the letter of the Act.' Wright v. Union Central Life Ins. Co., \n311 \nU.S. 273, 279\n, 61 S.Ct. 196, 200. But we are now told that the spirit and the letter of  75, sub. n, especially the phrase, 'or where deed had not been delivered', may be disregarded upon a \n\n[317 \nU.S. 135, 143]\n\u00a0\n 'fair reading of the entire section' and a consideration of its legislative history, both of which, it is claimed, disclose that Congress did not intend the benefits of  75 to extend beyond the expiration of the equity of redemption by force of state law, the above-quoted phrase being added, 'apparently out of an excess of caution,' to provide for those states in which the equity of redemption survives until the delivery of a deed. It Congress so intended, its words were poorly chosen. Congress could easily have declared that bankruptcy jurisdiction does not survive the extinguishment of the equity of redemption under state law, whether that extinguishment is accomplished by sale, confirmation, or the delivery of a deed. Instead Congress used the disjunctive 'or'. That Congress did not so intend is clear from the legislative history of the Act. The true Congressional purpose was 'to protect the farmer's home and property, and at the same time to protect the creditor'.1 This purpose is best achieved by giving effect to the precise words of  75, sub. n. The farmer is given a chance to rehabilitate himself so long as he has any vestige of a right in the property, call it 'bare legal title' or what you will. The creditor is protected because the value of the property remains, under adequate safeguards provided by the Act, as security for the debt. 'There is no constitutional claim of the creditor to more than that.' Wright v. Union Central Life Ins. Co., \n311 \nU.S. 273, 278\n, 61 S.Ct. 196, 200. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 11 U.S.C.  203, 11 U.S.C.A.  203, sub. n. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 7 Cir., 124 F.2d 701. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Glenn v.

EVANS(1942)\nNo. 872\nArgued: April 14, 1942Decided: April 27, 1942\n\n\n\n\n[316 \nU.S. 159, 160]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Ellis G. Arnall, Atty. Gen., of Atlanta, Ga., for petitioner.\n Mr. Edwin W. Moise, of Atlanta, Ga., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Complaining that the respondents had combined to fix prices and suppress competition in the sale of asphalt in violation of the Sherman Law, the State of Georgia, which each year purchases large quantities of asphalt for use in the construction of public roads, brought this suit to recover treble damages under  7 of that Act, 26 Stat. 209, 210, 15 U.S.C .  15, 15 U.S.C.A.  15. According to that section, 'Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by any other person or corporation by reason of anything forbidden or declared to be unlawful by this act, may sue therefor in any district court of the United States ..., and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained ....' Section 8 provides that 'the word 'person', or 'persons', wherever used in this act ( sections 1-7 and 15 of this title) shall be deemed to include corporations and associations existing under the authorized by the laws of either the United States, the laws of any of the Territories, the laws of any State, or the laws of any foreign country.' 26 Stat. 209, 210, 15 U.S.C.  7, 15 U.S.C.A.  7. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 159, 161]\n\u00a0\n The District Court dismissed the suit on the ground that the State of Georgia is not a 'person' under  7 of the Act. Deeming the question controlled by United States v. Cooper Corp., \n312 \nU.S. 600\n, 61 S.Ct. 742, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the judgment. 123 F.2d 57. The importance of the question in the enforcement of the Sherman Law is attested by the fact that thirty-four states, as friends of the Court, supported Georgia's request that the decision be reviewed on certiorari. And so we brought the case here. \n315 \nU.S. 792\n, 62 S.Ct. 796, 86 L.Ed. --.\n The only question in the Cooper case was 'whether, by the use of the phrase 'any person', Congress intended to confer upon the United States the right to maintain an action for treble damages against a violator of the Act.' 312 U.S. at page 604, 61 S.Ct. at page 743. Emphasizing that the United States had chosen for itself three potent weapons for enforcing the Act, namely, criminal prosecution under  1, 2, and 3, injunction under  4, and seizure of property under  6, 15 U.S.C.A .  1-4, 6, the Court concluded that Congress did not also give the United States the remedy of a civil action for damages. This interpretation was drawn from the structure of the Act, its legislative history, the practice under it, and past judicial expressions. It was not held that the word 'person', abstractly considered, could not include a governmental body. Whether the word 'person' or 'corporation' includes a State or the United States depends upon its legislative environment. State of Ohio v. Helvering, \n292 \nU.S. 360, 370\n, 54 S.Ct. 725, 727. The Cooper case recognized that 'there is no hard and fast rule of exclusion. The purpose, the subject matter, the context, the legislative history, and the executive interpretation of the statute are aids to construction which may indicate an intent, by the use of the term, to bring state or nation within the scope of the law.' 312 U.S. at pages 604, 605, 61 S.Ct. at page 743. Considering all these factors, the Court found that Congress did not give to the Government, in addition to the other remedies ex- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 159, 162]\n\u00a0\n clusively provided for it, the remedy of treble damages-the only remedy originally given to victims other than the Government of practices proscribed by the Act.\n The considerations which led to this construction are entirely lacking here. The State of Georgia, unlike the United States, cannot prosecute violations of the Sherman Law. \n1\n Nor can it seize property transported in definance of it. And an amendment was necessary to permit suit for an injunction by others than the United States. See State of Minnesota v. Northern Securities Co., \n194 \nU.S. 48, 70\n, 71 S., 24 S.Ct. 598, 604, and Act of October 15, 1914, c. 323,  16, 38 Stat. 730, 737, 15 U.S.C.A.  26. If the State is not a 'person' within  8, the Sherman Law leaves it without any redress for injuries resulting from practices outlawed by that Act.\n The question now before us, therefore, is whether no remedy whatever is open to a State when it is the immediate victim of a violation of the Sherman Law. We can perceive no reason for believing that Congress wanted to deprive a State, as purchaser of commodities shipped in interstate commerce, of the civil remedy of treble damages which is available to other purchasers who suffer through violation of the Act. We have already held that such a remedy is afforded to a subdivision of the State, a municipality, which purchases pipes for use in constructing a waterworks system. Chattanooga Foundry v. City of Atlanta, \n203 \nU.S. 390\n, 27 S.Ct. 65. Reason balks against implying denial of such a remedy to a State which purchases materials for use in building public highways. Nothing in the Act, its history, or its policy, could justify so restrictive a construction of the word 'person' in  7 as to exclude a State. Such a construction would deny all redress to \n\n[316 \nU.S. 159, 163]\n\u00a0\n a State, when mulcted by a violator of the Sherman Law, merely because it is a State. \n2\n\u00a0\n\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice BLACK concurs in the result.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n I agree that this case is not ruled by our decision in United States v. Cooper Corp., \n312 \nU.S. 600\n, 61 S.Ct. 742. Certain of the reasons adduced in support of that decision are inapplicable here. I am, nevertheless, of opinion that the judgment should be affirmed. I base this conclusion upon the plain words of the Sherman Act. Section 7 provides that 'any person who shall be injured in his business or property by any other person', by any action forbidden by the statute, may sue and recover damages therefor. Section 8 provides that the word 'person' or 'persons', wherever used in the Act, 'shall be deemed to include corporations and associations existing under or authorized by the laws of either the United States, the laws of any of the Territories, the laws of any State, of the laws of any foreign country.'\n If the word 'person' is to include a state as plaintiff, it must equally include a state as a defendant or the language used is meaningless. Moreover, when in  8 Congress took the trouble to include as 'persons' corporations organized under the laws of a state, the inference is plain that the state itself was not to be deemed a corporation organized under its own laws any more than the United \n\n[316 \nU.S. 159, 164]\n\u00a0\n States is to be deemed a corporation organized under its own laws.\n It is not our function to speculate as to what Congress probably intended by the words it used or to enforce the supposed policy of the Act by adding a provision which Congress might have incorporated but omitted. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In 1914 Congress rejected an amendment to authorize the Attorney General of any State to institute a criminal proceeding, in the name of the United States, to enforce the anti-trust laws. 51 Cong.Rec. 14519, 14527. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] We put to one side the suggestion that if the Sherman Law gives a State a right of action, Article III of the Constitution would give this Court original jurisdiction of such a suit if a State saw fit to pursue its remedy here. If the district courts are given jurisdiction, a State may bring suit there even though under Article III suit might be brought here. United States v. State of California, \n297 \nU.S. 175, 187\n, 56 S.Ct. 421, 425. \n\n\n\n\n","119":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE TAX COMMISSION OF UTAH v. ALDRICH(1942)\nNo. 814\nArgued: March 12, 1942Decided: April 27, 1942\n\n\n\n Messrs. J. Lambert Gibson and Garfield O. Anderson, both of Salt Lake City, Utah, for petitioner.\n Mr. Melber Chambers, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The sole question presented by this case is whether the State of Utah is precluded by the Fourteenth Amendment from imposing a tax upon a transfer by death of shares of stock in a Utah corporation, forming part of the estate of a decedent who, at the time of his death, was domiciled in the State of New York and held there the certificates representing those shares.\n In 1940 Edward S. Harkness died testate, being at that time domiciled in New York. His estate was probated \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 175]\n\u00a0\n in New York where respondents were appointed executors. Respondents were also appointed administrators with the will annexed in Utah. At the time of his death Harkness was the owner of 10,000 shares of common stock and 400 shares of preferred stock of the Union Pacific Railroad Co., a Utah corporation. The certificates representing those shares were never within Utah. They were in the possession of Harkness in New York at the time of his death and are now held by respondents. For many years the Union Pacific Railroad Co. has kept its stock books and records and transfer agents in New York and has not maintained any in Utah. These shares are the only property owned by decedent which is claimed to be within the jurisdiction of Utah. At the date of decedent's death a New York statute allowed as a credit against the estate tax imposed by New York the amount of any constitutionally valid estate or inheritance tax paid to any other state within three years after the decedent's death. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Respondents sought a declaratory judgment in the Utah court holding that the transfer of the shares was not subject to tax by Utah under the provisions of its inheritance tax law. \n2\n The trial court entered judgment for respond- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 176]\n\u00a0\n ents. The Supreme Court of Utah, under the compulsion of First National Bank of Boston v. State of Maine, \n284 \nU.S. 312\n, 52 S.Ct. 174, 77 A.L.R. 1401, affirmed Aldrich v. State Tax Comm., Utah, 116 P.2d 923. We granted the petition for certiorari so that the constitutional basis of First National Bank of Boston v. State of Maine could be reexamined in the light of such recent decisions as Curry v. McCanless, \n307 \nU.S. 357\n, 59 S. Ct. 900, 123 A.L.R. 162, and Graves v. Elliott, \n307 \nU.S. 383\n, 59 S.Ct. 913. And see Commonwealth v. Stewart, 338 Pa. 9, 12 A.2d 444, affirmed \n312 \nU.S. 649\n, 61 S.Ct. 445\n\n\n There can be no doubt but that the judgment below should be affirmed if First National Bank of Boston v. State of Maine is to survive, as the judgment in that case prohibited the State of Maine from doing what the State of Utah is here attempting. But we do not think it should survive. And certainly it cannot if the principles which govern the Curry and Graves cases rest on firm constitutional grounds.\n First National Bank of Boston v. State of Maine, like its forerunners Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. State of Minnesota, \n280 \nU.S. 204\n, 50 S.Ct. 98, 65 A.L.R. 1000, and Baldwin v. State of Missouri, \n281 \nU.S. 586\n, 50 S.Ct. 436, 72 A.L.R. 1303, read into the Fourteenth Amendment a 'rule of immunity from taxation by more than one state.' 284 U. S. page 326, 52 S.Ct. page 176, 77 A.L.R. 1401. As we said in the Curry case that doctrine is of recent origin. Prior to 1930, when Blackstone v. Miller, \n188 \nU.S. 189\n, 23 S.Ct. 277, was overruled by Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. State of Minnesota, the adjudications of this Court clearly demanded a result opposite from that which obtained in First National Bank of Boston v. State of Maine. That was recognized by the majority in the latter case (284 U.S. page 321, 52 S. Ct. 174, 77 A.L.R. 1401)-and properly so because Blackstone v. Miller rejected the notion that there were constitutional objec- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 177]\n\u00a0\n tions to double taxation of intangibles by States which had command over them or their owner. And see Kidd v. State of Alabama, \n188 \nU.S. 730, 732\n, 23 S.Ct. 401, 402. Blackstone v. Miller permitted New York to tax the transfer of debts owed by New York citizens to a decedent who died domiciled in Illinois, although Illinois had taxed the entire succession. Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for the Court, upheld the power of New York to collect the tax because the transfer of the debts 'necessarily depends upon and involves the law of New York for its exercise'. 188 U.S. page 205, 23 S.Ct. page 278. It was that view which the minority in First National Bank of Boston v. State of Maine championed. They maintained that there was no constitutional barrier to taxation by Maine of the transfer of the shares of stock of the Maine corporation, since the nature and extent of the decedent's interest in the shares were 'defined by the laws of Maine, and his power to secure the complete transfer' was 'dependent upon them'. 284 U.S. page 332, 52 S.Ct. page 179, 77 A.L.R. 1401. That view had been repeatedly expressed in other earlier cases touching on the rights of a State to tax intangibles over which it had command though the owner was a non-resident. Tappan v. Merchants' Nat. Bank, 19 Wall. 490, 503, 504; Hawley v. City of Malden, \n232 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 34 S.Ct. 201, Ann. Cas.1916C, 842; Baker v. Baker, Eccles & Co., \n242 \nU.S. 394, 401\n, 37 S.Ct. 152; Frick v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, \n268 \nU.S. 473, 497\n, 45 S.Ct. 603, 42 A.L.R. 316; Rhode Island Hospital Trust Co. v. Doughton, \n270 \nU.S. 69, 81\n, 46 S.Ct. 256, 258, 43 A.L.R. 1374. As stated by Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 429, the power to tax 'is an incident of sovereignty, and is co-extensive with that to which it is an incident. All subjects over which the sovereign power of a state extends, are objects of taxation ....'\n It was that view which we followed in the Curry case. We held there that the Fourteenth Amendment did not prevent both Alabama and Tennessee from imposing death taxes upon the transfer of an interest in intangibles held in trust by an Alabama trustee but passing under the will of a beneficiary decedent domiciled in Tennessee. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 178]\n\u00a0\n We stated that rights to intangibles 'are but relationships between persons, natural or corporate, which the law recognizes by attaching to them certain sanctions enforceable in courts. The power of government over them and the protection which it gives them cannot be exerted through control of a physical thing. They can be made effective only through control over and protection afforded to those persons whose relationships are the origin of the rights. ... Obviously, as sources of actual or potential wealth-which is an appropriate measure of any tax imposed on ownership or its exercise-they cannot be dissociated from the persons from whose relationships they are derived. These are not in any sense fictions. They are indisputable realities.' 307 U.S. page 366, 59 S.Ct. page 905, 123 A.L.R. 162. We held that the power to tax intangibles was not restricted to one State whether 'we regard the right of a state to tax as founded on power over the object taxed, as declared by Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland, supra, through dominion over tangibles or over persons whose relationships are the source of intangible rights; or on the benefit and protection conferred by the taxing sovereignty, or both'. 307 U.S. pages 367, 368, 59 S.Ct. page 906, 123 A.L. R. 162. And we added: 'Shares of corporate stock may be taxed at the domicile of the shareholder and also at that of the corporation which the taxing state has created and controls; and income may be taxed both by the state where it is earned and by the state of the recipient's domicile. Protection, benefit, and power over the subject matter are not confined to either state.' 307 U.S. page 368, 59 S.Ct. page 906, 123 A. L.R. 162. In the recent case of State of Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., \n311 \nU.S. 435, 444\n, 61 S.Ct. 246, 249, 130 A.L.R. 1229, we gave renewed expression to the same view: 'A state is free to pursue its own fiscal policies, unembarrassed by the Constitution, if by the practical operation of a tax the state has exerted its power in relation to opportunities which it has given, to protection which it has afforded, to benefits which it has \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 179]\n\u00a0\n conferred by the fact of being an orderly, civilized society.' And see Graves v. Schmidlapp, \n315 \nU.S. 657\n, 62 S.Ct. 870, 86 L.Ed. --, decided March 30, 1942.\n Furthermore, the rule of immunity against double taxation espoused by First National Bank of Boston v. State of Maine had long been rejected in other cases. Kidd v. State of Alabama, supra; Fort Smith Lumber Co. v. State of Arkansas, \n251 \nU.S. 532\n, 40 S.Ct. 304; Cream of Wheat Co. v. Grand Forks, \n253 \nU.S. 325\n, 40 S.Ct. 558. We rejected it again only recently. Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. State of Minnesota, \n309 \nU.S. 157\n, 60 S.Ct. 419. And as we pointed out in the Curry case the reasons why the Fifth Amendment 'does not require us to fix a single exclusive place of taxation of intangibles for the benefit of their foreign owner' (Burnet v. Brooks, \n288 \nU.S. 378\n, 53 S.Ct. 457, 86 A.L.R. 747) are no less cogent in case of the Fourteenth. 307 U.S. pages 369, 370, 59 S.Ct. page 907, 123 A.L.R. 162.\n The recent cases to which we have alluded are all distinguishable on their facts. But their guiding principles are irreconcilable with the views expressed in First National Bank of Boston v. State of Maine. If we raised a constitutional barrier in this case after having let it down in the Curry case, we would indeed be drawing neat legal distinctions and refinements which certainly cannot be divined from the language of the Constitution. Certainly any differences between the shares of stock in this case and the intangibles in the Curry case do not warrant differences in constitutional treatment so as to forbid taxation by two States in the one case and to permit it in the other. If we perpetuated any such differences, we would be doing violence to the words 'due process' by drawing lines where the Fourteenth Amendment fails to draw them. Furthermore, the legal interests in the intangibles here involved are as diverse as they were in the intangibles in the Curry case. And to say that these shares of stock were localized or had an exclusive situs in New York would be to indulge in the fiction which we rejected in the Curry case. Any such attempt to fix their \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 180]\n\u00a0\n whereabouts in New York would disregard the intimate relationship which Utah has to this corporation and its shares.\n More specifically, if the question is 'whether the state has given anything for which it can ask return' (State of Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., supra, 311 U.S. page 444, 61 S.Ct. page 250, 130 A.L.R. 1229) or whether the transfer depends upon and involves the law of Utah for its exercise (Blackstone v. Miller) there can be no doubt that Utah is not restrained by the Fourteenth Amendment from taxing this transfer. The corporation owes its existence to Utah. Utah law defines the nature and extent of the interest of the shareholders in the corporation. Utah law affords protection for those rights. Utah has power over the transfer by the corporation of its shares of stock. Certainly that protection, benefit, and power over the shares would have satisfied the test of Blackstone v. Miller and Curry v. McCanless. But it is said that we are here interested only in the factum of the transfer and that the stockholder in the case at bar had no need to invoke the law of Utah to effect a complete transfer of his interest. The argument is based on the fact that the transfer office is located outside Utah and that under the Uniform Stock Transfer Act which Utah has adopted (Rev.Stat. 1933,  18-3-1 et seq.) the trend is to treat the shares as merged into the certificates in situations involving the ownership and transfer of the shares. We do not stop to analyze the many cases which have been cited nor to speculate as to how Utah would interpret its law in this regard. Suffice it to say that if that freedom of transfer exists as respondents claim, it stems from Utah law. It finds its ultimate source in the authority which Utah has granted. It is indeed a benefit which Utah has bestowed. For it alone Utah may constitutionally ask a return. In view of these realities we cannot say with the majority in First National Bank of Boston v. State of Maine, 284 U.S. page 327, 52 S.Ct. page 177, 77 A.L.R. 1401, that a 'transfer from the dead to the living of any specific property is an event \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 181]\n\u00a0\n single in character and is effected under the laws, and occurs within the limits, of a particular state', so as to preclude Utah from imposing a tax on this transfer.\n We are of course not unmindful of the notions expressed in Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. State of Minnesota and repeated in First National Bank of Boston v. State of Maine that the view championed by Blackstone v. Miller disturbed the 'good relations among the states' and had a 'bad' practical effect which led many States 'to avoid the evil by resort to reciprocal exemption laws.' 280 U.S. page 209, 50 S.Ct. page 99, 65 A.L.R. 1000. But as stated by the minority in First National Bank of Boston v. State of Maine, 'We can have no assurance that resort to the Fourteenth Amendment, as the ill-adapted instrument of such a reform, will not create more difficulties and injustices than it will remove.' 284 U.S. page 334, 52 S.Ct. page 179, 77 A.L.R. 1401. More basically, even though we believed that a different system should be designed to protect against multiple taxation, it is not our province to provide it. See Curry v. McCanless, supra, 307 U.S. pages 373, 374, 59 S.Ct. page 909, 123 A.L.R. 162. To do so would be to indulge in the dangerous assumption that the Fourteenth Amendment 'was intended to give us carte blanche to embody our economic or moral beliefs in its prohibitions.' Mr. Justice Holmes, dissenting, Baldwin v. State of Missouri, supra, 281 U.S. page 595, 50 S.Ct. page 439, 72 A. L.R. 1303. It would violate the first principles of constitutional adjudication to strike down state legislation on the basis of our individual views or preferences as to policy, whether the state laws deal with taxes or other subjects of social or economic legislation.\n For the reasons stated we do not think that First National Bank of Boston v. State of Maine should survive. We overrule it. In line with our recent decisions in Curry v. McCanless, Graves v. Elliott and Graves v. Schmidlapp we repeat that there is no constitutional rule of immunity from taxation of intangibles by more than one State. In case of shares of stock 'jurisdiction to tax' is not restricted to the domiciliary State. Another State which has extended benefits \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 182]\n\u00a0\n or protection or which can demonstrate 'the practical fact of its power' or sovereignty as respects the shares (Blackstone v. Miller, 188 U.S. page 205, 23 S.Ct. page 278) may likewise constitutionally make its exaction. In other words, we restore these intangibles to the constitutional status which they occupied up to a few years ago. See Greves v. Shaw, 173 Mass. 205, 53 N.E. 372; Larson v. MacMiller, 56 Utah 84, 189 P. 579; and cases collected in 42 A.L.R. page 365 et seq.\n We reverse the judgment below and remand the cause to the Supreme Court of Utah for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, concurring.\n A case of this kind recalls us to first principles.\n The taxing power is an incident of government. It does not derive from technical legal concepts. The power to tax is coextensive with the fundamental power of society over the persons and things made subject to tax. Each State of the Union has the same taxing power as an independent government, except insofar as that power has been curtailed by the federal Constitution.\n The taxing power of the States was limited by the Constitution and the original ten amendments in only three respects: (1) no State can, without the consent of Congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports, except as necessary for executing its inspection laws, Art. I, Sec. 10, Cl. (2); (2) no State can, without the consent of Congress, lay any tonnage duties, Art. I, Sec. 10, Cl. 3; and (3) by virtue of the Commerce Clause, Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 3, no State can tax so as to discriminate against interstate commerce. (For present purposes I put the Contract Clause to one side). None of these limitations touches the power of a State to create corporations and the incidental power to tax opportunities which such State-created corporations afford. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 183]\n\u00a0\n This phase of the taxing power, rooted in the established practices of the States in common with other governments, was not suddenly abrogated on July 28, 1868, when the Fourteenth Amendment became the law of the land. On the contrary, taxes based on the States' power over corporations of their own creation thereafter became an increasingly familiar source of revenue. Of course, the Due Process Clause has its application to the taxing powers of the States-a State cannot tax a stranger for something that it has not given him. When a State gives nothing in return for exacting a tax it may be said that there is no 'jurisdiction to tax'. But that phrase obscures rather than enlightens, for it only states a result and does not analyze the Constitutional problem. The right of a State to tax the effective acquisition of membership in a domestic corporation, wherever the piece of paper representing such a taxable interest may be physically located,-the immediate question before us-was not doubted until the decision of this Court only ten years ago in First National Bank of Boston v. State of Maine, \n284 \nU.S. 312\n, 52 S.Ct. 174, 77 A.L. R. 1401. That decision, as was made clear in its dissent, was an unwarranted deviation from unbroken legal history and fiscal practice. Drawn as the decision was 'from the void of 'due process of law' when logic, tradition and authority have united to declare the right of the State to lay' such a tax (Holmes, J., dissenting in Baldwin v. State of Missouri, \n281 \nU.S. 586, 596\n, 50 S.Ct. 436, 439, 72 A.L.R. 1303), due regard for the Constitution demands that the deviation be not perpetuated and that the power erroneously withdrawn from the States be again recognized.\n Modern enterprise often brings different parts of an organic commercial transaction within the taxing power of more than one State, as well as of the nation. It does so because the transaction in its entirety may receive the benefits of more than one government. And the exercise by the States of their Constitutional power to tax may \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 184]\n\u00a0\n undoubtedly produce difficult political and fiscal problems. But they are inherent in the nature of our federalism and are part of its price. These difficulties are not peculiar to us. Kindred problems have troubled other constitutional federalisms. For Australia, see Report of the Royal Commission on the Constitution, Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia (1929), p. 187 et seq.; for Canada, see 1 Report of the Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations (1940) p. 202 et seq.\n'A good deal has to be read into the Fourteenth Amendment to give it any bearing upon this case.' Holmes, J., dissenting in Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. State of Minnesota, \n280 \nU.S. 204, 218\n, 50 S.Ct. 98, 103, 65 A.L.R. 1000. We would have to read into that Amendment private notions as to tax policy. But whether a tax is wise or expedient is the business of the political branches of government, not ours. Considerations relevant to invalidation of a tax measure are wholly different from those that come into play in justifying disapproval of a tax on the score of political or financial unwisdom.\n\n It may well be that the last word has not been aid by the various devices now available-through uniform and reciprocal legislation, through action by the States under the Compact Clause, Art. I, Sec. 10, Cl. 3, or through whatever other means statesmen may devise-for distributing wisely the total national income for governmental purposes as between the States and the Nation. But even if it were possible to make the needed adjustments in the fiscal relations of the States to one another and to the federal government through the process of episodic litigation-which to me seems most illadapted for devising fiscal policies-it is enough that our Constitutional system denies such a function to this Court.\n I agree, therefore, that First National Bank of Boston v. State of Maine should be overruled and that the tax imposed by Utah \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 185]\n\u00a0\n in this case is valid. To refuse to nullify legislation the frailties of which we think we see, is to respect the bounds of our Constitutional authority and not to indulge in a fiction. See James Bradley Thayer, The Origin and Scope of the American Doctrine of Constitutional Law, 7 Harv.L. Rev. 129. To allow laws to stand is to allow laws to be made by those whose task it is to legislate. The nullification of legislation on Constitutional grounds has been recognized from the beginning as a most 'delicate' function not to be indulged in by this Court simply because it has formal power to do so but only when compelling considerations leave no other choice. To suggest that when this Court finds that a law is not offensive to the Constitution and that it must therefore stand, we make the same kind of judgment as when on rare occasions we find that a law is offensive to the Constitution and must therefore fall, is to disregard the role of this Court in our Constitutional system since its establishment in 1789.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON, dissenting.\n State taxation of transfer by death of intangible property is in something of a jurisdictional snarl, to the solution of which this Court owes all that it has of wisdom and power. The theoretical basis of some decisions in the very practical matter of taxation is not particularly satisfying. \n1\n But a switch of abstract concepts is hardly to be expected without at least careful consideration of its impact on the very practical and concrete problems of states and taxpayers. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 186]\n\u00a0\n Weighing the highly doctrinaire reasons advanced for this decision against its practical effects on our economy and upon our whole constitutional law of state taxation, I can see nothing in the Court's decision more useful than the proverbial leap from the frying pan into the fire.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n There is little persuasion and certainly no compulsion in the authorities mustered by the Court's present opinion, which are either admittedly overruled cases, such as Blackstone v. Miller, \n188 \nU.S. 189\n, 23 S.Ct. 277, or admittedly distinguishable ones, such as Curry v. McCanless, \n307 \nU.S. 357\n, 59 S.Ct. 900, 123 A.L.R. 162; Graves v. Elliott, \n307 \nU.S. 383\n, 59 S.Ct. 913; State of Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., \n311 \nU.S. 435\n, 61 S.Ct. 246, 130 A.L.R. 1229. Such authorities are not impressive in vindication of such a judgment. Without discussion of the academic merits of the decision that is being overruled I am willing to proceed on the estimate of it made at the time of its pronouncement by the present Chief Justice, who said in his dissent: 'Situs of an intangible, for taxing purposes, as the decisions of this court, including the present one, abundantly demonstrate, is not a dominating reality, but a convenient fiction which may be judicially employed or discarded, according to the result desired.' First National Bank of Boston v. State of Maine, \n284 \nU.S. 312, 332\n, 52 S.Ct. 174, 179, 77 A.L.R. 1401.\n This older rule ascribed a fictional consequence to the domicile of a natural person; it is overruled by ascribing a fictional consequence to the domicile of an artificial corporation. The older rule emphasized dominance by the individual over his intangible property the tax situs of which followed the domicile of its owner. Today's new rule emphasizes the dominance of the corporation, a crea- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 187]\n\u00a0\n ture of the legal imagination. \n2\n To this fictional personality it ascribes a hypothetical 'domicile' in a place where it has but a fraction of its property and conducts only its formal corporate activities; and on the union of these two fictions it permits the chartering state to tax the estates of persons who never lived or did business therein. The reasoning back of the holding is this: Because Utah issued a charter to a corporation, which issued stock to a nonresident, which changed hands at his death, which required a transfer on the corporation's books, which transfer was permitted by Utah law, Utah got jurisdiction to tax succession to the stock. It is really as remote as that.\n No one questions that a state which charters a corporation, even though it amounts to no more than giving 'to airy nothing a local habitation and a name,' has the right to exact a charter fee, an incorporation tax, or a franchise tax from the artificial entity it has created. But that such chartering enables the taxing arm of the state to reach the estate of every stockholder, wherever he lives, and to tax the entire value of the stock because of 'opportunities which it has given,' 'protection which it has afforded,' or 'benefits which it has conferred' is quite another matter. Utah is permitted to tax the full value \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 188]\n\u00a0\n of each share of Union Pacific stock passing by death. Any conceivable 'opportunity,' 'protection,' or 'benefit' derived by the Union Pacific stockholders from Utah is negligible in proportion to the values Utah is authorized to tax.\n It would be hard to select a case that would better demonstrate the fictional basis of the Court's doctrine of benefits and protection than this case of Utah and the Union Pacific Railroad. When Utah was admitted to statehood in 1896, the Union Pacific Railroad was already old as a national institution. The first white settlement in Utah made by the Mormons was in its second year when President Taylor recommended to Congress consideration of a railroad to the Pacific as a 'work of great national importance and of a value to the country which it would be difficult to estimate.' \n3\n In 1853, Congress appropriated $150,000 to make explorations and surveys to 'ascertain the most practicable and economical route.' \n4\n In 1860, both the leading political parties in their platforms declared in favor of building such a road. \n5\n President Lincoln on July 1, 1862, signed6 the war measure creating the Union Pacific Railroad Company and subsidizing the construction of the road,7 which opened on \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 189]\n\u00a0\n May 10, 1869.8 The story of the Union Pacific has been a part of our national history. Not even its scandals were local. Its Credit Mobilier scandal rocked the nation. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n The road continued to be a national problem as well as a national enterprise. President Cleveland recommended to Congress in his message of December 3, 1894 consideration of reorganization. \n10\n The steps taken by the Government were reported to the Congress by President McKinley in his annual messages of 1897, 1898, and 1899. He reported the sale of the Union Pacific main line under the decree of the United States Court for the District of Nebraska on November 1 and 2, 1897,11 Utah, on July 1, 1897, granted a charter to the present Union Pacific Railroad Company, as the Federal Government or any one of several state governments might have done. It has become one of the great and stable transportation systems of the United States.\n If it had only the 'opportunities' and 'benefits' conferred by Utah and only the properties protected by her laws, the Union Pacific would cut little figure either in transportation or finance. It holds its stockholders' meetings in that State. But it maintains no executive office or stock transfer office in Utah. Its executive and stock transfer offices are in New York City. Its stocks are listed on the New York, Boston, London, and Amsterdam stock exchanges. Over 200,000 shares of its stock were traded on the New York Stock Exchange in 1939.12 Its western operating office is not in Utah, but in Omaha, Nebraska. It is stipulated that less than 9% of its 9877 miles of \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 190]\n\u00a0\n trackage are in Utah and that during 1939, the railway operating revenue from Utah intra-state business plus the Utah proportion on a mileage basis of its interstate business was 8.97% of the entire gross operating revenues of the company.\n What gives the Union Pacific stock its value, all of which is appropriated by this decision to Utah's taxing power, is its operation in interstate commerce, a privilege which comes from the United States and one which Utah does not give or protect and could not deny. The Union Pacific system itself is in interstate operation, embracing thirteen states and drawing its business from the whole country. Approximately 37% of its total tonnage was received from connecting lines. \n13\n If the values derived from privileges extended by the National Government and from rendering national transportation were to be allocated to any single state for tax purposes, a realistic basis would entitle the five States of Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska, Oregon, and Washington to some consideration, for each embraces, authorizes, and protects by its laws more miles of trackage than does Utah. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n These facts leave nothing of Utah's claim to tax the full value of Union Pacific shares when transferred by death of a nonresident stockholder, and no basis for the Court's decision that it may do so, except the metaphysics of the corporate charter.\n\n\n II.\n\n\n The theories on which this case is decided contrast sharply with certain hard facts which measure the decision's practical wisdom or lack of it. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 191]\n\u00a0\n 1. The effect of the Court's decision is to intensify the already unwholesome conflict and friction between the states of the Union in competitive exploitation of intangible property as a source of death duties.\n The practical issue underlying this case is not whether the Harkness estate shall pay or avoid a transfer tax. The issue is whether Utah or New York will collect this tax. It is admitted that if this Court breathes constitutionality into this Utah tax, all that Utah gets will be credited to the Harkness estate on its tax payable in New York as the state of domicile. The right of a state to tax succession to corporate stock by death of one domiciled therein, while not abrogated, is now subjected to an interfering and overlapping right of the state which chartered the corporation to tax the same stock transfer on a different and inconsistent principle. Since the chartering state has apparently been empowered to exact its tax as a condition of permitting the transfer, the taxing power of the state of the stockholder's domicile is really subordinated and deferred to the taxing power of the chartering state. By laying its tax on the gross value transferred, irrespective of the net value of the decedent's estate, the chartering state may give its tax an effective priority of payment over the taxes laid by the domiciliary state and may collect what amounts to an inheritance tax, even when there is no net estate to transfer. Thus, through the corporate charter fiction the chartering state may thrust its own tax with extraterritorial effect between the taxing power of the state of domicile and tax resources to which that State has had, and I think should have, first and under ordinary circumstances exclusive resort.\n\n 2. \nTo subject intangible property to many more sources of taxation than other wealth prejudices its relation to other investments and other wealth by a discrimination which has no basis in the function that intangibles per- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 192]\n\u00a0\n form for our present society. \n15\n Intangibles, except for government issues, are an outgrowth of our modern corporation system. Of relatively recent growth, the corporation has become almost the unit of organization of our economic life. Whether for good or ill, the stubborn fact is that in our present system the corporation carries on the bulk of production and transportation, is the chief employer of both labor and capital, pays a large part of our taxes, and is an economic institution of such magnitude and importance that there is no present substitute for it except the state itself. Except for the easy circulation and ready acceptability of pieces of paper characterized as stocks or bonds, this existing system could not function. It is these intangible symbols or tokens which give liquidity and modibility to otherwise fixed underlying plant assets, which give ready negotiability to fractional interests therein that would otherwise transfer with difficulty, and which divide among many both benefits and risks from aggregation of properties whose successful functioning for society requires unified management of the bulk. The amount of plant and material and goods in process, working capital, good will, and organization at any time devoted \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 193]\n\u00a0\n to enterprise substantially will depend upon the willingness of the public to stand in the position of stockholder or bondholder. When this Court determines that the effect of owning this type of circulating medium is to subject the estate of the owner to an inheritance tax from every state that chartered one of the companies in which he has invested, it imposes a handicap on such ownership that is substantial and influential upon our economy.\n Not one substantial evil is said by the opinion in this case to flow from the rule being upset, and evils of some magnitude admittedly follow from the one being reinstated. These consequences the Court declines even to consider, although they bear upon a segment of our economy bigger than the national debt16 and affect more persons than are now in the armed forces. \n17\n Intangibles \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 194]\n\u00a0\n constitute well above 50% of all property transferred by death18 and an even greater proportion of that transferred by gift, which I assume is equally vulnerable to this tax. \n19\n The gravity of subjecting such extensive interests to complex, confusing, and overlapping tax jurisdictions should be weighed against the reasons advanced for the change.\n Of course it does not follow that the same proportions hold good for estates too small to be reported under federal law. Because they would be more heavily weighted with farm and home owning, I am confident these statistics do not present proportions applicable to all transfers by death. They do, I believe, sustain the statement made in the text.\n The revenue that the states may collect in consequence of this decision is not the measure of the burden it imposes on taxpayers. The ascertainment of taxes of this type is costly and wasteful. Such taxation frequently \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 195]\n\u00a0\n requires taking out ancillary letters in the state of the corporation's domicile, the hiring of local counsel, the furnishing of affidavits to local probate courts and inheritance tax officials, and the payment of various fees, costs, and expenses. For the assurance of local creditors, bonds are sometimes required and long kept in force. Realization upon assets and distribution of estates is delayed by inability to get waivers or consents to transfer until after extensive proceedings have been conducted. The seriousness of these burdens is increased if the decedent owns stock in consolidated corporations incorporated in several states, and under this decision stocks of some consolidated railroads would be subject to tax on their full values by five or six states. One need not be unduly soft-hearted towards taxpayers to doubt whether the exhaustion of estates through multiplication of reports, returns, appraisals, litigation, counsel fees, and expenses ultimately makes for a sound fiscal policy or an enlightened social policy.\n Moreover, the burdens imposed by this type of taxation are unequal and capricious and in inverse order to the ability of the estate to pay. I suppose we need have little anxiety about Mr. Harkness's $87,000,000 net estate with its $1,000,000 investment in Union Pacific stock. As we have pointed out, it is not he, but the State of New York, that will pay this tax to the State of Utah. And if New York had no provision in its statutes for credit and Mr. Harkness could have foreseen the shift of position of this Court, it is not likely that he would have been caught with the tax. Those who have large estates and watchful lawyers will find ways of minimizing these burdens. But Mr. Harkness is not a typical Union Pacific stockholder. In 1939, the Union Pacific had 50,131 stockholders. \n20\n The many small stockholders can- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 196]\n\u00a0\n not afford professional counsel or evasion devices. The burden of reports and appraisals and foreign tax proceedings bears heavily upon them because of the relatively small amount involved in their transfers. The new tax we have authorized undermines the principle of graduation of tax burdens in proportion to ability to pay. No tax laid on anything less than the total net worth of the estate can be graduated even roughly according to the principle which progressive modern taxation strives to heed. The imposition of unpredictable assessments from many sources makes it impossible for the state of domicile to make intelligent use of its own taxing power as an instrument of enlightened social policy. Chaos serves no social end.\n\n 3. \nA large majority of the states by experience prior to the First National Bank of Boston v. State of Maine decision found the system of taxation which this Court imposes on all states today to be unworkable and to constitute a threat to the death tax on intangibles as a state source of revenue. Competitive use by the states of death taxation and immunities invited federal invasion of the field, one phase of which was the enactment by Congress of  301, Revenue Act of 1926, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Acts, page 225, sustained by this Court in State of Florida v. Mellon, \n273 \nU.S. 12\n, 47 S.Ct. 265. There the Federal Government had laid an estate tax, but retained only 20% of the revenue and used an 80% credit provision to equalize the demands of the states. There was an uneasy premonition among the states that overlapping, capricious, and multiple taxation would lead to federal occupation of the field. Appearing in the First National Bank case as amicus curiae, the New York State Tax Commission urged that both principle and policy prevent the levying of taxes by more than one jurisdiction, and added: 'The New York Tax Commission \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 197]\n\u00a0\n believes that the present is a crucial period in the development of death taxation in this country and that a false step may make it difficult for the states to retain the death tax as a source of substantial revenue.' We revive their difficulties.\n Farsighted states saw that the total revenue resources practically available to the states was not increased by overlapping their taxation and invading each other's domiciliary sources of taxation. Many felt that justice required credits to their own domiciled decedents' estates for taxes exacted elsewhere, and the credits granted offset largely the revenue derived from the tax. The multiple taxation added substantially to the cost of administration and to the annoyance of taxpayers. Because of these considerations, at the time of argument of First National Bank of Boston v. State of Maine, thirty-seven states had enacted reciprocity statutes which voluntarily renounced revenues from this type of taxation. The Court was urged to stay the hand of sister states which would not cooperate. The restraint laid by this Court in response to those appeals is now withdrawn at the behest of a state which has at no time enacted a reciprocity statute or given a credit for such taxes paid by its domiciled decedents elsewhere. We have not heard the views of any other state nor considered their concern about retaining the source of taxation opened to them. I do not doubt that today's decision will give a new impetus to federal absorption of this revenue source and to federal incorporation of large enterprises.\n\n 4. \nAn unfortunate aspect of this decision is that in common with other judge-made law it has retroactive effect. Consequently, inequalities and injustices will be suffered by states as well as by individuals. For example, the State of New York has written into its own Constitu- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 198]\n\u00a0\n tion the limitations on its taxing power which this Court had established by the decision we now overrule. \n21\n Until it can adjust its constitutional provisions, such a state may not take advantage of the tax privileges the Court confers today, although other states may do so. We have not been advised as to the number of states which have repealed or modified reciprocity or credit provisions in their own statutes or constitutions in reliance upon the decision we overrule. Credit provisions contained in statutes may be the foundation for claims for refund against domiciliary states as chartering states proceed to take advantage of the privilege of retroactive taxation accorded them by this decision. Estates closed and distributed under existing laws become indebted by force of this decision to chartering states on claims for transfer tax that may have existed in the state statutes but had never been suspected of having constitutional validity. For what periods these claims may have vitality depends on state \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 199]\n\u00a0\n statutes of limitation. Whether personal liability may be asserted against executors and administrators for failure to pay taxes that our decisions did not tolerate at the time the estates were closed likewise depends on the laws of the chartering states. With confidence we may anticipate that this decision will produce much confusion, some controversy between the states, and a lusty crop of litigation.\n\n\n III.\n\n\n The Court casts aside former limitations on state power to tax nonresidents in such terms as to leave doubt whether any legal limitations are hereafter to be recognized or applied. The opinion of the Court says that the state may 'constitutionally make its exaction' 'which can demonstrate 'the practical fact of its power'.' The concurring opinion adds that 'Each State of the Union has the same taxing power as an independent government, except insofar as that power has been curtailed by the federal Constitution' and it enumerates three limitations, each of which prohibits a kind of tax or protects kinds of business from tax, but none of them restrains taxation by reference to what we have usually expressed by 'jurisdiction'. It is true that the concurring opinion says that 'the Due Process Clause has its application to the taxing powers of the States' but we are not told what it may be, and it is difficult to conceive of a situation where it will ever be useful if it may not be considered as a test of jurisdiction to impose a tax.\n Despite today's decision, I trust this Court does not intend to say that might always makes right in the matter of taxation. I hope there is agreement, though unexpressed, that there are limits, and that our problem is to search out and mark those limits. One way to go about it is to say that those states can tax which have the physi- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 200]\n\u00a0\n cal power to do so and have conferred some benefits or protection on the taxpayer. Of course there is nothing in the Constitution about this, but that is a criticism that can be directed at any test that I can think of. My difficulty is that on its face-and as so far applied-this test comes out to the point where might does make right. For in a very real sense every state and territory in the Union has conferred very real benefits upon every inhabitant of the Union. Some states have seen to it that our food is properly produced and inspected; others have fostered and protected the industry upon which we are utterly dependent for the ordinary conveniences of life and for life itself. All of them have yielded up men to provide government at home and to repel the enemy abroad. I am the very real debtor, but am frank enough to say I hope not a potential taxpayer, of all.\n Certain it is that while only corporate stock is expressly mentioned in the opinion or involved in the judgment today, the fiction of benefits and protection is capable of as ready adaptability to other intangible property. Our tomorrows will witness an extension of the taxing power of the chartering or issuing state to corporate bonds and bonds of states and municipalities (by overruling Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. State of Minnesota, \n280 \nU.S. 204\n, 50 S.Ct. 98, 65 A.L.R. 1000), to bank credits for cash deposited (by overruling Baldwin v. State of Missouri, \n281 \nU.S. 586\n, 50 S.Ct. 436, 72 A.L.R. 1303) and to choses in action (by overruling Beidler v. South Carolina Tax Comm., \n282 \nU.S. 1\n, 51 S.Ct. 54). And while today the Court sustains only a death transfer tax, its theories are equally serviceable to sustain an income or excise tax on dividends from such stock or interest on bonds or a sales tax, or a gift tax. Whether each chartering or issuing state will be permitted to calculate its tax on some formula that will consider the total property owned by the decedent, I do not know, but in the present \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 201]\n\u00a0\n trend of decision there is little restraint on such formulas. I therefore take today's decision to mean that any state may lay substantially any tax on any transfer of intangible property toward which it can spell out a conceivable legal relationship.\n And since the Due Process Clause speaks with no more clarity as to tangible than as to intangible property, the question is opened whether our decisions as to taxation of tangible property are not due to be overhauled. And if the State of Utah is not denied jurisdiction over the transfer of this stock owned by a New York resident it is difficult to see where the Court could find a basis for denying it jurisdiction to prescribe the rule of succession to it.\n The Court, it seems to me, will be obliged to draw the line at which state power to reach nonresidents' estates and extraterritorial transactions comes to an end. I find little difficulty in concluding that exaction of a tax by a state which has no jurisdiction or lawful authority to impose it is a taking of property without due process of law. The difficulty is that the concept of jurisdiction is not defined by the Constitution. Any decision which accepts or rejects any one of the many grounds advanced as jurisdictional for state taxing purposes22 will read into the Constitution an inclusion or an exclusion that is not found in its text. To read into the Constitution the Court's present concept of jurisdiction through charter granting, and to hold that it follows that the Constitution does not prohibit this tax, is to make new law quite as certainly as to adhere to the concept of jurisdiction ac- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 174, 202]\n\u00a0\n cording to the decedent's domicile and to hold that the Constitution therefore does prohibit it. \n23\n\u00a0\n\n I am content with existing constitutional law unless it appears more plainly that it is unsound or until it works badly in our present day and society.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] N.Y.L.1930, c. 710,  1, amended L. 1934, c. 639,  1; McKinney's Consol.Laws, c. 60, Bk. 59, Tax Law,  249-o.

Many estimates are extravagant and include an enormous amount of duplications-for example, the aggregate of stockholders' lists of all corporations. I think the estimate of Berle and Means as of 1927 that between four and six million persons owned stocks, including an estimated two million employee or customer stockholders, is a reasonable one. The Modern Corporation and Private Property (1934) 374. Many are, of course, also bondholders, and the number to be added after allowing for duplication is difficult to estimate. It must also, of course, be borne in mind that this includes many very small holdings and that such statistics are of little value in considering the relative benefits from such holdings derived by those in different income brackets. \n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] United States Treasury Statistics of Income for 1938, Part I, p. 220, shows that 15,221 estates filed returns showing total gross estates of 2,746,143,000, of which real estate was $433,487,000, tangible personal property, $34,637,000, and intangible personal property $2,278,019,000.\n The intangibles so reported included:\n Capital stock in corporations $1,079,231,000 State and municipal bonds 242,537,000 Government bonds 148,802,000 Other bonds 164,796,000\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] United States Treasury Statistics of Income for 1938, Part I, p. 264, show total gifts reported for taxation as-\n Real Estate $41,241,000 Stocks and Bonds 214,583,000 Cash 72,390,000 Insurance 21,795,000 Misc. 49,764,000\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] Moody's Steam Railroads (1940) 888. \n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] Article XVI,  3 of the New York State Constitution, adopted in 1938, provides:\n'Moneys, credits, securities and other intangible personal property within the state not employed in carrying on any business therein by the owner shall be deemed to be located at the domicile of the owner for purposes of taxation, and, if held in trust, shall not be deemed to be located in this state for purposes of taxation because of the trustee being domiciled in this state, provided that if no other state has jurisdiction to subject such property held in trust to death taxation, it may be deemed property having a taxable situs within this state for purposes of death taxation.

And another candid jurist has said: 'I will not hesitate in the silence or inadequacy of formal sources to indicate as the general line of direction for the judge the following: that he ought to shape his judgment of the law in obedience to the same aims which would be those of a legislator who was proposing to himself to regulate the question.'

SOUTHERN RY. CO.(1942)\nNo. 161\nArgued: January 8, 1942Decided: February 16, 1942\n\n\n\n Judgment Vacated on Rehearing Mar. 9, 1942\n\n\n See \n315 \nU.S. 784\n, 62 S.Ct. 801, 86 L.Ed. --.\n Messrs. William H. Allen and Charles M. Hay, both of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioner. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 283, 284]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Sidney S. Alderman, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought by the administratrix of Stewart's estate to recover for his death in consequence of a violation of the Safety Appliance Act. \n1\n The crew of which the intestate was a member was engaged in coupling freight cars. Stewart was on the engineer's side of the train. He gave a back-up signal with which the engineer complied and then a stop signal which was obeyed. The engineer saw him go between the ends of the last car of the train and the car that was to be coupled to it. While the train was stationary, this car drifted into collision with the end car of the train. Persons who responded to Stewart's cries found him with his arm crushed between the couplers, both of which were closed. His arm was amputated and a few days later he died.\n The administratrix, pursuant to leave of a state probate court, executed a release in consideration of $5,000 paid her. Subsequently she alleged in that court that she had been fraudulently induced to settle the case, and sought authority to rescind the release. The court decided against her after full hearing.\n In the present action the plaintiff offered testimony as to the circumstances of the accident. The respondent relied upon the release; offered evidence to prove death was due to causes other than the injury, but introduced no testimony as to what occurred at the time of Stewart's \n\n[315 \nU.S. 283, 285]\n\u00a0\n injury, or as to the condition of the couplers. The trial court ruled that the decision of the probate court on the issue of fraud in procuring the release was not res judicata, and submitted to the jury all issues, including that of the validity of the release. A verdict was rendered for petitioner for $17,500. It does not appear whether this sum was intended to be in addition to the $5,000 theretofore received by the administratrix. The judgment entered was for the amount of the verdict without credit for that sum.\n The respondent appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals. The petitioner was substituted for the administratrix, who had died. Judgment non obstante veredicto was denied but the judgment was reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial, for errors in the charge to the jury. \n2\n On motion of both parties a rehearing was accorded. The court then held there was no substantial evidence to sustain the verdict, and reversed and remanded with directions to enter a judgment for the respondent. \n3\n This Court granted certiorari. \n314 \nU.S. 591\n, 62 S.Ct. 71, 86 L.Ed. --.\n The record contains no direct evidence as to any defect in the coupler mechanisms of the cars involved in the accident. Each was equipped with an automatic coupler having a 'pin lifter', whereby the pin in the coupler can be lifted so as to allow the jaw of the coupler to swing into the open position. The purpose of the device is to permit a switchman to open the coupler into the position where it will engage with the coupler of the other car upon impact without the operator going between the ends of the cars. The engineer, a witness for petitioner, testified that he did not see the intestate attempt to use the pin lifter, but did see him go between the cars. The foreman of the crew, also a witness for the petitioner, testified \n\n[315 \nU.S. 283, 286]\n\u00a0\n that when he arrived the jaws of both couplers were closed and decedent's arm had been crushed between them. He testified that after the accident he coupled the cars in question by going between the cars and opening the jaw of the coupler by hand. He stated that he tried to use the pin lifter on the car at the end of the train, which would be the one available on the side of the train on which he was working. He also testified that if the coupler was in working order it could be set by the use of the pin lifter. He was not asked, and did not state, what effort he made to operate the pin lifter. Neither party asked him any further questions as to the working condition of the pin lifter or coupler.\n The petitioner insists that, in the absence of evidence on behalf of the respondent as to the condition of the coupler, the jury were entitled to infer that the pin lifter was not in working order, otherwise the foreman, an experienced man, would not have gone between the cars and opened the coupler jaw by hand. The court below held the jury was not entitled to draw this inference in the absence of testimony by the foreman with respect to his efforts to use the pin lifter and as to its condition.\n We hold that, on this record, neither party is entitled to prevail. If the issue as to the condition of the coupler mechanism was determinative, a new trial should have been ordered so that this issue might have been resolved in the light of a full examination of the foreman, the witness who could have given further testimony on the subject.\n The judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded to the court below for further proceedings. We express no opinion on other errors assigned in the Circuit Court of Appeals which may affect the disposition of the cause by that court.\n So ordered.\n Reversed and remanded with directions. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 283, 287]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting.\n The jury found from the evidence before it that the railroad had, contrary to the Federal Safety Appliance Act, used cars 'not equipped with couplers coupling automatically by impact, and which can be uncoupled without the necessity of men going between the ends of the cars.' 45 U.S.C .  2, 45 U.S.C.A.  2. The trial judge, who alone of the judges in the several proceedings below had the opportunity to see and hear the witnesses as well as to observe a coupling apparatus brought into the court room as an exhibit, made it clear that he regarded the evidence as sufficient to support the jury's verdict both by submitting the issues to it and by denying a new trial. The Circuit Court of Appeals took the same position in its first opinion. 8 Cir., 115 F.2d 317. Solicitude for the right to trial by jury on issues of fact prompted the adoption of the Seventh Amendment as part of the Bill of Rights. 1 Respect for the institution of trial by jury should, in my judgment, prompt us to leave undisturbed the jury's finding in this case that the coupler was defective.\n Because it must rely on the written page rather than living words, an appellate court can never fully appreciate the effect of testimony heard by a jury of local citizens. Even in the written record, however, I can find support for the jury's finding which convinces me that it should stand. The transcript shows the following:\n If a pin lifter functions properly, there will be automatic coupling of the cars, making it unnecessary for a workman to go between them. Stewart was an experi- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 283, 288]\n\u00a0\n enced workman. Besides being his duty, it was conductive to his safety for him to use the pin lifter to bring about coupling. On the day he was found with his arm crushed between the couplers, he had successfully handled the coupling of other cars.\n The crew foreman who shortly after the accident undertook the coupling of the particular cars between which Stewart was crushed testified as follows:\n'Q. Now, after this accident, when you coupled the cars, which I presume you did, did you couple the cars after the accident?\n\n'A. I did.\n\n'Q. How did you open the knuckle?\n\n'A. I opened it with my hand.\n\n'Q. Let me ask you, Mr. Stogner, if the coupler is working automatically, or the pin lifter, is it necessary to go in between the cars to open with your hands then?\n\n'A. No. sir.'\n\n And in the course of cross examination by the company's attorney whose questions indicated he accepted the fact that Stogner had tried without success to use the pin lifter, Stogner was asked: 'Now, which knuckle did you try to open, or which pin lifter did you try to use?' His reply-'The one on the north side'-designated the one connected with the coupler which had caused Stewart's death.\n Had Stogner's attempts with the pin lifter been successful, he would not have had to go between the cars to couple them. But that was what he testified he did after trying to raise the pin lifter. True, Stogner did not say how many attempts he made, nor how much force he applied in the effort. But the jury could reasonably have inferred that the company's foreman, a worker of many years of experience, applied such force as would have raised a pin lifter which was not defective. Moreover, since there was a statutory duty not to continue using \n\n[315 \nU.S. 283, 289]\n\u00a0\n this particular pin lifter if it was defective, we can reasonably assume that the railroad's inspectors made some examination of it. Yet no inspector nor anyone else was called by the railroad to give testimony on the condition of the pin lifter immediately after the accident. \n2\n Under these circumstances, reasonable jurors are not to be denied the right to make inferences which other reasonable people would make: that Stogner tried in the usual way to couple the cars; that his efforts were unsuccessful; and that he was therefore compelled to go between the cars to effect a coupling. And they could therefore have concluded that the pin lifter was defective. The jury's finding of this fact should not have been disturbed.\n Mr. Justice REED, Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, and Mr. Justice MURPHY join in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 45 U.S.C.  2, 45 U.S.C.A.  2. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 8 Cir., 115 F.2d 317. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 8 Cir., 119 F.2d 85. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Amendment VII: 'In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Cf.

UNITED STATES(1942)\nNo. 848\nArgued: Decided: May 25, 1942\n\n\n\n Messrs. Robert L. Lipman, Allan P. Matthew, J. M. Mannon, Jr., and A. Crawford Greene, all of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioners.\n Mr. Richard H. Demuth, of Washington, D.C., for respondent. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 354, 355]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the United States to quiet its title to a large area of tule marsh lands lying northwest of the Mare Island Navy Yard in San Pablo Bay in California. United States v. O'Donnell, \n303 \nU.S. 501\n, 58 S.Ct. 708, was a similar suit to quiet the Government's title to marsh lands lying between the high land on which the Navy Yard is located and the lands in controversy, which terminated favorably to the Government. In both cases the Government deraigned title through a grant by the Mexican Governor of California to one Castro and certain mesne conveyances by Castro and his grantees. In both cases the defendants claimed title under the State of California on the theory that the State acquired the lands under the Swamp Lands Act of September 28, 1850.1 The O'Donnell case involved the validity of the grant to Castro, the validity of the decree of the Board of Land Commissioners confirming that grant, the question of priority of right as between the United States as purchaser of the land granted to Castro and the State of California and its grantees under the Swamp Lands Act. The decision in that case settled these questions in favor of the Government.\n In the O'Donnell case it was contended that the lands there in controversy were not embraced within the grant to Castro. The District Court found against the contention and the Circuit Court of Appeals approved the finding. We refused to review the concurrent findings of the lower courts.\n In the present case, the petitioners do not contest the rulings in the O'Donnell case. Their defences are that their lands, which they hold under patents issued for swamp and overflowed lands, under the Swamp Lands Act, were never part of the land granted to Castro by the Mexican Governor and further that, if they were, the decision \n\n[316 \nU.S. 354, 356]\n\u00a0\n in San Francisco Savings, Union v. Irwin, C.C., 28 F. 708, affirmed \n136 \nU.S. 578\n, 10 S.Ct. 1064, constitutes a ruling as to their title which ought now to be followed. In addition, they claim that the action of the United States is barred by the Act of March 3, 18912 which prohibits suit by the United States to annul any patent after six years from the date of issue. They also contend that laches, estoppel, and failure to undertake to do equity as a condition of obtaining the desired relief require a decree dismissing the bill.\n The case was tried before the same District Judge who presided at the trial of the O'Donnell case. Upon the basis of the pleadings and proofs, he made, inter alia, the following findings of fact bearing upon the defence that the lands in controversy were not included in the grant to Castro or the confirmation thereof and hence never passed to the United States as ultimate transferee of Castro's title:\n That none of the lands involved was ever a part of Mare Island.\n That none of these lands was, either at the time of the grant to Castro or at the time of the proceedings for confirmation of the grant, a part of the lands known as, or referred to as, or by the name of Mare Island.\n That none of the lands was embraced in or covered by the grant of Mare Island to Castro.\n That none of the lands was ever occupied by, or in possession of, Castro.\n That none of the lands was claimed as a part of, or to be a part of, Mare Island.\n That none of the lands was covered by, or embraced within, the confirmation proceedings or the order of confirmation of the Board or the decree of the District Court confirming the order of confirmation of the Board. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 354, 357]\n\u00a0\n That none of the lands was purchased or acquired by the United States as part of its purchase of Mare Island.\n The judge also further made findings that the petitioners' title was derived from the United States through the State of California under the Swamp Lands, Act. He concluded the action was barred by the Statute of Limitations and that the United States was not the owner of the lands in suit. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decree by a vote of 2 to 1. 4 The dissenting judge said: 'The District Court found, in effect, that the 'place' which at the time of the grant to Castro and at the time of the confirmation to Bissell and Aspinwall was called Isla de la Yegua or Mare Island did not include any of the land here in controversy. The finding is amply supported by evidence.'\n The majority of the court did not overrule the findings of the District judge above outlined. After making a reference to the evidence they said: 'But whatever may be the fact, there is no occasion to inquire into the extent of Castro's occupancy, or into the matter of early repute.' They held that, whatever the extent of the Mexican grant to Castro, the decree of the Board of Land Commissioners, made pursuant to the Act of March 3, 1851,5 established a definite boundary-the line of ordinary high water mark-which was controlling. It is conceded that a portion of the marsh lands embraced in Survey No. 34, which are the lands involved in the O'Donnell case, are, and have been, above ordinary high water mark. The court held that there was some land above that mark in the narrow neck of land conveyed by Survey No. 34 and \n\n[316 \nU.S. 354, 358]\n\u00a0\n connecting the high land on which the Navy Yard is constructed with the large tract of about 7500 acres covered by Survey No. 569, which constitutes the land in this suit. Construing the decree of the Commissioners in accordance with the common law of California in force at the time of the confirmation of the Castro grant, the Court held that the tract confirmed to Castro's grantees comprised not only the high land on which the Navy Yard stands but the narrow strip to the northwestward empraced in Survey No. 34 and the large tract of tule marsh lying still farther to the northwestward embraced in Survey No. 569. On account of the importance of the questions involved we granted certiorari. \n315 \nU.S. 791\n, 62 S.Ct. 640, 86 L.Ed. --.\n We are of opinion that, in the light of the District Court's findings, which are undisturbed, the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in reversing the District Court's judgment. It is evident that the Circuit Court of Appeals accepted, or at least did not overrule, the findings of the District Judge. If, as we think, these findings were supported by substantial evidence, there is no principle of law which requires a decision that the decree of confirmation extended the tract actually granted to Castro so as to embrace the marsh lands, title to which is in controversy.\n The record before the Commissioners shows that, on October 30, 1840, Castro petitioned that he be granted an island called 'Mare Island', that the Governor ad interim granted his petition on October 31, 1840, and that on May 2, 1841, the Governor of the Californias, one Alvarado, confirmed Castro's ownership in fee of the same island 'in all its extent', which he designated as 'the Island named La Yegua'. There was no evidence before the Commissioners, and none in the trial of this case, to the effect that Castro occupied any portion of the tule marsh in controversy. The testimony before the Commissioners \n\n[316 \nU.S. 354, 359]\n\u00a0\n was devoted almost entirely to the question of the authenticity and good faith of the grant to Castro. The only evidence with respect to the size or extent of the island was that given by a witness Vallejo who resided near it. He testified that the island was two and one-half miles in length and contained about half a league of land. This description does not include the marsh land involved in the present case but covers only the high land where the Navy Yard is located.\n The petition of Bissell and Aspinwall for a confirmation to them of title to the lands granted to Castro by the Commissioners was filed August 31, 1852. It stated that the subject of the grant was 'the island called 'Isle de la Yegua\" and asked that the Commissioners confirm to them the said 'tract of land'. The decree of the Commissioners, after stating that the claim was valid and the application for confirmation should be allowed, continued: 'The place of which confirmation is hereby given is situate in the Bay of San Francisco and is called 'Isle de la Yegua' or Mare Island and being an island is bounded by the water's edge.'\n It is undisputed that the original grant to Castro was governed by the Mexican law and that, under that law, the title of an owner of land bordering on navigable waters ran to the line of the highest high tide. The record contains evidence indicating that, at such highest tide, the neck of land to the northwestward of the high land on which the Navy Yard is located was covered, at least at certain points, by water. This fact could not alter boundaries definitely fixed by the Commission's decree, which is to be interpreted according to the common law in force in California at the time it was entered. Under the common law, the boundary would be the line of ordinary high water. But the boundary of the Mexican grant is of some significance in determining what the Mexican Gov- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 354, 360]\n\u00a0\n ernor intended to, and did in fact, grant to Castro, especially as both grant and confirmation referred to the tract as what is named or called Mare Island.\n It is to be observed that the decree of confirmation refers not to a tract of land but to a 'place' and to the place which 'is called' Mare Island.\n At the time the decree of confirmation was entered several early maps of the area existed which, although they did not designate Mare Island by any name, showed the high land as entirely surrounded by water. They indicate a channel across the low neck of marsh land to the wastward of the high promontory on which the Navy Yard is constructed.\n Coming to about the date of the grant and confirmation, we find several significant maps. One of these, made by an Army lieutenant in 1848, shows an actual break at the northerly end of the high land and indicates that, at this point, water covered the land, at least at high tide. The island thus delimited is marked on the map 'Mare Island' and the low tule marsh to the northwestward is not comprehended in the area so designated. Another, made by one Ellis in 1852, marks the high land 'Mares Island'. All the area to the northwest of the high land, including the land in controversy, is shown as water. A third, made by one Ringgold, a Commander of the Navy in 1850, shows the swamp land to the northwest of what is now the Navy Yard tract but designates only the latter as Mare Island.\n Seven United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Charts dated respectively 1851, 1851, 1856, 1859, 1861, 1863, and 1915, designate only the high land by the name of 'Mare Island'. The United States Geological Survey prepared maps of the Napa quadrangle and the Mare Island quadrangle in 1902 and 1916. In each the high land is marked Mare Island and the land in controversy is marked 'Island No. 1'. The State Geological Survey of California pre- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 354, 361]\n\u00a0\n pared a map in 1873 which applies the name 'Mare Island' to the high land.\n San Francisco Savings Union v. Irwin, supra, was tried about 1885. The Coast and Geodetic Survey prepared a map for use in that case which shows only the high land as constituting Mare Island. In the trial of the instant case it was testified that the land in controversy has been for some years known as 'Cross Island.'\n Shortly before the Government purchased Mare Island, and as a basis of the purchase, a Board of Officers known as the Sloat Board reported on the island as a site for a navy yard. This report was made before the confirmation proceedings were concluded. One of the plans attached to the report purports to be a plan of Mare Island showing its topography. The plan covers only the high land. The report states that Mare Island is 'bounded on the east by Mare Island Straits which separates it from the City of Vallejo on the west by the bay of San Pablo and on the north by a large tract of tule land extending several miles in the direction of Sonoma.' The report speaks of the 'north end' of the island as more uniform than the southerly end so that it may easily be reduced to a convenient grade. These remarks cannot well apply to the tule marsh in question. The report states that the island contains 'including the tule opposite Vallejo, about 900 acres.' There is a further statement that the whole length of the island is about two miles. This describes only the high land as the length would be about ten miles if the tule marsh in controversy were included.\n The foregoing facts seem to us to furnish adequate support for a finding that what was granted to Castro was the high land known at the time as Mare Island and not the great extent of tule marsh lying to the northwestward of the former which was apparently not occupied or claimed by Castro or commonly understood to be a part \n\n[316 \nU.S. 354, 362]\n\u00a0\n of the land called Mare Island. All that the decree purported to confirm was the title to a 'place ... called ... Mare Island'. Even if the high land was connected by a narrow neck with the tule marsh to the northwestward, that high land might still be called an island either because the narrow neck of low marsh land to its westward was sometimes flooded or because the name 'island' was colloquially applied to a piece of land which a geographer would mere accurately call a peninsula. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The Court of Appeals, however, held, and the Government here urges, that the facts recited are immaterial in view of the terms of the decree of confirmation. The undoubted principle that when such a decree defines the boundaries of a tract with precision, the decree cannot be attacked on the ground that the boundaries named were erroneous,7 is invoked. But the question remains whether the petitioners' contention in this case amounts to such an attack. The description in the decree of confirmation is at best but a vague one. It is of a 'place ... called ... Mare Island.' If there were nothing more it would be competent to show what was in fact the place so known or called. The Government's contention is, however, that, because the Commission added that, being an island it was bounded by the water's edge, this supererogatory statement gives a fixed and definite boundary which overcomes any vagueness inherent in the designation of the place granted. We think no such strict \n\n[316 \nU.S. 354, 363]\n\u00a0\n rule has been applied in the interpretation of deeds or, indeed, of decrees of confirmation of Mexican grants in like circumstances. On the contrary, courts have repeatedly resorted to evidence of what was commonly known and called a ranch, or lot, or other place, in order to correct erroneous boundaries stated in a deed description or a decree of confirmation. \n8\n Thus to explain the meaning and extent of a decree is not to attack it for error but to reconcile all of the descriptive language used to designate the tract title to which is confirmed.\n We are of opinion that the evidence in question was of probative value; that its reception and consideration did not run counter to the rule that the decree of confirmation was not open to attack by reason of erroneous description of the land confirmed, and that the proofs furnished a basis for a finding of fact that the land in controversy was not a part of that granted to Castro and confirmed to his vendees. This view renders it unnecessary to discuss the other questions presented by the petitioners. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court is affirmed.\n So ordered.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] c. 84, 9 Stat. 519, 43 U.S.C.  982, 43 U.S.C.A.  982. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 2 c. 561,  8, 26 Stat. 1095, 1099, 43 U.S.C.A.  1166. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] D.C., 29 F.Supp. 59. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] 9 Cir., 121 F.2d 705, 714. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] c. 41, 9 Stat. 631. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] It is common knowledge that lands not in fact surrounded by water are sometimes called islands.

A. D. Caesar and Charles W. Rivise, both of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioner.\n Mr. Isaac J. Silin, of Erie, Pa., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The only question presented for our determination is whether Section 48 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  109, 28 U.S.C.A.  109, is the sole provision governing the venue of patent infringement litigation or whether that section is supplemented \n\n[315 \nU.S. 561, 562]\n\u00a0\n by Section 52 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  113, 28 U.S.C.A.  113. Section 48 gives jurisdiction of suits for patent infringement to the United States district courts in the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant or in any district in which the defendant shall have committed acts of infringement and have a regular and established place of business. Section 52 permits suits, not of a local nature, against two or more defendants residing in different judicial districts within the same state to be brought in either district. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Petitioner, Stonite Products Company, an inhabitant of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania without a regular \n\n[315 \nU.S. 561, 563]\n\u00a0\n and established place of business in the Western District of that State, was sued jointly with Lowe Supply Company, an inhabitant of the Western District, in the Western District for infringement of Patent No. 1,777,759 for a boiler stand. Petitioner was served with process in the Eastern District, entered a special appearance in the action in the Western District, and moved to dismiss or quash the return of service because venue was laid in the wrong district. The district court granted the motion and dismissed the cause as to petitioner. \n2\n 36 F.Supp. 29. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 119 F.2d 883. We granted certiorari because of an asserted conflict with Motoshaver, Inc. v. Schick Dry Shaver, Inc., 9 Cir., 100 F.2d 236.\n We hold that Section 48 is the exclusive provision controlling venue in patent infringement proceedings.\n Section 48 is derived from the Act of March 3, 1897, c. 395, 29 Stat. 695, and its scope can best be determined from an examination of the reasons for its enactment.\n Section 11 of the Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, c. 20, 1 Stat. 79, permitted civil suits to be brought in the federal courts against a person only in the district of which he was an inhabitant or in which he was found at the time of serving the writ. That section applied to suits for patent infringement. Chaffee v. Hayward, 20 How. 208, 216, 851; Allen v. Blunt, Fed.Cas.No.215, 1 Blatchf. 480. The Act of March 3, 1875, c. 137, 18 Stat. 470, retained the provision allowing suit wherever the defendant could be found. The abuses engendered by this extensive venue prompted the Act of March 3, 1887, c. 373, 24 Stat. 552, which as amended by the Act of August 13, 1888, c. 866, 25 Stat. 433, permitted civil suits to be instituted only in the district of which the defendant was an inhabitant, except \n\n[315 \nU.S. 561, 564]\n\u00a0\n that in diversity jurisdiction cases suit could be started in the district of the plaintiff's or the defendant's residence. The substance of those provisions was reenacted as Section 51 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C.  112, 28 U.S.C.A.  112).\n After the holding of In re Hohorst, \n150 \nU.S. 653\n, 14 S.Ct. 221, 225, that the Act of 1887 as amended did not apply to a suit against an alien or a foreign corporation 'especially in a suit for the infringement of a patent right', the lower federal courts became uncertain as to the applicability of the Act of 1887 to patent infringement proceedings. \n3\n In explanation of Hohorst's case it was said Re Keasbey & Mattison Co., \n160 \nU.S. 221, 230\n, 16 S.Ct. 273, 275, that 'It was a suit for infringement of a patent right, exclusive jurisdiction of which had been granted to the circuit courts of the United States ...; and was therefore not affected by general provisions regulating the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States, concurrent with that of the several states'. Thereafter the lower federal courts for the most part took the position that the Act of 1887 as amended did \n\n[315 \nU.S. 561, 565]\n\u00a0\n not apply to suits for patent infringement, and that infringers could be sued wherever they could be found. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The Act of 1897 was adopted to define the exact jurisdiction of the federal courts in actions to enforce patent rights and thus eliminate the uncertainty produced by the conflicting decisions on the applicability of the Act of 1887 as amended to such litigation. \n5\n That purpose indicates \n\n[315 \nU.S. 561, 566]\n\u00a0\n that Congress did not intend the Act of 1897 to dovetail with the general provisions relating to the venue of civil suits, but rather that it alone should control venue in patent infringement proceedings.\n Section 52 is derived from R.S.  740, which in turn stems from the Act of May 4, 1858, c. 27, 11 Stat. 272, a general act intended to do away with the insertion of special provisions preserving state-wide venue in acts dividing a state into two or more judicial districts,6 and the Act of February 24, 1863, c. 54,  9, 12 Stat. 662. Respondents insist that Section 52 applies to patent infringement suits because it antedates Section 48, excludes from its purview only suits of a local nature, and is consistent with and complementary to Section 48 since it deals with the problem of venue in the geographical sense rather than in terms of specified classes of litigation. We cannot agree.\n Even assuming that R.S.  740 covered patent litigation prior to the Act of 1897, we do not think that its application survived that Act, which was intended to define the exact limits of venue in patent infringement suits. \n7\n Furthermore, the Act of 1897 was a restrictive measure, limiting a prior, broader venue. General Elec. Co. v. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 561, 567]\n\u00a0\n Marvel Rare Metals Co., \n287 \nU.S. 430, 434\n, 435 S., 53 S.Ct. 202, 204; Bowers v. Atlantic, G. & P. Co., C.C., 104 F. 887; Cheatham Electric Switching Device Co. v. Transit Development Co., C.C., 191 F. 727.8 Thus there is little reason to assume that Congress intended to authorize suits in districts other than those mentioned in that Act.\n The reenactment of the Act of 1897 as Section 48, and of R.S.  740 as Section 52 of the Judicial Code by the Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1100, 1101, is not indicative of any Congressional understanding that the two sections are complementary. Quite the contrary, for Section 52 appears in the Judicial Code as an exception to Section 51, the general venue provision derived from the Act of 1887, as amended. See Camp v. Gress, \n250 \nU.S. 308, 315\n, 39 S.Ct. 478, 481. Section 51 is, of course, not applicable to patent infringement proceedings. General Elec. Co. v. Marvel Rare Metals Co., supra. \n9\n Since Section 48 is wholly independent of Section 51, there is an element of incongruity in attempting to supplement Section 48 by resort to Section 52, an exception to the provisions of Section 51.

If such suit is brought in a district of which the defendant is not an inhabitant, but in which such defendant has a regular and established place of business, service of process, summons, or subpoena upon the defendant may be made by service upon the agent or agents engaged in conducting such business in the district in which suit is brought.'\n\n Section 52 provides:\n'When a State contains more than one district, every suit not of a local nature, in the district court thereof, against a single defendant, inhabitant of such State, must be brought in the district where he resides; but if there are two or more defendants, residing in different districts of the State, it may be brought in either district, and a duplicate writ may be issued against the defendants, directed to the marshal of any other district in which any defendant resides. The clerk issuing the duplicate writ shall indorse thereon that it is a true copy of a writ sued out of the court of the proper district; and such original and duplicate writs, when executed and returned into the office from which they issue, shall constitute and be proceeded on as one suit; and upon any judgment or decree rendered therein, execution may be issued, directed to the marshal of any district in the same State.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Lowe Supply Company defaulted and the suit proceeded to judgment against it. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Prior to the Hohorst case the lower federal courts seem to have been unanimous in assuming that the Act of 1887 as amended governed patent infringement litigation.

Rec. 1900-1901):\n'Mr. Speaker, the necessity for this law grows out of the acts of 1887 and 1888 which amended the judiciary act. Conflicting decisions have been arisen in the different districts in the same States as to the construction of these acts of 1887 and 1888, and there is great uncertainty throughout the country as to whether or not the act of 1887 as amended by the act of 1888 applied to patent cases at all.\n\n'The bill is intended to remove this uncertainty and to define the exact jurisdiction of the circuit courts in these matters.\n\n'The committee have been extremely careful in the investigation of the matter before reporting the bill.\n\n'As the bill was referred to me, I wrote to a great many patent lawyers in different parts of the country, in order to get their views and objections, if any, and I find that they are all unanimously in favor of the bill as it is now reported, and state that it would tend not only to define the jurisdiction of the circuit courts not now defined, but also limit that jurisdiction and so clearly define it that in the future there will be no question with regard to the application of the acts of 1887 and 1888.\n\n'... The trouble has arisen in this matter that under the act of 1888 some of the courts were uncertain whether or not the law did or did not apply to patent cases, and therefore this special bill relating to patents solely has been brought up because of the indefiniteness and uncertainty arising from different constructions of the act of 1888 as applied to patent cases.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See the remarks of Senator Pugh who reported the bill for the Senate Judiciary Committee. 36 Cong. Globe 936, 35th Cong., 1st Sess. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] As a matter of fact there was some uncertainty as to whether R.S.  740 survived the general venue provisions of the Acts of 1875 and 1887.

Blanchard, of Chicago, Ill., for appellant Armour & Co.\n Mr. Hugh B. Cox, of Washington, D.C., for appellees the United States and Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. Douglas F. Smith, of Chicago, Ill., for appellees Alton R. Co. et al.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Swift & Company and Omaha Packing Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary, filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission a complaint against the common carriers by railroad which served the Chicago Union Stock Yards, operated by the Union Stock Yard & Transit Company. \n1\n They were later joined by Armour & Com- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 216, 218]\n\u00a0\n pany as intervenor to constitute the interest referred to herein as the packers. Although Armour sought no relief, it was allowed to intervene because it was at the time litigating in the courts a similar complaint, which was later passed on by this Court in Armour & Co. v. Alton R. Co., \n312 \nU.S. 195\n, 61 S.Ct. 498. The complaint in this case concerned practices of the Union Stock Yard & Transit Company and charges collected by it from the packers, but the Yard Company was not a party to the proceedings. The packers sought a revision of the Yard Company's practices, which they said were part of the carrier-shipper relation, through the exercise of the Interstate Commerce Commission's jurisdiction over the railroads and over transportation.\n The complaint charged that the packers shipped over lines of defendant carriers from various points of origin throughout the United States to Chicago, Illinois, what are known as 'direct shipments' of livestock. 'Direct shipments' refers to livestock consigned directly to a packer at the Union Stock Yards, as distinguished from a shipment consigned to a commission merchant at the Stock Yards for sale. \n2\n Direct shipments are generally of livestock which has been purchased by the packer or its buyers at country points or at markets other than \n\n[316 \nU.S. 216, 219]\n\u00a0\n Chicago. On arrival the cars containing the livestock are placed at unloading or chute pens of the Yard Company by the railroad employees and the stock is then unloaded and placed in the pens by employees of the Yard Company. For this unloading service the Yard Company is paid at published tariff rates3 by the railroads, which absorb the charge out of their line- haul rates.\n The packers desire immediately to take their consignments from these unloading pens and insist that they desire no further services and, of course, desire to incur no further charges.\n The Yard Company, however, under tariffs filed with the Secretary of Agriculture pursuant to the Packers and Stockyards Act4 imposes upon the packers a schedule of charges known as yardage charges, which vary from ten cents to forty-five cents per head of stock. The packers say that they desire none of the services, such as weighing, watering, feeding, or holding, which yardage charges compensate, and desire only to move their stock immediately from the unloading pens to the public streets without payment of the yardage charges. Contending that it is their legal right so to obtain delivery, the packers made sufficient demand upon the Yard Company and upon the railroad companies for immediate and free delivery of their stock from the unloading pens. This was refused, and yardage charges have been paid to the Yard Company under protest. The packers demanded from the Commission relief by way of reparation and asked the Commission to establish rules and practices under which they may obtain delivery to themselves by the railroads of \n\n[316 \nU.S. 216, 220]\n\u00a0\n direct shipments at the Union Stock Yards in convenient, safe, and suitable pens, with egress for the immediate removal of the livestock to the nearest public street, by a way to be designated by the railroads, without the payment of any yardage charges to the Union Stock Yards & Transit Company, and without the payment of any charges other than the linehaul transportation charges of the railroads.\n The Commission after hearings denied the packers relief for reasons later to be considered. It found that the delivery of stock consigned by the packers to themselves at the Stock Yards into the Yard Company's pens without affording free egress for the shipments is not an unreasonable practice on the part of the carriers and that the yardage charges thereafter assessed by the Union Stock Yard & Transit Company are not subject to the Commission's jurisdiction. 238 I.C.C. 179.\n Appellants Swift and Omaha then brought suit in a district Court of three judges for a decree permanently suspending and annulling the order of the Commission and for a remand of the complaint for decision in accordance with principles of law to be determined by the court. Appellant Armour intervened and participated in the trial. The railroads which had been named as defendants before the Commission also intervened, as defendants in the District Court. After hearing, the District Court held without opinion that the Commission's findings were properly supported by evidence; that the findings made by the Commission were adequate to support its conclusion; that the practices complained of were not unreasonable; and that the Commission did not have jurisdiction of the yardage charges. It dismissed the packers' complaint, and appeal was taken to this Court. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[316 \nU.S. 216, 221]\n\u00a0\n The many assignments of error may be grouped under three inquiries: ( 1) Do the packers have an absolute right as a matter of law to take their direct shipments of livestock from the unloading pens free from yardage charges? (2) If there is no such absolute right, was the Commission in error in considering the history of dealings between packers and the Yard Company together with other facts bearing on the reasonableness of the carriers' method of delivery at the Stock Yards? (3) If the practice as to delivery was correctly held a reasonable method of terminating the carriers' obligation to furnish transportation, did the Commission have jurisdiction in a proceeding against the railroad companies to inquire into or prescribe the yardage charges complained of?\n\n\n I.\n\n\n The packers' contention that they are entitled as a matter of absolute right to delivery of their livestock from the unloading pens without payment of yardage charges is based upon the decision of this Court in Covington Stock-Yards Co. v. Keith, \n139 \nU.S. 128\n, 11 S.Ct. 461, and the subsequently enacted  1(3) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  1(3).\n In the Covington case, decided on facts antedating the Interstate Commerce Act, this Court said that 'A carrier of livestock has no more right to make a special charge for merely receiving or merely delivering such stock, in and through stockyards provided by itself, in order that it may properly receive and load, or unload and deliver, such stock, than a carrier of passengers may make a special charge for the use of its passenger depot by passengers when proceeding to or coming from its trains, or than a carrier may charge the shipper for the use of its general freight depot in merely delivering his goods for shipment, or the consignee of such goods for its use in merely receiving them there within a reasonable time after they are unloaded from the cars. If the carrier may not make \n\n[316 \nU.S. 216, 222]\n\u00a0\n such special charges in respect to stock-yards which itself owns, maintains, or controls, it cannot invest another corporation or company with authority to impose burdens of that kind upon shippers and consignees. The transportation of live-stock begins with their delivery to the carrier to be loaded upon its cars, and ends only after the stock is unloaded and delivered, or offered to be delivered, to the consignee, if to be found, at such place as admits of their being safely taken into possession.' 139 U.S. at pages 135, 136, 11 S.Ct. at page 463.\n After the decision in this case there was enacted  1(3) of the Interstate Commerce Act, providing that 'The term 'transportation' as used in this chapter shall include ... all instrumentalities and facilities of shipment or carriage, irrespective of ownership or of any contract, express or implied, for the use thereof, and all services in connection with the receipt, delivery, elevation, and transfer in transit, ... storage, and handling of property transported. ...' 36 Stat. 539, 545, 49 U.S.C.  1(3)(a), 49 U.S.C.A.  1(3) (a).\n After the enactment of  1(3), this Court decided Adams v. Mills, \n286 \nU.S. 397\n, 52 S.Ct. 589, which arose before the enactment of  15(5), set forth below. The propriety of an additional charge for the unloading of livestock at the Chicago Union Stock Yards was in issue, and it was said: 'That the yards are, in effect, terminals of the railroads is clear. They are in fact used as terminals; and necessarily so. Whether the unloading in the yards was a part of transportation was not a pure question of law to be determined by merely reading the tariffs. Compare Great Northern R. Co. v. Merchants Elevator Co., \n259 \nU.S. 285, 294\n, 42 S. Ct. 477 (480). The decision of the question was dependent upon the determination of certain facts, including the history of the Stock Yards and their relation to the line-haul carriers; the history of the unloading charge at these yards; and \n\n[316 \nU.S. 216, 223]\n\u00a0\n the action of the parties in relation thereto. If there was evidence to sustain the Commission's findings on these matters, its conclusion that the collection of the extra charge from the shippers was an unreasonable and unlawful practice must be sustained. Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co. v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 199, 221\n, 34 S.Ct. 291 (297); Los Angeles Switching Case (Interstate Commerce Commission v. Atchison, T. & S. F.R. Co.), \n234 \nU.S. 294, 310\n, 311 S., 34 S.Ct. 814 (818).' 286 U.S. at pages 409, 410, 52 S.Ct. at page 592.\n On February 28, 1920, prior to this decision and during the pendency of the controversy which led to it, there was enacted  15(5) of the Interstate Commerce Act, which provided that: 'Transportation wholly by railroad of ordinary livestock in carload lots destined to or received at public stockyards shall include all necessary service of unloading and reloading en route, delivery at public stockyards of inbound shipments into suitable pens, and receipt and loading at such yards of outbound shipments, without extra charge therefor to the shipper, consignee or owner, except in cases where the unloading or reloading en route is at the request of the shipper, consignee or owner, or to try an intermediate market, or to comply with quarantine regulations. The commission may prescribe or approve just and reasonable rules governing each of such excepted services. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to affect the duties and liabilities of the carriers existing on February 28, 1920, by virtue of law respecting the transportation of other than ordinary livestock, or the duty of performing service as to shipments other than those to or from public stockyards.' 41 Stat. 456, 486, 49 U.S.C.  15(5), 49 U.S.C.A.  15(5).\n In the subsequent case of Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co. v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 193\n, 55 S.Ct. 748, it was pointed out that in appropriate circumstances the Commission might properly find that the carriers' duty to deliver livestock ended with delivery into suitable pens at the Chicago Union \n\n[316 \nU.S. 216, 224]\n\u00a0\n Stock Yards, and it was recognized that the question of where the carrier's obligation ends is for the administrative judgment of the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Our most recent decision bearing on the Commission's power to determine when transportation ends with reference to shipments of livestock to the Chicago Union Stock Yards is Armour & Co. v. Alton R. Co., \n312 \nU.S. 195\n, 61 S.Ct. 498, rendered in the controversy over the propriety of yardage charges made in circumstances precisely similar to those of the present case, by virtue of which Armour & Co. intervened in the present litigation. There it was held by a unanimous Court that Armour's complaint in the federal District Court should be dismissed since primary jurisdiction was lodged in the Interstate Commerce Commission; and it was said that the facts alleged in the complaint revealed that 'there are many questions relating to complex transportation problems that must be solved as a prerequisite to a determination of whether the railroads, in violation of contracts or governing laws, have failed properly to deliver petitioner's livestock.' 312 U.S. at page 200, 61 S.Ct., at page 501. By way of illustration the opinion detailed several questions which would arise, and among them was the following: 'At what point did the common carriers' duty to transport come to an end? Neither the statute nor any applicable principle of governing law can be said to mark this boundary, under all circumstances and conditions and in all cases.' Ibid. The decision agreed with the view of the railroads and courts below that 'adjudication of the issues presented relates to such complex transportation problems that determination of the legal questions must necessarily be preceded by the consideration of extensive evidence in a specialized field, and that decision of such questions is by statute vested exclusively in the Interstate Commerce Commission.' 312 U.S. at page 197, 61 S.Ct. at page 500. Finally, it was said that 'If use of the terminal facilities for egress to the street after unloading of livestock is a \n\n[316 \nU.S. 216, 225]\n\u00a0\n part of transportation, as petitioner alleges, and if this use is a service for which reasonable compensation is justified, it cannot be doubted that this charge, like the unloading charge, is a part of that reasonable transportation rate determination of which is committed to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission. And before such long- standing transportation customs can be held illegal, it is of course necessary that evidence be heard.' 312 U.S. at pages 200, 201, 61 S.Ct. at page 502.\n Thus it is seen that before the enactment of  15\n\n[316 \nU.S. 216, 5]\n\u00a0\n, whether transportation included unloading was a question of fact for the determination of the Commission. Adams v. Mills, supra. Section 15(5) changed this, but it did not alter the situation with respect to yardage services, Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co. v. United States, supra; and whether they are included in transportation is therefore a question to be decided by the Commission upon the facts of each particular case, and not by mechanical application of a fixed rule of law as contended by the appellants. Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co. v. United States, supra; Armour & Co. v. Alton R. Co., supra. Otherwise we erred in requiring 'primary resort' to the Commission in the Armour case with respect to the question where transportation ended. Great Northen Ry. Co. v. Merchants Elevator Co., \n259 \nU.S. 285\n, 42 S.Ct. 477. The propriety of the yardage charges in the present case was a question for decision by the Commission in the exercise of its judgment, and not for decision according to any fixed rule of law.\n\n\n II.\n\n\n In determining whether the Yard Company's unloading pens were suitable points at which to terminate the duties of carriers to consignees and points where the consignees entered into a relationship with someone other than the carriers, the Commission was justified in considering as it did all that would account for the evolution \n\n[316 \nU.S. 216, 226]\n\u00a0\n of the practice complained of as well as the effect of existing and proposed practices on the interest of the carriers, the public, and other shippers. Adams v. Mills, supra, 286 U.S. at page 409 et seq., 52 S.Ct. at page 592; Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co. v. United States, supra, 295 U.S. at page 198 et seq., 55 S.Ct. at page 751, Armour & Co. v. Alton R. Co., supra, 312 U.S. at page 201, 61 S.Ct. at page 502. Neither the railroads nor the Stock Yards exist for the benefit of the packers alone. Their patronage is large and important, but neither in the regulation of the carriers nor in the regulation of the Stock Yards are they entitled to facilities or treatment that will ignore the existence of other interests. The Stock Yards are not only a facility for the transportation of direct shipments from points of country origin to the packers; they also are an important factor in the entire animal industry of the United States. The Commission found that the direct shipments of livestock transported by rail to the packers at Chicago have exceeded 30,000 carloads annually for several years, but that the total annual average rail movement to the Stock Yards was 94,629 carloads.\n The bulk of the movement of stock is received in the Yards during the first days of the week, and approximately three-fourths of the daily movement is unloaded between three and eight in the morning. In some instances immediate removal of the animals from the unloading pens is necessary to preserve an even flow of livestock from the cars into the Yards. Apart from the direct shipments, much of this stock must be watered, fed, and weighed in the Yards. It is removed to holding pens and one of the important functions of the Stock Yards is to furnish the facilities for marketing. Commission brokers or market agencies receive consignments of livestock and sell them for the account of the producer, sometimes to the packers and sometimes to purchasers who require re-shipment.\n Shipments must be moved with great rapidity and order, and it may be that this can best be done by employees \n\n[316 \nU.S. 216, 227]\n\u00a0\n under a single management and discipline. The customary handling over many years led to the building up of a physical plant which the Commission finds makes it physically impossible to remove this stock from the unloading pens except by use of the property of the Yard Company.\n The interests of the public and of the community are entitled to consideration. This transportation is of a special kind of property on the hoof which calls for special handling in the interests of economy, safety, sanitation, and health. The Commission has found that 'the evidence fails to disclose how, as a practical matter, an annual volume of 30,000 carloads of livestock could be discharged into and handled through the public streets of Chicago.'6\n The existence and suitability of alternative facilities for delivery of livestock were considered by the Commission. Some stock is and can be delivered at team tracks and some at industrial sidings. These facilities are inadequate for handling the entire volume of direct shipments. It does not appear, however, that the existence or adequacy of alternative facilities for delivery at other points is particularly important in the case, because the shipments involved are consigned to the packers at the Union Stock Yards by their own choice. It does not appear that they are demanding an increase of other facilities, and the case has not been considered in that light.\n The packers object to consideration of their own part in evolving the situation of which they complain. The Commission, however, considered it and made findings as to the history of the relation between the Yard Company and the packers.\n The Commission found that since the Yard Company began operation in 1865 there has been a line of demarkation between the services which shippers were \n\n[316 \nU.S. 216, 228]\n\u00a0\n entitled to receive for the transportation charges and the services received from the Yard Company. The line-haul carriers have paid the Yard Company for the unloading service and absorbed the charge made for such service out of their line-haul rates. From the beginning, however, all shippers were required to pay to the Yard Company a yardage charge on every animal unloaded. Dealings with respect to those charges were between the Yard Company and the shippers, with no intervention by the carriers. After these practices had been in effect for about twenty-five years, the Yard Company entered into certain arrangements under which these packers participated in the profits from its operations. Some time before 1890, the packers threatened to move their plants from Chicago and to establish facilities of their own for the receipt of their livestock. The packers had acquired a large tract of land in Indiana as a site for their proposed plants. They had also purchased property known as the 'Central Stock Yards' near the Union Stock Yards and had erected thereon platforms, pens, sheds, and sidings for the purpose of receiving all cattle and livestock consigned to them. They had also filed a complaint in an Illinois court demanding that the Yard Company be required to permit the line-haul carriers to use its tracks in making deliveries to the packers' Central Stock Yards.\n Having put themselves in this independent position and threatened to reduce the revenues of the Yard Company, the packers negotiated a contract which in substance involved the abandonment by the packing companies of this threatened move to Indiana and surrender of their own facilities for receiving direct shipments in return for a participation in the profits and capital of the Yard Company. In 1892, the packers conveyed to Stock Yard interests the Indiana site and the Central Stock Yards, and agreed by contract to dismiss the suit filed \n\n[316 \nU.S. 216, 229]\n\u00a0\n in the Illinois court and to refrain from filing any similar suit for a period of fifteen years; to continue their business at Packingtown adjacent to the Union Stock Yards for fifteen years from July 1, 1891; to have all livestock slaughtered by them on their premises or within two hundred miles of the City of Chicago during such period pass through and use the Union Stock Yards, and to pay the usual yardage charge therefor; and they guaranteed that the Yard Company would receive and collect from its yardage charges on packers' livestock the aggregate sum of $2,000,000 within six years, and agreed to make up any deficiency in that amount. The packers also agreed that as long as the Yard Company conducted its business in Chicago they would not interest themselves in any other stockyards in Chicago for the receipt and use of their own livestock.\n The packers received income bonds of a new corporation, the security of which was the revenues of the Stock Yards, in the amount of $3,000,000. Swift received approximately one-third. These bonds were subsequently redeemed by the issuing corporation.\n The railroad companies were not parties to this agreement, and the Commission found that the packers at the time the agreement was entered into did not consider the assessment of the yardage charges to be a matter of any concern to the railroads. During the existence of the agreement described, the packers paid the yardage charges, and participated in the receipts from such charges. This agreement expired in 1907, except for the covenant by the packers not to establish or become interested in any other stockyards for the receipt of their livestock so long as the Yard Company maintained its business in Chicago. It appears, however, that after the expiration of the contract the Yard interests were informed that the packers were still threatening to move their plant from Chicago, and it appears that Swift expected to receive a share of \n\n[316 \nU.S. 216, 230]\n\u00a0\n the Yard's earnings as late as 1918, but there is no proof that it did receive anything in addition to the bonds received under the contract of 1892. J. O. Armour, of Armour & Company, however, received substantial benefits after 1907.\n Thus, for more than seventy years the responsibility of the railroads in respect of direct shipments consigned to the packers has ended with the unloading service. The packers from that point on have negotiated their own arrangement with the Yard Company. More recently, of course, the Stock Yards have passed under public regulation, and discrimination or rebating of the kind once practiced is no longer possible. The Commission finds that it was the attitude of the packers that their patronage was a thing of value to the Stock Yards and they proposed to sell that patronage to the Yard Company. The Packers and Stockyards Act having made private arrangements of this kind unlawful,7 the packers now contend that the carriers must protect them against yardage charges on their direct shipments.\n It was the packers themselves who suppressed the competitive yards and alternative facilities for unloading their stock. The Commission, however, has not held the packers to be estopped by their conduct. It has only considered the practice and usage of the packers as bearing on the suitability of the Yard Company's unloading pens as a point of termination of the carriers' responsibility. The Commission has held it to be a reasonable practice that the railroads' responsibility for transportation of such direct shipment consigned by the packers to themselves at the Union Stock Yards ends with unloading into the unloading pens, which it found to be suitable, and that the carriers' failure to negotiate or purchase free egress for such shipments from the unloading pens has \n\n[316 \nU.S. 216, 231]\n\u00a0\n not resulted and does not result in an unreasonable practice. There is evidence to support the determination, and the decision of the administrative body charged with making it is therefore conclusive on this Court. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n III.\n\n\n Having properly decided that transportation ended when the livestock reached the unloading pens, was the Commission in error in concluding that it had no jurisdiction to inquire into the reasonableness of practices or charges of the Yard Company beyond that point?\n The appellants contend that the fact that property of the Yard Company was involved in furnishing egress to the appellants' shipments did not prevent the Commission from exercising such jurisdiction. The Yard Company, they say, was the agent of the railroads and acted in a dual capacity as public stockyards subject to the Packers and Stockyards Act and also as a common carrier by railroad subject to the Interstate Commerce Act. In the latter capacity, it is said, the Yard Company as the railroads' agent provides terminal facilities for livestock delivery which is a part of the railroads' obligation.\n The Stock Yards are named in the railroads' tariffs as a specific station to which the railroad rates to Chicago are applicable. The line- haul railroads publish an allowance to the Yard Company of $1.25 per single-deck car and $1.50 per doubledeck car for unloading livestock. The Yard Company also files with the Interstate Commerce Commission its tariff which publishes the same amounts as charges for unloading the livestock 'as carrier's agent.' Since unloading is required by statute as a part of the transportation service, the filing of the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 216, 232]\n\u00a0\n terms on which it is performed is manifestly proper, although shippers are not concerned with the charge because the railroads absorb it in the line- haul rate. Because the Yard Company in this specific and limited matter acts as agent for the railroads and in the performance of that transportation service is subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, it does not follow that the Commission may regulate either directly or somehow through the railroads, the other practices and charges of the Yard Company.\n If the Yard Company is in the dual position of being at once the agent of the carriers for the unloading of the stock and the principal in rendering any subsequent services, so is it under dual regulatory schemes and authorities. In so far as it is an agency in transportation, it is subject to the Interstate Commerce Act and to the control of the Interstate Commerce Commission. In so far as it performs stockyard services, it is subject to the Packers and Stockyards Act and to the regulation of the Secretary of Agriculture. The statutes clearly disclose an intention that jurisdiction of the Secretary of Agriculture over stockyard services shall not overlap that of the Commission over transportation. \n9\n The boundary between the two is the place where transportation ends, and in this case that is established to be the unloading pens.\n The Union Stock Yards are a public utility. The decision of the Commission that the transportation ends with unloading leaves the stock in the hands of a public utility-the Union Stock Yards-for delivery to the consignee. Neither the Interstate Commerce Commission nor this Court can assume that the charges or practices \n\n[316 \nU.S. 216, 233]\n\u00a0\n of that utility are unfair or unreasonable, that it is charging for services that are not performed or facilities not used, or that it is imposing on consignees unnecessary services. Nor can the Commission or this Court assume that if unreasonable practices or charges are imposed by this utility the Secretary of Agriculture would fail to correct them upon an appropriate complaint in a proceeding to which the Yard Company is a party and may defend its practices for itself. In any event, Congress has provided that the Secretary of Agriculture is the forum in which such charges and practices may be questioned and may be weighed in the interest, not only of the packers, but of others who use the Yards and markets and who might be affected competitively by granting the packers' present demands. Congress has established an appropriate forum in which any complaint of the packers against the real party in interest may be heard and any lawful grievances adjusted, and the Commission was quite right in refusing to trespass upon its jurisdiction.\n It follows that the decree below should be and hereby is\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n The question in this case is not where the transportation ends but what the particular transportation service includes. I do not suppose that it would be contended that a railroad could lawfully exact from a passenger who had alighted on the station platform an extra charge for passing through the station to the street. The reason why it could not make that exaction is that although the transportation ended at the platform, the transportation service included free egress from the station. I think that that principle is applicable and controlling here.\n Covington Stock-Yards Co. v. Keith, \n139 \nU.S. 128\n, 11 S.Ct. 461, which arose prior to the Interstate Commerce Act, applied that \n\n[316 \nU.S. 216, 234]\n\u00a0\n principle to the delivery of livestock at stockyards. This Court after stating that a carrier of livestock has no right 'to make a special charge for merely receiving or merely delivering such stock, in and through stock- yards provided by itself', added (pages 135, 136 of 139 U.S., page 463 of 11 S.C t.): 'If the carrier may not make such special charges in respect to stockyards which itself owns, maintains, or controls, it cannot invest another corporation or company with authority to impose burdens of that kind upon shippers and consignees. The transportation of livestock begins with their delivery to the carrier to be loaded upon its cars, and ends only after the stock is unloaded and delivered, or offered to be delivered, to the consignee, if to be found, at such place as admits of their being safely taken into possession.'\n So far as I am aware the Covington case has never been overruled. As recently as 1939 we approved it. For we stated in Union Stock Yard & Transit Co. v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 213, 219\n, 60 S.Ct. 193, 196, after reviewing  1(3) and 15(5) of the Interstate Commerce Act: 'Without the aid of these statutes the transportation of livestock by rail was held to begin with its delivery to the carrier for loading onto its cars, and to end only after unloading for delivery or tender to the consignee at the place of destination. Covington Stock-Yards Co. v. Keith, \n139 \nU.S. 128, 136\n, 11 S.Ct. 461, 463. The same rule has been repeatedly applied since the statute was adopted. Erie R. Co. v. Shuart, \n250 \nU.S. 465, 468\n, 39 S.Ct. 519, 520; Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co. v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 193, 198\n, 55 S.Ct. 748, 751, and cases cited; Denver (Union) Stock Yard Co. v. United States, \n304 \nU.S. 470\n, 58 S.Ct. 990; 2 Hutchison, Carriers, 3d ed.  510.'\n Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co. v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 193\n, 55 S.Ct. 748, did not alter that rule. As stated by the majority in that case (295 U.S. page 200, 55 S.Ct. page 752): 'The Hygrade Company did not seek and the Commission did not grant relief upon the ground that the carriers failed to provide egress from the unloading pens in the public stockyards to the city streets by means of which consignee's animals might be \n\n[316 \nU.S. 216, 235]\n\u00a0\n removed to its plant. Consignee sought free delivery in cars switched into its plant, but the Commission found the switching charge not unreasonable. Consignee also sought free use of the Yards Company's properties including the overhead runway to take its animals from holding pens as well as from unloading pens to its plant.' And the majority added (295 U.S. page 201, 55 S.Ct. page 752): 'Plainly there is an essential difference between the route from unloading pens to consignee's plant and a mere way out to the public highways. Transportation does not include delivery within the Hygrade plant or the furnishing of the properties, overhead runway and all, that are used for that purpose.' Although certain general statements in the opinion are not consistent with the rule of the Covington case, a unanimous Court recently explained Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co. v. United States as follows: 'There the Commission's order directing the discontinuance of appellant's yardage charge to consignees was set aside on the sole ground that the Commission's findings failed to show that the service for which the charge was made was any part of the loading or unloading services, or otherwise a service which the rail carrier was bound to furnish.' Union Stock Yard & Transit Co. v. United States, supra, 308 U.S. page 219, 60 S.Ct. page 196. That is amply supported by the reasons given by the majority itself for setting aside the Commission's order in the Atchison case: 'But the Commission, in respect of the shipments covered by its order, made no definite finding as to what constitutes complete delivery or where transportation ends. Its report does not disclose the basic facts on which it made the challenged order. This court will not search the record to ascertain whether, by use of what there may be found, general and ambiguous statements in the report intended to serve as findings may by construction be given a meaning sufficiently definite and certain to constitute a valid basis for the order.' 295 U.S. pages 201, 202, 55 S.Ct. page 752. And Armour & Co. v. Alton R. Co., \n312 \nU.S. 195\n, 61 S.Ct. 498, did not weaken the rule \n\n[316 \nU.S. 216, 236]\n\u00a0\n of the Covington case. We merely held in that case that the complaint of a packer who sought to be rid of 'yardage charges' raised certain administrative problems necessitating primary resort to the Interstate Commerce Commission. We did not reach in that case the merits of that controversy nor the questions of law involved here. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Hence, I think we reach the question of the application of the rule of the Covington case to this situation unembarrassed by a prior holding.\n I do not agree that Congress has left to the Commission the power to eliminate free egress from this particular transportation service. Whatever may have been the scope of the authority of the Commission prior to the Transportation Act of 1920 (Adams v. Mills, \n286 \nU.S. 397\n, 52 S.Ct. 589), it should be noted that Mr. Justice Brandeis, the author of Adams v. Mills, joined in the dissenting opinion in the Atchison case which repudiated the notion that the transportation service in this type of shipment was completed at the unloading pens. Furthermore, as stated in the dissenting opinion in the Atchison case, it is clear that Congress itself provided a rule in  15(5) of that Act which placed on the Commission the duty and the author- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 216, 237]\n\u00a0\n ity to see to it that tribute was not exacted from a shipper by exaction of a separate charge for egress from the station to the street or other public place. 41 Stat. 456, 486, 49 U.S.C.  15(5), 49 U.S.C.A.  15(5). That section so far as material here provides that transportation wholly by railroad of ordinary livestock in carload lots received at public stockyards 'shall include all necessary service of unloading and ... delivery at public stockyards of inbound shipments into suitable pens ... without extra charge therefor to the shipper, consignee or owner ....' To say that carriers need not furnish facilities for delivery and immediate removal of livestock by the consignee without extra charge is to give  15(5) an interpretation which is not only 'ingenious' (Atchison, T . & S.F.R. Co. v. United States, supra, 295 U.S. page 205, 55 S.Ct. page 754, dissenting opinion) but which is also quite oblivious of the crying abuses which  15(5) was designed to correct. The words 'all necessary service of unloading and ... delivery' of livestock at public stockyards must be taken to include all services at a terminal incidental to obtaining delivery of the livestock. And delivery 'into suitable pens' must be taken 'to mean pens to which the consignees may gain unimpeded access for the purpose of removing their stock'. 295 U.S. page 206, 55 S. Ct. page 754. As stated by Commissioner Eastman in Hygrade Food Products Corp. v. Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co., 195 I.C.C. 553, 559, pens are not 'suitable' within the meaning of  15(5) where they do not 'permit of reasonable opportunity to accept delivery and remove the livestock from the premises after notice of arrival.' Otherwise the purpose of  15(5) in removing 'an old evil' is defeated and 'a crop of new ones' is sanctioned 'by giving stockyards and rail carriers of live stock carte blanche to impose vexatious charges which for more than thirty years had been condemned by this court.' Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co. v. United States, supra, 295 U.S. page 206, 55 S.Ct. page 755, dissenting opinion. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 216, 238]\n\u00a0\n The legislative history of  15(5) was reviewed in the dissenting opinion in the Atchison case. 295 U.S. at pages 207, 208, 55 S.Ct. at page 755. The mandate contained in  15(5) originated with the American National Live Stock Association (59 Cong.Rec. 674) and the National Live Stock Shippers' League. Hearings, Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, H.R. 4378, 66th Cong., 1st Sess., Vol. I, pp. 139- 141. The proposal was not vague. It was that there be 'one through rate on live stock for the whole services from point of origin to the destination at public stockyards used at market place which shall include unloading into suitable pens and delivery therein at such stockyards, where the animals may be counted and checked, including such facilities as are necessary or in use for making such delivery'. Id., p. 141. It was the enactment of the rule of the Covington case which was specifically asked. Id., p. 874. The argument was that a railroad would not 'make two rates to its own pens if it owned and operated them, and neither should it do so with respect to pens which it uses in the same manner. There should be one fare, the same as a passenger rate, to such depot as they use in a given city.' Id., p. 881. The record shows that Congress was alive to the evils of which the shippers complained and that it endeavored to correct them. As stated by the House Managers the aim of the amendment introduced in the Senate and amplified in Conference was to provide that the 'through rates on live stock should include unloading and other incidental charges.' 59 Cong.Rec. 3264. Indeed the sole purpose of the amendment was to impose on the Commission the duty and authority to eliminate the practices condemned by the Covington case. In view of that explicit history it comes as a surprise that the Commission can now abdicate and say that a consignee or owner who has paid a through rate may not have free receipt of his stock at the station. To hold that \n\n[316 \nU.S. 216, 239]\n\u00a0\n the separate charge for unloading livestock into pens which  15(5) outlawed may now be exacted for taking the livestock out is to make the relief afforded by that section illusory indeed.\n But it is said that the matter is subject to the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 and that if relief is to be had, the Secretary of Agriculture must give it. The difficulty with that view is that that Act provides, 'nothing in this Act (chapter) shall affect the power or jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, nor confer upon the Secretary concurrent power or jurisdiction over any matter within the power or jurisdiction of such commission.' 42 Stat. 169, 7 U.S.C.  226, 7 U.S.C.A.  226. The boundary between the Commission and the Secretary of Agriculture is not the place where the transportation ends but the time when the transportation service is completed. It is not completed until the consignee has unimpeded access to the station for the purpose of removing the livestock. That view is supported by Union Stock Yard & Transit Co. v. United States, supra, where the stockyards argued that their loading and unloading services were subject to regulation by the Secretary of Agriculture and not by the Commission. We held that loading and unloading services were 'common carrier services placed under the authority of the Commission by the Interstate Commerce Act.' 308 U.S. page 221, 60 S.Ct. page 197. And we defined the scope of those services in terms of the rule of the Covington case. 308 U.S. page 219, 60 S.Ct. page 196. to call the withholding of the stock until an additional fee is paid, a stockyard 'service' is indeed incongruous. It is to forget over half a century of history. It is to take away part of the protection which Congress afforded shippers by  15(5). It is to interpret  15(5) not liberally as a remedial provision but strictly against the stock raisers for whose ultimate benefit it was passed. For years the carriers and stockyards persistently sought to dignity this type of trib- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 216, 240]\n\u00a0\n ute and exploitation as a 'stock yard service'. Until the present they were unsuccessful. They should fail again. The Covington case states the correct rule. It is that rule which Congress enacted into  15(5) for the protection of the stock raisers who ultimately pay the tribute and vexatious charges which the middle man exacts. It is that rule which we should enforce until Congress changes it.\n The Interstate Commerce Commission followed that rule in Hygrade Food Products Corp. v. Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co., 195 I.C.C. 553. That case met with reversal here. Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co. v. United States, supra. And the opinion of the Court contained a dictum that 'Usage and physical conditions combined definitely to end transportation, at least in respect of these shipments, with unloading into suitable pens as is now required by section 15(5).' 295 U.S. page 201, 55 S.Ct. page 752. It is that dictum which has haunted this litigation and which largely shaped the ruling of the Commission in the instant case. For the Commission proceeded from the premise that there was 'no difference in principle' between the Atchison case and this one and that this Court had stated in the earlier case 'that the obligation of the line-haul carriers ceased when the animals were placed in the unloading pens.' 238 I.C.C. 179, 189, 190, 196. But the Commission was under no such compulsion. Commissioner Alldredge was quite right when he pointed out in his dissenting opinion that the Commission misconstrued the opinion of this Court in the Atchison case. 238 I.C.C. pages 197, 198. Hence the conclusion of the Commission reached in large measure under the compulsion of that erroneous assumption should not be given the weight normally due findings and conclusions of such an expert body.\n We should reaffirm once more the rule of the Covington case and reject the dictum in the Atchison case. We should hold that  15(5) is remedial and should be liberally construed and, as the Commission itself held in the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 216, 241]\n\u00a0\n Atchison case, that this particular transportation service includes the timehonored opportunity of the consignee or owner to go to the station and take away his livestock without payment of an additional toll.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice MURPHY join in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Other phrases of the general problem of the present case have been considered in Adams v. Mills, \n286 \nU.S. 397\n, 52 S.Ct. 589; Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co. v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 193\n, 55 S.Ct. 748; Union Stock Yard & Transit Co. v.

'Under the terms of the contract, complainant could have required delivery of the 15.6 percent of shipments either at the stockyards or on defendants' team tracks, but complainant never requested delivery of those shipments to any point other than the Union Stock Yards.' 238 I.C.C. 179, 189.

There were several questions relating to complex transportations involved in that case which required primary determination by the Commission. They included possible readjustments of rate schedules, possible refunds to shippers, and definition of the boundaries of the station named in the tariff. The statement in the Armour case that the statute did not mark the point where the transportation service was completed 'under all circumstances and conditions and in all cases' (312 U. S. page 200, 61 S.Ct. page 502) is borne out by the Atchison case where the consignee, as we have noted, sought free delivery in cars switched into its plant and the use of an overhead runway from holding pens to its plant. Clearly a determination of the precise facts concerning the characteristics and use of a particular station was necessary before a correct application of the applicable rule of law could be made. \n\n\n\n\n","124":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTAYLOR v. STATE OF GA.(1942)\nNo. 70\nArgued: Decided: January 12, 1942\n\n\n\n\n[315 \nU.S. 25, 26]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Leonard Haas, of Atlanta, Ga., and Thomas Taylor Purdom, of Sparta, Ga., for appellant.\n Mr. C. S. Baldwin, Jr., of Madison, Ga., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BYRNES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant was indicted in the Superior Court of Wilkinson County, Georgia, for violation of  7408 and 7409, of Title 26 of the Georgia Code. Section 7408 provides:\n'Any person who shall contract with another to perform for him services of any kind with intent to procure money, or other thing of value thereby, and not to perform the service contracted for, to the loss and damage of the hirer; or after having so contracted, shall procure from the hirer money, or other thing of value, with intent not to perform such service, to the loss and damage of the hirer, he shall be deemed a common cheat and swindler, and upon conviction shall be punished as for a misdemeanor.'1\n\n And Section 7409 declares: \n\n[315 \nU.S. 25, 27]\n\u00a0\n 'Satisfactory proof of the contract, the procuring thereon of money or other thing of value, the failure to perform the services so contracted for, or failure to return the money so advanced with interest thereon at the time said labor was to be performed, without good and sufficient cause and loss or damage to the hirer, shall be deemed presumptive evidence of the intent referred to in the preceding section.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The indictment alleged that appellant had entered into a contract with R. L. Hardie to perform manual labor for $1.25 a day until he had earned $19.50 at that rate, that he had done so with the intent not to perform the services, that he had thus obtained the $19.50 as an advance, that he had failed without good and sufficient cause to do the work, that he had failed and refused to repay the $19.50, and that loss and damage to Hardie had resulted. Appellant demurred to the indictment, asserting that  7408 and 7409, upon which it was based, were repugnant both to the Thirteenth Amendment and the Act of Congress passed pursuant to it,3 and to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The demurrer was overruled, exception was taken, and the case went to trial.\n Hardie was the only witness for the State. He testified that the agreement had been made, that he had advanced the $19.50, that appellant had neither done the work \n\n[315 \nU.S. 25, 28]\n\u00a0\n nor returned the money, and that although appellant had said something about being sick, he had given no visible sign of it and had not been confined to bed. Under the statutes of Georgia4 appellant could not testify under oath, but he was permitted to make an unsworn statement in which he generally denied that he and Hardie had made the agreement or that Hardie had paid him the $19.50. The trial judge charged the jury in the language of  7408 and 7409. He refused to instruct the jury that these sections are repugnant to the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States.\n The jury returned a verdict of guilty and judgment of conviction was entered. Appellant moved for a new trial on the ground that  7408 and 7409 violated provisions of both the federal and state Constitutions, and the motion was denied. On appeal, the conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Georgia. 191 Ga. 682, 13 S.E.2d 647. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 25, 29]\n\u00a0\n We think the conviction must be reversed. There is no material distinction between the Georgia statutes challenged here and the Alabama statute which was held to violate the Thirteenth Amendment in Bailey v. Alabama, \n219 \nU.S. 219\n, 31 S.Ct. 145.5 It is argued here, just as it was in the Bailey case, that the purpose of  7408 is nothing more than the punishment of a species of fraud, namely, the obtaining of money by a promise to perform services with intent never to perform them. And the presumption created by  7409 is said to be merely a rule of evidence for the trial of cases arising under  7408. Actually, however,  7409 embodies a substantive prohibition which squarely contravenes the Thirteenth Amendment and the Act of Congress of March 2, 1867.6 Its effect is to authorize the jury to convict upon proof that an agreement has been reached, that money has been advanced on the strength of it, that the money has not been returned, that the appellant has failed or refused to perform the services 'without good and sufficient cause,' and nothing more. The necessary consequence is that one who has received an advance on a contract for services which he is unable to repay is bound by the threat of penal sanction to remain at his employment until the debt has been discharged. Such coerced labor is peonage. And it is no less so because a presumed initial fraud rather than a subsequent breach of the employment contract is the asserted target of the statute. It is of course clear that peonage is a form of involuntary servitude within the meaning of the Thirteenth Amendment and that the Act of 1867 is an 'appropriate' implementation of that Amendment. Clyatt v. United States, \n197 \nU.S. 207\n.\n We are told that the manner in which these sections have been interpreted by the courts of Georgia rescues \n\n[315 \nU.S. 25, 30]\n\u00a0\n them from invalidity. It is urged that the phrase 'without good and sufficient cause', which appears in  7409, in effect requires proof of fraudulent intent at the time of making the contract and obtaining the money. But this argument is wide of the mark. The words 'without good and sufficient cause' plainly refer to the failure to perform the services or to return the money advanced. Since the subsequent breach of the contract by the defendant, however capricious or reprehensible, does not establish a fraudulent intent at the initial stage of the transaction, the content which has been assigned to the phrase 'without good and sufficient cause' by the Georgia courts is immaterial. See Bailey v. Alabama, 219 U.S. at pages 233, 234, 31 S.Ct. at page 148.\n Moreover, as the Court observed in the Bailey case, 'the controlling construction of the statute is the affirmance of this judgment of conviction.' 219 U.S. at page 235, 31 S.Ct. at page 149. The most that the jury could have found in the evidence here was proof that the contract had been made, that $19.50 had been advanced, that the appellant had failed to do the work or to return the money, and perhaps that this failure had been 'without good and sufficient cause'. The presumption created by  7409 was thus essential to the conviction.\n It is true that it appears from the record that the Supreme Court of Georgia regarded it as unnecessary to determine the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict because 'the defendant relies solely on constitutional grounds' (191 Ga. 682, 13 S.E.2d 647, 650). And it is also true that it appears from the record that in his brief in that court the appellant stated: 'Inasmuch as the defendant in seeking to set aside his conviction relies solely on constitutional grounds, the evidence set out in the record is material only in so far as it relates to these grounds.' However, the only possible construction of this statement, in the light of appellant's consistent attack upon the presumption created by  7409, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 25, 31]\n\u00a0\n is that appellant agreed to waive any contention that the evidence was insufficient to establish the factors declared by that section to warrant the presumption of an initial intent to defraud. He cannot fairly be said to have conceded more. Consequently, the Georgia Supreme Court could not escape the necessity of passing upon the validity of the presumption raised by  7409 in order to sustain the conviction.\n We are aware that in Wilson v. State, 138 Ga. 489, 75 S.E. 619, the Supreme Court of Georgia held that Bailey v. Alabama does not require the invalidation of these sections. Its error in so doing arose from a misconception of the scope of the Bailey decision. To be sure, a judicially created rule in Alabama denied to a defendant the opportunity to make any kind of statement as to his uncommunicated motives, and this circumstance drew the notice of the Court, 219 U.S. at pages 228, 236, 31 S.Ct. at pages 146, 149. In Georgia, on the other hand, a defendant is permitted to make an unsworn statement if he chooses. But the opinion in the Bailey case leaves no doubt that this factor was far from controlling and that its effect was simply to accentuate the harshness of an otherwise invalid statute.\n We think that the sections of the Georgia Code upon which this conviction rests are repugnant to the Thirteenth Amendment and to the Act of 1867, and that the conviction must therefore be reversed.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 1065 of the Georgia Penal Code (Ga.Code (1933), Title 27,  2506) provides: 'Except where otherwise provided, every crime declared to be a misdemeanor shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000, imprisonment not to exceed six months, to work in the chain gang on the public roads, or on such other public works as the county or State authorities may employ the chain gang, not to exceed 12 months, any one or more of these punishments in the discretion of the judge ....' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] These two sections were enacted as sections one and two of the Act of August 15, 1903.

GASKILL(1942)\nNo. 139\nArgued: Decided: March 2, 1942\n\n\n\n\n[315 \nU.S. 442, 443]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wymer Dressler, Mr. Wilfred M. McFarland, and Mr. Robert D. Neely, all of Omaha, Neb., for petitioners.\n Mr. S. L. Winters, of Omaha, Neb., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is whether the record shows an essential requisite of the jurisdiction of the District Court, namely, that the 'matter in controversy exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of $3,000'. Judicial Code,  24(1), 28 U.S.C.  41(1), 28 U.S.C.A .  41(1). There were other questions which, in the view we take of the case, need not be stated.\n Respondents, forty-one conductors and brakemen employed by the Chicago & Northwestern Railway Company, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 442, 444]\n\u00a0\n brought suit against the railroad and one Kimball, an employee of the road, in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska. The complaint alleged that the plaintiffs 'belong to' the trackage of the railroad called the Nebraska Division; that 'the controversy arises over the division of seniority rights between the Nebraska Division to which plaintiffs belong, and the Sioux City Division to which the defendant George Kimball belongs, over the Northwestern road from Omaha, Nebraska to Sioux City, Iowa'; that trains running between these points moved over 31 miles of the Nebraska Division and 70 miles of the Sioux City Division; that prior to May 1, 1930, seniority rights of the plaintiffs were governed by certain contracts 'referred to sometimes as the 'Schedule of Wages and Rules of Compensation for Conductors and Trainmen\", which provided that when trains were operated over more than one seniority district, the 'percentage of miles run over each division will govern in assignment to such runs'; that since May 1, 1930, the railroad has assigned all of the work on the Omaha-Sioux City run to the Sioux City Division; that although the railroad insists that the plaintiffs' seniority rights have been abrogated 'by an alleged agreement between the said defendant railroad trainmen, and the order of Railway Conductors', the plaintiffs are not bound by such agreement; and that on account of the 'wrongful deprivation' of their seniority rights, the plaintiffs have been damaged in excess of $3,000.\n The railroad's answer stated that the plaintiffs had only such seniority rights as were derived from agreements between the railroad and the Order of Railroad Conductors and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen; that the agreements could be abrogated or modified by the railroad and the unions without the consent of the plaintiffs; that the track between Omaha and Blair, located on the Omaha- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 442, 445]\n\u00a0\n Sioux City run, was not part of the Nebraska Division of the railroad; that this trackage is owned by the Chicago, St. P., M. & O. Railway Company; that the only part of the Nebraska Division on the run between Omaha and Sioux City is 7.5 miles long; and that the complaint did not show the existence of the required jurisdictional amount. The District Court ordered the plaintiffs to prove that more than $3,000 was involved, and ten of them submitted affidavits. The substance of each affidavit was that since May 1, 1930, the Chicago & Northwestern had 'operated trains over thirty-one miles of the Nebraska Division in violation of existing contracts', and that 'to the best of (affiant's) knowledge and ability', his loss exceeded $3,000. The defendants submitted affidavits supporting the allegations of their answers. But neither the pleadings nor the affidavits of the parties contain the terms of the various agreements referred to in the complaint and upon which the plaintiffs' action is based.\n Upon the defendants' motion to dismiss the cause for want of jurisdiction, the District Court held that the pleadings and supporting affidavits established that 'the amount in controversy as to any one plaintiff does not amount to as much as $3,000', and that the nature of the suit was not such as to permit aggregation of the claims of all the plaintiffs. Accordingly, the action was dismissed. The first conclusion of the District Court was not challenged either in the Circuit Court of Appeals or before us. The plaintiffs contended that their claims should be aggregated because 'the rights of the plaintiffs are so interlocked and interwoven that the rights of one cannot be determined without the others being parties thereto'. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal, holding that the plaintiffs' claims could be aggregated for purposes of determining the value of the matter in controversy. The Court stated that although it found the com- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 442, 446]\n\u00a0\n plaint 'very difficult of analysis', it had construed it 'most favorably to the pleader, for the purpose of passing on the sole question of jurisdiction raised on the appeal.' 8 Cir., 119 F.2d 105, 108. We brought the case here, \n314 \nU.S. 590\n, 62 S.Ct. 68, 86 L.Ed. --, in view of the important question affecting the jurisdiction of the district courts.\n The policy of the statute conferring diversity jurisdiction upon the district courts calls for its strict construction. Healy v. Ratta, \n292 \nU.S. 263, 270\n, 54 S.Ct. 700, 703; and see Town of Elgin v. Marshall, \n106 \nU.S. 578, 580\n, 1 S.Ct. 484, 486. Accordingly, if a plaintiff's allegations of jurisdictional facts are challenged by the defendant, the plaintiff bears the burden of supporting the allegations by competent proof. McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., \n298 \nU.S. 178, 188\n, 189 S., 56 S.Ct. 780, 784, 785; KVOS, Inc. v. Associated Press, \n299 \nU.S. 269, 278\n, 57 S.Ct. 197, 200. Gibbs v. Buck, \n307 \nU.S. 66, 72\n, 59 S.Ct. 725, 729. The bill must be dismissed if the evidence in the record does not support the allegations as to jurisdictional amount. And our review of the District Court's determination of the jurisdictional amount must be confined to this record. Henneford v. Nor. Pacific Ry., \n303 \nU.S. 17, 19\n, 58 S.Ct. 415, 416; Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., \n306 \nU.S. 583, 589\n, 590 S., 59 S.Ct. 744, 748, 749\n\n\n Since the record does not contain the various agreements upon which the plaintiffs' action is founded, there is no basis for determining whether this is a suit 'in which several plaintiffs, having a common undivided interest, unite to enforce a single title or right, and in which it is enough that their interests collectively equal the jurisdictional amount', Lion Bonding & Surety Co. v. Karatz, \n262 \nU.S. 77, 86\n, 43 S.Ct. 480, 483; see Shields v. Thomas, 17 How. 3, 5; Troy Bank v. Whitehead & Co., \n222 \nU.S. 39, 40\n, 41 S., 32 S.Ct. 9; Gibbs v. Buck, \n307 \nU.S. 66, 74\n, 75 S., 59 S.Ct. 725, 730, or one in which 'the matters in dispute are separate and distinct, and are joined in one suit for convenience or economy', Davis v. Schwartz, \n155 \nU.S. 631, 647\n, 15 S.Ct. 237, 243; see Clay v. Field, \n138 \nU.S. 464, 479\n, 480 S., 11 S.Ct. 419, 425; Russell v. Stansell, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 442, 447]\n\u00a0\n \n105 \nU.S. 303\n. Aggregation of plaintiffs' claim cannot be made merely because the claims are derived from a single instrument, Pinel v. Pinel, \n240 \nU.S. 594\n, 36 S.Ct. 416, or because the plaintiffs have a community of interest, Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., \n306 \nU.S. 583\n, 59 S.Ct. 744. In a diversity litigation the value of the 'matter in controversy' is measured not by the monetary result of determining the principle involved, but by its pecuniary consequence to those involved in the litigation. Wheless v. St. Louis, \n180 \nU.S. 379, 382\n, 21 S.Ct. 402, 403; Oliver v. Alexander, 6 Pet. 143, 147.\n The record contains no showing of the requisite jurisdictional amount, and the District Court was therefore without jurisdiction. The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court without prejudice to an application for leave to amend the bill of complaint.\n So ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","126":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTULEE v. STATE OF WASHINGTON(1942)\nNo. 318\nArgued: March 3, 1942Decided: March 30, 1942\n\n\n\n Messrs. Francis Biddle, Atty. Gen., and Nathan R. Margold, of Washington, D.C., for appellant.\n Mr. T. H. Little, of Olympia, Wash., for appellee. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 681, 682]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant, Sampson Tulee, a member of the Yakima tribe of Indians, was convicted in the Superior Court for Klickitat County, Washington, on a charge of catching salmon with a net without first having obtained a license as required by state law. \n1\n The Supreme Court of Washington affirmed. 7 Wash.2d 124, 109 P.2d 280. The case is here on appeal under Section 237(a) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  344(a), 28 U.S.C.A.  344( a), the appellant challenging the validity of the Washington statute as applied to him on the ground that it was repugnant to a treaty made between the United States and the Yakima Indians.\n In 1855, the Yakimas and other Indians owned and occupied certain lands in the Territory of Washington, which the United States wished to open up for settlers. May 29, 1855, representatives of the government met in council with representatives of the Indians, and after extended discussions lasting until June 11, the Indians agreed to a treaty, under which they were to cede 16,920 square miles of their territory, reserving 1,233 square miles for the confederated tribes represented at the meeting. As consideration for the cession by the Indians, a cession which furthered the national program of transforming wilderness into populous, productive territory, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 681, 683]\n\u00a0\n the government agreed to pay $200,000; to build certain schools, shops, and mills and keep them equipped for twenty years; to erect and equip a hospital; and to provide teachers and various helpers for twenty years. This agreement was ratified and proclaimed as a treaty in 1859. 12 Stat. 951.\n The appellant claims that the Washington statute compelling him to obtain a license in order to fish for salmon violates the following provision of Article III of the treaty:\n'The exclusive right of taking fish in all the streams, where running through or bordering said reservation, is further secured to said confederated tribes and bands of Indians, as also the right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places, in common with citizens of the Territory, and of erecting temporary buildings for curing them; together with the privilege of hunting, gathering roots and berries, and pasturing their horses and cattle upon open and unclaimed land.'\n\n The state does not claim power to regulate fishing by the Indians in their own reservation. Pioneer Packing Co. v. Winslow, 159 Wash. 655, 294 P. 557. Nor does it deny that treaty rights of Indians, whatever their scope, were preserved by Congress in the act whcih created the Washington Territory and the enabling act which admitted Washington as a state. 10 Stat. 172; 25 Stat. 676. Relying upon its broad powers to conserve game and fish within its borders,2 however, the state asserts that its right to regulate fishing may be exercised at places like the scene of the alleged offense which, althugh within the territory originally ceded by the Yakimas, is outside of their reservation. It argues that the treaty should not be con- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 681, 684]\n\u00a0\n strued as an impairment of this right and that since its license laws do not discriminate against the Indians, they do not conflict with the treaty. The appellant, on the other hand, claims that the treaty gives him an unrestricted right to fish in the 'usual and accustomed places', free from state regulation of any kind. We think the state's construction of the treaty is too narrow and the appellant's too broad; that while the treaty leaves the state with power to impose on Indians equally with others such restrictions of a purely regulatory nature concerning the time and manner of fishing outside the reservation as are necessary for the conservation of fish,3 it forecloses the state from charging the Indians a fee of the kind in question here.\n In determining the scope of the reserved rights of hunting and fishing, we must not give the treaty the narrowest construction it will bear. In United States v. Winans, \n198 \nU.S. 371\n, 25 S.Ct. 662, 664, this Court held that, despite the phrase 'in common with citizens of the territory', Article III conferred upon the Yakimas continuing rights, beyond those which other citizens may enjoy, to fish at their 'usual and accustomed places' in the ceded area; and in Seufert Bros. Co. v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 194\n, 39 S.Ct. 203, a similar conclusion was reached even with respect to places outside the ceded area. From the report set out in the record before us of the proceedings in the long council at which the treaty agreement was reached, we are impressed by the strong desire the Indians had to retain the right to hunt and fish in accordance with the immemorial customs of their tribes. It is our responsibility to see that the terms of the treaty are carried out, so far as possible, in accordance with the meaning they were understood to have by the tribal representatives at the council and in a \n\n[315 \nU.S. 681, 685]\n\u00a0\n spirit which generously recognizes the full obligation of this nation to protect the interests of a dependent people. United States v. Kagama, \n118 \nU.S. 375, 384\n, 6 S.Ct. 1109, 1114; Seufert Bros. Co. v. United States, supra, 249 U.S. pages 198, 199, 39 S.Ct. page 205.\n Viewing the treaty in this light we are of the opinion that the state is without power to charge the Yakimas a fee for fishing. A stated purpose of the licensing act was to provide for 'the support of the state government and its existing public institutions.' Laws of Washington, 1937, c. 149, pp. 529, 534. The license fees prescribed are regulatory as well as revenue producing. But it is clear that their regulatory purpose could be accomplished otherwise, that the imposition of license fees is not indispensable to the effectiveness of a state conservation program. Even though this method may be both convenient and, in its general impact fair, it acts upon the Indians as a charge for exercising the very right their ancestors intended to reserve. We believe that such exaction of fees as a prerequisite to the enjoyment of fishing in the 'usual and accustomed places' cannot be reconciled with a fair construction of the treaty. We therefore hold the state statute invalid as applied in this case.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington is reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'It shall be unlawful to catch, take or fish for food fish with any appliance or by any means whatsoever except with hook and line ... unless license so to do has been first obtained ....'

William H. Davis and Dean S. Edmonds, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Samuel E. Darby, Jr., of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the respondent to restrain the petitioner from infringing claims 8 and 9 of reissue patent No. 20,370. The application for reissue was filed September 25, 1936, and granted May 18, 1937. The original patent was No. 1,998,878, applied for March 22, 1932, and granted April 23, 1935, to Theodore Emile Lefort of Paris, France, for a 'Process for the Production of Ethylene Oxide'. The application was based on earlier French patents. The respondent purchased the United States patent in April 1936, and, as a result of its study thereof, the patentee was persuaded to apply for the reissue.\n If the reissue patent is valid, no question is now raised as to petitioner's infringement of the claims in suit. The District Court held the patent valid and infringed. \n1\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. \n2\n We took the case because of an apparent conflict with decisions of this court and several Circuit Courts of Appeals, to the effect that a reissue patent must, under the statute, be for the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 668, 670]\n\u00a0\n same invention as the original patent. \n3\n The petitioner also raised a question as to intervening rights which, in the view we take, need not be considered or decided.\n Ethylene is a hydrocarbon gas, C2H4. For a long time it was thought impossible directly to oxygenize it to form C2H4O by bringing oxygen and ethylene into contact, though the formation of ethylene oxide by direct oxidation was commercially desirable. Efforts at direct oxidation, instead of producing the oxide, resulted in less desirable oxygenated compounds such as aldehydes. Lefort conceived the idea of effecting the oxidation by catalytic reaction, that is, the use of a substance, which, in some unexplained way, causes a chemical union or reaction when the two substances to be affected are brought into contact in its presence under given conditions. He recognized one incident of the direct oxidation process as applied to ethylene tending to decrease its efficiency, namely, that, in addition to the principal reaction producing C2H4O, there occurs a side reaction by which a portion of the ethylene is converted into carbon dioxide and water, and, to that extent, the ethylene is wasted. He found that, by certain control of the process, this side reaction could be so restricted as not to decrease the production of ethylene oxide below a profitable level.\n According to both the original patent and the reissue, ethylene and oxygen are to be introduced into a heated reaction chamber in the presence of a catalyzer. The petitioner insists that the original patent also treats as \n\n[315 \nU.S. 668, 671]\n\u00a0\n a mandatory or necessary step the voluntary introduction of water, whereas the reissue in specification and claims 8 and 9 omits this requirement, and therefore describes a different process. The respondent, on the other hand, asserts that as both patents describe the oxygen of air as that which may be used, and as atmospheric air contains moisture, the first, specifying water, and the reissue specifying air, both contemplate the introduction of water in some form and therefore are for the same process. 4 This dispute must be resolved by a comparison of the disclosures of the two instruments. If that comparison leads to the conclusion that the reissue is not for the same invention as the original, the reissue is void as not within the terms of the statute.\n We shall postpone discussion of the tests of identity or difference of invention, and the use of expert testimony, to a statement of the criteria of judgment furnished by the language of the specifications and claims of the two documents.\n The opening paragraph of the original patent is:\n'This invention has for object a process for the production of ethylene oxide which mainly consists in subjecting ethylene to the simultaneous action of the oxygen of air and of water in presence of a catalyzer and, if need be, of hydrogen.'\n\n After referring to the use of hydrogen as optional, the specification deals with the character and composition of metals to be used as catalyzers. It then speaks of the elements to be used to obtain the desired reaction thus: \n\n[315 \nU.S. 668, 672]\n\u00a0\n 'The ethylene can be obtained from any source of supply: ...\n'Water can be admitted to the reaction vessel, either in the liquid state, or as steam.\n\n'The oxygen can be the oxygen of the air, this latter gas being introduced in the reaction.'\n\n Immediately following, it is said:\n'The efficiency of the reaction is increased by diminishing the CO2 which is formed, by introduction, in this reaction, of a suitable quantity of water. A suitable quantity of CO2 can also be previously introduced in the reacting gases.'\n\n The CO2 which it is desired to diminish is that which is formed by the undesirable side reaction above mentioned. This reaction is again mentioned, and the introduction of water again specified thus:\n'Moreover, the applicant has found that the reaction giving CO2 is, contrarily to previous belief, a reaction of oxidation independent from that giving ethylene oxide and from that giving aldehydes. From experiments effected by the applicant, it results that, if water is introduced in suitable quantity, the reaction is not only facilitated, as above stated, but, in addition, the reaction giving CO2, probably by direct oxidation of ethylene according to the equation C(2)H(4) 3O(2) = 2H( 2)O 2CO(2) is checked, owing, as is probable, to the partial pressure of water.'\n\n It is further said that the experiments indicate that the side reaction producing CO2 and water may be completely checked and the efficiency of the reaction producing ethylene oxide increased if CO(2) is previously introduced in addition to the water and the reacting gases.\n Three modi operandi are next indicated as examples. In the first, compressed ethylene and compressed air are led, with or without hydrogen, into a heated tube contain- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 668, 673]\n\u00a0\n ing the catalyzer, the tube being connected with a circulating pump to supply water under pressure. In the second, the catalyzer is introduced and the tube heated and then 'a mixture of ethylene, air, water vapour and hydrogen' is sent through the tube. In the third, the catalyzer is introduced into a high-pressure tube filled with water. Pure ethylene is added 'in order that it can dissolve in the water.' The tube is heated and 'air and hydrogen are slowly introduced.'\n The specification concludes:\n'The experiments ... have shown that, in presence of the catalyzers indicated, water, in the form of steam or not, considerably promotes the reaction ensuring the production of ethylene oxide.'\n\n All of the seven claims include oxygen and water or steam. Claim 1 is typical. It runs:\n'A process for the production of ethylene oxide, consisting in subjecting ethylene to the simultaneous action of oxygen and water, in presence of a catalyst (describing the catalyst) at a temperature between 150 and 400 C.'\n\n In some of the claims the word 'steam' is substituted for 'water'; in two, 'hydrogen' is added.\n Various options or alternatives are mentioned in the specifications, but nowhere in them, or in the claims, is the introduction of water treated as optional or permissive. The District Court made no finding directed to this fact, but the court below definitely holds, and we agree, that, in the process defined in the original patent, the voluntary introduction of water into the reaction chamber is mandatory.\n Experiments conducted by the respondent just before it acquired the patent demonstrated that ethylene oxide could be produced by passing ethylene and air over a catalyst at the temperature described in the patent without the voluntary introduction of water. Its patent attorney was asked to study the patent and he concluded that Le- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 668, 674]\n\u00a0\n fort should have obtained far broader claims. He prepared two oaths for execution by Lefort to support the application for reissue.\n In the first it was averred that the specification and claims failed to emphasize the fact that the reaction takes place 'whether or not water is present'; and that the attorney in drawing the application had not been adequately instructed that the 'fullest benefit and application' of the invention was the production of the oxide in the presence of the catalyst 'with or without the inclusion of water in the reaction'.\n After rejection, the second affidavit was filed. This stated that a certain amount of water was necessarily present in the reaction chamber due to the side reaction which gives CO2 and water, and that the introduction of additional water and carbon dioxide was merely permissive in order to augment the quantities already formed by that reaction.\n Thereupon reissue was granted with a rewritten specification, the seven original claims and two new ones, 8 and 9, which are those in suit.\n The substituted specification opens thus:\n'This invention provides a specific and novel process for making ethylene oxide. It essentially consists in causing ethylene to combine directly with molecular oxygen at temperatures of about 150 to about 400 C. in the presence of a surface catalyst which favors the oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide under these conditions.'\n\n The statement is made that ethylene from any source can be used, and that the oxygen can be that of the air.\n The only reference to the introduction of water is:\n'The oxidation of ethylene takes place with a giving off of heat, and it is, of course, desirable to maintain the temperature of the zone of reaction within the range specified. This can be facilitated by suitable dilution of the reaction \n\n[315 \nU.S. 668, 675]\n\u00a0\n gases, such as that accomplished by the use of air as the source of oxygen, and some water or carbon dioxide in addition to that formed can be admitted to the mixture in the reaction zone if desired. Hydrogen may be similarly added.'\n\n The description of the mode of conducting the process differs from all those given in the original specification in omitting the introduction of water.\n The specification concludes:\n'In any case, the ethylene and oxygen are thus reacted simultaneously at the temperatures set forth in the presence of a surface catalyst and of water'.\n\n The new claims 8 and 9 are broader than those of the original patent. 5 It will suffice to quote 8. It is:\n'The process of making ethylene oxide by the direct chemical combination of oxygen with ethylene in the proportions of one atom of oxygen to one molecule of ethylene, which comprises forming a mixture containing ethylene and molecular oxygen and conducting said mixture through a confined reaction zone which is maintained at an elevated temperature; controlling said temperature to maintain said mixture in said zone at a temperature between about 150 and about 400 C; subjecting said mixture in said zone at said elevated controlled temperature to intimate contact with an active surface catalyst' (describing it, inter alia, as one which favors the formation of 'oxidation products containing ethylene oxide in the presence of water.') and describing other steps not necessary to be recited.\n\n The question is whether, in the light of the disclosures contained in the two patents, they are for the same invention. This court has said that they are if the reissue \n\n[315 \nU.S. 668, 676]\n\u00a0\n fully describes and claims the very invention intended to be secured by the original patent;6 if the reissue describes and claims only those things which were embraced in the invention intended to have been secured by the original patent;7 if the broader claims in the reissue are not merely suggested or indicated in the original specification but constitute parts or portions of the invention which were intended or sought to be covered or secured by the original patent. \n8\n The required intention does not appear if the additional matter covered by the claims of the reissue is not disclosed in the original patent. \n9\n If there be failure of disclosure in the original patent of matter claimed in the reissue, it will not aid the patentee that the new matter covered by the reissue was within his knowledge when he applied for his original patent. \n10\n And it is not enough that an invention might have been claimed in the original patent because it was suggested or indicated in the specification. It must appear from the face of the instrument that what is covered by the reissue was intended to have been covered and secured by the original. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n As the Circuit Court of Appeals held, the original specification and claims treated the voluntary introduction of water into the reaction chamber as a necessary step in the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 668, 677]\n\u00a0\n process whereas such introduction is made permissive by the reissue. We agree with that court's view that there is thus a difference between the procedure described in the two documents. But we cannot agree with its conclusion that the difference is so insubstantial as not to invalidate the new claims 8 and 9. On the face of the papers the process described in the original patent included a step not designated as optional or desirable but described and claimed as an integral part of the whole operation. In contrast, the reissue treats this step as immaterial and mentions the introduction of water as for the mere purpose of controlling the temperature in the reaction zone-a thought not even suggested by the specification of the original patent which, on the contrary, in its very first sentence, speaks of the simultaneous action of the oxygen of air and of water.\n We think it plain that the reissue omitted a step in the process which was described and claimed as essential in the original patent. The court below was persuaded by expert testimony that, from a chemist's point of view, the prescribed step (the introduction of water) was immaterial; in other words, chemists testified that, by carrying out the procedure, omitting the introduction of water, they obtained the results described in the patent. Naturally enough this fact led them to state, as chemists, that the introduction of the water was immaterial. Apparently this testimony induced both of the courts below to conclude that Lefort, when he applied for his original patent, knew that the introduction of water was unnecessary. The inquiry at once arises, if this were so, why did he not say so. If he had discovered a process, which the claims of the reissue are certainly broad enough to cover-that of mixing dry oxygen and ethylene in the presence of a catalyst at the prescribed temperature to produce ethylene oxide-it is not understood why, throughout his \n\n[315 \nU.S. 668, 678]\n\u00a0\n specifications and claims, he spoke of exposing ethylene to the simultaneous action of oxygen and water or steam.\n We think the court below fell into error in adopting the scientific conclusion of expert witnesses that the result would be the same whether water were introduced into the reaction chamber or not as proof that Lefort's invention was not what he stated it to be in his original patent but rather the invention of a process of bringing ethylene and oxygen into contact in the presence of a catalyst.\n Although it is the duty of a court to determine for itself, by examination of the original and the reissue, whether they are for the same invention, it is permissible, and often necessary, to receive expert evidence to ascertain the meaning of a technical or scientific term or term of art so that the court may be aided in understanding not what the instruments mean but what they actually say. \n12\n It is inadmissible to enlarge the scope of the original patent by recourse to expert testimony to the effect that a process described and claimed in the reissue, different from that described and claimed in the original patent, is, because equally efficacious, in substance that claimed originally. 13 If such testimony could tip the scales on the issue of the validity of a reissue, it would always be possible to substitute any new combination of steps or elements or devices for the one originally described and claimed by proving that the omission of any one or more steps would not alter the result.\n This court has uniformly held that the omission from a reissue patent of one of the steps or elements prescribed in the original, thus broadening the claims to cover a new and different combination, renders the reissue void, even though the result attained is the same as that brought about by following the process claimed in the original patent. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 668, 679]\n\u00a0\n In Russell v. Dodge, \n93 \nU.S. 460\n, 464, the original patent was for treating skins by the use of a compound in which heated fat liquor was expressly stated as an essential ingredient. There was no disclosure that the fat liquor could be used cold. In a reissue the specification was altered by eliminating the requirement that the liquor be heated. The court said:\n'The change made in the old specification, by eliminating the necessity of using the fat liquor in a heated condition, and making in the new specification its use in that condition a mere matter of convenience, and the insertion of an independent claim for the use of fat liquor in the treatment of leather generally, operated to enlarge the character and scope of the invention. The evident object of the patentee in seeking a reissue was not to correct any defects in specification or claim, but to change both, and thus obtain, in fact, a patent for a different invention. This result the law, as we have seen, does not permit.'\n\n In Gill v. Wells, 22 Wall. 1, the original patent disclosed and claimed a machine for making hat bodies. One of the elements of the machine was a tunnel through which a current of air was to be passed. The specifications did not indicate that this part could be omitted. The reissue for a machine without any tunnel, was held invalid. The court said at page 26 of 22 Wall.:\n'Argument to show that an invention consisting of a combination of three ingredients which are old is not the same as that of a combination of four old ingredients is quite unnecessary, as the negative of the proposition is as well settled in the patent law as it is in mathematics.'\n\n Many other cases might be cited to the same effect.\n The court below was persuaded to construe the reissue patent as not differing from the original by the argument that, in both, the introduction of water was not essential to the technological success of the process. When certiorari was applied for in this court, the respondent in its \n\n[315 \nU.S. 668, 680]\n\u00a0\n brief said: 'The introduction of water, as distinguished from its presence, in the reaction zone is not 'an essential feature' in the invention at bar, and was not 'described and claimed in the original patent as an essential feature.\"\n This argument goes upon the theory that if the presence of water is necessary to the reaction, its presence is assured by the side reaction we have mentioned which produces CO2 and water. It does not explain, however, why, if this is the source of the necessary water, Lefort did not say so in his original patent. Nor does it suggest how the reaction can be initiated or caused when dry oxygen is used and the side reaction has not commenced.\n In the argument on the merits in this court, the respondent shifted its position. In brief and argument it stated that both the original and reissue cover the same invention for if both require the introduction of water, the described introduction of air effects also the introduction of water since atmospheric air contains both oxygen and moisture. It is thus sought to avoid the finding of the Circuit Court of Appeals that the original patent called for the voluntary introduction of water and the reissue does not. This argument fails to square with the specification or claims of either the original patent or the reissue. The claims of the original patent are not limited to the oxygen of air; and the specification merely says the oxygen 'can be the oxygen of air.' The specification and claims of the reissue are satisfied by the introduction of dry oxygen.\n In short, to avoid the difficulties which stare one in the face when the attempt is made to read specifications and claims as calling for the same process, the respondent is driven to take inconsistent positions neither of which comports with the plain language of the two patents. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 668, 681]\n\u00a0\n We hold that the reissue is not for the same invention described and claimed and intended to be secured by the original patent and is, therefore, void.\n The decree is reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 34 F.Supp. 813. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 4 Cir., 121 F.2d 665. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] R.S.  4916, 35 U.S.C.  64, 35 U.S.C.A.  64: 'Whenever any patent is wholly or partially inoperative or invalid, by reason of a defective or insufficient specification, or by reason of the patentee claiming as his own invention or discovery more than he had a right to claim as new, if the error has arisen by inadevertence, accident, or mistake, and without any fraudulent or deceptive intention, the Commissioner shall ... cause a patent for the same invention, and in accordance with the corrected specification, to be reissued. ...'

Francis Biddle, Atty. Gen., and Arnold Raum, of Washington, D. C., for petitioners.\n Mr. Arthur, D. Welton, Jr., of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By an indenture denominated a 'lease' respondent in 1864 granted, demised and leased to Chicago & Alton Railroad Co. all of its railroad property, real and personal. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 44, 45]\n\u00a0\n The 'lease' was in perpetuity upon specified terms and conditions. The Chicago & Alton Railroad Co. covenanted and agreed, inter alia, to guarantee and pay quarterly to the holders of the fifteen thousand shares of capital stock of respondent an annual dividend of seven per cent on the par value of the shares; to deposit with a designated depository specified monthly sums to be placed to the credit of the stockholders and to be held as a fund for the purpose of paying the dividends; to pay the dividends without any deduction for any federal tax whatsoever; to pay all taxes which may be due to the United States 'on account of said dividend so paid from time to time'; and to pledge to respondent thirty-seven parts out of two hundred and fifty-seven parts of the gross receipts of the line between the cities of Alton and Chicago for the purpose of securing the performance of its various covenants. The 'lease' contained no defeasance clause.\n The annual dividend is.$7.00 per share and totals $105,000.00. This amount has been paid directly to respondent's stockholders every year since 1864-by Chicago & Alton Railroad Co. until acquisition of the property in 1931 by the Alton Railroad Co., and since then by the latter company. The dispute here is over federal income taxes for the years 1931, 1932, 1933 and 1934. Respondent, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Illinois, filed its income tax return for each of those years reporting the $105,000.00 of dividends paid its shareholders as its income. The resulting tax was paid each year by the Alton Railroad Co. In addition the latter paid each year for respondent an additional tax on the amount of the income tax on $105,000.00 on the theory that the latter constituted additional taxable income to respondent. Respondent filed claims for refund for the additional tax paid in 1931 and for all the income taxes paid on its behalf for the other years in question \n\n[315 \nU.S. 44, 46]\n\u00a0\n on the theory that the income on which those taxes were paid was not realized by it. On rejection of those claims by the Commissioner respondent instituted suit in the District Court. That court rendered judgment for the petitioner. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, one judge dissenting. 118 F.2d 174. We granted the petiton for certiorari, \n314 \nU.S. 591\n, 62 S.Ct. 70, 86 L.Ed. --, because of the conflict between that decision and the governing principles of Gold & Stock Telegraph Co. v. Commissioner, 83 F.2d 465, United States v. Northwestern Telegraph Co., 83 F.2d 468, and Pacific & Atlantic Telegraph Co. v. Commissioner, 83 F.2d 469, decided by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n Respondent urges, and the court below held, that this so-called lease in perpetuity without a defeasance clause divested respondent of all right, title and interest in the property and vested a full and indefeasible title in the grantee. See Huck v. Chicago & Alton Railroad Co., 86 Ill. 352, 354, 355; Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R.R. Co. v. Boyd, 118 Ill. 73, 7 N.E. 487. Respondent also argues that the indenture of 1864 vested all rights to payment of dividends in its stockholders and divested it of any right to, or control over, such payments. Respondent therefore contends that a corporation which does not own or control property and has no right to, or control over, any income from the property cannot be in receipt of income, constructively or otherwise.\n Such considerations do not dispose of this controversy. In Lucas v. Earl, \n281 \nU.S. 111\n, 50 S.Ct. 241, this Court held that a husband's salary was taxable to him though by contract with his wife half of it vested in her when paid. Mr. Justice Holmes said (281 U.S. at pages 114, 115, 50 S.Ct. at page 241): 'There is no doubt that the statute could tax salaries to those who earned them and provide that the tax could not be escaped by anticipatory arrangements and contracts however skil- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 44, 47]\n\u00a0\n fully devised to prevent the salary when paid from vesting even for a second in the man who earned it. That seems to us the import of the statute before us and we think that no distinction can be taken according to the motives leading to the arrangement by which the fruits are attributed to a different tree from that on which they grew.'\n Precisely that approach was taken in Art. 70 of Treasury Regulations 74, promulgated under the Revenue Act of 1928. It provides in part:\n'Where a corporation has leased its property in consideration that the lessee shall pay in lieu of other rental an amount equivalent to a certain rate of dividend on the lessor's capital stock or the interest on the lessor's outstanding indebtedness, together with taxes, insurance, or other fixed charges, such payments shall be considered rental payments and shall be returned by the lessor corporation as income, notwithstanding the fact that the dividends and interest are paid by the lessee directly to the shareholders and bondholders of the lessor. The fact that a corporation has conveyed or let its property and has parted with its management and control, or has ceased to engage in the business for which it was originally organized, will not relieve it from liability to the tax.'\n\n That long standing regulation1 is plainly applicable here. It covers various kinds of conveyances and leases including those where the grantor or lessor has parted with all rights of management and control over the property. If valid, it governs this case whatever may be the legal incidents of the 1864 indenture under Illinois law. Its validity seems clear. It is a permissible definition of \n\n[315 \nU.S. 44, 48]\n\u00a0\n one item of gross income2 under  22(a) of the Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 791, 797, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 354. Payments made directly to shareholders by the lessee or transferee of corporate property are properly recognized as income to the corporation by reason of the relationship of a corporation to its shareholders. The fact that there is an anticipatory arrangement whereby the taxpayer is not even a conduit of the payments is no more significant in this type of case than it was in Lucas v. Earl, supra.\n The relationship between respondent and its shareholders is an abiding one. They obtain the dividend payments because of their status as shareholders. All questions of the rights of creditors aside, there can be no doubt that a corporation may normally distribute its assets among its stockholders. When it undertakes to do so, its act is nonetheless a corporate act though its shareholders receive new contractual rights enforceable by them alone against the transferee. That is to say their rights to receive the proceeds on the disposal of corporate assets are strictly derivative in origin. The fact that the consideration is made distributable to them directly over a long period of time rather than in one lump payment does not alter the character of those rights. In each case their claims to the proceeds flow from the corporation and are measured by the stake which they have in it. For the rental or purchase payments for the property conveyed by respondent could not lawfully be paid to another without its authority; and it could not lawfully dispose of them to others without the consent of its shareholders. Cf. Raybestos- Manhattan, Inc., v. United States, \n296 \nU.S. 60\n, 56 S.Ct. 63, 102 A.L.R. 111. The fact that the cor- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 44, 49]\n\u00a0\n poration may remain in existence only to maintain a stock transfer book is immaterial. The umbilical cord between it and its shareholders has not been cut. The distribution made is in performance of the obligation owed by the corporation to them. For these reasons the regulation in question merely conforms to accepted legal theory. The conclusion that the dividend payments made to respondent's stockholders were income realized by it likewise marks no innovation in income tax law. That is indicated not only by Lucas v. Earl, supra, but also by those cases which hold that, 'Income is not any the less taxable income of the taxpayer because by his command it is paid directly to another in performance of the taxpayer's obligation to that other.' Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., v. United States, supra, 296 U. S. at page 64, 56 S.Ct. at page 65, 102 A.L.R. 111, and cases cited. The reach of the income tax law is not to be delimited by technical refinements or mere formalism. Helvering v. Clifford, \n309 \nU.S. 331\n, 60 S. Ct. 554.\n Since the dividend payments made to respondent's stockholders were income realized by it, the federal income tax on those sums which was paid by the Alton Railroad Co. was likewise income taxable to respondent.

ROSENBLUM TRUCK LINES(1942)\nNo. 52\nArgued: Decided: January 19, 1942\n\n\n\n Appeals from the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Missouri.\n Messrs. Francis Biddle, Atty. Gen., and Frank Coleman, of Washington, D.C., for appellants. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 50, 51]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Gus O. Nations, of St. Louis, Mo., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are direct appeals by the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission from final decrees of a specially constituted three- judge district court,1 which sustained appellees' separate petitions to annul, set aside and enjoin an order of the Commission entered July 1, 1940, denying appellees' separate applications under the so-called 'grandfather clause' of Section 209(a) of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 543, 552, 49 U.S.C.  309(a), 49 U.S.C.A.  309(a),2 for a permit authorizing operations as a contract carrier by motor vehicle.\n The evidentiary facts are not seriously disputed. Prior to the critical date, July 1, 1935, and until February 1936, appellees and their predecessors in interest3 hauled only for common carriers by motor vehicle, and in each case principally for a single common carrier, between St. Louis and Chicago for which they were paid a lump sum on dock to dock movements. Appellees protected their equipment by carrying fire, theft and collision insurance in their own names. They also paid the operating and maintenance costs. Cargo, public-liability, property-damage, and similar types of insurance for the protection \n\n[315 \nU.S. 50, 52]\n\u00a0\n of the general and the shipping public were taken out by the common carriers and in some instances charged to the appellees. They occasionly paid small cargo damage claims not covered by insurance. The drivers of appellees' trucks were their employees. The specificity with which the common carriers directed the routes to be followed is in some doubt but the drivers were requested to 'sign in' at certain registration stations enroute.\n The greater portion of the traffic of the common carriers which appellees served was carried in the carriers' own vehicles. Appellees' equipment was secured on oral arrangements to handle overflow freight. The freight so handled was always solicited by the common carrier, accumulated at its terminal, loaded and unloaded by its employees, and moved from consignor to consignee on that carrier's way bills. The record is silent as to whether appellees' trucks bore the name of the common carrier on whose behalf they were operated.\n After February 1936 appellees ceased hauling for common carriers by motor vehicle and began hauling for individual shippers in their own right.\n The Commission found that appellees' equipment prior to February 1936 'was operated solely under the direction and control of the common carriers and under the latter's responsibility to the general public and the shippers' and concluded that 'as to such operations applicants ( appellees) do not qualify as carriers by motor vehicle within the meaning of the Act and are consequently not entitled to a certificate or a permit under the 'grandfather' clause of Section 206(a) or 209(a) thereof.' \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The court below set aside the Commission's order, concluding that appellees were in 'bona fide operation as (a) contract carrier(s) in interstate commerce on July 1, 1935' and 'in so operating assumed control, management \n\n[315 \nU.S. 50, 53]\n\u00a0\n and responsibility for the hauling of cargo' and that 'there is no substantial evidence in the record to support the order entered'.5\n The point of divergence between the Commission and the court below seems to have been whether the evidentiary facts supported the Commission's ultimate conclusion that appellees operated solely under the control of the common carriers. Because of our views as to the proper construction of the Act, we need not determine whether substantial evidence supports that conclusion of the Commission. In any event the evidence clearly shows that on the critical date, and from then until February 1936, appellees helped the common carriers move their overflow freight and, as to each job, were an integral part of a single common carrier service offered to the public by the common carrier for whom they hauled.\n The question here, as in any problem of statutory construction, is the intention of the enacting body. Congress has set that forth for us broadly in the declaration of policy6-in essence it is the regulation of transportation by motor carriers in the public interest so as to achieve adequate, efficient and economical service. To implement that policy Congress forbade common carriers by motor vehicle to operate in interstate commerce without securing a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Commission,7 and required contract carriers to secure a permit from that body. \n8\n Those carriers engaged in either of such operations on the respective critical dates and continuously thereafter were to be given the requisite certificate or permit as of right under the 'grandfather' provisos of Sections 206(a) and 209(a). We think it clear that Congress did not intend to grant \n\n[315 \nU.S. 50, 54]\n\u00a0\n multiple 'grandfather' rights on the basis of a single transportation service. Presumably the common carriers which appellees served were entitled to common carrier 'grandfather' rights over the entire line. It was the common carriers who offered the complete transportation service to the general public and the shipper. To hold that appellees, who performed part of that complete transportation service for those common carriers under agreements with them, acquired contract carrier 'grandfather' rights over the same line entitling them also to serve the public is to ascribe to Congress an intent incompatible with its purpose of regulation. The result would be to create in this case two services offering transportation to the public when there had been only one on the 'grandfather' date, without allowing the Commission to determine if the additional service was in the public interest. And, instances can readily be imagined where a single common carrier might utilize the services of several operators such as appellees. Automatically to grant contract carrier rights to such operators might result in such a wholesale distribution of permits as would defeat the very purpose of federal regulation.\n Also indicative of the Congressional intent not to confer contract carrier 'grandfather' rights on operators, such as appellees, who, on the critical date, were not serving the public directly but were instruments performing part of a common carrier service, is the fact that there would seem to be no reason to apply to them the regulatory provisions of the Act generally applicable to contract carriers, such as the requirement that they should secure a permit only after a showing that their operations are 'consistent with the public interest', Section 209(b), or that they should file schedules of their minimum rates, Section 218(a), or that the Commission should prescribe the minimum rates, Section 218(b). The Act clearly contemplates that contract and common carriers will offer com- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 50, 55]\n\u00a0\n peting types of service for Section 210, 49 U.S.C.A.  310, prohibits any person from simultaneously holding a certificate and a permit for the same route or territory unless the Commission finds that such is in the public interest, and Section 218(b) enjoins the Commission, in prescribing minimum rates for contract carriers, to 'give no advantage or preference to any such carrier in competition with any common carrier by motor vehicle subject to this part (chapter)'. The declaration of policy in Section 202(a) which stresses the avoidance of destructive and unfair competition is referred to in the sections dealing with contract carriers. \n 9\n\u00a0\n\n Appellees' contention that their activities on the critical date fall within the literal language of the definition of 'contract carrier' in force on the date of the order10 and that they are therefore entitled to contract carrier 'grandfather' rights is without merit. A holding that the activities of appellees prior to February 1936 were those of contract carriers would not accord with the intent of Congress. Where the plain meaning of words used in a statute produces an unreasonable result, 'plainly at variance with the policy of the legislation as a whole', we may follow the purpose of the statute rather than the literal words. United States v. American Trucking Associa- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 50, 56]\n\u00a0\n tions, \n310 \nU.S. 534, 543\n, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 1064, and cases cited. We conclude that the Commission rightly determined that appellees were not contract carriers within the meaning of the Act prior to February 1936\n\n\n Appellees make no contention that they were common carriers during the period in question and we are clear that they were not, for the Congressional intent to avoid multiple 'grandfather' rights on the basis of a single transportation service is equally applicable to prevent appellees from being considered either as contract or as common carriers within the meaning of the Act. The reasonableness of this interpretation of the Act is apparent. Since appellees' operations, namely, serving the common carriers, on the critical date did not make them 'carriers' within the meaning of the Act, and thus subject to regulation under it, it follows that they are free to engage in such operations without securing the authorization of the Commission. \n11\n But those operations cannot be the basis for appellees' automatically securing permits to serve the public in their own right, a service which they were not performing on the 'grandfather' date.\n The fact that carriers within the meaning of the Act need not deal directly with the public but may act through brokers12 in no wise affects our conclusion. As we have seen, Congress did not intend to confer multiple 'grandfather' rights on the basis of a single transportation service to the public. That difficulty arises only when an operator undertakes to serve a carrier who is serving the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 50, 57]\n\u00a0\n public. It is not present when a carrier deals through a broker.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Convened pursuant to the Urgent Deficiencies Act of 1913, 38 Stat. 220, 28 U.S.C.  47 and 47a, 28 U.S.C.A.  47, 47a, and Section 205(h) of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, rearranged by the Transportation Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 899, as Section 205(g) of Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  305(g). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Motor Carrier Act of 1935 is now designated as Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act. 54 Stat. 919. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] In both of these cases it was the appellee's predecessor in interest who was operating on July 1, 1935.

United States v. Molasky, 7 Cir., 118 F.2d 128. Because questions of importance in the enforcement of this criminal statute and the administration of the revenue laws were raised, we granted certiorari. \n313 \nU.S. 557\n, 61 S.Ct. 1110, 1111.\n In computing net corporate income subject to tax, a deduction is permitted for 'all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business, including a reasonable allowance for salaries or other compensation for personal services actually rendered ....' Sec. 23(a) Revenue Acts of 1932, 1934, and 1936, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  23(a). 47 Stat. 179; 48 Stat. 688; 49 Stat. 1658. 'Dividends' distributed from net corporate profits are not allowable deductions. But 'commissions', if incurred as necessary business expenses and as a reasonable allowance for personal services actually rendered, are deductible from gross income. The larger the allowable deduction the smaller are the net taxable income and the tax imposed. The first four counts of the indictment set out attempts by the defendants to evade income taxes of the Consensus Publishing Company for the years 1933 to 1936, through a fraudulent scheme whereby, under the guise of paying commissions which were deducted from gross income, the corporation distributed dividends deduction of which the statute does not permit. The fifth count sets out a conspiracy to accomplish similar results for the years 1929 to 1936.\n After an examination of the evidence in the record including numerous exhibits, we are satisfied that the \n\n[314 \nU.S. 513, 518]\n\u00a0\n jury could justifiably have found the following facts to be true:\n The Consensus Publishing Company, an Illinois corporation, was organized in 1929 to carry on the business of preparing 'rundown' sheets, daily bulletins containing information on horse racing, and selling them to bookmakers. The original stock ownership was distributed among Arnold Kruse (20 shares), James Ragen, Sr. (20 shares), William Molasky (30 shares), and Cecelia Investment Company (30 shares), a holding company controlled by Moses Annenberg, the dominant figure in several other corporations which were engaged in enterprises connected with betting on horse races. Kruse and Ragen were executives in other Annenberg companies. Molasky alone lived in St. Louis, where Consensus conducted its principal business operations, but he delegated to one Gordon Brooks, an employee of another corporation owned by Molasky, the job of collecting receipts, preparing records and reports, and supervising printing for Consensus, work which took Brooks an hour and a half a day on the average except for the one day each week when the preparation of operating reports for the Chicago office required about three hours.\n For several years Consensus made a weekly distribution of money to its shareholders in direct proportion to their holdings. In the period covered by the indictment, only the 30% of the distribution going to Cecelia Investment Company was treated as dividends in Consensus' tax returns. The remaining 70%, although referred to in some of the corporation's confidential weekly reports to stockholders during the period as 'dividends', was nevertheless in its income tax return deducted from gross income as 'commissions.' The deductions thus claimed were $10, 761 in 1929, $62,961 in 1930, $64,791 in 1931, $57,255 in 1932, $54,538 in 1933, $60,172 in 1934, $76,714 in 1935, and $119,756 in 1936. The book- \n\n[314 \nU.S. 513, 519]\n\u00a0\n keeping system under which 70% of the funds remaining after payment of expenses was charged as commissions was set up in 1929 in accordance with instructions from Arnold Kruse.\n In 1934, Kruse, having learned of a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals that distributions of profits as commissions would not be allowed as a deductible expense if made in accordance with stockholdings, set in motion a series of transactions retroactively modifying the relationship between Consensus and its stockholders. He directed an employee to destroy the original stock book of the company, issue new stock certificates bearing the date of incorporation (September 18, 1929), and then immediately to cancel the new certificates and issue a single certificate for one hundred shares to the Cecelia Investment Company. In 1935 or 1936, Kruse ordered the drawing up of written yearly contracts of employment for the several years from 1930 on between Consensus and the individuals to whom 'commission' payments had since the inception of the company been made. In each contract, the compensation was to correspond identically with the amount that had already actually been paid.\n Except for delays in destroying the original stock book and the original stock certificates, this plan was promptly carried out. Moreover, corporate minutes were drawn up, appropriately back dated, which set out the stock 'issue' and the employment contracts as if they were actual events contemporaneous with the false dates of recording.\n Among the back dated contracts were several between Consensus and the respondent Lester Kruse, son of Arnold. These together with a back dated assignment by Arnold to Lester of his 'contract of employment' with Consensus were to afford ostensible documentation of a shift to Lester, after March, 1933, of the share that had formerly \n\n[314 \nU.S. 513, 520]\n\u00a0\n gone to Arnold. \n1\n Similarly, after 1931, Consensus paid the share that had formerly gone to Ragen to Ragen's son. Here, too, a set of back dated papers documenting the shift was fabricated. After their sons became the nominal recipients of commissions, Kruse and Ragen continued to be connected with the affairs of Consensus. Kruse, for example, directed the creation of the spurious papers and records already described, and Ragen from time to time at least until 1935 signed 'commission' checks of Consensus which were paid in regular course. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n If, from the foregoing and other supporting evidence in the record, the jury could have found that any one of the defendants had, with the intentional cooperation of the others, received 'commissions' without rendering any services whatsoever, it would have been possible for the trial judge to have submitted the case to the jury without calling upon it to decide any questions of reasonableness of compensation for services actually rendered. If, however, each defendant had performed some service for the corporation, the jury would have had to consider whether or not the 'commissions' had intentionally been made excessive so that a portion of payments made in the guise of meeting expenses actually constituted a distribution of dividends. There was evidence which, if believed, tended to establish that each defendant had performed some service, although of an irregular and undefined nature. Hence, it seems to us entirely proper for the trial judge to have submitted the case to the jury with a charge not necessarily calling for a determination of whether all or \n\n[314 \nU.S. 513, 521]\n\u00a0\n none of the 'commissions' paid to each defendant were dividends, but permitting a determination of whether the 'commissions' were intentionally made to include substantial amounts which should have been treated as dividends. Upon such a charge,3 the jury found Arnold Kruse and Ragen guilty on all five counts, and Lester Kruse guilty on counts four and five. 4 \n\n[314 \nU.S. 513, 522]\n\u00a0\n In the charge as given, the Circuit Court of Appeals found reversible error. The gist of the court's argument is contained in the following excerpt from the opinion (118 F.2d 139):\n'We have reached the conclusion that where a statute permits a reasonable deduction for services, a criminal prosecution can not be maintained by proof other than that such services were not rendered. It is not sufficient to allege or prove that a deduction claimed for services is unlawful because the amount charged is unreasonable. Such a charge would leave to the trier of the facts the responsibility for fixing the standard by which a defendant's guilt would be determined. The standard would vary according to the views of different courts and juries. Such a theory would be violative of the defendant's constitutional rights, and void. United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., \n255 \nU.S. 81\n, 41 S.Ct. 298, 14 A.L.R. 1045; International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 \nU.S. 216, 221\n, 34 S.Ct. 853, (854); Collins v. Kentucky, \n234 \nU.S. 634, 638\n, 34 S.Ct. 924, (925).'5\n\n Determination of allowable deductions by reference to a standard of 'reasonableness' is not unusual under federal income tax laws. For example, the deductions allowed for depreciation and obsolescence, for bad debts, and for ordinary and necessary business expenses (other than compensation for services) are designated in the Internal Revenue Code as 'reasonable.' 53 Stat. 1, 12 Secs. 23(l), 23(k)(1), 23(a)(1). If, as the opinion below suggests, the only question that can properly be submitted to the jury is whether the entire deduction is fabricated, an unconscionable taxpayer can immunize himself from the criminal sanctions for tax evasion by the simplest of expedients. He need only find a legitimate item of deduction and then pad it as much as his purpose \n\n[314 \nU.S. 513, 523]\n\u00a0\n requires. By transforming the question 'Should any deduction have been made?' into 'Was the deduction made in excess of a reasonable allowance?' he can, if the theory accepted below be correct, largely destroy the deterrent effect of a penal statute passed by Congress.\n We have concluded, however, that the ground of decision below is untenable. The mere fact that a penal statute is so framed as to require a jury upon occasion to determine a question of reasonableness is not sufficient to make it too vague to afford a practical guide to permissible conduct. Cf. Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373\n, 33 S.Ct. 780. The cases cited by the Court of Appeals affirm no such proposition. In the Cohen Grocery case, this Court held a conviction under Section 4 of the Lever Act, 41 Stat. 297, 298, unconstitutional because the statute left open 'the widest conceivable inquiry, the scope of which no one can foresee and the result of which no one can foreshadow or adequately guard against,' and because an 'attempt to enforce the section would be the exact equivalent of an effort to carry out a statute which in terms merely penalized and punished all acts detrimental to the public interest when unjust and unreasonable in the estimation of the court and jury.' United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., supra, \n255 \nU.S. 89\n, 41 S.Ct. 300, 14 A.L.R. 1045. In the International Harvester case, this Court expressed the view that assurance that the state statute there in issue was complied with called for 'gifts that mankind does not possess.' International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, supra, \n234 \nU.S. 224\n, 34 S.Ct. 856. And in the Collins case, the same statute was said to call for a determination of conduct 'not according to the actualities of life, or by reference to knowable criteria, but by speculating upon imaginary conditions.' Collins v. Kentucky, supra, \n234 \nU.S. 638\n, 34 S.Ct. 925.\n No such unworkable standards are involved here. Section 145 of the Revenue Act of 1932 standing alone is not vague nor does it delegate policy making powers to \n\n[314 \nU.S. 513, 524]\n\u00a0\n either court or jury. It declares that 'any person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed' by the act 'shall ... be guilty of a felony' and specifies penalties in addition to those otherwise provided by law. That such acts of bad faith are not beyond the ready comprehension either of persons affected by the act or of juries called upon to determine violations need not be elaborated. Nor does the particular mode of evasion here alleged, intentional deduction of dividends in the guise of compensation for personal services, so transform the nature of the offense as to make the actors less aware that they are committing it or juries less competent to detect it. The statutory specification of permissible deduction here in question is of long standing. For years thousands of corporations have filed income tax returns in accordance with the direction to deduct 'a reasonable allowance for salaries or other compensation for personal services actually rendered,' and there has not been any apparent general confusion bespeaking inadequate statutory guidance. A finding of unconstitutional uncertainty in this section of the act as applied here would be a negation of experience and common sense.\n On no construction can the statutory provisions here involved become a trap for those who act in good faith. A mind intent upon willful evasion is inconsistent with surprised innocence. Cf. Gorin v. United States, \n312 \nU.S. 19\n, 61 S.Ct. 429; Hygrade Provision Co. v. Sherman, \n266 \nU.S. 497\n, 45 S.Ct. 141; Omaechevarria v. Idaho, \n246 \nU.S. 343\n, 38 S.Ct. 323. And the charge given by the trial court amply instructed the jury that scienter is an essential element of the offense.\n We conclude that it was not error to submit to the jury the question of whether or not the respondents attempted to make unreasonable allowances for personal services. The respondents, however, raise a further objection going not to the propriety of such a submission as a matter of law, but to the insufficiency of the evidence upon which \n\n[314 \nU.S. 513, 525]\n\u00a0\n the jury could have found an answer to the question submitted. They contend that the record discloses that the recipients of commissions performed some services; that the record fails to show that the services disclosed were the only services rendered; that there was no direct testimony as to the total amount of services rendered or the reasonable value thereof; and that, therefore, the jury had no rational basis upon which to conclude that the sums deducted as 'commissions' were more than a reasonable allowance for compensation for the services rendered. We must reject this contention.\n The business conducted by Consensus, a business which, according to the testimony of a person who was in immediate charge of its major operations, normally required only an hour and a half daily of managerial supervision, would hardly seem to call for additional executive services worth what Consensus paid in 'commissions.' The same witness testified that he had never seen some of the recipients of 'commissions', and that his only contact with one of them was two telephone conversations. This testimony, too, belies participation by the respondents in the business activities of Consensus to a degree justifying payment of the high 'commissions'-equal on the average to about half of gross revenues and amounting each year to several times all other wages and salaries6-as a quid pro quo for their services. Moreover, there is the additional circumstance, damaging to the respondents' contention, that year in and year out, 30% of earnings after deduction of expenses was paid to the Cecelia Investment Company as dividends, and 70% to the respondents or other individuals as 'commissions.' This uniformity in the computation of 'compensation' is difficult to reconcile with the variations in extent and kind of personal services which \n\n[314 \nU.S. 513, 526]\n\u00a0\n one would expect to find in accounts reflecting bona fide allowances for personal services. Further, there is the circumstance that the 'commission' payments were always in proportion to original stock holdings. And darkening the whole picture is the atmosphere of purposeful concealment evinced by the destruction of some important corporate papers and the fabrication of others. We are convinced that all of this is sufficient to support a finding by the jury that the respondents willfully attempted to make unreasonable allowances for personal services.\n The respondents also urge that there was a fatal variance between the indictment and the proof in that the indictment alleges that the commission payments were actually dividends in their entirety whereas the evidence indicates that some services were performed. The fifth count of the indictment does refer to 'all of the moneys ... paid ... by virtue of the ... so-called 'Employment Contracts\" as 'in truth and in fact, distributions of profits and dividends.' But the gravamen of the charge is distribution of dividends in the guise of commissions, and the respondents cannot fairly claim that they were not adequately apprised of the nature of the offense. Any variance which existed, at most a matter of the extent of the alleged tax evasion, involves no elements of surprise prejudicial to the respondents' efforts to prepare their defense. Cf. Berger v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 78\n, 55 S.Ct. 629; Bennett v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 333\n, 33 S.Ct. 288.\n The respondents have made further contentions which we conclude after consideration are without merit.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court affirmed. It is so ordered.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS, Mr. Justice MURPHY, and Mr. Justice JACKSON took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Or to his wife. From August, 1932, to March, 1933, Consensus distributed 20% of its earnings to Mrs. Arnold Kruse. No explanation is apparent in the record. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Because of this and other circumstances showing Ragen's continued participation in the affairs of Consensus, we conclude that the argument, separately made on his behalf, that there was insufficient evidence to establish his connection with any scheme to evade taxes, is without merit. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The crucial portions of the District Judge's charge to the jury are as follows:\n'If these sums distributed were distributed as a part of the profits of the corporation, then they should have been accounted for in the income tax report of the Consensus Company as profits and upon that the corporation should have paid a tax, which it did not.\n\n'If, on the other hand, they were intended to and represented actual bona fide compensation to employes of this corporation in the ordinary operation of its business; in other words, if they were ordinary and necessary expenses of the operation of the business, then they were properly deductible as they were deducted and no tax was due upon them.\n\n'We are concerned only with the question of whether these men have entered into a conspiracy, into a scheme whereby as a result this corporation, the Consensus Company, under the guise of commissions, distributed to its shareholders sums that actually represented a division of profits.\n\n'If these defendants had that kind of plan and carried it out, if they wilfully and intentionally entered into such an arrangement, there wouldn't be any question of their guilt.\n\n'It is not necessary for the government under this indictment to prove that all of the sums so distributed to these defendants were profits. It is not necessary that the government prove all of the figures precisely as they are charged in the indictment.

Stein, of Chicago, Ill., for Wrightwood Dairy Co.\n\n\n\n[315 \nU.S. 110, 113]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Francis Biddle, Atty. Gen., and Mr. John S. L. Yost, Sp. Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[315 \nU.S. 110, 115]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The principal questions for our decision are whether certain price regulation by the Secretary of Agriculture of milk produced and sold intrastate is authorized by the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 110, 116]\n\u00a0\n provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of June 3, 1937, 50 Stat. 246, 7 U.S.C.  608c, 7 U.S.C.A.  608c, and is a permissible regulation under the commerce clause of the Constitution.\n Section 8c of the Act authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to issue marketing orders fixing minimum prices to be paid to producers of milk and certain other commodities. Paragraph 1 of the section provides that orders of the Secretary 'shall regulate, in the manner hereinafter in this section provided, only such handling of such agricultural commodity, or product thereof, as is in the current of interstate or foreign commerce, or which directly burdens, obstructs, or affects, interstate or foreign commerce in such commodity or product thereof'.\n The United States sought in the present suit a decree directing respondent to comply with the Secretary's Order No. 41, of August 28, 1939, regulating the handling of milk in the 'Chicago, Illinois, marketing area.' Respondent is a handler in that area of milk which it purchases from producers in Illinois. The order, which is of the type described in the opinion of this Court in United States v. Rock Royal Co-operative, Inc., \n307 \nU.S. 533\n, 551-555, 59 S.Ct. 993, 1002-1004, is by its terms applicable to respondent and purports to carry out the statutory scheme for regulating the price of milk paid to producers, considered in the opinion in that case. By the order the Secretary found that all milk produced for sale in the marketing area 'is handled in the current of interstate commerce, or so as directly to burden, obstruct, or affect interstate commerce in milk or its products ...', and directed that it apply to such 'handling of milk' in the marketing area 'as is in the current of interstate commerce or which directly burdens, obstructs, or affects interstate commerce'.\n The order, as provided by the statute,  8c(5), classifies milk according to its uses, and establishes a formula for determining the minimum price to be paid to producers \n\n[315 \nU.S. 110, 117]\n\u00a0\n for each class of milk. It prescribes the method of determining the value of milk received from producers by each handler during each month. It requires the payment of a uniform unit price to producers, computed by dividing the total value of milk reported by all handlers in the marketing area by the total quantity of such milk, with deductions of certain amounts to provide a cash balance in a 'producer-settlement fund'. The handler is required to pay producers the uniform price, subject to butterfat and location differentials. But he is also required to pay into the settlement fund, or permitted to withdraw from it, as the case may be, certain amounts, depending on whether the total value of the milk used by him is greater, or less, respectively, than his total payments to producers at the uniform price. The amounts withdrawn from the settlement fund by handlers are required to be used to bring the price received by certain producers up to the uniform price set in the order, where, because of the purpose for which the handler has sold it, the value of their milk is less than the uniform price. Handlers are required to make reports to the Administrator containing information necessary for the execution of the order and to bear the expense of administering it.\n Respondent's answer in the District Court sets up that its business is entirely intrastate and that in consequence the statute does not and under the commerce clause can not constitutionally apply to it. The answer also sets up additional grounds, which need not now be considered, for respondent's contention that the order is invalid, and by way of counterclaim prays that the United States and its officers and agents be enjoined from enforcing the order. The court found that respondent had not complied with the order; that in the course of its business it purchases milk from producers within the State of Illinois, processes the milk and sells it in the state 'in competition with the milk of other handlers in the area'; that \n\n[315 \nU.S. 110, 118]\n\u00a0\n none of respondent's milk is physically intermingled with that which has crossed state lines; and that prior to the order 60 per cent of the milk sold in the marketing area was produced in Illinois and 40 per cent in neighboring states, and that at the time of the findings 'over 60 per cent' was produced in Illinois. The record shows that 'approximately 40%' comes from without the state.\n The court held that 'the order was issued by the Secretary in full compliance with the law. All conditions precedent to the effectiveness of said order have occurred', but that the business of the defendant 'was not in the current of interstate ... commerce and did not directly burden, obstruct or affect interstate ... commerce in milk marketed within the Chicago, Illinois, marketing area.' It accordingly decreed that the complaint be dismissed, and granted the injunction prayed by the counterclaim.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, 7 Cir., 123 F.2d 100, 103, on the sole ground that Congress is without authority under the commerce clause to regulate intrastate transactions in milk which affect interstate commerce through competition only. It recognized that respondent's milk is sold in competition with other milk moving interstate; that the 'milk problem is a serious one and apparently for the most effective control requires unified regulations', and that if respondent is not subject to the present regulations '(it) may well be that the effective sanction of the order will wither before the force of competition, the morale of the market will disintegrate, and this attempted solution of the problem by the National Government will fail.' But it concluded that there is a hiatus between the constitutional power of state and nation which precludes any solution of the problem by Congressional legislation.\n We think there is no such hiatus. Congress plainly has power to regulate the price of milk distributed through the medium of interstate commerce, United States v. Rock Royal Co-operative, Inc., supra, and it possesses every power \n\n[315 \nU.S. 110, 119]\n\u00a0\n needed to make that regulation effective. The commerce power is not confined in its exercise to the regulation of commerce among the states. It extends to those activities intrastate which so affect interstate commerce, or the exertion of the power of Congress over it, as to make regulation of them appropriate means to the attainment of a legitimate end, the effective execution of the granted power to regulate interstate commerce. See McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421; United States v. Ferger, \n250 \nU.S. 199\n, 39 S.Ct. 445; Consolidated Edison Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n305 \nU.S. 197, 221\n, 59 S.Ct. 206, 213; United States v. Darby, \n312 \nU.S. 100, 118\n, 119 S., 61 S.Ct. 451, 459, 132 A.L.R. 1430. The power of Congress over interstate commerce is plenary and complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 196. It follows that no form of state activity can constitutionally thwart the regulatory power granted by the commerce clause to Congress. Hence the reach of that power extends to those intrastate activities which in a substantial way interfere with or obstruct the exercise of the granted power.\n Familiar examples are the Congressional power over commodities inextricably commingled, some of which are moving interstate and some intrastate, see United States v. New York Central R.R. CO., \n272 \nU.S. 457, 464\n, 47 S.Ct. 130, 132; the power to regulate safety appliances on railroad cars, whether moving interstate or intrastate, Southern Ry. Co. v. United States, \n222 \nU.S. 20\n, 32 S.Ct. 2; the power to control intrastate rates of a common carrier which affect adversely federal regulation of the performance of its functions as an interstate carrier, Shreveport Case, (Houston, E. & W.T.R.

Northern Securities Company v. United States, \n193 \nU.S. 197\n, 24 S.Ct. 436; Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375\n, 25 S.Ct. 276; United States v.

So too the marketing of a local product in competition with that of a like commodity moving interstate may so interfere with interstate commerce or its regulation as to afford a basis for Congressional regulation of the intrastate activity. It is the effect upon the interstate commerce or its regulation, regardless of the particular form which the competition may take, which is the test of federal power. Cf. Shreveport Case, supra; Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, B. & Q.R.R. Co., supra; National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Corp., \n301 \nU.S. 1\n, 36- 43, 57 S.Ct. 615, 623-627, 108 A.L.R. 1352; United States v. Darby, supra, 312 U.S. page 122, 61 S.Ct. page 461, 132 A.L. R. 1430.\n As the court below recognized, and as seems not to be disputed, the marketing of intrastate milk which competes with that shipped interstate would tend seriously to break down price regulation of the latter. Under the conditions prevailing in the milk industry, as the record shows, the unregulated sale of the intrastate milk tends to reduce the sales price received by handlers and the amount which they in turn pay to producers. Study of the order which we have summarized makes clear that the unregulated handler selling fluid milk can pay producers substantially less than the minimum price set in the order for milk of that class, and yet pay as much as, or more than, the 'uniform price' prescribed by the regulatory scheme for all pro- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 110, 121]\n\u00a0\n ducers, which is based upon the average price for the several classes of milk combined. Such a handler would have an advantage over others in the sale of the class of milk in which he principally deals, and could force his competitors dealing in interstate milk to surrender the market or seek to reduce prices to producers in order to retain it.\n It is no answer to suggest, as does respondent, that the federal power to regulate intrastate transactions is limited to those who are engaged also in interstate commerce. The injury, and hence the power, does not depend upon the fortuitous circumstance that the particular person conducting the intrastate activities is, or is not, also engaged in interstate commerce. See Board of Trade of Chicago v. Olsen, \n262 \nU.S. 1\n, 43 S.Ct. 470; Stevens Co. v. Foster & Kleiser Co., supra. It is the effect upon interstate commerce or upon the exercise of the power to regulate it, not the source of the injury which is the criterion of Congressional power. Second Employers' Liability Cases (Mondou v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co.), \n223 \nU.S. 1, 51\n, 32 S.Ct. 169, 175, 38 L.R. A.,N.S., 44. We conclude that the national power to regulate the price of milk moving interstate into the Chicago, Illinois, marketing area, extends to such control over intrastate transactions there as is necessary and appropriate to make the regulation of the interstate commerce effective; and that it includes authority to make like regulations for the marketing of intrastate milk whose sale and competition with the interstate milk affects its price structure so as in turn to affect adversely the Congressional regulation.\n We turn to the question whether Congress has exercised that authority by  8c(1). Respondent argues that Congress, in enacting it, did not intend to exercise its full power over commerce, and that read in the light of its legislative history the section does not authorize the regulation of competing intrastate milk. In terms the statute speaks of the handling of products 'in the current of interstate ... commerce' or 'which directly burdens, obstructs, or af- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 110, 122]\n\u00a0\n fects, interstate ... commerce'. The argument is that the word 'directly' in the statute is restrictive, evidencing an intention to exercise less than the full authority possessed by Congress, and a purpose not to extend that authority to the regulation of local products which affect the interstate commodities and their regulation only by competing with them.\n In support of this contention respondent points to the precursor of the present statute, the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 31, 35, as amended by 48 Stat. 528, which contained provisions omitted from the present statute, specifically authorizing certain regulation of products 'in competition with' those in interstate commerce. Section 8(2) of the 1933 Act, as amended, authorized the Secretary to enter into maketing agreements with those 'engaged in the handling of any agricultural commodity or product thereof, in the current of or in competition with, or so as to burden, obstruct, or in any way affect, interstate or foreign commerce'. And  8(3) provided for the issuing of licenses to those engaged 'in the handling, in the current of interstate or foreign commerce, of any agricultural commodity or product thereof, or any competing commodity or product thereof'. In the 1935 amendments to the Agricultural Adjustment Act these provisions were replaced by the phraseology which was taken over without change into  8c(1) of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, already quoted. Hence it is to the legislative history of the 1935 amendments that we must turn to ascertain the significance of the phrase, 'directly affects' interstate commerce, which then appeared in the statute for the first time.\n The bills providing for the 1935 amendments, as introduced, eliminated the differences between  8(2) and  8(3) of the 1933 Act, as amended, and authorized the Secretary to issue licenses to those 'engaged in the handling of any agricultural commodity or product thereof, or any \n\n[315 \nU.S. 110, 123]\n\u00a0\n competing commodity or product thereof, in the current of or in competition with or so as to burden, obstruct, or in any way affect, interstate or foreign commerce'. S.R.1807, H.R. 7713 and 8052, 74th Cong. 1st Sess. In the reports of the House and Senate Committees on Agriculture, it was pointed out that although 'the full extent of the Federal power over interstate commerce is intended to be vested in the Secretary', it was 'not intended to authorize the licensing of persons handling goods only in intrastate commerce except where such handling burdens, obstructs, or affects interstate commerce.' S.Rep. No. 548, p. 6, H.Rep. No. 808, p. 5, H.Rep. No. 952, p. 5, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.\n These bills were pending in Congress when Schechter Corp. v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 495\n, 55 S.Ct. 837, 841, 97 A.L.R. 947, was decided on May 27, 1935. In consequence of that decision a new bill, H.R. 8492, was reported out which superseded the pending bills and eventually became the Act of 1935. The new bill, in terms, permitted the Secretary to regulate the handling of products which 'directly affects' interstate commerce. As the legislative history demonstrates, this phraseology was deliberately chosen to conform to that adopted in the opinion in the Schechter case, as signifying the full reach of the commerce power, and with the avowed purpose of conferring on the Secretary authority over intrastate products to the full extent of that power. See 79 Cong.Rec. 9478 and S.Rep. No. 1011, p. 8, H.Rep. No. 1241, p. 8, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.\n In the Schechter case the Court was concerned only with the alleged infringements of the 'Code of Fair Competition' for the live poultry industry of the New York City metropolitan area, which had been adopted under the provisions of  3 of the National Industrial Recovery Act of June 16, 1933, 48 Stat. 195, 196. The violations of the code charged were that wholesale distributors who had purchased poultry in New York, most \n\n[315 \nU.S. 110, 124]\n\u00a0\n of which came from without the state, and who were engaged in slaughtering and reselling to retailers, had failed to maintain for their employees wages and hours prescribed by the code, and had failed to abandon 'selective selling' to their customers in New York which the code had prohibited.\n The Court's opinion pointed out that the defendants were not charged with injury to interstate commerce or interference with persons engaged in that commerce, and that the acts charged had no different relation to or effect upon interstate commerce than like acts in any other local business which handle commodities brought into the state. Schechter Corp. v. United States, supra, 295 U.S. pages 545, 546, 55 S.Ct. pages 849, 850, 97 A.L.R. 947. It characterized their effect upon interstate commerce as 'indirect', and distinguished them from those acts and transactions intrastate which, because they 'directly affect' interstate commerce, are within he Congressional regulatory power. In explanation of this distinction and as examples of direct effects which are within the commerce power it referred to the 'fixing of rates for intrastate transportation which unjustly discriminate against interstate commerce', citing the Shreveport Case, supra, and referred to intrastate restraints upon competition injuriously affecting interstate commerce condemned by the Sherman Act, citing Local 167 v. United States, supra, and other cases.\n In adopting the change in the new bill, giving to the Secretary the authority to regulate the handling of products 'directly affecting' interstate commerce, and in deleting the phrase 'in competition with' interstate commerce, the House and Senate Committees on Agriculture, after referring to the Schechter case, stated: 'This phrase has been omitted from the proposed  8c(1) of the bill which deals with orders ... because the proposed language makes it clear that the full extent of the Federal power over interstate and foreign commerce and no more \n\n[315 \nU.S. 110, 125]\n\u00a0\n is intended to be vested in the Secretary of Agriculture in connection with orders.' See S. Rep. No. 1011, p. 9; H. Rep. No. 1241, p. 8, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.\n The same interpretation of the amendments was given by the Committee representative charged with explaining them on the floor of the Senate, who declared, 79 Cong.Rec. 11139, 'The position of the Committee in respect to these amendments is that intrastate commerce may burden or affect interstate commerce and that consequently this is a constitutional enactment under the decision of the Court in the Shreveport case.' The House debates also disclose general recognition that the bill as amended was intended to be a full exercise of the federal power over competing intrastate milk. 79 Cong.Rec. 9479-9480, 9485.\n The opinions of some members of the Senate,1 conflicting with the explicit statements of the meaning of the statutory language made by the Committee reports and members of the Committees on the floor of the Senate and the House, are not to be taken as persuasive of the Congressional purpose. Cf. United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Ass'n, \n166 \nU.S. 290, 318\n, 17 S.Ct. 540, 550. Moreover, other Senators, not members of the Committee on Agriculture, accepted its views of the extent to which the federal power was to be exerted by the proposed legislation. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n We think it clear that Congress, by the provisions of  8c(1) conferred upon the Secretary authority to regulate the handling of intrastate products which by reason of its competition with the handling of the interstate milk so affects that commerce as substantially to interfere with its regulation by Congress; and that the statute so read is a constitutional exercise of the commerce power. Such was the view expressed in United States v. Rock Royal \n\n[315 \nU.S. 110, 126]\n\u00a0\n Co-operative, Inc., supra, 307 U.S. page 568, 59 S.Ct. page 1010.

BINNEY & SMITH CO.(1942)\nNo. 71\nArgued: November 13, 1942Decided: December 7, 1942\n\n\n\n Mr. Hugh M. Morris, of Wilmington, Del., for petitioners.\n Mr. Dean S. Edmonds, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent sued for infringement of patent No. 1,889,429, issued to Weigand and Venuto, relating to carbon black in aggregated form and a process for its conversion \n\n[317 \nU.S. 228, 229]\n\u00a0\n to that form. Its complaint was particularized to apply only to claims 1 and 2 of the patent, which are product claims and not process claims. The District Court found these claims invalid as lacking novelty and invention and because they failed to define the product asserted to have been invented in such clear, definite, and exact terms as required by patent law. It also found no infringement. 37 F.Supp. 779. The Circuit Court of Appeals held to the contrary on each of these propositions and reversed. 4 Cir., 125 F.2d 255. The importance of the questions in the case prompted us to grant certiorari. \n316 \nU.S. 657\n, 62 S.Ct. 1269\n\n\n Carbon black has been manufactured from natural gas since the 1870's. At present the most extensive of its many uses is as a binder in automobile tires. 1 The particles of carbon black in its original form are extremely fine and dispersable. They are smaller than the length of a light wave, having a diameter of about one-millionth of an inch. One pound of them is said to present surfaces sufficient to cover 12 or 13 acres. Unprocessed carbon black weighs but ten pounds or less per cubic foot.\n The fineness and dispersability of the substance causes it to raise in clouds of dust when handled, with consequent losses, discomfort to workmen, and difficulties in manufacturing processes. Since 1915, when carbon black first came to be widely used in the manufacture of rubber, many attempts have been made to cope with the dust problem. In many cases mixing rooms were segregated at great expense from other parts of rubber factories, and the mills where the carbon black was mixed into the rubber were enclosed to confine the clouds of dust.\n Efforts were made to prevent as well as to control the dust. Compressing the carbon black to force out the \n\n[317 \nU.S. 228, 230]\n\u00a0\n air and increase its density met with some, but only indifferent, success. Attempts were made to prevent dust by the use of binders in the carbon black to make the particles adhere. These were not satisfactory, since the binders were unwanted and sometimes injurious substances and at best foreign matter to rubber formulas. Wetting and drying the carbon black also proved unsatisfactory, since this caused the particles to adhere in such manner that the aggregate product was not sufficiently friable (i.e. breakable) and dispersable when mixed with other substances.\n Weigand and Venuto experimented extensively, and the patent in litigation is the outcome. They mixed carbon black with a liquid such as water; displaced the water with another liquid such as gasoline which was substantially immiscible with the first and had a greater ability to wet the carbon particles; agitated the mixture until the water was substantially free from carbon; and finally removed the gasoline by evaporation. As it apparently must in order to assert invention and infringement, respondent argues that Weigand and Venuto solved the problem of carbon-black dust by a product consisting of carbon black aggregates formed without the use of any binder, sufficiently hard and flowable to prevent the formation of dust, yet sufficiently friable and dispersable for use as a component in the manufacture of rubber and other products.\n Manufacture was undertaken, one Glaxner being employed to put into use the process taught by this patent. He soon bettered his instruction by devising a simpler and much less expensive process employing but one liquid. His process was the subject of another patent,2 and at once superseded that of the patent in suit which thereupon became obsolete. Several other processes to achieve \n\n[317 \nU.S. 228, 231]\n\u00a0\n very similar results, including those used by the petitioner, have also been developed and patented. \n3\n Commercial success of respondent's process was short-lived, and the really impressive commercial success has been achieved since the development of the Glaxner process. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The product claims which respondent says the petitioner's product infringed, regardless of the process by which it was made, read as follows: '1. Sustantially (sic) pure carbon black in the form of commercially uniform, comparatively small, rounded, smooth aggregates having a spongy or porous interior. 2. As an article of manufacture, a pellet of approximately one-sixteenth of an inch in \n\n[317 \nU.S. 228, 232]\n\u00a0\n diameter and formed of a porous mass of substantially pure carbon black.'\n Section 4888 of the Revised Statutes, 35 U.S.C.  33, 35 U.S.C.A.  33, requires that the applicant for a patent 'shall particularly point out and distinctly claim the part, improvement, or combination which he claims as his invention or discovery.' As the Court recently stated in General Electric Co. v. Wabash Corp., \n304 \nU.S. 364, 369\n, 58 S.Ct. 899, 901: 'Patents, whether basic or for improvements, must comply accurately and precisely with the statutory requirement as to claims of invention or discovery. The limits of a patent must be known for the protection of the patentee, the encouragement of the inventive genius of others, and the assurance that the subject of the patent will be dedicated ultimately to the public. The statute seeks to guard against unreasonable advantages to the patentee and disadvantages to others arising from uncertainty as to their rights. The inventor must 'inform the public during the life of the patent of the limits of the monopoly asserted, so that it may be known which features may be safely used or manufactured without a license and which may not.' The claims 'measure the invention.' ... In a limited field the variant must be clearly defined.'\n The District Court found that the claims did not meet these requirements, and the Circuit Court of Appeals held that they did. Much testimony was directed to this question at the trial, and it has been discussed in the briefs and argument in this Court. Petitioner seeks reversal on the grounds of anticipation and non-infringement. The scope and sufficiency of the claims in suit necessarily present themselves as preliminary problems in the resolution of these ultimate issues. The courts in determining the questions of invention and infringement brought to them by respondent, no less than the parties-litigant, need and may insist upon the precision enjoined by the statute. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 228, 233]\n\u00a0\n To sustain claims so indefinite as not to give the notice required by the statute would be in direct contravention of the public interest which Congress therein recognized and sought to protect. Cf. Muncie Gear Works v. Outboard Marine & Manufacturing Co., \n315 \nU.S. 759\n, 62 S.Ct. 865.\n Here, as in many other cases, it is difficult for persons not skilled in the art to measure the inclusions or to appreciate the distinctions which may exist in the words of a claim when read in the context of the art itself. The clearest exposition of the significance which the terms employed in the claims had for those skilled in the art was given by the testimony of Weigand, one of the patentees, whom respondent called as its witness. Weigand was employed as Director of Research of the Columbian Carbon Company, whose stock respondent owned, and for whom respondent acted as sole selling agent. His testimony in this respect was given principally upon cross-examination, but it was in no wise impeached or contradicted, and is borne out by that of other witnesses. From it we learn that 'substantially pure' refers, not to freedom from ash and other impurities, but rather to freedom from binders; 'commercially uniform' means only the degree of uniformity demanded by buyers; 'comparatively small' is not shown to add anything to the claims, for nowhere are we advised what standard is intended for comparisons; 'spongy' and 'porous' are synonymous, and relate to the density and gas content of aggregates of carbon black. Although sponginess or porosity is not a necessary attribute of a friable substance, it does contribute to the friability of aggregates of carbon black. It is of value only in that regard. A spongy or porous aggregate of carbon black may be so friable as to permit of the formation of dust; and, on the other hand, it is conceivable that it might not be sufficiently friable to mix satisfactorily with other substances such as those used in the manufacture of rubber products. The correct degree of friability can be ascer- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 228, 234]\n\u00a0\n tained only by testing the performance of the product in actual processes of manufacture of products of which carbon black is a component. A 'pellet' of carbon black is 'a spheroidal shaped aggregate that has substance and strength to it.' For 'strength' 'we have this rough and ready test: does it survive under gentle rubbing of the fingers. I would not say that is an adequate test to predicate rubber behavior on, but it is a rough and ready test;' and if it responds to that test it is a pellet within the meaning of the claim. Finally, what on first impression appears to be reasonable certainty of dimension disappears when we learn that 'approximately one-sixteenth of an inch in diameter' includes a variation from approximately 1\/4th to 1\/100th of an inch.\n So read, the claims are but inaccurate suggestions of the functions of the product, and fall afoul of the rule that a patentee may not broaden his claims by describing the product in terms of function. Holland Furniture Co. v. Perkins Glue Co., \n277 \nU.S. 245\n, 256-258, 48 S.Ct. 474, 478, 479; General Electric Co. v. Wabash Corp., supra, 304 U. S. at pages 371, 372, 58 S.Ct. at pages 902, 903.\n Respondent urges that the claims must be read in the light of the patent specification,5 and that as so read they are sufficiently definite. Assuming the propriety of this \n\n[317 \nU.S. 228, 235]\n\u00a0\n method of construction, cf. General Electric Co. v. Wabash Corp., supra, 304 U.S. at pages 373-375, 58 S.Ct. at pages 903, 904, it does not have the effect \n\n[317 \nU.S. 228, 236]\n\u00a0\n claimed, for the description in the specification is itself almost entirely in terms of function. It is therefore unnecessary to consider whether the rejection of certain claims6 by the Patent Office might in turn deprive the specification of any curative effect in this regard. Cf. Schriber-Schroth Co. v. Cleveland Trust Co., \n311 \nU.S. 211\n, \n312 \nU.S. 654\n, 61 S.Ct. 235; Exhibit Supply Co. v. Ace Patents Corp., \n315 \nU.S. 126\n, 62 S.Ct. 513.\n The statutory requirement of particularity and distinctness in claims is met only when they clearly distinguish what is claimed from what went before in the art and clearly circumscribe what is foreclosed from future enterprise. A zone of uncertainty which enterprise and experimentation may enter only at the risk of infringement claims would discourage invention only a little less than unequivocal foreclosure of the field. Moreover, the claims must be reasonably clearcut to enable courts to determine whether novelty and invention are genuine. Congress has provided that a patent may be awarded only for a new and useful manufacture 'not patented or described in any printed publication in this or any foreign country, before his invention or discovery thereof.' R.S. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 228, 237]\n\u00a0\n s 4886, 35 U.S.C.  31, 35 U.S.C.A.  31. While we do not find it necessary to consider questions of novelty and invention, in the view we take of the claims in suit, a mere reading of prior art patents shows how, if they are read with the liberality and inclusiveness claimed for those in suit, they describe products, if not identical, at least of confusing similarity. \n7\n Whether the vagueness of the claim has its source in the language employed or in the somewhat indeterminate character of the advance claimed to have been made in the art is not material. An invention must be capable of accurate definition, and it must be accurately defined, to be patentable. Cf. General Electric Co. v. Wabash Corp., supra, 304 U.S. at pages 372, 373, 58 S.Ct. at page 903.\n We are of opinion that the claims in litigation are bad for indefiniteness, and have no occasion to consider questions of novelty, invention, and infringement.

It is the subject of a number of patents, the first of which was applied for by Billings and Offutt on July 18, 1932 and issued as No. 2,120,540. Manufacture is under license of the Cabot company, patent owner.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] This states in pertinent part that:\n'The main object of our invention is to secure carbon black having the desired dispersive properties, greater density, freedom from dust, freedom from gritty particles, less absorbed or occluded gases, reduced oil absorption than the ordinary powder form, and capable of considerable handling without crushing or dusting.\n\n'This process, if carried out under certain conditions, causes the carbon black to form into pellets which are hard enough to stand any ordinary shipment or handling without dusting, flying or breaking down, and which at the same time are easily crushed by moderate pressure, as between the fingers or by the pressures commonly employed in the rolls of rubber compounding machinery, printers ink mixers and the like. The crushed particles have substantially their original softness and the material disperses freely without leaving any particles of undispersed carbon in the material.\n\n'While the pellet form is a very convenient form of the carbon black, the shape of the particles is not the most important characteristic of this novel carbon black.\n\n'The pellets are very porous, of substantially spherical or globular form, have a smooth somewhat lustrous outer surface which is not easily broken by handling, are more compact than untreated carbon, are fragile under light pressure, any may be easily reduced to soft minute particles which cannot be told from the original particles except that possibly they have a more unctuous feel. They somewhat resemble lead shot and may be rolled in the hand without diretying or dusting. Apparently the outer surface portion or shell of each pellet is slightly more compact than the inner part, but still porous. \n\n'In shipping or storing, we find that approximately twice the number of pounds of these pellets can be placed in a container of a given size than is the case with the untreated carbon black. Thus, expense is reduced for shipment or storage.\n\n'There are various factors which enter into the process and these may be varied to get the pellets harder or softer or larger or smaller. Among these factors are the thickness of the paste, the amount of gasoline used, the adding of the gasoline in bulk or a little at a time, speed of agitation, temperature, type of gasoline used, and character of the carbon black.\n\n'If small pellets are desired, a lesser amount of gasoline or other liquid should be used in respect to the amount of water and carbon, and greater agitation should be employed. To secure large pellets, we use a larger amount of gasoline and slower agitation. In practice, we do not consider a size larger than one-quarter of an inch desirable. There are many kinds, grades or varieties of carbon black and often identification of the particular kind or grade is difficult. With our improved process the different kinds or grades may be made into pellets of different sizes so that identification is facilitated, for instance, very small pellets may be made for printers ink and larger ones for rubber, etc.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] To meet objections of the examiner, the following product claims were withdrawn in course of prosecution of the application:\n'4. A pellet formed of (substantially pure)* soft carbon black particles, the pellet being sufficiently hard to withstand ordinary shipment or handling, but readily breaking down to a fine state of subdivision upon the application of slight pressure.\n\n'8. Soft carbon black particles cohering in small masses of substantially uniform size and having smooth outer surfaces.\n\n'2. Carbon black in the form of pellets of sponge-like or porous structure.\n\n'7. A carbon black pellet formed of soft carbon black, the pellet having sufficient hardness to withstand ordinary shipment or handling without dusting, but sufficiently fragile to permit reduction to the original fine state of subdivision upon the application of light pressure.'

Claim No. 7 of this patent is: 'The method of compounding rubber with lampblack which consists in mixing the lampblack with water and a binder, producing a granular condition, evaporating the water, and incorporating the dry, granular lampblack with rubber on a heated mixing mill.'\n Claim No. 10 of the prior Coffin and Keen patent, No. 1,561,971 is: 'As a new article of manufacture, dried pulverulent material in the form of very small individually dried friable globular masses composed of lightly cohering particles of the material.' \n\n\n\n\n","133":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. BETHLEHEM STEEL CORPORATION(1942)\nNo. 816\nArgued: December 9, 1941Decided: February 16, 1942\n\n\n\n\n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 291]\n\u00a0\n Merrs. Francis Biddle, Atty. Gen., and Charles Fahy, Sol. Gan., for petitioners.\n Mr. Frederick H. Wood, of New York City, for respondents. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 292]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These two cases arise from a dispute between Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Ltd., and the government about the amount of profits claimed by Bethlehem under thirteen war time contracts for building ships. The contracts were negotiated and executed in 1917 and 1918, when Germany's destructive warfare against our ocean shipping essential to the successful prosecution of the war made it necessary for the United States to build the greatest possible number of ships in the shortest possible time. They are typical products of a system of procurement heavily relied upon by the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation and other government purchasing agencies at the time.\n On June 15, 1917, Congress gave to the President sweeping war powers, 40 Stat. 182, including (1) the power to commandeer shipbuilding plants and facilities, (2) the power to purchase ships at what he deemed a reasonable price with a provision for subsequent revision by the courts in the event the seller regarded the price set as unfair, and (3) the power to purchase or contract for the building of ships at prices to be established by negotiation. Acting under authority delegated to it by the President with Congressional approval, the Fleet Corporation declined to seek utilization of the first and second methods but chose, under the third alternative, to make purchases though ordinary business bargaining.\n The 'actual cost' to Bethlehem of building the ships over which this dispute arises was about $109,000,000. The generously inclusive formula1 for determining 'ac- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 293]\n\u00a0\n tual cost,' not challenged by the government here, was not peculiar to these contracts. It was based on the standard formula used by the Fleet Corporation in its contracts with other shipbuilders. And, as in practically all contracts of this type, there was no risk of loss. \n2\n The total profits claimed under the contracts by Bethlehem, and \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 294]\n\u00a0\n allowed by both courts below, were about $24,000,000,3 or a little more than 22% of the computed cost. \n4\n This figure of $24,000,000 does not include such profits as may have been made by Bethlehem Steel Company, Bethlehem's parent, which sold it at the maximum prices established by the War Industries Board, 43,000 tons of steel used in these ships. \n5\n The percentage of profits in relation to the actual investment and working capital devoted by Bethlehem to the building of the ships was not found by either of the courts below. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n In No. 8, the government filed a bill in equity against Bethlehem and others. The bill alleged that the gov- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 295]\n\u00a0\n ernment had been induced to enter into the contracts by fraudulent representations of Bethlehem's agents; and as an independent ground for relief, that it had been the duty of Bethlehem to perform the contracts fairly, honestly, and economically 'in the shortest practicable time' for no more than 'a fair and reasonable profit' and that any provisions in the contract for payment of more are 'void and unenforceable.' The prayer was for an accounting and a decree requiring Bethlehem to refund all amounts previously paid to it by the government in excess of what the court should find to be just and reasonable compensation for building the ships. Bethlehem filed an answer and a counterclaim for damages based on alleged breach of contract by the Fleet Corporation.\n In No. 9, Bethlehem brought suit at law against the Fleet Corporation claiming damages for breach of the same contracts. In an affidavit of defense and counterclaim the Fleet Corporation repeated the allegations made by the government in No. 8 and sought the same relief.\n The two actions were jointly referred by the District Judge to a Master who held hearings and made findings. In No. 8, the Master recommended that the government's bill be dismissed, and on the authority of Nassau Smelting & Refining Works v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 101\n, 45 S. Ct. 25, further recommended that Bethlehem's counterclaim be dismissed for want of jurisdiction, the amount claimed being in excess of $ 10,000. In No. 9, he recommended that judgment be entered for Bethlehem for $5,272,0757 with interest at 2% from September 1, 1922. The District Judge declined to allow any interest, applying the law of Pennsylvania as he thought our decision in Erie R. Co. v. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 296]\n\u00a0\n Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A.L.R. 1487, required. In all other respects he followed the Master's recommendations and rendered judgment accordingly. 23 F.Supp. 676; 26 F.Supp. 259. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 3 Cir., 113 F.2d 301, 305. On application of the United States and the Fleet Corporation, we granted certiorari. \n311 \nU.S. 632\n, 61 S.Ct. 49.\n As the case reaches us, the controversy revolves primarily around the section of the contracts which sets out what is to be paid to Bethlehem. In all the contracts, that section contains substantially the following provisions:\n'The price to be paid for each vessel to be constructed and furnished in accordance with the terms of this contract ... shall be the actual cost, plus the definite sum for profit hereinafter in this Article provided for, based upon an estimated base cost to the Contractor .... Should the actual cost be less than the estimated ... cost ... the Contractor shall be allowed as profit on each vessel in addition to said fixed sum for profit ... one-half the amount by which such actual cost of each vessel falls short of the estimated cost ....'\n\n Thus, a high estimated cost would increase the probability of 'savings' to be divided between Bethlehem and the government. And the more the estimated cost exceeded actual cost, the greater would be Bethlehem's share. It can be seen, therefore, that the estimated cost agreed upon by the parties is a pivotal figure.\n\n\n I.\n\n The government charged Bethlehem with fraud in submitting estimated cost figures which were adopted in the contracts. It was alleged that Bethlehem's agents made two false representations: (1) that it was impracticable to estimate closely what the cost would be and (2) that the estimates Bethlehem submitted, and which the Fleet Corporation accepted, were fair and reasonable under the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 297]\n\u00a0\n circumstances. The Master found that there was no evidence to support this charge of fraud. The District Judge approved this finding as did the Circuit Court of Appeals which said that it had 'carefully considered the record in the light of this contention (of fraud)' and concluded that 'the estimates submitted by Bethlehem and prepared for it by its representative Brown were fairly and honestly made and as accurate as could be expected under the uncertain conditions then prevailing.' And in this Court the petitioner accepts these findings. Therefore, in considering other attacks upon Bethlehem's right to recover, we must do so on the assumption that there was no fraud in Bethlehem's negotiations with the government.\n\n\n II.\n\n The government contends that even in the absence of fraud, Bethlehem is entitled to nothing by virtue of the half-savings clauses.\n One argument is that the contracts gave Bethlehem the benefits of participating in the savings only if Bethlehem by special efforts increased its efficiency and brought actual costs below the estimates agreed to in the contracts.\n Neither the specific language of the half-savings provision nor its context supports this contention. On its face, the provision contains an unconditional promise to pay Bethlehem one-half of the difference between the actual and estimated cost of the ships in question. That such a method of computation would tend to discourage careless expenditures and encourage vigorous attempts at realizing economies in building the ships is hardly debatable. But the half-savings clause does not impose any positive obligations upon the builder. The Master found, upon consideration both of the terms of the contracts and testimony on the understanding of the parties, that a showing of savings, without more, obligated the government to share them with Bethlehem. It cannot be main- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 298]\n\u00a0\n tained that this finding, accepted by both courts below, is without ample support.\n Nothing in the negotiations between the parties as revealed in the record indicates that they had a contrary understanding of the contracts. Bethlehem held out against the Fleet Corporation's early insistence upon lump sum contracts. It continually asserted that uncertainties about final cost due to rapidly rising prices would require it to protect itself by insisting upon a figure too high for the Fleet Corporation's acceptance and therefore itself proposed the cost-plus-fixed-fee-plus-half-savings method of determining compensation. While there seems to have been recognition that this method might induce greater efforts at efficiency which would be to the advantage of both parties, there is not the smallest hint that either Bethlehem or the government regarded the substitution of this method as imposing any positive obligations upon Bethlehem in addition to those it would have had under lump sum contracts.\n In the alternative, the government urges that the half-savings clauses are severable and that if the contracts imposed upon Bethlehem no obligation of special effort to effect savings, these clauses were unsupported by consideration, and are therefore unenforceable. The Master and the courts below, however, treated these clauses as non-severable; to do otherwise would call for departure from accepted principles of the law of contract. Whether a number of promises constitute one contract or more than one is to be determined by inquiring 'whether the parties assented to all the promises as a single whole, so that there would have been no bargain whatever, if any promise or set of promises were struck out.' Williston on Contracts, Rev.Ed.,  863 and cases there cited. The record makes it clear that each of the contracts here was assented to as a single whole, and that consummation of a bargain between the parties depended upon inclusion of \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 299]\n\u00a0\n the half-savings clause. Furthermore, we know of no federal or state statute or established rule of law in any jurisdiction inconsistent with the elementary proposition that a promise to build ships is good consideration for a promise to pay a sum of money whether fixed in amount or depending upon the relationship between actual and estimated cost. \n8\n Cf. Dayton Airplane Co. v. United States, 6 Cir., 21 F.2d 673, 682, 683.\n\n\n III.\n\n The government further argues that if the half-savings clauses must be taken as permitting Bethlehem to participate in savings however caused, the contracts are invalid because unconscionable. Without specifying that it relies on the law of any particular jurisdiction, the petitioner rests its argument on an asserted general doctrine of unconscionability at common law. Since there is no governing constitutional or federal statutory provision, if these were contracts between private individuals, the law of some locality would be controlling. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, supra. Whether the same rule would apply to government contracts in general or to the contracts of the Fleet Corporation9 in particular, we need not decide. Nor assuming the applicability of the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 300]\n\u00a0\n Tompkins case to the contracts before us, would we have to determine whether the law of the District of Columbia or of some particular state is decisive. For in invoking the asserted doctrine of unconscionability claimed to be applicable here, the government relies entirely upon the alleged existence of two elements: duress and profits grossly in excess of customary standards. And for reasons we shall set out, neither of these two elements exists here.\n Duress. The word duress implies feebleness on one side, overpowering strength on the other. Here it is suggested that feebleness is on the side of the government of the United States, overpowering strength on the side of a single private corporation. Although there are many cases in which an individual has claimed to be a victim of duress in dealings with government, e.g., Union Pac. R. Co. v. Public Service Comm., \n248 \nU.S. 67\n, 39 S.Ct. 24, this, so far as we know, is the first instance in which government has claimed to be a victim of duress in dealings with an individual.\n The argument by which the petitioner seeks to establish that the contracts were made under duress is essentially this: Germany's submarine warfare made it imperative that the government secure the greatest possible number of ships in the shortest possible time; there was a scarcity of ships and shipbuilding facilities in the United States; Bethlehem, the largest shipbuilder in the world, not only had shipbuilding facilities available, but also a trained organization; at a time when Bethlehem's facilities and trained organization were vital to the prosecution of the war, it declined to accept terms proposed by the government, but insisted upon prices which some of \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 301]\n\u00a0\n the government's representatives thought too high; although Congress had authorized the Executive to commandeer shipbuilding facilities if necessary, Bethlehem's organization was also needed and the government was without power to compel performance by an unwilling organization; the government therefore had to accept contracts on whatever terms Bethlehem proposed or, doing without the ships which Bethlehem could produce, run the risk of military defeat.\n Two basic propositions underlie this argument: (1) The government's representatives involuntarily accepted Bethlehem's terms.' (2) The circumstances permitted the government no other alternative.\n Upon reviewing the negotiations between the representatives of the government and the representatives of Bethlehem, we cannot find support for the first proposition. The Master found, and the courts below agreed, that 'the contracts resulted from negotiations in which both parties were represented by intelligent, well informed and experienced officers whose sole object was to make the best trade possible, under conditions which included the uncertainties of war time contingencies, the results from which were not and could not have been known at the time the contracts were made.' Two of the three principal negotiators for the Fleet Corporation have testified in the proceedings before the Master. It is abundantly clear from their testimony that, during the course of the negotiations, they did not consider themselves compelled to accept whatever terms the other side proposed. In the disposition of the two main differences between the negotiators there is no evidence of that state of overcome will which is the major premise of the petitioner's argument of duress. Cf. French v. Shoemaker, 14 Wall. 314, 332.\n One of the differences was settled by the government's abandonment of its earlier insistence upon a lump sum arrangement together with a guaranteed date of delivery. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 302]\n\u00a0\n In view of the rising prices and unpredictable labor supply of the time, Bethlehem's reluctance to enter into contracts on such terms does not seem unreasonable. \n10\n And if the government's abandonment of its position is to be regarded as evidence of compulsion, we should have to find compulsion in every contract in which one of the parties makes a concession to a demand, however reasonable, of the other side.\n The other major difference between the negotiators was on the matter of price. There is evidence that some of the Fleet Corporation's representatives considered Bethlehem's demands high, but we cannot conclude that the figure finally accepted by the Fleet Corporation was accepted because its representatives felt themselves powerless to refuse. On the contrary, Bethlehem by letter voluntarily offered to accept contracts on terms to be fixed by the Fleet Corporation's general manager. This offer was rejected, one of the Fleet Corporation's negotiators testifying that it preferred to make contracts rather than assume the attitude of dictating terms. Moreover, the general manager of the Fleet Corporation, in whom final authority was vested and who approved these contracts, was of the opinion that high estimated cost figures would be advantageous to the government because 'care must be exercised that they be not placed at too low a figure, for if they are, the probabilities are that the contractor will lose interest in keeping the cost down.' And one of the negotiators for the Fleet Corporation has given testimony that he was not so much concerned with cost as with speed of production since 'legislation was already in the offing in the form of war profit taxes ... to take care of extreme \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 303]\n\u00a0\n cases.' We must therefore conclude that the negotiations do not show that Bethlehem forced the government's representatives to accept contracts against their will.\n If the negotiations do not establish duress, the government finds it in the circumstances themselves. The petitioner concedes that the government could have commandeered Bethlehem's plants, but it contends that if the plants had been commandeered, Bethlehem's organization would have been unwilling to serve the government in them. Heavy reliance is placed on an observation in the Master's report that 'the Government did not have power to compel performance by an unwilling organization.' We shall later consider the alleged lack of power. We now point out that the alleged unwillingness is an assumption unsupported by findings of evidence. Since the possibility of commandeering appears not even to have been suggested to Bethlehem, we have no basis for knowing what its reaction would have been. We cannot assume that if the negotiations failed to produce contracts acceptable to both sides, Bethlehem would have refused to contribute to the war effort except under legal compulsion. We cannot lightly impute to Bethlehem's whole organization, composed as it was of hundreds of people, such an attitude of unpatriotic recalcitrance in the face of national peril.\n But even if we were to assume, as we do not, an initial attitude of unwillingness, we do not think that the government was entirely without means of overcoming it. For the representatives of the Fleet Corporation, an agent of the United States, came to Bethlehem armed with bargaining powers to which those of no ordinary private corporation can be compared. If it chose to, the Fleet Corporation could have foregone all negotiation over price, compelling Bethlehem to undertake the work at a price set by the President with the burden of going to court if it considered the compensation unreasonably low. And the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 304]\n\u00a0\n power to commandeer Bethlehem's entire plant and facilities, in accordance with authority specifically delegated by the President, provided the Fleet Corporation with an alternative bargaining weapon difficult for any company to resist.\n The government nevertheless urges that the circumstances here are analogous to those under which courts of admiralty have held contracts to be unenforceable. In particular, it points to the principle that courts of admiralty 'will not tolerate the doctrine that a salvor can take the advantage of his situation, and avail himself of the calamities of others to drive a bargain; nor will they permit the performance of a public duty to be turned into a traffic of profit.' Post v. Jones, 19 How. 150, 160. We think this principle has no real relevance to the case before us.\n In the first place, if there was a 'traffic of profit' here, it was not the unanticipated result of an accident as in the salvage cases. When Congress authorized the procurement of ships through ordinary commercial negotiations, it must have known that the purchases could not be made in a market of open competition because existing shipbuilding facilities would be overtaxed by the construction program. See Department of Commerce, Government Aid to Merchant Shipping, Rev.Ed.1923, 433; Hearings before House Committee on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries on H.R. 10500, 64th Cong., 1st Sess., passim. And Congress must have anticipated that in the contracts agreed upon profits would be expected and that the self interest inherent in commercial transactions would make itself felt. Therefore, in seeking to establish duress from the circumstances in which these contracts were made, the government is relying on the identical circumstances which were in existence at the time Congress chose the policy of authorizing procurement of ships through com- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 305]\n\u00a0\n mercial negotiation. We cannot now invalidate contracts made pursuant to a congressionally selected policy on the sole ground of the coercive effect of circumstances which Congress clearly contemplated. To do so we should have to repudiate legislative power exercised in proper constitutional sphere.\n In the second place, the captain of a ship in distress on the high seas who is completely at the mercy of his salvor cannot be likened to a sovereign power dealing with an individual contractor. We cannot regard the government of the United States at war as so powerless that it must seek the organization of a private corporation as a helpless suppliant. The Constitution art. 1,  8 grants to Congress power 'to raise and support Armies', 'to provide and maintain a Navy', and to make all laws necessary and proper to carry these powers into execution. Under this authority Congress can draft men for battle service. Selective Draft Law Cases (Arver v. United States), \n245 \nU.S. 366\n, 38 S.Ct. 159, L.R.A.1918C, 361, Ann.Cas.1918B, 856. Its power to draft business organizations to support the fighting men who risk their lives can be no less.\n Profits. The general common law rule of unconscionability on which the petitioner relies is said to deny enforcement to contracts when the profits provided for are grossly in excess of a standard established by common practice. Whether there is such a rule, what is its scope, and whether it is part of the body of law governing these contracts, we need not decide. For high as Bethlehem's 22% profit seems to us, we are compelled to admit that so far as the record or any other source of which we can take notice discloses, it is not grossly in excess of the standard established by common practice in the field in which Congress authorized the making of these contracts. And in particular, it may be added, the Master found that the ships built by Bethlehem cost the government less than comparable ships built by other shipbuilders. The gov- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 306]\n\u00a0\n ernment made no attempt to establish, nor is there any indication in the record, that the profits realized by other shipbuilders were any less than Bethlehem's.\n To establish a standard of customary profits, the petitioner points to the experience of the Navy and War Departments and other branches of the government in connection with straight cost plus contracts. Because 10% was the profit specified in many such contracts, the government asserts that it is an appropriate figure here, and urges that the profits on these contracts, tested by such a standard, cannot be allowed. The relevance of experience with cost plus contracts to the contracts here is not clear. The Shipping Board deliberately chose to avoid cost plus contracts where possible, having found them unsatisfactory in practice. Moreover, the record shows that the total cost to the government of comparable ships under cost plus contracts was higher than the total cost of the ships Bethlehem built under the contracts here in question. And experience in many fields has demonstrated that the percentage of profit actually realized under cost plus contracts is likely to be far more than the percentage specified. As stated in 1918 by Charles E. Hughes, later Chief Justice, in his report to the Attorney General on the aircraft industry, 'contracts of this sort lead to waste, foster abuses, and impose an almost intolerable burden of cost accounting, in itself a hinderance to rapid production.' Report to the Attorney General on the Aircraft Inquiry (1918) 134. See, also, Expenditures in the War Department-Camps, House Report No. 816, 66th Cong., 2d Sess., 49-53. The 10% which the petitioner derives by reference to the cost plus contracts of certain governmental department cannot be taken as a standard of common practice. It is in illusory figure without basis in the realities of business experience.\n If profits earned under government contracts in general are taken as the standard of comparison the 22% \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 307]\n\u00a0\n claimed here is overshadowed in too many instances for it to be regarded as extraordinary. The Hughes report referred to above, for example, points out (pp. 136-146) that most of the airplane production during the last war was under contracts providing for much higher profits. To take an example of the profits made on food products, the Federal Trade Commission determined that in 1917, profits on the sales of salmon canneries, a major portion of whose output was purchased by the government, ranged from 15 to 68% of cost, averaging 52%.11 Federal Trade Commission, Report on Canned Salmon (1918) 63. In the shipbuilding industry itself, even in peace times, profits were found by a special committee of the Senate which investigated the munitions industry to have been from 25% to 37% on the cruisers built in 1927, about 22% in 1929, and of like range for other years. Senate Report No. 944, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 4.\n If the comparison is made with industrial profits, not limited to profits on government contracts alone, the 22% asked for here likewise loses all claim to distinction. An exhibit, the accuracy of which the government has not challenged, incorporated into the record of this case, indicates that in terms of profit on gross sales, the largest American steel company made 49, 58, and 46% during the years 1916, 1917, and 1918. As computed by the Federal Trade Commission, net earnings in 1917 of the same company on all its business were 25% of total investment, and the Commission cites instances of other steel companies whose earnings thus measured ranged from 30 to 320%. Federal Trade Commission, Letter on Profiteering (1918) 9. Profits of lumber producers, again in terms of return \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 308]\n\u00a0\n on investment, ranged as high as 121%; and of producers of petroleum products, as high as 122%, over half of the industry earning more than 20%. Id. 12, 13. During the first six months of 1917, one of the two major sulphur producers in the country sold its product at an average price of $ 18.11 per ton, more than 200% above cost which was $5.73 per ton; the other major producer earned 236% on its investment during the first eleven months of the same year. Id. 11. The Federal Trade Commission's collection of data for various other industries, a collection which the Commission stated was 'by no means a complete catalog', affords many additional examples of the same kind. But further confirmation should be unnecessary for a conclusion no businessman would question: that the profits claimed here, seen in their commercial environment, cannot be considered exceptional.\n The profits claimed here arise under contracts deliberately let by the Fleet Corporation under authority delegated by the President in accordance with an act of Congress. Neither Congress not the President restricted the freedom of the Fleet Corporation to grant measures of profits common at the time. And the Fleet Corporation's chosen policy was to operate in a field where profits for services are demanded and expected. The futility of subjecting this choice of policy to judicial review is demonstrated by this case, coming to this Court as it does more than twenty years after the ships were completed. In any event, we believe the question of whether or not this policy was wise is outside our province to decide. Under our form of government we do not have the power to nullify it, as we believe we should necessarily be doing, were we to declare these contracts unenforceable on the ground that profits granted under Congressional authority were too high. The profits made in these and other contracts entered into under the same system may justly arouse indignation. But indignation based on the no- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 309]\n\u00a0\n tions of morality of this or any other court cannot be judicially transmuted into a principle of law of greater force than the expressed will of Congress. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n IV.\n\n The problem of war profits is not new. In this country, every war we have engaged in has provided opportunities for profiteering and they have been too often scandalously seized. See Hearings before the House Committee on Military Affairs on H.R. 3 and H.R. 5293, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 590-598. To meet this recurrent evil, Congress has at times taken various measures. It has authorized price fixing. It has placed a fixed limit on profits, or has recaptured high profits through taxation. It has expressly reserved for the government the right to cancel contracts after they have been made. Pursuant to Congressional authority, the government has requisitioned existing production facilities or itself built and operated new ones to provide needed war materials. It may be that one or some or all of these measures should be utilized more comprehensively, or that still other measures must be devised. But if the Executive is in need of additional laws by which to protect the nation against war profiteering, the Constitution has given to Congress, not to this Court, the power to make them.\nAFFIRMED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice JACKSON, who as former Attorneys General actively participated in the prosecution of these cases, take no part in this decision. Mr. Justice ROBERTS also takes no part in the decision. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 310]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY, concurring.\n I concur in the opinion of the Court insofar as it relates to duress and coercion and the non-severability of the 'bonus for savings' clauses, but desire to add a brief further statement of my views.\n In voting for affirmance of the judgment, I do not wish to be understood as expressing approval of an arrangement like the one now under review, by which a company engaged in doing work for the Government in time of grave national peril-or any other time-is entitled to a profit of 22 per cent. under contracts involving little or no risk and grossing many millions of dollars. Such an arrangement not only is incompatible with sound principles of public management, but is injurious to public confidence and public morale. The fact that such cases were common during the last war, as evidenced by the circumstances recited in the opinion of the Court, provides no justification to my mind for such a practice then or now. No man or set of men should want to make excessive profits out of the travail of the nation at war, and government officials entrusted with contracting authority, and the Congress bestowing such authority, should be alert to prevent it.\n The question before the Court for decision, however, is not whether an arrangement like the one presented for review accords with our conceptions of business morality or with correct administration of the public business. Having made a bargain, the Government should be held to it unless there are valid and appropriate reasons known to the law for relieving it from its obligations. It is the duty and responsibility of the courts, not to re-write contracts according to their own views of what is practical and fair, but to enforce them in accordance with the evidence and recognized principles of law.\n In my opinion the elements of duress and coercion have not been established in this case. The doctrine that \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 311]\n\u00a0\n 'necessitous men are not free men', a doctrine evolved by the English courts of chancery in the eighteenth century for the protection of harassed debtors,1 is not applicable to the Government of the United States, armed as it is with both an actual and a potential arsenal of powers adequate to protect its interests in dealings with private persons.\n I am also of opinion that the 'bonus for savings' clauses are integral parts of the contracts in question and part of the entire consideration moving to Bethlehem in exchange for its promise to build ships. To characterize these clauses as severable and supported by consideration only if Bethlehem promised to increase its efficiency is ingenious, but requires us to close our eyes to the actualities of the record before us and to ignore fundamental contract law.\n Nor can I accept the proposition that the 'bonus for savings' clauses are properly interpreted as meaning that Bethlehem was to receive one-half of the 'savings' only insofar as Bethlehem could prove that the 'savings' were due to its increased efficiency. Such an interpretation, it is true, would prevent Bethlehem from benefiting by reason of purely fortuitous 'savings'. However, in the absence, as here, of fraud, mistake, or that overreaching which we label 'duress' and 'coercion', contracts should be interpreted as they are written, not as they might or should have been written in the light of after-thought and subsequent experience. The language of the 'savings' clauses does not limit Bethlehem's participation in 'savings' to those attributable only to its own efforts. The Master found that 'Bethlehem was to participate in savings however earned'. The suggested interpretation, ignoring the language of the contracts and the expressed \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 312]\n\u00a0\n understanding of the parties, gratuitously rewrites the contracts to accord with notions of fairness acquired in the light of subsequent developments.\n It is understandable that one may be indignant at Bethlehem's claim, but such indignation does not justify the distortion of established legal principles to relieve the Government of its approval of a hard bargain. It cannot be left out of consideration that the Government entered into the agreements with full understanding of their terms. Surely there is much to be said in favor of the Government's standing behind obligations, even though quite onerous, which it incurred with knowledge of the circumstances. The possibility that the Government may be relieved of bargains twenty-four years after agreeing to them is not conducive to mutual trust and confidence between citizens and their government.\n The judgment should be affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, dissenting.\n The Founders divided our government into three branches, partly to prevent autocratic concentration of power and partly to achieve appropriate division of labor in the difficult task of government. The President has his duties, the Congress its duties, and we ours. What powers the Congress should give the President in order to obtain the most effective production of war supplies, how the President should exercise those powers, whether a system of private contracts for war materials is conducive to unjustifiable waste and profiteering, or whether government production of necessary war supplies is a wiser course-these and like matters are not our business and upon them we should neither express nor intimate views. However circumscribed the judicial area may be, we had best remain within it. But the function of the judiciary is not so limited that it must sanction the use of the federal courts as instruments of injustice in dis- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 313]\n\u00a0\n regard of moral and equitable principles which have been part of the law for centuries. I am compelled, therefore, the dissent from the judgment of the Court.\n In the summer of 1917 the United States was at war with Germany. The enemy's submarine was taking terrific toll of our shipping. The immediate threat to our national security had to be met promptly. Congress enacted the Emergency Shipping Fund Act of June 15, 1917, 40 Stat. 182, conferring vast powers upon the President. He was authorized to place orders for such ships or material as 'the necessities of the Government' may require; to modify, suspend, cancel or requisition contracts for the building, production, or purchase of ships or material; and to take over any plants and ships constructed or in the process of construction. If any person owning any ship, plant, or material refused to build or sell ships or material ordered by the Government 'at such reasonable price as shall be determined by the President', he was empowered to take possession of the ships, material, or plant of such person.\n On July 11, 1917, the President delegated all the authority vested in him by this Act to the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation. A stupendous task was thereby imposed upon the Fleet Corporation. 'The program of construction, as well as operation was gigantic. It involved an expenditure of more than three and a half billion dollars, a sum greater than any expended by any corporation in a similar period of time. Many of the officials and board members were without experience in either shipbuilding or operation. No adequate organization existed at the beginning. A complete organization to carry out its large program had to be created. There was a shortage of shipbuilding skill as well as shipbuilding facilities. The need for ships was imperative and constantly increased during the combat period.' Report of the Select Committee on U.S. Ship- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 314]\n\u00a0\n ping Board Operations, H.Rep. No. 1399, 66th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 24.\n Bethlehem was the largest shipbuilding company in the world. Its five subsidiaries and their plants were experienced shipbuilders, with efficient and well-equipped organizations. As the Master in this case found, 'it was understood by all parties concerned that the Fleet Corporation shipbuilding program would call for capacity production at each of Bethlehem's shipyards'. Of course the Government had the power to take over Bethlehem's shipyards and plants. But the United States was at war. It needed ships-and it needed them at once. The shipyards and plants of a recalcitrant shipbuilder would not produce the necessary tonnage, at least not in the needed time, without an organization able to operate them at maximum efficiency. The Master found that 'A failure to induce Bethlehem to undertake the shipbuilding program covered by these contracts, followed by the taking possession by the Fleet Corporation of the Bethlehem plants, could not have accomplished the desired result. It was Bethlehem's organization that was necessary to insure success to the shipbuilding program of the Fleet Corporation and, as the Government did not have the power to compel performance by an unwilling organization, if Bethlehem demanded its price on the basis of substantial commercial profits rather than contribute such services on a patriotic basis, the Government was obliged to take the contracts on such basis or not at all.'\n Bethlehem does not deny that in these negotiations the Government's legal power to requisition its shipyards was, for purposes of bargaining, an empty weapon. 'It is also true', Bethlehem admits, 'that, although the Fleet Corporation had the power to take over Bethlehem's yards, what it really required for the carrying out of its program was the use of Bethlehem's organization-its knowledge of how to build ships.' The representatives \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 315]\n\u00a0\n of both Bethlehem and the Fleet Corporation knew that the Government did not regard its power to requisition plants and shipyards as a satisfactory alternative to making contracts with private shipbuilders for the construction of ships. \n1\n It is not for us to say that the Government should not have determined upon such a policy. It is enough that when these contracts were made, none of the parties believed that there was open to the Government the feasible alternative which now, twenty-five years later, this Court says was open to it.\n This was the setting in which the contracts in suit were made. Bethlehem was represented throughout the negotiations by Joseph W. Powell, its vice president and operating manager, and Harry Brown, its technical manager, described by the Master as 'two of the ablest and most experienced shipbuilders and estimators of shipbuilding costs in the United States'. On behalf of the Fleet Corporation the active negotiators were Admiral E. T. Bowles, manager of its division of steel ship construction, and G. S. Radford, manager of its contract \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 316]\n\u00a0\n division. The Master characterized Bowles and Radford as 'equally competent shipbuilding experts'. However, they were not empowered to conclude contracts on behalf of the Fleet Corporation. That ultimate authority belonged to Charles Piez, the vice-president and general manager of the Fleet Corporation. Piez was a business man who had had no previous shipbuilding experience, and the Master found that 'At the time of the negotiations relating to the contracts in controversy, the relations between Powell and Piez were very close. Piez, as Powell knew, had had no shipbuilding experience whatsoever, had implicit confidence in Powell's integrity and shipbuilding ability and experience, and was accustomed to look to him for information and assistance with respect to matters of shipbuilding.'\n Following a conference in Washington on June 15, 1917, attended by Powell and other shipbuilders, the General Manager of the Fleet Corporation requested Bethlehem to submit formal proposals for the construction of ships. Throughout the entire negotiations which followed, the Fleet Corporation tried to persuade Bethlehem to enter into 'lump-sum' contracts. Powell refused, insisting upon the so-called 'half-savings' form of contract which he had originated. He set forth his proposals in his letter of December 13, 1917, to the Fleet Corporation: 'Because of the unprecedented conditions surrounding the Labor and Material market, it is impracticable to estimate within a reasonable percentage what will be the actual cost of construction, and it is therefore impossible to submit fixed prices for any of these vessels, except upon a basis so far above estimated cost that any figure acceptable to this Company would not be acceptable to the Emergency Fleet Corporation. It is proposed, however, that they be constructed on the basis of actual cost plus a fee, with an agreed upon probable cost, this Company to be paid in addition to the fee one-half of any saving that may be \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 317]\n\u00a0\n made below this cost figure, and with the further provision that the estimated cost figure will be increased due to any increase in rates of wages that may be approved by the Emergency Fleet Corporation.'\n After further conferences, Powell submitted a proposal, dated December 19, 1917, specifying the estimated costs and fixed fees of the vessels to be constructed. On the morning of January 3, 1918, before the Fleet Corporation had expressed any views on the proposal of December 19, Powell handed Piez a letter, dated January 3, 1918, offering to construct a greater number of vessels than was specified in his earlier proposal. The letter concluded 'that while this company cannot undertake any capital expenditures at its expense, if the terms in our proposal do not otherwise meet with the Emergency Fleet Corporation's approval, we are prepared to accept the order to construct these vessels on such terms as may be personally determined by Mr. Charles Piez, the Vice President and General Manager, and strongly urge there be no delay in placing this order, as we are making this offer because of our knowledge of the vital emergency now confronting this nation in connection with the requirements for additional merchant vessels.'\n Upon receipt of this letter, Piez arranged a conference between Powell, Brown, Bowles, and Radford, which occurred on the afternoon of January 3. But Bowles and Radford did not know, and neither was informed before or during the conference, of the offer made to Piez in Powell's letter of January 3. It can hardly be said, therefore, that this letter, neither addressed to nor made known to the real negotiators for the Government, was a factor in their negotiations.\n At the conference, which lasted about five hours, Bowles again attempted to persuade Powell to undertake the construction upon a lump-sum basis. Powell was adamant, however, and Bowles had to acquiesce in the half-savings \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 318]\n\u00a0\n form of contract in order to reach any agreement. Powell insisted that the estimates previously submitted by Bethlehem were fair and reasonable. Neither Bowles nor Radford submitted any estimates or counter-proposals, 'their criticism being limited to the opinion expressed by Bowles that the original and reduced estimates submitted by Powell were too high'. Powell made several reductions in the estimates, and in response to Bowles' inquiry, Brown assured him that the estimates were about as accurate as could be made under the circumstances. Bowles and Radford thereupon agreed to the prices, subject to confirmation by Piez. On the same day they handed Piez the following memorandum:\n'We hand you herewith the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation's proposal dated December 19, for additional construction at their various plants, amounting in all to 19 vessels, exclusive of tugs. It may be noted that, with the exception of three ships, the vessels in question are troop ships and tankers-ships of a type that only real shipbuilders can produce satisfactorily. As is well known, we have been having difficulty in placing such vessels.\n\n'We wish to place on record the fact that the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation's representatives have insisted on comparatively high prices for these vessels; that they have only with difficulty been persuaded to quote us on the types of ships referred to; and, that their attitude has been characterized by an arbitrary refusal to guarantee or stand behind delivery dates. In other words, it was difficult to persuade them to quote even a tentative delivery date, and they refused positively to accede to a bonus and penalty clause for delivery.\n\n'The letter herewith, addressed to the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, in reply to their proposal, has been prepared for your signature and is now presented with the recommendation that it be signed. While the prices we have agreed to, with representatives of the Bethlehem \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 319]\n\u00a0\n Shipbuilding Corporation, are not satisfactory to us, nevertheless, they represent a material reduction from the prices quoted by that Corporation. Realizing that the Nation will need these vessels we have been actuated by the belief that further delay in placing the contracts should be eliminated and we believe we have made the best compromise possible under very difficult conditions.'\n\n As a consequence of these negotiations, the thirteen contracts here in controversy were executed, seven on February 1, 1918, and six thereafter.\n The provisions of these contracts demand careful analysis. The contract marked No. 183, calling for the construction by Bethlehem of three steel tank vessels each weighing about 9,100 tons, is typical.\n In order to provide the sums necessary for carrying on the work under the contract, the Fleet Corporation agreed to deposit in advance 'such sums as may be necessary to constitute and keep constituted a fund from which to finance the work, to provide for payments to be made for materials, and for wages and salaries of persons employed upon the work hereunder.' The Fleet Corporation agreed also to assist Bethlehem 'to secure with the utmost practicable expedition and at the minimum cost consistent with the existing conditions, the facilities, utilities, parts, materials and supplies required for the work under this contract'. The price to be paid for each vessel was defined to include (a) the 'actual cost', plus (b) a fixed fee of $185,000, plus (c) one-half the amount by which the actual cost of each vessel should fall short of an estimated cost of $1,865,000.\n It would be difficult to draft a more inclusive definition of 'cost' than that contained in this contract. 'Actual cost' was defined to include the following items, as well as 'items similar thereto in principle': (a) the net costs of labor (including bonuses), materials, machinery, equipment, and supplies furnished by Bethlehem, and all other \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 320]\n\u00a0\n direct charges, such as insurance on the vessels, etc.; (b) a 'proper proportion' of running expenses, including rentals, cost of repairs and maintenance, light, heat, power, insurance, management, salaries ( including bonuses), and all other indirect charges; (c) a 'proper proportion' of interest accrued on bonds, loans, or other debts existing or previously made, the proceeds of which 'shall be used, or shall have been or shall be invested in plant, equipment, etc., that shall be used,' in the performance of the contract; (d) a 'proper proportion' of taxes of all kinds, except federal taxes, with respect to the business or property; ( e) a 'proper proportion' of physical losses sustained in connection with the construction of the vessels under the contract, including losses from fire, flood, storm, riot, vandalism, acts of God, acts of war, or other casualties; and (f) a 'reasonable' allowance for depreciation of property and plants used in connection with the construction under the contract.\n The Master found that under the 'half-savings' clause Bethlehem was entitled to receive one-half the difference between the estimated cost and the actual cost, regardless of how this difference was achieved. Bethlehem was therefore not required to show that the 'savings' were attributable to its efforts to increase efficiency.\n Since the estimated costs of construction specified in the contracts are crucial in fixing the extent of Bethlehem's profits, it is necessary to consider how they were determined. According to the explanation furnished by Bethlehem, Brown prepared the estimated costs specified in Bethlehem's letter of December 19, 1917, as follows: As the basis of his estimate he took the cost of constructing Hull 253, a 9,100 ton tanker which had recently been completed at the Fore River yard. The cost of the material in Hull 253 was about $389,000, consisting of $150,000 for the steel structure and $239,000 for the remaining material. Brown estimated that the cost of the material \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 321]\n\u00a0\n in a similar tanker to be constructed in 1918 would be $817,000, including $ 399,000 for the steel structure and $418,000 for the remainder. His estimate assumed an increase in freight rates and costs of delivery of 42%. The next item was the cost of labor, which on Hull 253 amounted to 38.75 cents per hour. Brown assumed that wage scales would rise to 50 cents per hour, an increase of 29%, and that efficiency would decrease about 30%. Therefore, he estimated a total labor cost of $548,000, as compared with the actual labor cost upon Hull 253 of.$326,000. Similarly, the estimates of plant operating expenses were computed on the basis of equally large assumed increases. The total estimated cost of material, labor, operating expenses, and overhead amounted to $1,694,000, to which Brown added a flat 10% allowance to cover items such as armed guard equipment and 'to make allowance for other contingencies', making a total estimated cost of $1, 863,000, or approximately $205 per ton. To this figure Powell added an additional $10 per ton because, as he testified, 'there was an item of increased cost of steel, which represented a contract for very high-priced steel that we had to use in connection with this program, and which amounted to about $2.50 a ton spread over the program that we expected to undertake. That was a very rough figure. Whatever else I put on I put on because I knew I was going to have to trade the final contract out with Admiral Bowles and I knew I would not get what I asked for , and if I did not ask for more than I expected I would not get out where I wanted to be.' Brown testified that 'He (Powell) took the figures that I gave him and added $10 a ton to it' for some reason which he could not recall.\n The estimated cost finally specified in the contract for the construction of the three vessels was $1,865,000; the estimated cost of such vessels proposed in Powell's letter of December 19, 1917, was $1,983, 800, a difference of $118,800, or less than 6% of the proposed estimate. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 322]\n\u00a0\n The Master found that during the negotiations the Fleet Corporation was uninformed as to the probable cost of materials and labor, Bethlehem's overhead and operating expenses, and depreciation and similar charges. Consequently, at the conference of January 3, 1918, from which emerged the contracts in controversy, the representatives of the Fleet Corporation did not submit any counter-offers to Bethlehem; they merely insisted that Bethlehem's estimates were too high. Brown's testimony is illuminating as to the nature of the bargaining at the conference:\n'Q. Now I am asking you whether with respect to these vessels Admiral Bowles submitted any price of his own?\n\n'A. No, sir.\n\n'Q. Did he ask you how your estimates were made up?\n\n'A. No, sir.\n\n'Q. Did he ask you to justify your estimates in any way?\n\n'A. No, sir.\n\n'Q. He just objected to them repeatedly and said they were too high?\n\n'A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. But did not ask you to justify them?\n\n'A. No, sir.\n\n'Q. Until Powell finally came down to a figure which Bowles was willing to accept?\n\n'A. Well, I should put it this way; to a figure which Mr. Powell refused to go below.'\n\n The total estimated costs of construction in the thirteen contracts in controversy amounted to $119,750,000. The total actual costs, as defined in the contracts, were $92,990,521. The estimated costs therefore exceeded the actual costs by $26,759,479, or, to put it another way, the estimated costs were almost 29% greater than actual costs. Nowhere in the long record, as the Master found, is there any explanation or justification for the tremendous dis- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 323]\n\u00a0\n parity between the estimated costs submitted by Bethlehem, or those specified in the contracts, and the actual costs.\n Bethlehem's profits under these contracts amount to approximately $24, 000,000, or about 22% of actual costs including extra work. In two of these contracts, Nos. 191 and 226, its profits exceed 34% and 32%, respectively. Moreover these figures do not include the profits made by Bethlehem Steel Company, an affiliate, on the sales to Bethlehem at the maximum prices permitted by the War Industries Board of 43,000 tons of steel used in the construction of ships under these contracts.\n To speak of Bethlehem's profits as only 22% is in any event misleading. The profits are 22% of 'cost', and not 22% of what might fairly be described as Bethlehem's capital investment in these contracts. For under these contracts Bethlehem took absolutely no risk of loss; in addition, the Government agreed to advance all sums necessary to finance the construction of the vessels. Even in usurious transactions the lender takes the risk of the borrower's insolvency. Here Bethlehem took no risks at all.\n Bethlehem has already received from the Government the total costs of construction (including items for wage increases and extra work), plus fixed profits of $11,962,400 (representing about 11% of the actual costs including extra charges), plus bonuses of $8,093,157 under the half- savings clause (over 7% of costs). It has thus received total profits of more than $20,000,000 under these contracts. In the present suits it is seeking additional sums of more than $7,500,000, of which about $3,800,000 represents bonuses under the contracts in question. In sustaining the judgments of the lower courts, this Court is awarding Bethlehem further profits of about 4% on these contracts.\n The Master expressly found that it was essential that Bethlehem undertake to build the vessels provided for in \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 324]\n\u00a0\n the contracts, and that since the Government needed Bethlehem's organization, it had no satisfactory alternative. It had to make the contracts on Bethlehem's terms or not at all. He concluded, nevertheless, that since 'the Fleet Corporation made the contracts with open eyes, although resenting the commercial attitude of Bethlehem and condemning Bethlehem for demanding its 'pound of flesh\", the contracts were enforceable by Bethlehem in the absence of any proof of fraud.\n The District Court concurred in the proposition that the absence of fraud made the contracts invulnerable. But its conclusion is contradicted by its findings: 'The managers for the contractor adopted the famous Rob Roy distinction who admitted he was a robber but proudly proclaimed that he was no thief. The contractor boldly and openly fixed the figures in the estimated cost so high as to give them the promise of large bonus profits. The managers for the Fleet Corporation knew that the estimate was high and why it was made high and so protested it. The reply of the contractor's managers was, 'We will take the contract with this promise of bonus profits incorporated in it but not otherwise. You take it or leave it'. Whatever wrong there was in this, may have been the wrong in a daylight robbery but there was no element of deception in it.' 23 F.Supp. 676, 679.\n Similarly, the affirmance of the Circuit Court of Appeals appears to have been based upon the assumption that the government's failure to show fraud was fatal: 'It is of course obvious that these negotiations took place in time of war when the need of the Government for ships was extremely urgent and the necessity of reaching an agreement with Bethlehem, therefore, vital. It is equally clear that Bethlehem insisted upon assuring itself a margin of profit which in view of the necessities of the Government was so large as to indicate an attitude of commercial greed but little diluted with patriotic feeling. There is no doubt \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 325]\n\u00a0\n that this attitude on the part of Bethlehem was deeply resented by the Government representatives but the latter were faced with the alternative of either agreeing to Bethlehem's terms or taking possession of its shipyards and having the Government itself construct the vessels. We think the record clearly indicates that the Government representatives felt that the latter course could not have accomplished the shipbuilding program with the speed which was essential. It was Bethlehem's existing shipbuilding organization that was necessary to insure success to the program of the Fleet Corporation. Consequently the Government representatives, feeling as they did that Bethlehem's organization was necessary to their program, were obliged to accept the terms offered by Bethlehem. This they did with full knowledge, as we have said, that the estimated cost figures included in the contracts did not represent close approximations but were so prepared as to assure to Bethlehem substantial additional profits by way of the bonus of savings. It follows that while Bethlehem may be condemned for having taken advantage of the Nation's necessities to secure inordinate profits it cannot be charged with having misrepresented the facts to the Government's representatives.' 113 F.2d 301, 305, 306.\n Thus, not less than six times did the Circuit Court of Appeals declare that the unconscionable terms of this contract were forced upon the Government by the dire necessities of national self-preservation. Nevertheless the Court found itself impotent to resist the demand that the courts themselves become the means of realizing these 'inordinate profits'. But law does not subject courts to such impotence. Courts need not be the agents of a wrong that offends their conscience if they heed the commands of law.\n In England prior to 1285 (Statute of Westminster II, 13 Edw. I, c. 50) suitors were frequently 'obliged to depart from the Chancery without getting writs, because there are none which will exactly fit their cases, although these cases \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 326]\n\u00a0\n fall within admitted principles.' Maitland, Forms of Action at Common Law, Lect. IV (1936 ed.) p. 51. Today it is held that because the circumstances of this case cannot be fitted into a neatly carved pigeonhole in the law of contracts, 'daylight robbery', exploitation of the 'necessities' of the country at war, must be consummated by this Court. It is said that familiar principles would be outraged if Bethlehem were denied recovery on these contracts. But is there any principle which is more familiar or more firmly embedded in the history of Anglo-American law than the basic doctrine that the courts will not permit themselves to be used as instruments of inequity and injustice? Does any principle in our law have more universal application than the doctrine that courts will not enforce transactions in which the relative positions of the parties are such that one has unconscionably taken advantage of the necessities of the other?\n These principles are not foreign to the law of contracts. Fraud and physical duress are not the only grounds upon which courts refuse to enforce contracts. The law is not so primitive that it sanctions every injustice except brute force and downright fraud. More specifically, the courts generally refuse to lend themselves to the enforcement of a 'bargain' in which one party has unjustly taken advantage of the economic necessities of the other. 'And there is great reason and justice in this rule, for necessitous men are not, truly speaking, free men, but, to answer a present exigency, will submit to any terms that the crafty may impose upon them.' Vernon v. Bethell, 2 Eden 110, 113. So wrote Lord Chancellor Northington in 1761\n\n\n The fact that the representative of the Government entered into the contracts 'with their eyes wide open' does not mean that they were not acting under compulsion. 'It always is for the interest of a party under duress to choose the lesser of two evils. But the fact that a \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 327]\n\u00a0\n choice was made according to interest does not exclude duress. It is the characteristic of duress properly so called.' Holmes, J., in Union Pac. R. Co. v. Public Service Comm., \n248 \nU.S. 67, 70\n, 39 S.Ct. 24, 25. In that case a state unconstitutionally exacted a fee for a certificate of authority to issue railroad bonds. A railroad which had paid the fee and obtained a certificate, rather than run the risk of subsequent invalidation of its bonds and imposition of serious penalties, was held to have been coerced into making the payments. In Swift & Courtney & Beecher Mfg. Company v. United States, \n111 \nU.S. 22, 29\n, 4 S.Ct. 244, 247, the taxpayer's only alternatives were 'to submit to an illegal exaction or discontinue its business'. The payment of the tax in these circumstances was held to be under duress. See, also, Ward v. Board of County Com'rs of Love County, \n253 \nU.S. 17, 23\n, 40 S.Ct. 419, 421. The courts generally regard the dilemma of the taxpayer who must either pay the taxes or incur serious business losses as a species of duress. E.g., Morgan v. Palmer, 2 Barn. & C. 729; Ripley v. Gelston, 9 Johns., N.Y., 201, 6 Am.Dec. 271; Scottish U. & N. Ins. Co. v. Herriott, 109 Iowa 606, 80 N.W. 665, 77 Am.St.Rep. 548; see Notes, 64 A.L.R. 9, 84 A. L.R. 294.\n Underlying all these cases is the law's recognition of a basic psychological truth. In Atkinson v. Denby, 7 Hurst. & N. 934, 936, Cockburn, C.J., said that 'Where the one person can dictate, and the other has no alternative but to submit, it is coercion'. See, also, Abbott, C.J., in Morgan v. Palmer, 2 Barn. & C. 729, 735: 'But if one party has the power of saying to the other, 'that which you require shall not be done except upon the conditions which I choose to impose,' no person can contend that they stand upon anything like an equal footing.' And these were decisions in days when law was supposed to be much more rigid and more respectful of forms than we now ordinarily deem just.\n The fundamental principle of law that the courts will not enforce a bargain where one party has unconscionably \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 328]\n\u00a0\n taken advantage of the necessities and distress of the other has found expression in an almost infinite variety of cases. See Lonergan v. Buford, \n148 \nU.S. 581, 589\n, 591 S., 13 S.Ct. 684, 686, 687; Snyder v. Rosenbaum, \n215 \nU.S. 261, 265\n, 266 S., 30 S.Ct. 73, 75, 76. Perhaps the most familiar is the situation of the mortgagor who under the pressure of financial distress conveys his equity of redemption to the mortgagee. The courts will scrutinize the transaction very carefully, Villa v. Rodriguez, 12 Wall. 323, 339, and if it appears that the mortgagee has taken unfair advantage of the other's position, the conveyance will not be enforced. Compare Vernon v. Bethell, 2 Eden 110; Close v. Phipps, 7 M. & G. 586; Richardson v. Barrick, 16 Iowa 407.\n Similarly, an heir or remainderman who is compelled by financial circumstances to sell his expectancy for a song may recover it if the vendee has unduly exploited the other's distress. Wood v. Abrey, 3 Madd. 216, 219 (where the Vice-Chancellor, Sir John Leach, said: 'If a man who meets his purchaser on equal terms, negligently sells his estate at an under value, he has no title to relief in equity. But a Court of Equity will inquire whether the parties really did meet on equal terms; and if it be found that the vendor was in distressed circumstances, and that advantage was taken of that distress, it will avoid the contract.'); Underhill v. Harwood, 10 Ves.Jr. 209; McKinney v. Pinckard's Ex'r, 2 Leigh 149, 29 Va. 149, 21 Am.Dec. 601; Butler v. Duncan, 47 Mich. 94, 10 N.W. 123, 41 Am.Rep. 711; Brown v. Hall, 14 R.I. 249, 51 Am.Rep. 375. In Administrators of Hough v. Hunt, 2 Ohio 495, 502, 15 Am.Dec. 569, a person heavily in debt, in order to obtain a further loan with which to meet debts falling due, agreed to buy land at more than double its value. The court found that the lender had unjustly taken advantage of the borrower's necessities and therefore rescinded the contract: 'The rule in chancery is well established. When a person is incumbered with debts, and that fact is known to a person with whom he contracts, who avails himself of it to exact an \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 329]\n\u00a0\n unconscionable bargain, equity will relieve upon account of the advantage and hardship.' This was written in 1826. To the same effect are Vyne v. Glenn, 41 Mich. 112, 1 N.W. 997, and Bither v. Packard, 115 Me. 306, 98 A. 929.\n Another class of cases in which this principle has been applied arises where a customer of a gas or electric company pays charges which he asserts he is not obligated to pay, rather than have his service disconnected. Payments made in such circumstances are regarded as coerced. See Boston v. Edison Electric Illuminating Co., 242 Mass. 305, 310, 136 N. E. 113; Westlake & Button v. St. Louis, 77 Mo. 47, 46 Am.Rep. 4; Note, 34 A.L.R. 185.\n Cobb v. Charter, 32 Conn. 358, 87 Am.Dec. 178, illustrates another type of controversy in which the courts have given effect to the historic principle of duress which is now seemingly rejected as an innovation. The defendant there had possession of a chest of tools belonging to the plaintiff, a mechanic. He refused to give up the chest, which the plaintiff needed in order to ply his trade, unless the latter would pay a bill for which he denied responsibility. The plaintiff's payment of the bill in these circumstances was held to have been made under duress. Accord: Lonergan v. Buford, \n148 \nU.S. 581, 589\n, 591 S., 13 S.Ct. 684, 686, 687; Fenwick Shipping Co. v. Clarke Bros., 133 Ga. 43, 65 S.Ct. 140; Stenton v. Jerome, 54 N.Y. 480; Harmony v. Bingham, 12 N.Y. 99, 62 Am. Dec. 142.\n In Stiefler v. McCullough, 97 Ind.App. 123, 174 N.E. 823, a merchant who had to obtain a loan in order to remain in business agreed to pay the president of a bank an exorbitant sum in consideration for his services in procuring a loan. The court refused to enforce this agreement as unconscionable. Similarly, in Niedermeyer v. Curators of University of Missouri, 61 Mo.App. 654, a student paid tuition fees which he regarded as excessive, and which he did not believe he was required to pay under his contract with the university, only because he feared expulsion for non- payment. This payment was held to have been made \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 330]\n\u00a0\n under duress and hence recoverable. Cf. Baldwin v. Sullivan Timber Co., 65 Hun 625, 20 N.Y.S. 496; Kelley v. Caplice, 23 Kan. 474, 33 Am.Rep. 179.\n Strikingly analogous to the case at bar are the decisions that a salvor who takes advantage of the helplessness of the ship in distress to drive an unconscionable bargain will not be aided by the courts in his attempts to enforce the bargain. Post v. Jones, 19 How. 150, 160; The Tornado, \n109 \nU.S. 110, 117\n, 3 S.Ct. 78, 82; The Elfrida, \n172 \nU.S. 186, 193\n, 19 S.Ct. 146, 148. In Post v. Jones, supra (19 How. 160), it was said that the courts 'will not tolerate the doctrine that a salvor can take the advantage of his situation, and avail himself of the calamities of others to drive a bargain; nor will they permit the performance of a public duty to be turned into a traffic of profit'. These cases are not unlike the familiar example of the drowning man who agrees to pay an exorbitant sum to a rescuer who would otherwise permit him to drown. No court would enforce a contract made under such circumstances. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n To deny the existence of duress in a Government contract by ironic reference to the feebleness of the United States as against the overpowering strength of a single private corporation is an indulgence of rhetoric in disregard of fact. The United States with all its might and majesty never makes a contract. To speak of a contract by the United States is to employ an abstraction. We must not allow it to become a blinding abstraction. Contracts are made not by 130 million Americans but by some official on their behalf. Because the national interest is represented \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 331]\n\u00a0\n not by the power of the nation but by an individual professing to exercise authority of vast consequence to the nation, action by Government officials is often not binding against the Government in situations where private parties would be bound. \n3\n The contracts here were not made by an abstraction known as the United States or by the millions of its citizens. For all practical purposes, the arrangement was entered into by two persons, Bowles and Radford. And it was entered into by them against their better judgment because they had only Hobson's choice-which is no choice. They had no choice in view of the circumstances which subordinated them and by which they were governed, namely, that ships were needed, and needed quickly, and Bethlehem was needed to construct them quickly. The legal alternative-that the Government take over Bethlehem-was not an actual alternative, and Bethlehem knew this as well as the representatives of the Government.\n The suggestion is made that Bethlehem's profits under these contracts were not exceptional when compared with the profits made under similar contracts, and that the enormous profits claimed by Bethlehem under these contracts cannot be regarded as supporting the inference that Bethlehem took advantage of the Government's distress. But the only contracts before us are those involved in this litigation. There is nothing in this record which enables us to say that although these contracts are unconscionable, all contracts made by the Government during the same period were no less unconscionable. And \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 332]\n\u00a0\n even if this were so, it would be no argument that this Court should give its sanction to these contracts by making itself the instrument for realizing the unconscionable profits. What little light the record does cast upon contemporary contracts gives no justification for regarding these contracts as typical. The policy of Charles M. Schwab, Director General of the Fleet Corporation, was to make contracts providing for a maximum profit of 10%, out of which all federal taxes would have to be paid. See Letter of Oct. 2, 1918, to Edward N. Hurley, Chairman of the Shipping Board, relating to contracts with the American Shipbuilding Company.\n If we are to go outside the record, the evidence is confusing and unreliable. It must be borne in mind that Bethlehem took no risk of loss, that under the contracts it was protected from the risks of rising costs of labor, materials, transportation, etc., that under the contracts it was not required to make any capital expenditures, that the Government agreed to advance all sums that should be necessary for the performance of the contracts. It is idle to compare the profits made by Bethlehem under these contracts with profits made by industrial concerns of various types under different types of contracts. Such figures are statistical quicksand unless we are told also that in each case the contractor was not required to make any capital investment, that he was insured against normal business risks, and that he was guaranteed a profit, regardless of any change in circumstances.\n We know that the policy of the Navy Department with respect to so- called straight cost-plus shipbuilding contracts was to allow profits of 10% of actual cost. See Annual Report of the Secretary of the Navy (1917) p. 33; Annual Report (1918) p. 685; Annual Report (1919) pp. 572-76; Annual Report (1920) pp. 147-48. We know that, similarly, the policy of the War Department with respect to cost-plus contracts for the construction of can- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 333]\n\u00a0\n tonments was to allow profits not exceeding 10% of cost. See Annual Report of the Secretary of War (1917) vol. 1, p. 28; Annual Report (1918) vol. 1, p. 1319; Annual Report (1919) pp. 4138-42. See also Crowell, Government War Contracts, p. 85 (in 'emergency building contracts' a sliding scale of profits was employed, ranging from cost plus 7% on contracts less than $ 100,000 to cost plus 2 1\/2% on contracts more than $10,000,000). Similarly, contracts for the construction of buildings to house war workers were let on the basis of cost plus 2 1\/2% on contracts over $1,000,000, and 3 1\/2% on contracts under $1,000,000. See testimony of Otto M. Eidlitz, President of the U.S. Housing Corporation, Hearings before the subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds pursuant to S. Res. 371, 65th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 35.\n These statistics obviously do not tell the whole story of Government contracts in the last war. But they indicate plainly enough that this Court should not accept, as a basis for decision in this case, the premise that Bethlehem's profits were conventional when compared with profits made in comparable transactions.\n It is said, further, that even if these contracts are unenforceable when measured by standards of justice and equity enforced by the courts for centuries, nevertheless this Court must enforce the contracts now before us because Congress and the President specifically authorized such a traffic in profits. The suggestion is not consistent with historical fact.\n The legislative history of the Emergency Shipping Fund Act furnishes no support for the contention that in conferring upon the President authority to enter into contracts for the construction of ships, Congress thereby commanded the courts to enforce all contracts that were made. Without regard to their provisions and the circumstances under which they were negotiated. On the contrary, the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 334]\n\u00a0\n debates contain many indications that Congress expected that the shipbuilders of the nation would provide their services for a reasonable compensation, and that the power conferred upon the President to take over shipyards would not be exercised. See remarks of Senator Knox, 55 Cong.Rec. 2518; Senator Calder, 55 id. 2529; Rep. Fitzgerald, 55 id. 3018. Indeed, the Act itself specified that ships should be built 'at such reasonable price as shall be determined by the President'. 40 Stat. 182, 183.\n The National Defense Act, 39 Stat. 166, 213, 50 U.S.C.A.  80, specifically provided that 'The compensation to be paid to any individual, firm, ... for its products or material, or as rental for use of any manufacturing plant while used by the United States, shall be fair and just.' There can be no clearer indication that Congress did not authorize or approve any policy of trafficking in profits. The fact that Congress took care to ascertain whether the war agencies were letting contracts under which excessive profits were being made, see Hearings before subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations on H.R. 3971, 65th Cong., 1st Sess., especially pp. 15-17, shows very plainly that Congress in no way countenanced exploitation for exorbitant private profit of the necessities of the Government.\n Authority given to make contracts does not imply authority to make unconscionable contracts. Suppose that Congress in authorizing the contracts in question had written into its legislation: 'Provided, that no agency of government shall be authorized to enter into unconscionable contracts.' Can it be that because Congress did not expressly provide that 'unconscionable contracts' are unauthorized it impliedly sanctioned the making of 'unconscionable contracts'? Or suppose the estimated costs in the contracts were so inflated by Bethlehem that its profits were 200% rather than 22%. Would this Court still be bound to enforce these contracts on the ground that \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 335]\n\u00a0\n Congress had commanded their enforcement? Surely Congress did not impliedly repeal historic legal principles and prohibit this Court from exercising its duty to withhold relief when the particular circumstances disclose an unconscionable arrangement in the making of which the Government's contracting officers had no practical choice.\n The suggestion that President Wilson authorized a 'traffic in profit' is refuted, if explicit proof be needed, by his utterances. For example, addressing a meeting of mine operators and manufacturers on July 12, 1917, he spoke as follows:\n'I hear it insisted that more than a just price, more than a price that will sustain our industries, must be paid; that it is necessary to pay very liberal and unusual profits in order to 'stimulate production'; that nothing but pecuniary rewards will do it-rewards paid in money, not in the mere liberation of the world.\n\n'I take it for granted that those who argue thus do not stop to think what that means. Do they mean that you must be paid, must be bribed, to make your contribution, a contribution that costs you neither a drop of blood nor a tear, when the whole world is in travail and men everywhere depend upon and call to you to bring them out of bondage and make the world a fit place to live in again, amidst peace and justice?\n\n'Do they mean that you will exact a price, drive a bargain, with the men who are enduring the agony of this war on the battlefield, in the trenches, amidst the lurking dangers of the sea, or with the bereaved women and the pitiful children, before you will come forward to do your duty and give some part of your life, in easy, peaceful fashion, for the things we are fighting for, the things we have pledged our fortunes, our lives, our sacred honor to vindicate and defend-liberty and justice and fair dealing and the peace of nations? Of course you will not. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 336]\n\u00a0\n 'It is inconceivable. Your patriotism is of the same self-denying stuff as the patriotism of the men dead or maimed on the fields of France, or else it is no patriotism at all.\n\n'Let us never speak, then, of profits and of patriotism in the same sentence, but face facts and meet them.\n\n'Let us do sound business, but not in the midst of a mist. Many a grievous burden of taxation will be laid on this Nation, in this generation and in the next, to pay for this war. Let us see to it that for every dollar that is taken from the people's pockets it shall be possible to obtain a dollar's worth of the sound stuffs they need.' Public Papers of Woodrow Wilson, Vol. 3, pp. 75-6; 55 Cong.Rec. 4995.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes has said that 'Men must turn square corners when they deal with the Government.' Rock Island, etc., R. Co. v. United States, \n254 \nU.S. 141, 143\n, 41 S.Ct. 55, 56. His admonition has particular relevance when this Court is called upon to enforce agreements made with the Government at war for the production of supplies essential to the prosecution of the war. During wartime the bargaining position of Government contracting officers is inherently weak, no matter how conscientious they may be. If they are to deal on equal terms with private contractors, particularly where the subject matter of contracts is so intricate and so specialized as the building of ships, they must have available to them not only detailed information but also the time within which to study the data and the freedom to exercise a real choice. In the last war, at least, this was not generally true. See Sen.Rep. No. 944, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 4, p. 30. It is not difficult in these days to appreciate the position of negotiators for the Government in time of war and to realize how much the pressures of war deprive them of equality of bargaining power in situations where bargaining with private contractors is the only practicable means of securing necessary war supplies. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 337]\n\u00a0\n Because the Government is in such a dependent position, and because those who deal with it on a cost-plus arrangement or some similar basis are assured of a profit, it is wholly consistent with practicalities and makes no unduly idealistic demand for the law to judge the arrangements of such wartime contractors by standards not unlike those by which a fiduciary's conduct is judged. Those upon whom the nation is dependent for its supplies in the defense of its life would hardly wish to be judged by lower standards.\n The modes are vast and varied by which the nation obtains its war supplies. What will best supply war needs in amplest measure in the quickest time and least wastefully-whether by private letting and, if so, under what restrictions and safeguards; under what circumstances the Government should do its own supplying either by taking over old plants or building new ones or a combination of the two; to what extent and through what means peacetime habits and traditions may be displaced and disregarded-these are questions of policy for the wisdom and responsibility of the Congress and the Executive. The very limited scope of inquiry to which a litigation on a particular transaction is confined is hardly the basis for judgment on such far-flung issues. If the history of this Court permits one generalization above all others, it is the unwisdom of entering the domain of policy outside the very narrow legal limits presented by the record of a particular litigation. Such intrusion into the executive and legislative domains is not conducive to the just disposition of the immediate controversy. We are much less likely to go wrong if we do not depart from the well-grooved path of judicial competence.\n This Court should not permit Bethlehem to recover these unconscionable profits, and thereby 'make the court the instrument of this injustice.' Thomas v. Brownville, etc., R. Co., \n109 \nU.S. 522, 526\n, 3 S.Ct. 315, 318. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 338]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS.\n On the point of duress and coercion I thoroughly agree with the views expressed by Mr. Justice BLACK and join in the opinion of the Court. For the reasons stated by Mr. Justice BLACK, the claim that Bethlehem's profits were unconscionable in the legal sense would likewise fail.\n There is, however, one aspect of the case on which I take a somewhat different view.\n The United States does not contest here the right of Bethlehem to retain its 'fixed fee' of approximately $12,000,000 for the construction of the ships. The dispute revolves around an additional sum of $12,000,000 which Bethlehem claims under the so-called 'bonus-for-savings' provision of the contracts. That provision in the several contracts was the same except for the amount of the fixed fee. Thus a typical contract provided: 'Should the actual cost be less than the estimated ... cost ... the Contractor shall be allowed as profit on each vessel in addition to said fixed sum for profit of ... $210,000 one-half the amount by which such actual cost of each vessel falls short of the estimated cost ....'\n I agree that the consummation of the bargain depended upon the inclusion of this 'savings' clause and that in each instance there was but one contract, not several. My view, however, is that each contract was divisible or severable. '... the essential feature of such a contract is that a portion of the price is by the terms of the agreement set off against a portion of the performance and made payable for that portion, so that when an apportioned part of the performance has been rendered a debt for that part immediately arises.' Williston on Contracts,  861 (Rev.Ed.). In other words, the whole performance of each contract was divided 'into two sets of partial performances, each part of each set being the agreed exchange \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 339]\n\u00a0\n for a corresponding part of the set of performances to be rendered by the other promisor'. Id.,  860A. (1) The promise of the Fleet Corporation to pay the actual cost plus the fixed fee was exchanged for Bethlehem's undertaking to construct the ships. (2) The promise of the Fleet Corporation to pay one-half the amount by which the actual cost fell short of the estimated cost was exchanged for Bethlehem's promise (which is implied) to effect the savings by increasing efficiency.\n Although I am clear that the contracts would not have been made but for the inclusion of the 'savings' provision, I do not believe that there is a 'necessary dependency' between these two sets of promises within the rule of Philadelphia, W. & B.R. Co. v. Howard, 13 How. 307, 339. And see Pollak v. Brush Electric Assoc., \n128 \nU.S. 446, 455\n, 9 S.Ct. 119, 121; Fullmer v. Poust, 155 Pa. 275, 278, 26 A. 543, 35 Am.St.Rep. 881; Restatement, Contracts,  266(3). Precedents, to be sure, are of little aid since each case turns on its special circumstances. But the construction of divisibility seems warranted by the facts, though here as in other cases considerable reliance must be placed on implications.\n Bethlehem's argument against divisibility rests on such testimony of Piez, who represented the Fleet Corporation, as follows: 'The price had to be placed for actual cost, if we knew the cost, plus an allowance for contingencies, plus an allowance for incentive, plus the fee. So we start out with the bare cost; then in order to meet any contingencies that may happen, add some allowance for contingencies; in order to give a proper incentive, add an incentive allowance; and then add the fee.' That is to say the 'savings' clause was deemed to be valuable from the Fleet Corporation's viewpoint as an 'incentive' to keep the costs down and to expedite the work. And Powell, the author of the 'savings' clause in this case and the representative of Bethlehem, testified that the savings to be obtained would \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 340]\n\u00a0\n be sufficient to 'wipe out the excess profits taxes', so that the fixed fee would be 'net' to Bethlehem.\n But Powell's testimony also indicated that while the 'savings' clause was an 'incentive', Bethlehem was to earn the 'savings':\n'Q. Then I take it that one of your great problems, as the driving force of this organization, was to improve your labor conditions, or first to prevent labor conditions from getting worse and then to try to improve them?\n\n'A. Yes.\n\n'Q. Over what they were in December of 1917?\n\n'A. Yes.\n\n'Q. And if you were able to do that, then there was a possibility of some profit in these contracts under the half savings clause?\n\n'A. Yes.\n\n'Q. Was there any likelihood, or did you at that time foresee any likelihood, of any substantial saving in your material items?\n\n'A. No, I should not have expected at that time to make any saving of any amount in the materials.\n\n'Q. So that, if Bethlehem was to make any money out of these contracts in excess of the fixed fee, it was your judgment that the only way to do it was by increasing the efficiency of the yards?\n\n'A. Exactly.'\n\n Powell also testified:\n'The estimate was a figure which we had to shoot at that in my judgment gave us a reasonable profit or a chance of making a substantial saving. To make that saving, we had to operate more efficiently than what we might say was average efficiency under conditions that then existed. If we were going to make that saving, we had to overcome any increased cost due to decreased efficiency, and increase efficiency beyond what it was at that time.' \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 341]\n\u00a0\n And Piez testified that the provision was to give the shipbuilders an 'incentive' to 'use their ingenuity to make a larger profit.'\n\n The Special Master found that the estimates designated as 'base prices' in the contracts 'would afford Bethlehem a reasonable opportunity to effect 'savings' as a result of its efforts and ability to increase efficiency of management and labor as compared with average efficiency then existing.' He also found that 'it was understood that participation in 'savings' was supposed to represent a bonus or additional compensation to be earned by Bethlehem as consideration for its special efforts and ability to reduce cost by increasing efficiency of management and labor as compared with efficiency then existing.' Yet he further found that 'Bethlehem was to participate in savings however earned, but expected to produce savings by increased efficiency.'\n My difficulty is with that last finding. If Bethlehem was to share half of the savings 'however earned', then its right to receive the bonus might well depend on a wholly fortuitous circumstance or it might accrue as petitioner suggests 'simply as a reward for the inaccuracy of its estimate of actual costs.' Under that view Bethlehem would be entitled to $ 12,000,000 additional compensation merely because the wholesale price index fell. Yet that would be tantamount to a gift by public officers of property of the United States. The same result would follow if the clause be read as containing merely a 'best efforts' provision. The contract already provided that Bethlehem 'in all its acts hereunder, shall use its best efforts to protect and subserve the interest of the Owner.' Even if the absence of such a provision, one would be implied. United States v. A. Bentley & Sons Co., D.C., 293 F. 229, 235; United States v. George A. Fuller Co., D.C., 296 F. 178, 180. Hence it is difficult for me to imply that this additional $12,000,000 was offered as a reward for performing an obligation which the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 289, 342]\n\u00a0\n law would impose on the contractor in any event. Burke & James, Inc., v. United States, 63 Ct.Cl. 36, 57. That, too, would be a grant of public funds for which the United States would receive no quid pro quo.\n Hence it seems more reasonable to imply that Bethlehem was to render an additional performance for the additional compensation of $12,000,000. Such a construction of the contracts avoids the difficulties I have mentioned, as it gives the United States a quid pro quo for its promise to pay an additional $12,000,000. Cf. Dayton Airplane Co. v. United States, 6 Cir., 21 F.2d 673, 682, 683. And it is supported by the testimony of the representatives of the two contracting parties who negotiated the contracts.\n In that view of the matter Bethlehem would be put to its proof that it effected the savings which it now claims. Mere guesswork would not be enough. J. J. Preis & Co. v. United States, 58 Ct.Cl. 81, 86. Precise proof of each dollar saved might not be possible. But a reasonable approximation of Bethlehem's contribution to the savings would be necessary. Such burden of proof has been sustained in other cases involving similar contracts. Cohen, Endel & Co. v. United States, 60 Ct.Cl. 513; F. Jacobson & Sons v. United States, 61 Ct.Cl. 420. The Circuit Court of Appeals stated that there was 'some evidence tending to show that the savings resulted, in part at least, from increased efficiency.' 113 F.2d 301, 307. But there was no clear showing that special efforts were made to reduce costs and that the savings which resulted were traceable to such efforts. The necessary findings on that issue were not made. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Included in the detailed and comprehensive itemization of 'actual cost' were the following and 'items similar thereto in principle':\n'The net costs ... of labor (including compensation of labor by way of bonuses), and materials, machinery, equipment, and supplies ... and other direct charges, such as insurance on the vessels, etc.\n\n'A proper proportion of running expenses, including ordinary rentals , ... repairs, and maintenance, light, heat, power, insurance, management, salaries (including compensation by way of bonuses), and other indirect charges ....\n\n'A proper proportion of interest accrued ... on bonds or other debts or loans existing or contracted for prior to the date of this contract and the proceeds of which shall be used, or shall have been or shall be invested in plant, equipment, etc., that shall be used, in the performance of the work under this contract.\n\n'A proper proportion of taxes of all kinds accrued during the taxable year with respect to the business or property, except any Federal taxes. \n\n\"A proper proportion of physical losses actually sustained within the taxable year in connection with the construction of the vessels under this contract, including losses from fire, flood, storm, riot, vandalism, any acts of God, acts of war, or other casualties and not compensated for by insurance or otherwise.\n\n\"A reasonable allowance, according to the condition, for depreciation of values of the property and plant of the Contractor used in connection with the work under this Contract.\"\n\n Neither in the contracts nor under any relevant statutory provision was there any restriction on salaries and bonuses to be paid to executives of the shipbuilder or its affiliates. Cf. Sections 505(c) and 805(c) of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 1985, 1999, 2013. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Even in the case of lump sum contracts with the government, it is generally recognized that the real risk of loss is negligible. It is usual in this kind of contract to set prices high enough to cover, or otherwise specifically to provide against, unforeseen contingencies. And where loss does occur contrary to the expectation of both parties, Congress often passes special bills making the contractors whole. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] These ships apparently cost the government at least a large part of still another $4,825,415. The government paid this amount to Bethlehem to aid in expansion of plant facilities to build the ships-facilities which were turned over to Bethlehem after the war. The government's money was contributed under a contract commonly in use whereby the contractor was given the option of purchasing the additional facilities at a depreciated value. Whether the government, upon conveyance of the property, received any compensation at all does not clearly appear. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] While profits on individual contracts ranged above and below 22%, both in the proceedings below and in this Court the whole series of contracts was regarded as a unit. The government has made no separate argument with respect to the individual contracts in which more than the average profit was realized, nor has Bethlehem with respect to the contracts in which the amount due under the half-savings clause proved to be small. The only finding of the Master in which any separation of contracts is made shows that the profits realized on contracts in which the estimated costs were checked by the Fleet Corporation were higher than those on contracts in which the Fleet Corporation accepted Bethlehem's estimates without check. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Compare the statutory method of restricting profits of affiliates embodied in Section 803 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 1985, 2012, 46 U.S.C.A.  1221. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] The contracts contained a provision, usual in Fleet Corporation contracts, under which the government agreed 'to provide the cash funds necessary to pay for work already done and materials already furnished and for carrying on the work under this contract.' \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The government concedes 'that $1,514,995 of the judgment awarded ... in the action at law is ... due under contracts other than those now under attack.' \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Of the cases called to our attention by the government, only in Burke & James, Inc., v. United States, 63 Ct.Cl. 36, was a bonus for savings clause held severable and invalid although regarded as 'part and parcel of the original ... contract.' We agree, as did both courts below, with the Master's statement that the Burke case is not applicable here because 'the facts upon which the decision of that case was based are so different.' \n[\nFootnote 9\n] The District Court treated the contracts as governed by the law of Pennsylvania. The Circuit Court of Appeals treated them as governed by the law either of Pennsylvania or the District of Columbia, but did not decide which. The Fleet Corporation was organized under the laws of the District of Columbia. Although wholly owned and controlled by the government it has been held subject to suit either in state or federal courts. Sloan Shipyards Corporation v.

No. 944, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2, pp. 4-5, 111-15), it was without significance in the Fleet Corporation's shipbuilding program. The reports of the Shipping Board show that the exercise of the power was limited to the acquisition of vessels which had been built or were being constructed; the power does not seem to have been employed to take over the shipyards of recalcitrant private contractors. Indeed, the policy of the Government, based upon its wartime needs, was to encourage, financially and otherwise, the construction and maintenance of shipyards by private interests.

Gen., and Richard S. Salant, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Robert A. Littleton, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n ROBERTS, Justice.\n This case involves the meaning and application of the terms of a standard form of Government construction contract.\n The findings of the Court of Claims may be summarized. In 1931 the War Department asked bids for the construction of a levee on the east side of the Mississippi River. The respondent bid 14.43\u00f5 a cubic yard on a section of the work involving approximately 3,881,600 cubic yards of earthwork. A paragraph of the specifications reserved the right to make such changes in the work contemplated as might be necessary or expedient to carry out the intent \n\n[317 \nU.S. 56, 57]\n\u00a0\n of the contract or to meet unanticipated conditions, but added that no such modification would be the basis for a claim for extra compensation except as provided in the regular form of contract to be entered into between the parties.\n The respondent began construction at the south end of the project and proceeded northward. The length of the proposed levee was divided by stations one hundred feet apart and numbered from north to south. Sixty- eight per cent. of the construction between Station 5123 and Station 5113 had been completed when portions of the levee already constructed south of Station 5123 were found to have a tendency to subside. For this reason the Government contracting officer, on October 7, 1932, ordered the work stopped between the two stations while he sought to determine the cause of the subsidence. He concluded that the placing of an enlarged false berm, not called for in the original specifications, would prevent subsidence in the sector between the two stations. On October 18th he gave respondent a written order to construct such a berm; the order stated that respondent would be given one hundred per cent. credit for the earth placed south of Station 5123 where the subsidence had occurred and that payment for additional yardage required by the false berm would be made at the contract price per cubic yard. The additional yardage involved was about 64,000 cubic yards. The work covered by the change order was necessary for the completion of the project. The order was issued against the respondent's protest that an extra price should be allowed as the additional work would cost the respondent more than 14.43\u00f5 per cubic yard, and that the order was not within the terms of the contract. The respondent asserted it would later present a claim for extra cost occasioned it by the additional work.\n Article 3 of the standard form of construction contract signed by the parties provides: \n\n[317 \nU.S. 56, 58]\n\u00a0\n 'Article 3. Changes.-The contracting officer may at any time, by a written order, and without notice to the sureties, make changes in the drawings and (or) specifications of this contract and within the general scope thereof. If such changes cause an increase or decrease in the amount due under this contract, or in the time required for its performance, an equitable adjustment shall be made and the contract shall be modified in writing accordingly. ... Any claim for adjustment under this article must be asserted within ten days from the date the change is ordered, unless the contracting officer shall for proper cause extend such time, and if the parties can not agree upon the adjustment the dispute shall be determined as provided in Article 15 hereof. But nothing provided in this article shall excuse the contractor from proceeding with the prosecution of the work so changed.'\n Article 15 provides:\n'Article 15. Disputes. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this contract, all disputes concerning questions of fact arising under this contract shall be decided by the contracting officer or his duly authorized representative, subject to written appeal by the contractor within thirty days to the head of the department concerned, whose decision shall be final and conclusive upon the parties thereto as to such questions of fact. In the meantime the contractor shall diligently proceed with the work as directed.'\n\n The respondent did not appeal from the order of the contracting officer to the head of the department concerned. After completion of the work, the acceptance of the Government's final payment was under protest. Thereafter respondent brought this action for its additional costs over the price of 14.43\u00f5 paid it for the extra work and was awarded a recovery by the court below.\n The Government's defense was that, under the terms of the contract, the contracting officer's decision as to what \n\n[317 \nU.S. 56, 59]\n\u00a0\n was an equitable adjustment involved only a question of fact and that if the respondent was dissatisfied with the officer's judgment the contract limited further recourse to an appeal to the department head. The court below overruled the contention by a vote of 3 to 2, one of the judges in the majority writing a separate opinion. \n1\n Two of the judges were of opinion that the contracting officer paid no attention to Art. 3 of the contract, made no adjustment, and, without considering the possibility of extra costs involved in the extra work, simply ruled that the contract price applied to it.\n We cannot accept this view for several reasons. In the first place, there are no findings to support it. The findings show that the officer gave the matter consideration, reached a decision about it, and issued the order which gave respondent a credit to which it might not have been entitled under the contract, and fixed the rate of 14.43\u00f5 per cubic yard for the extra yardage required by the change in the specifications. There are no findings that the contracting officer failed to ascertain the probable cost of the new work or that he did not honestly decide that the contract price would be a fair allowance for the extra work. If the conflict between the opinion and the findings were sufficient to require a remand for clarification this is obviated in the present instance by certification of the evidence which supports the following conclusions. Between October 7th, the date of the stop order, and October 18th, the date of the change order, the respondent's officials were in touch with the area engineer and the contracting officer, represented that there was not sufficient earth in the borrow pit opposite the sector in question but that the earth would have to be brought from other points, and that the contract price of 14.43\u00f5 would be insufficient to compensate for the additional expense involved. The Government's representatives dis- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 56, 60]\n\u00a0\n agreed with the contentions. Prior to October 18th, however, after talking with the contracting officer, respondent's officials signified that they would proceed with the work as ordered, keep a careful record of the work done and its cost, and would later insist on payment of any cost greater than that specified by the change order.\n All three judges who were in the majority below agreed, as an alternative ground of decision, that if what the contracting officer did constituted his notion of an equitable adjustment, he was wrong; and the respondent was right in its claim that the adjustment made was unfair and inequitable. To the Government's insistence that the question was one of fact and, therefore, to be settled finally by appeal to the department head, in accordance with Art. 15 of the contract, the court below replied that this court, in Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Co., \n308 \nU.S. 106\n, 60 S.Ct. 1, and Securities and Exchange Commission v. United States Realty & Improvement Co., \n310 \nU.S. 434\n, 60 S.Ct. 1044, held that what constitutes an equitable adjustment is not a question of fact but a question of law. In this view they held that Art. 15 was inapplicable; that the contracting officer having erred in his construction of the contract had thereby breached its terms, and the respondents were entitled to sue for the amount of damage incurred by that breach.\n The decisions cited are not authority for the principle that what is fair and equitable is always a question of law. Quite the contrary. In  77B of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  207, it was provided that the court should confirm a plan of reorganization if satisfied 'it is fair and equitable' and does not discriminate unfairly in favor of any class of creditors or stockholders. We held that, in this connection, the phrase 'fair and equitable' had become a term of art, that Congress used it in the sense in which it had been used by the courts in reorganization cases, and that whether a plan met the test of fairness and equity long established by judicial decision was not a question to be answered by \n\n[317 \nU.S. 56, 61]\n\u00a0\n the creditors and stockholders but by the court as a matter of law.\n An 'equitable adjustment' of the respondent's additional payment for extra work involved merely the ascertainment of the cost of digging, moving, and placing earth, and the addition to that cost of a reasonable and customary allowance for profit. These were inquiries of fact. If the contracting officer erroneously answered them, Article 15 of the contract provided the only avenue for relief.\n The judgment is reversed.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 95 Ct.

The Commission authorized the issuance of a certificate but restricted its scope in three ways: (1) It cut down the geographical area which could be served by appellee and in parts of that area limited the service to designated points. (2) It allowed appellee to haul only certain specified commodities out of a larger list previously hauled. (3) It did not permit appellee to haul all of those specified commodities between all of the points in the authorized territory but allowed it to haul only certain commodities between given points. Its finding containing those restrictions (24 M.C.C., p. 309-310) reads as follows:\n'We find that applicant's predecessor in interest was on June 1, 1935, and continuously since it and its predecessor have been, in bona fide operation as a common carrier by motor vehicle, in interstate or foreign commerce (1) of cotton yarn from all points in Gaston, Lincoln, Cleveland, Rutherford, McDowell, Burke, Catawba, Alexander, Iredell, Rowan, Davidson, and Davie Counties, N.C., to Hagerstown, Md., New York, N.Y., Pawtucket and Providence, R.I., all points in Pennsylvania on and east of U.S. Highway 11, and points in Middlesex, Union, Essex, Hud- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 475, 479]\n\u00a0\n son, Passaic, Bergen, Somerset, and Morris Counties, N.J., (2) of asbestos textile products from Charlotte, N.C., to Philadelphia and North Wales, Pa ., Trenton, Newark, Passaic, and Paterson, N.J., New York, N.Y., Middletown, Conn., Providence and Pawtucket, R.I., and Boston and Hudson, Mass., (3) of supplies and materials used in the manufacture of asbestos textile products from Harrison and Perth Amboy, N.J., to Charlotte, N.C., and empty spools and boxes in the reverse direction, (4) of petroleum products in containers from Sewaren, N.J., and Marcus Hook, Pa., to Columbia and Greenville, S.C., and to all points in North Carolina, (5) of linoleum from Paulsboro, N.J., Marcus Hook, Pa., and East Walpole, Mass., to points in North Carolina and to Spartanburg and Greenville, S.C., (6) of canned goods from Baltimore, Md., to Shelby, N.C., (7) of beer and ale from Newark, N.J., to Gastonia and Wadesboro, N.C., and (8) of roofing and screen wire from York, Pa., to all points in North Carolina, all over irregular routes; that applicant is entitled to a certificate authorizing continuation of such operation; and that the application in all other respects should be denied.'\n\n The District Court held that such restrictions were not authorized by the statute. It said:\n'It is, of course, reasonable to limit the certificate to the type of service rendered by the carrier during the grandfather period, and to limit the territory to that within which substantial service of that type has been rendered; but it is unreasonable to limit the certificate of one who has functioned as a general carrier to the specific commodities carried and the specific points served. The law cannot reasonably be construed as authorizing such limitation.' (38 F.Supp. 555.) It further noted that such restrictions have not been imposed on regular route carriers and that Congress has \n\n[315 \nU.S. 475, 480]\n\u00a0\n made no such distinction between them and irregular route carriers like appellee.\n\n I. We think the Commission was justified in the restrictions which it placed on the geographical scope of appellee's operations. Sec. 206(a) of the Act authorizes the Commission to issue a certificate without a showing of public convenience and necessity if the carrier or its predecessor in interest was 'in bona fide operation as a common carrier by motor vehicle on June 1, 1935, over the route or routes or within the territory for which application is made and has so operated since that time'. Sec. 208(a) requires that the certificate specify 'the routes over which, the fixed termini, if any, between which, and the intermediate and off-route points, if any, at which, and in case of operations not over specified routes or between fixed termini, the territory within which, the motor carrier is authorized to operate.' It is clear from these provisions that the power of the Commission to authorize future operations within a designated 'territory', rather than over specified routes or between fixed termini, fits the peculiar requirements of irregular route operators such as appellee. Authority to operate within a specified 'territory' may include permission to service all points in that area. On the other hand it may be restricted to designated points therein. Or as in the instant case, it may extend to all points in a part of that area and to selected localities in another part. The precise delineation of the area or the specification of localities which may be serviced has been entrusted by the Congress to the Commission. Alton R. Co. v. United States, \n315 \nU.S. 15\n, 62 S.Ct. 432, 86 L. Ed. --. The Act provides the test of 'bona fide operation'. That standard carries the connotation of substantiality. It also makes clear that a holding out to serve a specified area is not alone sufficient. It is 'actual rather than potential or simulated service' which is required. McDonald v. Thompson, \n305 \nU.S. 263, 266\n, 59 S.Ct. 176, 178. Substantial, as \n\n[315 \nU.S. 475, 481]\n\u00a0\n distinguished from incidental, sporadic, or infrequent, service is required. Substantial service actually rendered may have been confined to narrow limits. Loving v. United States, D.C., 32 F.Supp. 464, affirmed \n310 \nU.S. 609\n, 60 S.Ct. 898. Ability to render the service throughout the wide reaches of the territory, which the applicant professed to be willing to serve, may not have existed. Furthermore, the characteristics of the transportation service rendered are relevant to the territorial scope of the operations which the Commission may authorize. Alton R. Co. v. United States, supra. In addition, the Commission in determining the precise territory which may be served by a particular carrier cannot be unmindful of its responsibility to coordinate the various transportation agencies which constitute our national transportation system. S. Rep.No. 482, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.; H. Rep. No. 1645, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. This does not mean that the right to the statutory grant may be withheld or cut down because the Commission disapproves to the competitive conditions which may be created if the application is granted. But its responsibility to bring greater order and stability to the transportation system than had earlier obtained (S.Doc. No. 152, 73d Cong., 2d Sess.) is an additional reason for its insistence upon a showing of substantial service in that territory which is sought to be covered by a certificate under the 'grandfather clause'.\n As we indicated in Alton R. Co. v. United States, supra, the purpose of the 'grandfather clause' was to assure those to whom Congress had extended its benefits a 'substantial parity between future operations and prior bona fide operations' (\n315 \nU.S. 22\n, 62 S.Ct. 437, 86 L.Ed. --). We cannot say that that was denied in this case, if the limitations on the territorial scope of the operations are alone considered. While service to and from all points in the States included in the application was not allowed, the reduction was determined by the standard of substantiality of service. And considera- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 475, 482]\n\u00a0\n tion was given to the characteristics of irregular route carriers and their role in the national transportation system. That involved a weighing of specific evidence in light of the complexities of this transportation service. The judgment required is highly expert. Only where the error is patent may we say that the Commission transgressed. That is not this case.\n II. We have doubts, however, as to the restrictions which the Commission has placed on the articles which appellee may carry. Sec. 203(a)( 14) defined2 the term 'common carrier by motor vehicle' as one who 'undertakes ... to transport passengers or property, or any class or classes of property, for the general public in interstate or foreign commerce by motor vehicle for compensation, whether over regular or irregular routes'. The Commission ruled that since a 'common carrier' may transport only a 'class or classes of property', the authority granted under the 'grandfather clause' of  206(a) 'should reflect any limitation in the undertaking' of the common carrier 'as indicated by the service actually rendered on and since the statutory dates.' It accordingly proceeded to eliminate commodities which, though of the same general class as the others, had been carried before but not after June 1, 1935. It further restricted future operations to those commodities which prior and subsequent to June 1, 1935, had been carried in substantial amounts and with a degree of regularity. We \n\n[315 \nU.S. 475, 483]\n\u00a0\n would not disturb those conclusions if only a question as to the weight of the evidence was involved. But we are not satisfied that the Commission applied the proper criterion in reaching its conclusion that only specified commodities could be carried in the future.\n Sec. 206[a] requires a showing that the applicant or its predecessor, was 'in bona fide operation as a common carrier' on June 1, 1935, and 'since that time'. By  208(a) the certificate must specify 'the service to be rendered' by the carrier. As we have noted, a 'common carrier by motor vehicle' was defined in  203(a)(14) as one who 'undertakes' to transport 'passengers or property, or any class or classes of property, for the general public'. That definition is the same for irregular and regular route carriers. It is plain that a carrier's holding out and actual performance may be limited to a few articles only. That is to say he may be a common carrier only of a restricted number of commodities. See Galveston Truck Line Corp., 22 M.C.C. 451, 467. Or the service actually rendered may have been confined to such a few commodities that his holding out or willingness to carry a much larger class may be disregarded. Loving v. United States, supra, was such a case. On the other hand, if the applicant has carried a wide variety of general commodities, he cannot necessarily be denied the right to carry others of the same class merely because he never carried them before. And where he has carried a wide variety of general commodities, he cannot necessarily be restricted to those which he carried with more frequency and in greater quantities than the others. See H.B. Church Truck Service Co., 27 M.C.C. 191, 197; Highway Motor Freight Lines, Inc., 23 M.C.C. 621, 636. The Commission may not atomize his prior service, product by product, so as to restrict the scope of his operations, where there is substantial evidence in addition to his holding out that he \n\n[315 \nU.S. 475, 484]\n\u00a0\n was in 'bona fide operation' as a 'common carrier' of a large group of commodities or of a whole class or classes of property. There might be substantial evidence of such an undertaking though the evidence as to any one article was not substantial. The broad sweep of his prior service may indeed have made the carriage of any one commodity irregular and infrequent. Yet viewed as a whole rather than as a group of separate and unrelated items, his prior activities may satisfy the test of 'bona fide operation' as a 'common carrier' within the scope of his holding out. The fact that some of the articles may have been carried before but not after June 1, 1935, may of course indicate an abandonment of the prior undertaking. See United States v. Maher, \n307 \nU.S. 148\n, 59 S.Ct. 768. But it does not necessarily mean that they should be stricken from the certificate, since the natural and normal course of his business may reveal a continuous undertaking to transport any or all commodities embraced within the group or the class. That is to say, he may have been a common carrier of a large group of general commodities or of an entire class of property both before and after the critical date though the specific commodities carried varied considerably. The questions are whether his service within the territory in question was sufficiently regular and whether his coverage of commodities was sufficiently representative to support a finding that he was in 'bona fide operation' as a 'common carrier' of the group of commodities or of the class or classes of property during the periods in question.\n The Commission in this case authorized the carriage of about a dozen kinds of commodities though in prior operations about three times that number had been carried. It is not our function to weigh the evidence. Hence we intimate no opinion as to whether more commodities should have been included had the proper criterion been employed. But we conclude that there is no \n\n[315 \nU.S. 475, 485]\n\u00a0\n statutory warrant for applying to irregular route carriers a different or stricter test as to commodities which may be carried than is applied to regular route carriers. The difference between those types of carriers may well justify a sharp delimitation of the far flung territory which an irregular route carrier may profess to serve. But once the territory has been defined, the statutory test of whether an applicant was a 'common carrier' by motor vehicle in 'bona fide operation' during the critical periods is the same for the irregular and the regular route carrier. We are not confident that the Commission has approached the problem in that way. For it has repeatedly stated beginning with Powell Brothers Truck Lines, Inc., 9 M.C.C. 785, 791, 792, that:\n'Authority to transport general commodities throughout a wide territory over irregular and unspecified routes pursuant to the 'grandfather' clause of the act should be granted to a carrier only when such carrier's right thereto has been proved by substantial evidence. To do otherwise would create the very ills which regulation is designed to alleviate, namely, congestion of highways, destructive rate practices, and unbridled competition. Common carriers which are expected to maintain regular service for the movement of freight in whatever quantities offered to and from all points on specified routes cannot operate economically and efficiently if other carriers are permitted to invade such routes for the sole purpose of handling the cream of the traffic available thereon in so- called irregular-route service.'\n\n And see Merchants Parcel Delivery Co., Inc., 21 M.C.C. 93; Langer Transport Corp., 23 M.C.C. 302; Lett & Co. of Indiana, Inc., 26 M.C.C. 159.\n Insofar as that view establishes a different test for commodities which may be carried by irregular route operators than for commodities which may be carried by \n\n[315 \nU.S. 475, 486]\n\u00a0\n regular route operators it is erroneous as a matter of law. For facts sufficient to establish that a person is a 'common carrier' by motor vehicle in 'bona fide operation' in the one case are sufficient in the other. The statutory differences lie only in the territorial scope and pattern of the operation.\n III. It follows from what has been said that a restriction on commodities which may be carried between specified points may not always be justified. If the applicant had established that it was a 'common carrier' for a group of commodities or for an entire class or classes of property and was in 'bona fide operation' during the critical periods in a specified territory, restrictions on commodities which could be moved in any one direction or between designated points would not be justified. The fact that a particular commodity had never been transported between certain points in that territory would not mean that authority to haul it between them should be withheld. Likewise, if the applicant could establish that it was a 'common carrier' only of a limited number of commodities, there would normally be no statutory sanction for limiting the carriage of particular commodities in that group to specified points in the authorized area. Presumptively one who had established his status of 'common carrier' would be entitled to carry all of the commodities embraced in his undertaking to all points to which any shipments of any articles were authorized. On the other hand, an applicant's status may vary from one part of the territory to another or be different in northbound shipments than in sothbound shipments. Thus in this case the Commission found that practically all of appellee's northbound shipments consisted of cotton yarn, though a few shipments of other commodities such as tires and tubes, asbestos textile products, spools and empty boxes were also made northbound. With the exception of tires and tubes, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 475, 487]\n\u00a0\n the Commission authorized the shipments of those products on northbound trips. Assuming that finding to be justified under the tests which we have described, it does not necessarily follow that the northbound destinations of those particular commodities should be restricted to the localities designated by the Commission. Once the common carrier status of appellee had been established as respects those commodities, shipments to any parts of the authorized territory, or to any of the authorized points therein, should have been permitted, in absence of evidence that the appellee as respects carriage between specified points had restricted its undertaking to particular commodities. That problem is clearer in this case as respects southbound shipments. The record is plain that appellee held itself out as being willing and able to carry a wide variety of commodities on its return trips to its home base in North Carolina. And the record shows that it carried many different kinds of articles on those southbound journeys. But the Commission drastically limited its rights in that regard. Thus it was permitted to carry beer from Newark, N.J. to two points in North Carolina but not from Baltimore, Md. In absence of evidence that it had thus limited its undertaking as respects beer, the mere fact that it previously had not carried beer from Baltimore would be immaterial. If it had established by substantial evidence that it was a 'common carrier' of beer on southbound trips, it would be entitled to carry it from any of the northern points to any of the southern destinations. For there was no evidence in this case that it had restricted its undertaking as respects beer to shipments from Newark, unless the fact that it had carried beer only from that point is to be conclusive. But to say that that was conclusive or controlling would be to disregard the natural and normal course of business shown by this record. So far as southbound shipments are con- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 475, 488]\n\u00a0\n cerned, it is plain that a wide variety of articles was transported consistently with appellee's holding out that it would carry any of the articles from any of the points. Appellee's 'bona fide operation' may possibly be limited only to those articles actually carried. But where it was actively soliciting whatever it could get at any of the points, it does violence to its common carrier status to make the origin or destination of future shipments conform to the precise pattern of the old. Such a pulverization of the prior course of conduct changes its basic characteristics. There is no statutory sanction for such a procedure.\n IV. To appellee such matters involve life or death. Empty or partially loaded trucks on return trips may well drive the enterprise to the wall. A restriction in this case of the commodities which may be carried from any one point on southbound trips is a patent denial to appellee of that 'substantial parity between future operations and prior bona fide operations' which the Act contemplates. Alton R. Co. v. United States, supra. Its prior opportunity should not be restricted beyond the clear requirements of the statute. For this Act should be liberally construed to preserve the position which those like appellee have struggled to obtain in our national transportation system. To freeze them into the precise pattern of their prior activities as was done here not only may alter materially the basic characteristics of their service; it also may well be tantamount to a denial of their statutory rights.\n The precise grounds for the Commission's determination that only certain commodities could be carried and that only a few could be transported between designated points are not clear. It is impossible to say that the standards which we have set forth were applied to the facts in this record. Hence, as in Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194, 215\n, 51 S.Ct. 119, 125, the defect is not merely one of the absence of a 'suitably complete statement' of the reasons for the deci- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 475, 489]\n\u00a0\n sion; it is the 'lack of the basic or essential findings required to support the Commission's order.' And see United States v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., \n293 \nU.S. 454, 464\n, 55 S.Ct. 268, 272; United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P.R. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 499, 510\n, 511 S., 55 S.Ct. 462, 467. Congress has made a grant of rights to carriers such as appellee. Congress has prescribed statutory standards pursuant to which those rights are to be determined. Neither the Court nor the Commission is warranted in departing from those standards because of any doubts which may exist as to the wisdom of following the course which Congress has chosen. Congress has also provided for judicial review as an additional assurance that its policies be executed. That review certainly entails an inquiry as to whether the Commission has employed those statutory standards. If that inquiry is halted at the threshold by reason of the fact that it is impossible to say whether or not those standards have been applied, then that review has indeed become a perfunctory process. If, as seems likely here, an erroneous statutory construction lies hidden in vague findings, then statutory rights will be whittled away. An insistence upon the findings which Congress has made basic and essential to the Commission's action is no intrusion into the administrative domain. It is no more and no less than an insistence upon the observance of those standards which Congress has made 'prerequisite to the operation of its statutory command.' Opp Cotton Mills, Inc., v. Administrator, \n312 \nU.S. 126, 144\n, 657 S., 61 S.Ct. 524, 532. Hence that requirement is not a mere formal one. Only when the statutory standards have been applied can the question be reached as to whether the findings are supported by evidence. That is why we cannot say that the Commission would be justified in placing the same restrictions on the certificate in this case had a correct construction of the Act been taken.\n We express no opinion on the scope of the certificate which should be granted in this case. That entails not \n\n[315 \nU.S. 475, 490]\n\u00a0\n only a weighing of evidence but the exercise of an expert judgment on the intricacies of the transportation problems which are involved. That function is reserved exclusively for the Commission. United States v. Maher, supra; Alton R. Co. v. United States, supra. Our task ends if the statutory standards have been properly applied.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON, dissenting.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER and I are unable to agree with this disposition of the case.\n It overturns the exercise of a discretion which Congress has delegated to the Interstate Commerce Commission upon grounds which seem to us so unsubstantial as really to be a reversal on suspicion. The function of determining 'grandfather' rights delegated in this case is not unlike the function dealt with in Gray v. Powell, \n314 \nU.S. 402\n, 62 S.Ct. 326, 332, 86 L.Ed. --, in which we said that Congress could have legislated specifically as to individual exemptions but 'found it more efficient to delegate that function to those whose experience in a particular field gave promise of a better informed, more equitable adjustment of the conflicting interests.' We held that this delegation will be respected and that unless we can say that a set of circumstances deemed by the Commission to bring a particular applicant within the concept of the statute 'is so unrelated to the tasks entrusted by Congress to the Commission as in effect to deny a sensible exercise of judgment, it is the Court's duty to leave the Commission's judgment undisturbed.' While the Court pays lip service to this principle the Commission's decision is upset because, as the opinion states, 'We have doubts'; 'We are not confident'; and 'We are not satisfied.' The opinion proceeds as it might do with a burden upon the Commission, although we supposed the burden to be upon those who \n\n[315 \nU.S. 475, 491]\n\u00a0\n complain of an administrative decision to satisfy the Court that the decision is wrong-particularly one dealing with an exemption from a general duty.\n We do not agree that a remand to the Commission to make specific findings of the kind required in Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194, 215\n, 51 S.Ct. 119, 125, is appropriate. In the Florida case, the Commission undertook to revise intrastate railroad rates under control of the state and over which, as Chief Justice Hughes said, 'the Commission has no general authority.' 282 U.S. at page 212, 51 S.Ct. at page 124. It was required to support its jurisdiction to revise rates not within its general control by specific findings as to whether those rates in any way constituted a burden on interstate commerce. The Court had earlier established the rule that an order of the Commission should not be given precedence over a state rate statute otherwise valid 'unless, and except so far as, it conforms to a high standard of certainty.' Illinois Central R. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n245 \nU.S. 493, 510\n, 38 S.Ct. 170, 176. And in this connection the Court pointed out that even an act of Congress is not to be construed to supersede or suspend the exercise of the reserved powers of the state, even where the Constitution permits, 'except so far as, its purpose to do so is clearly manifested.' It is one thing to require the Interstate Commerce Commission to be explicit in finding jurisdictional facts before it invades conceded state power. It is a wholly different thing to read with a hostile eye the Commission's findings that a claim for exemption from conceded federal regulatory authority has not been sustained.\n Furthermore, if after this case is returned to the Commission, the Commission should leave no room for doubt that in making the challenged order it acted upon correct notions of law, it may yet be upset because the Court says its findings are not sustained by the evidence, it \n\n[315 \nU.S. 475, 492]\n\u00a0\n had better be said now. We have here a small record and simple facts which are all before us, giving adequate basis for concluding whether these facts as found by the Commission warranted the order. On this record it is plain what the Commission has done. The only question is-Can it do what it has done? To send the case back to the Commission to be reconsidered or to say that it has already been considered in the light of the legal views which the Court expresses, and then, perhaps, to say that in any event the order is not warranted on the record before us, is really to invite the Commission to express abstract views on law. What this amounts to is that the Court refuses to tell the Commission what it thinks about the evidence until the Commission tells what it thinks about the law. We cannot regard this as the most helpful use of the power of judicial review.\n Congress by the Motor Carrier Act of 1935 cast upon the Commission the task of regulating the motor carrier industry. By the enactment, Congress asserted that the public interest in the motor carrier enterprise had become paramount to private interests. The highly individualistic nature of the business and the easy terms upon which equipment could be obtained had promoted a quick growth accompanied by intense and uneconomic competition, both within itself and with other transportation systems. It was not expected that a sprawling, chaotic, and cutthroat industry that had developed entirely in the private interest would be reduced to an orderly and regularized system of transportation in the public interest without stepping on a good many individual toes. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[315 \nU.S. 475, 493]\n\u00a0\n In trying to limit the injury caused by transition from a purely private enterprise to a regulated public service industry, the general plan was to preserve to private owners the transportation values evidenced by actual conditions of operation on June 1, 1935, and to exempt them from meeting the requirements of 'public convenience and necessity' as to such operation. Those who obtained such 'grandfather' rights are not, however, limited to them. They may expand their territory or extend their service by proving that public convenience and necessity will be served thereby. Thus, the scramble for 'grandfather' rights represents the effort to pre- empt territory and service privileges without submitting to the test of the public interest. Public regulation would be defeated at its very outset if the Commission permitted the bulk of the industry to escape the public interest test by inflated claims under the 'grandfather' clause. The nature of the general task of reducing the claims of 'grandfather' rights to defined and reasonable limits consistent with the plan of public regulation is disclosed by the record in this case.\n The motor carrier here asked as a matter of right that the Commission certify its 'grandfather' privileges to include the carriage of general commodities in a territory comprising substantially the Atlantic seaboard from South Carolina to Massachusetts. That there was some disparity between its hopes and its experience was indicated by the fact that on June 1, 1935, it was operating eitht trucks, and by 1936, the number of usable vehicles had fallen to four. After a change of ownership the number was increased and at the time of hearing the applicant was operating seventeen carrying units.\n This carrier did not operate at stated times or over regular routes, but was an irregular route carrier. The backbone of its business consisted of carriage of cotton \n\n[315 \nU.S. 475, 494]\n\u00a0\n yarn from points of origin in the South to points of distribution in the North. Incidental to this carriage it was ready to accept cargo of almost any kind to complete its loads and particularly to provide earnings on return trips. If satisfactory terms could be arrived at, it was willing to carry almost anything almost any place. On the basis of such general holdings out this carrier sought certificates that would entitle it as a matter of right to carry nearly everything within the territory described.\n The Commission cut down the claims of the applicant by the use of the standard which the Act prescribes: namely, bona fide operation as a common carrier by motor vehicle. The Commission reduced the territorial claim to that which the carrier actually served with some regularity and lopped off territory which had been served only occasionally or by isolated trips. It limited the commodities to be carried to those carried in substantial volume during the period before and after June 1, 1935. We find no basis upon which we can say as matter of law that these general methods of reducing nebulous and extravagant claims to a compass which the Commission could properly certify as representing bona fide operation are improper or other than those contemplated by the statute.\n The Court is 'not confident' that the Commission applied to this irregular route carrier the same test as to commodities that is applied to regular route carriers. We cannot be so confidently unconfident. The Commission seems to have made only the distinction between irregular and the regular route carriers that results from the differences inherent in the two types of enterprise. The Commission has tested both by the regularity and substantiality of their actual operations. It is a test with which they may have unequal ability to comply, but to reach different results on such different facts does not imply \n\n[315 \nU.S. 475, 495]\n\u00a0\n either the use of different legal standards or discriminatory administration.\n The administrators of the Motor Carrier Act must be aware, as the framers of it were, that 'the grandfather clause as of June 1, 1935 has been fixed in fairness to bona fide motor carriers now operating on the highway and limited so as to prevent speculation which is highly important.' Report of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, H.R.Rep. No. 1645, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 4. When a carrier claims grandfather rights to serve the entire Atlantic seaboard as a general common carrier with equipment consisting on the critical date, of eight trucks, the Commission is obviously forewarned that it must guard against granting franchise privileges that will result in their having a speculative value to the carrier rather than a service value to the public. The Commission was quite right to take the measure of the territory and service of such a claimant and to give him a certificate covering his actual substantial operations. We should not substitute our own wisdom or unwisdom for that of administrative officers who have kept within the bounds of their administrative powers. American T. & T. Co. v.

We granted certiorari. \n314 \nU.S. 605\n, 62 S.Ct. 365, 86 L.Ed. --.\n The insurance contract provided for the payment of 240 monthly installments of $57.50 each. It is not disputed that Eugene Kerr, as beneficiary, was entitled to receive the 56 monthly installments that accrued during his lifetime. \n1\n They aggregated $3220.00. The portion of the District Court's judgment which awarded that sum to Eugene Kerr's estate is not in controversy.\n The issue here involves only the amount due the estate of Joseph Kelly Kerr, the insured, on the 184 installments remaining after the death of the beneficiary. The government contends that the amount due the estate is $8234, which represents the present value of the 184 installments computed as of the death of the beneficiary on June 24, 1924. Respondent argues that the amount due is $10,580, which is the aggregate of 184 installments of $57.50 each. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Prior to 1924 the statutes of the United States directed that when the estate of an insured became eligible to pro- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 209, 212]\n\u00a0\n ceeds under the contract,3 they should be paid in regular monthly installments. The most recent enactment prior to that year was the Act of August 9, 1921, which provided: 'If no person within the permitted class of beneficiaries survive the insured, then there shall be paid to the estate of the insured the monthly installments payable and applicable under the provisions of Article IV of the War Risk Insurance Act (Act of October 6, 1917, c. 105, 40 Stat. 398, 409) ....'4\n The World War Veterans' Act of 19245 superseded the War Risk Insurance Act of 1917 and its amendments. It provided, in  303: 'If no person within the permitted class of beneficiaries survive the insured, or if before the completion of payments the beneficiary or beneficiaries shall die and there be no surviving person within said permitted class then there shall be paid to the estate of the insured, the present value of the monthly installments thereafter payable under the provisions of this title ....' This section altered the method of payment only with respect to benefits payable to the estates of insured. It did not change the method of payment to beneficiaries. Its obvious purpose was to have the obligation to the estate paid in one lump sum rather than in monthly installments. Since these installments included interest as well as principal, Congress desired to eliminate the interest when it provided for the lump sum payment. Accordingly it declared that the lump sum should be equal to 'the pres- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 209, 213]\n\u00a0\n ent value of the monthly installments thereafter payable'. The word 'thereafter' plainly relates to the death of the beneficiary, in a case like the one before us. And this has been the interpretation placed upon the section by the Veterans Administration ever since, the requirement being that the present value is to be computed as of the date of the death of the beneficiary.\n In 1925  303 was amended in several respects. \n6\n The only one of these which is important here is the addition of the following words: 'said value to be computed as of the date of last payment made under any existing award.' And this is important only because of the confusion which it has generated in the disposition of this case. According to a letter addressed to the Solicitor General by the Administrator of the Veterans Administration on July 14, 1941 (R. 41), the language quoted was added to  303 to correct a specific inequity which had arisen in a number of cases following the 1924 Act but which is not encountered here. That inequity arose in this way: In several cases the estate of the insured had become entitled to the proceeds of the policy prior to 1924 and a number of the $ 57.50 monthly installments had already been paid to the estate of the insured at the time Congress enacted  303 with its provision for a lump sum payment to the estate. Since  303 was made retroactive to October 6, 1917, the amount due the estate in these cases, as in the others, was held to be the present value of the installments remaining due after the death of the beneficiary, computed as of the date of death of the beneficiary. But in these cases, unlike the others, that portion of the installments already paid to the estate which represented interest had to be deducted from the lump sum award. To avoid this partial withdrawal of funds which had actually been released in these particular cases Congress provided in the 1925 amendment that the 'present value \n\n[316 \nU.S. 209, 214]\n\u00a0\n of the monthly installments thereafter payable' should be computed 'as of date of last payment made under any existing award.' Under this formula the installments which had been paid to the estate of an insured prior to 1924 were not disturbed. The Veterans Administration has consistently treated the 1925 amendment as applicable only to this limited number of cases. In the others, it has invariably computed the 'present value' as of the date of death of the beneficiary. This administrative interpretation over a period of 17 years controlling the settlement of thousands of cases is entitled to great weight, 'and such construction is not to be overturned unless clearly wrong or unless a different construction is plainly required.' United States v. Jackson, \n280 \nU.S. 183, 193\n, 50 S.Ct. 143.\n In this case no award had been made prior to 1924 and hence the amount due to the insured's estate could not be computed 'as of date of last payment made under any existing award.' This language of the 1925 amendment therefore cannot be applied to the facts here. But it does not follow that the balance of  303 does not apply. Indeed,  303 is the only present authority for the making of any payments to the estate of the insured. \n7\n Disregarding the words added by the 1925 amendment, the section simply requires the payment to the estate of a lump sum equal to 'the present value of the monthly installments thereafter payable.' And the latter language, as we have said, has been consistently interpreted to mean 'present value' as of the date of death of the beneficiary.\n The Court of Appeals was of the opinion that because recognition of the claim had been delayed until after the passage of the 240 months, the principles of computation \n\n[316 \nU.S. 209, 215]\n\u00a0\n embodied in the 1924 Act and the 1925 amendment required a settlement as if there had been an award of monthly installments. That is, it took the view that the 184 monthly installments concededly due to the estate should be multiplied by $57.50, which represents a payment of interest as well as principal, and the resulting total of $10,580 awarded to respondent. But one of the purposes of the 1924 and 1925 enactments was to abolish the monthly installment method of settling the claims of veterans' estates. Congress could not have made clearer its intention that the value of the remaining installments, purged of interest, should be paid in a lump sum to the estate. Both the Veterans Administration and this Court have recognized a legislative policy against the allowance of interest on past due payments on these policies. United States v. Worley, \n281 \nU.S. 339\n, 50 S.Ct. 291. The error which undermines respondent's contention and the decision of the Court of Appeals is the failure to give full effect to this Congressional purpose to eliminate interest from the lump sum settlement.\n The Court of Appeals was evidently impressed by the delay in the settlement of respondent's claim. We share that concern. The insured died almost 23 years ago and final disposition of the case is only now in view. But responsibility for the delay is not easily apportioned. \n8\n And in any event it could not influence our construction of the language of the statute. Congress has authorized neither the payment of damages for the delay nor an award of interest on past due obligations incurred under these insurance certificates, and it is not within our power to do so.\n The case is remanded for reinstatement of the judgment of the District Court.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] I.e. from Nov. 8, 1919, the date of the death of the insured, through June 8, 1924, the last due date for a monthly installment prior to the beneficiary's death. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] It is agreed that however this issue is resolved, respondent's recovery is subject to a deduction of $6.50, the amount of a premium due on the policy for November 1919, the month during which the insured died. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The claim to the proceeds might fall to the estate in several ways, such as by the death of the named beneficiary or by the death of an insured who has designated no beneficiary.

Edrington, of Washington, D.C., for respondents. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 23, 24]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BYRNES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By Act of February 14, 1931,1 making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, Congress authorized the construction of a library building at Howard University in the District of Columbia. The cost was not to exceed $800,000, of which sum $400,000 was made immediately available. Only a small part of this money had been used for architects' fees when the President, shortly after his inauguration in 1933, ordered impounded these and all other funds appropriated for construction.\n Title II of the National Industrial Recovery Act of June 16, 1933,2 created a Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works, with all of its powers vested in an Administrator. By  202 the Administrator was directed to 'prepare a comprehensive program of public works, which shall include among other things the following: ... (c) any projects of the character heretofore constructed or carried on either directly by public authority or with public aid to serve the interests of the general public ; ....' And  203 provided that 'with a view to increasing employment quickly ... the President is authorized and empowered, through Administrator or through such other agencies as he may designate or create , (1) to construct, finance, or aid in the construction or financing of any public-works project included in the program prepared pursuant to  202; ....'\n On August 24, 1935, Congress passed the Miller Act. \n3\n By the terms of this statute, 'before any contract, ex- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 23, 25]\n\u00a0\n ceeding $2,000 in amount, for the construction, alteration, or repair of any public building or public work of the United States is awarded to any person, such person shall furnish to the United States ... a payment bond with a surety or sureties satisfactory to such officer for the protection of all persons supplying labor and material in the prosecution of the work provided for in said contract for the use of each such person.' The Act also permitted persons who supplied materials and labor to bring suit on the bond in the name of the United States. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 23, 26]\n\u00a0\n These are the statutes applicable to this dispute.\n After the passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act, the Secretary of the Interior (who had been named Administrator pursuant to Title II) approved the library building at Howard University as a part of the public works program and allotted $1,120,811.58 for its construction. On December 5, 1936 the Assistant Secretary of the Interior, on behalf of the United States, entered \n\n[316 \nU.S. 23, 27]\n\u00a0\n into a contract with respondent, Irwin & Leighton, for the construction of the library building. As a condition of the contract, Irwin & Leighton was required to furnish a bond to secure the laborers and material men, under provisions of the Miller Act. \n4\n Accordingly, it posted such a bond in the amount of $408,618, with respondent United States Guarantee Company as surety.\n Petitioner furnished to a sub-contractor materials worth $23,649.35. Of this sum it was paid $11,146.80, leaving due $12,502.55 with interest. When payment of this amount was refused, petitioner brought this suit on the bond in the name of the United States. Respondents moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the construction of the library building at Howard University was not a 'public work', within the meaning of the Miller Act. The District Court overruled the motion to dismiss. The Court of Appeals allowed a special appeal and reversed, on the authority of its own earlier decision in Maiatico Construction Co. v. United States, 65 App. D.C. 62, 79 F.2d 418. The case is here on certiorari.\n The question before us therefore is whether the construction of the library was a 'public work' as that term is used in the Miller Act. We think that it is, that the Assistant Secretary of the Interior was consequently authorized to require respondents to post a bond securing materialmen, and that petitioner is entitled to sue on the bond in the name of the United States. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 23, 28]\n\u00a0\n No aid in ascertaining the meaning of 'public works' is to be found in the Miller Act itself. But in the National Industrial Recovery Act, passed two years before the Miller Act, Congress defined it as including 'any projects of the character heretofore constructed or carried on either directly by public authority or with public aid to serve the interests of the general public.' The library at Howard University was not only a project 'of the character heretofore constructed or carried on ... with public aid'; it had been directly and specifically authorized by Congress in 1931 and money had actually been appropriated for it. And it requires no discussion that Howard University, established by the authority of Congress 'for the education of youth in the liberal arts and sciences,'5 serves 'the interests of the general public.'\n In Maiatico Construction Co. v. United States, supra, upon which the Court of Appeals principally relied in reaching an opposite conclusion, the same court had construed a different statute, the Heard Act of August 13, 1894.6 That Act required that 'any person or persons entering into a formal contract with the United States for the construction of any public building, or the prosecution and completion of any public work, or for repairs upon any public building or public work, shall be required' to post a bond for the security of both the United States and the suppliers of labor and materials. It permitted the laborers and material men to enforce their claims by intervening in any suit by the United States on the bond. The plaintiffs in the Maiatico case supplied labor and materials in the construction of three dormitory buildings at Howard University, the contract for which had been let to the defendant construction company by the United States in Novem- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 23, 29]\n\u00a0\n ber, 1930. The Court of Appeals decided that the plaintiffs could not recover on the defendant's bond because the dormitories were not 'public buildings' and their construction was not a 'public work.' It based this conclusion on the theory that 'public buildings' or 'public works', within the meaning of the Heard Act, included only buildings which belonged to the United States. Since Howard University is a private institution and since it held title to the dormitories, recovery on the bond was denied to the suppliers of materials and labor. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Whatever may have been the validity of this narrow formula when applied to the Heard Act, we cannot approve its application to this suit under the Miller Act. In the first place, the whole concept of 'public works' has been considerably altered since the enactment of the Heard Act in 1894 and particularly within the last dozen years, and the question of title to the buildings or improvements or to the land on which they are situated is no longer of primary significance. \n8\n But we are not left to such vague guidance. Two and a half years after the execution of the contract involved in the Maiatico case, Congress, in the National Industrial Recovery Act, specifically defined 'public works' as including 'any projects of the character heretofore cnstructed or carried on either directly by public authority or with public aid to serve the interests of the general public.' The Miller Act was passed two years later for the purpose of enlarging the protection which the Heard Act had afforded to laborers and materialmen by facilitating the procedure for enforcing their claims against the contractor. During the hearings on the several bills from which the Miller Act evolved, Congressman Duffy, \n\n[316 \nU.S. 23, 30]\n\u00a0\n ofOhio, the author of one of the bills and a member of the sub-committee that drafted the Act, declared without dissent by any Representative: 'If this bill were passed by this Congress it would certainly be applicable to the public works program and that is the reason for its importance.' \n9\n\u00a0\n\n We have no doubt that the Miller Act was intended to apply to the 'public works' authorized by the Administrator under the National Industrial Recovery Act. The National Industrial Recovery Act did not leave to speculation the nature of the 'public works' that Congress envisaged. Its language was not technical but plain and specific. Expressly included were 'projects of the character heretofore constructed or carried on ... with public aid to serve the interests of the general public.' Beyond question the library at Howard University was such a project.\n The respondents evidently had no difficulty interpreting the language of the Recovery Act or the Miller Act until they were called upon to meet the claims of petitioner. The record does not reveal that Irwin & Leighton objected to posting the bond when the contract was executed. It paid a premium of $8,172.25 for the bond and the surety company accepted it without question. Presumably, these are the circumstances which caused the Court of Appeals, 122 F.2d 73, 78, to remark upon 'the strong equities' of petitioner's case.\n We hold that the Administrator had the authority to require the bond and that petitioner was entitled to bring this action on it. Holding this view, we find it unnecessary to consider the other questions raised by petitioner.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 46 Stat. 1115, 1160. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 48 Stat. 195, 201. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 49 Stat. 793, U.S.C., Title 40,  270a-270d, 40 U.S.C.A.  270a- 270d:\n'Sec. 1 ( 270a).

In their cross-petition the defendants seek dismissal of the indictment. We do not regard this as a correct disposition of the case. Since the correctness of the views concerning the meaning of the statute on which the trial court submitted the case to the jury goes to the root of the convictions and their reversal by the Circuit Court of Appeals, we shall confine our consideration of these cases to that issue. Consequently, we are concerned only with whether the defendants were tried in a manner consistent with the proper meaning and scope of the pertinent provisions of  2 of the Act, which provide:\n'Any person who, in connection with or in relation to any act in any way or in any degree affecting trade or commerce or any article or commodity moving or about to move in trade or commerce-\n\n'(a) Obtains or attempts to obtain, by the use of or attempt to use or threat to use force, violence, or coercion, the payment of money or other valuable considerations, or the purchase or rental of property or protective services, not including, however, the payment of wages by a bonafide employer to a bona-fide employee; or\n\n'(b) Obtains the property of another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of force or fear, or under color of official right; or '(c) Commits or threatens to commit an act of physical violence or physical injury to a person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to violate (sub) sections (a) or (b);'\n\n The proof at the trial showed that the defendant Local 807 includes in its membership nearly all the motor truck drivers and helpers in the city of New York, and that during the period covered by the indictment defendants Campbell and Furey held office in the Local as delegates in charge of the west side of Manhattan and the other de- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 521, 526]\n\u00a0\n fendants were members. Large quantities of the merchandise which goes into the city from neighboring states is transported in 'over-the-road' trucks which are usually manned by drivers and helpers who reside in the localities from which the shipments are made and who are consequently not members of Local 807. Prior to the events covered by this indictment, it appears to have been customary for these out-of-state drivers to make deliveries to the warehouses of consignees in New York and then to pick up other merchandise from New York shippers for delivery on the return trip to consignees in the surrounding states.\n There was sufficient evidence to warrant a finding that the defendants conspired to use and did use violence and threats to obtain from the owners of these 'over-the-road' trucks $9.42 for each large truck and $8.41 for each small truck entering the city. These amounts were the regular union rates for a day's work of driving and unloading. There was proof that in some cases the out-of-state driver was compelled to drive the truck to a point close to the city limits and there to turn it over to one or more of the defendants. These defendants would then drive the truck to its destination, do the unloading, pick up the merchandise for the return trip and surrender the truck to the out-of-state driver at the point where they had taken it over. In other cases, according to the testimony, the money was demanded and obtained, but the owners or drivers rejected the offers of the defendants to do or help with the driving or unloading. And in several cases the jury could have found that the defendants either failed to offer to work, or refused to work for the money when asked to do so. Eventually many of the owners signed contracts with Local 807 under whose terms the defendants were to do the driving and unloading within the city and to receive regular union rates for the work. No serious question is raised by the evidence \n\n[315 \nU.S. 521, 527]\n\u00a0\n as to the ability of the defendants to perform the labor involved in these operations.\n The first count of the indictment was based upon  2(a) of the Act and charged a conspiracy 'to obtain the payment of money ... (from the owners) by the use of, attempt to use and threat to use, force, violence and coercion.' The second count accused the defendants of conspiring to obtain the property of the owners 'with their consent induced by wrongful use of force and of fear,' in violation of  2(b). The third and fourth counts alleged a conspiracy to violate  2(c) in that the defendants agreed 'to commit and threatened to commit acts of physical violence and of physical injury to the persons and property' of their victims in furtherance of the general scheme to violate  2(a) and 2(b). Local 807 and all of the individual defendants were convicted on the first count; the Local and 17 individuals on the second; and the Local and 11 individuals on the third and fourth.\n The question in the case concerns that portion of  2(a) which excepts from punishment any person who 'obtains or attempts to obtain, by the use of or attempt to use or threat to use force, violence, or coercion ... the payment of wages by a bona-fide employer to a bona-fide employee.' \n2\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed because it believed that the trial court had failed to instruct the jury properly with respect to this exception.\n To ascertain the limits of the exception is a difficult undertaking. Always assuming the presence of violence and threats, as we must in the face of this record, three interpretations of varying restrictive force require consideration: (1) The exception applies only to a defendant \n\n[315 \nU.S. 521, 528]\n\u00a0\n who has enjoyed the status of a bona fide employee prior to the time at which he obtains or attempts to obtain the payment of money by the owner. ( 2) Assuming that this is incorrect and that the exception may affect a defendant who has not been a bona fide employee prior to the time in question, it does not apply if the owner's intention in making the payment is to buy 'protection' and not to buy service, even though the defendant may intend to perform the service or may actually perform it. We understand this to be the position adopted by the government in its brief and argument in this Court. (3) Assuming that both (1) and (2) are incorrect, the exception is not applicable to a defendant who obtains the payment of money if the owner rejects his genuine offer of service. We understand this to be the theory of the dissenting judge below.\n Confronted with these various interpretations we turn for guidance to the legislative history of the statute. Pursuant to a Senate Resolution of May 8, 1933,3 a sub-committee of the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce which became known as the Copeland Committee, undertook an investigation of 'rackets' and 'racketeering' in the United States. After conducting hearings in several large cities, the committee introduced 13 bills, of which S. 2248 was one. \n4\n As introduced, as reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee,5 and as passed without debate by the Senate,6 S. 2248 embodied very general prohibi- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 521, 529]\n\u00a0\n tions against violence or coercion in connection with interstate commerce and contained no specific mention of wages or labor. After the bill had passed the Senate, however, representatives of the American Federation of Labor expressed fear that the bill in its then form might result in serious injury to labor,7 and the measure was redrafted by officials of the Department of Justice after conferences with the President of the Federation. In the course of this revision, the bill assumed substantially the form in which it was eventually enacted. In particular, the exception concerning 'the payment of wages by a bona fide employer to a bona fide employee' was added, and a proviso preserving 'the rights of bona fide labor organizations' was incorporated in what became  6 of the Act as finally passed. \n8\n In its favorable reports on this revised bill,9 the House Committee on the Judiciary set forth without comment a letter from the Attorney General to the Committee, dated May 18, 1934. In this letter the Attorney General informed the Committee that the draft of the substitute bill had been 'definitely approved' by the President of the American Federation of Labor and his counsel. The letter continued:\n'We believe that the bill in this form will accomplish the purposes of such legislation and at the same time meet the objections made to the original bill.\n\n'The original bill was susceptible to the objection that it might include within the prohibition the legitimate and bona fide activities of employers and employees. As the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 521, 530]\n\u00a0\n purpose of the legislation is not to interfere with such legitimate activities but rather to set up severe penalties for racketeering by violence, extortion, or coercion, which affects interstate commerce, it seems advisable to definitely exclude such legitimate activities.\n\n'As the typical racketeering activities affecting interstate commerce are those in connection with price fixing and economic extortion directed by professional gangsters, we have inserted subparagraphs (a) and (b), making such activities unlawful when accompanied by violence and affecting interstate commerce.'\n\n The substitute was agreed to by both the House and Senate without debate when assurances were given that the approval of organized labor had been obtained. 10 Thereafter, while the bill awaited the signature of the President, Senator Copeland submitted a report11 in which he referred to S. 2248 as one of eleven bills which had been enacted 'to close gaps in existing Federal laws and to render more difficult the activities of predatory criminal gangs of the Kelly and Dillinger types.'\n This account of the legislative proceedings obviously does not provide specific definition of 'wages', 'bona-fide employer', or 'bona- fide employee', as those terms are used in  2(a). But it does contain clear declarations by the head of the Department which drafted the section and by the sponsor of the bill in Congress, first, that the elimination of terroristic activities by professional gangsters was the aim of the statute, and second, that no interference with traditional labor union activities was intended.\n It may be true that professional rackets have sometimes assumed the guise of labor unions, and, as the Circuit Court of Appeals observed, that they may have \n\n[315 \nU.S. 521, 531]\n\u00a0\n 'covered their practices by the pretence that the tribute collected was pay for services rendered.' 118 F.2d 684, 688. And it may also be true that labor organizations of good repute and honest purpose can be misdirected and become agencies of blackmail. Nevertheless, Congress plainly attempted to distinguish militant labor activity from the other and to afford it ample protection. With this legislative purpose uppermost in mind, we return to test the three theories of interpretation of  2(a) to which we have referred.\n\n\n (1)\n We hold that the exemption is not restricted to a defendant who has attained the status of an employee prior to the time at which he obtains or attempts or conspires to obtain the money. In the first place, we agree with the observation of the Court below that 'practically always the crux of a labor dispute is who shall get the job and what the terms shall be ....' To exclude this entire class of disputes from the protection of the exception would be unjustifiably to thwart the purpose of Congress as we understand it. In the second place, the structure and language of  2(a) itself is persuasive against so narrow an interpretation. It does not except 'a bona fide employee who obtains or attempts to obtain the payment of wages from a bona fide employer.' Rather, it excepts 'any person who ... obtains or attempts to obtain ... the payment of wages from a bona fide employer to a bona fide employee.' Certainly, an outsider who 'attempts' unsuccessfully by violent means to achieve the status of an employee and to secure wages for services falls within the exception. And where, as here, the offense charged is conspiracy to violate the section, the defendants are entitled to immunity if their objective is to become bona fide employees and to obtain wages in that capacity, even though they may fail of their purpose.\n\n\n (2)\n The government contends, as we have said, that the test is 'whether, under all the circumstances, it ap- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 521, 532]\n\u00a0\n pears that the money has been paid for labor or for protection.' If the defendants do not offer to work, or if they refuse to work, or if their offer to work is rejected by the owners, the government argues that any payment made to them must be for protection rather than for services. And even if the defendants actually perform some work, it is said, this circumstance should be regarded as relevant but not controlling in determining 'the one crucial issue in every case such as this-namely, whether the money was paid for labor or for protection.'\n We take this to mean that the intent of the owners in making the payment is to be regarded as controlling. We cannot agree. The state of mind of the truck owners cannot be decisive of the guilt of these defendants. On the contrary, their guilt is determined by whether or not their purpose and objective was to obtain 'the payment of wages by a bona- fide employer to a bona-fide employee'. And, of course, where the defendants are charged with conspiracy as they were here, it is particularly obvious that the nature of their plan and agreement is the crux of the case. The mischief of a contrary theory is nowhere better illustrated than in industrial controversies. For example, the members of a labor union may decide that they are entitled to the jobs in their trade in a particular area. They may agree to attempt to obtain contracts to do the work at the union wage scale. They may obtain the contracts, do the work, and receive the money. Certainly Congress intended that these activities should be excepted from the prohibitions of this particular Act, even though the agreement may have contemplated the use of violence. But it is always an open question whether the employers' capitulation to the demands of the union is prompted by a desire to obtain services or to avoid further injury or both. To make a fine or prison sentence for the union and its members contingent upon a finding by the jury \n\n[315 \nU.S. 521, 533]\n\u00a0\n that one motive or the other dominated the employers' decision would be a distortion of the legislative purpose.\n We are told, however, that under this view such a common law offense as robbery would become an innocent pastime, inasmuch as it is an essential element of that crime that the victim be moved by fear of violence when he parts with his money or property. This objection mistakes the significance of this requirement of proof in the case of robbery. Its true significance is that it places an added burden upon the prosecutor rather than upon the accused. That is, the prosecutor must first establish a criminal intent upon the part of the defendant and he must then make a further showing with respect to the victim's state of mind. The effect of this rule is to render conviction of robbery more, rather than less, difficult. There is no such restrictive evidentiary requirement in prosecutions under this Act. If the objective that these defendants sought to attain by the use of force and threats is not the objective to which the exception in  2(a) affords immunity, they are guilty and nothing further need be shown concerning the actual motive of the owners in handing over the money. On the other hand, if their objective did enjoy the protection of that exception, they are innocent and their innocence is not affected by the state of mind of the owners. We shall consider in a moment, in point (3) below, the legal consequences which flow from the owners' actual rejection of proffered services. But it needs to be emphasized here that for the owners to reject an offer of services amounts to an overt act on their part. It is conduct or behavior as distinct from intention or state of mind. It is an event which alters the external situation in which the defendants find themselves. The latter must then decide whether they will continue to push their demands for the money. Whether or not they are guilty of an offense under this \n\n[315 \nU.S. 521, 534]\n\u00a0\n Act if they choose to do so we shall presently discuss. But that decision must be made in terms of their motives and purposes and objectives rather than those of the owners.\n We do not mean that an offer to work or even the actual performance of some services necessarily entitles one to immunity under the exception. A jury might of course find that such an offer or performance was no more than a sham to disguise an actual intention to extort and to blackmail. But the inquiry must nevertheless be directed to whether this was the purpose of the accused or whether they honestly intended to obtain a chance to work for a wage.\n\n\n (3)\n There remains to be considered the difficult issue which divided the court below. The whole court agreed that the payment of money to one who refuses to perform the services is not 'the payment of wages by a bona- fide employer to a bona-fide employee', within the meaning of  2(a); it also agreed that payments to one who has been permitted actually to perform the services do fall within the exception. But it divided over the question whether the payment of money to one whose sincere offer to work is rejected constitutes the payment of 'wages' to a 'bona-fide employee'. Since the offense charged here is conspiracy, these questions must be put somewhat differently. Thus, there is no conspiracy to violate the Act if the purpose of the defendants is actually to perform the services in return for the money, but there is a punishable conspiracy if their plan is to obtain money without doing the work. The doubtful case arises where the defendants agree to tender their services in good faith to an employer and to work if he accepts their offer, but agree further that the protection of their trade union interests equires that he should pay an amount equivalent to the prevailing union wage even if he rejects their proffered services. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 521, 535]\n\u00a0\n We think that such an agreement is covered by the exception. The term 'wages,' 'bona-fide employee' and 'bonafide employer' are susceptible of more than one meaning, and the background and legislative history of this Act require that they be broadly defined. We have expressed our belief that Congress intended to leave unaffected the ordinary activities of labor unions. The proviso in  6 safeguarding 'the rights of bona-fide labor organizations in lawfully carrying out the legitimate objects thereof', although obscure indeed, strengthens us somewhat in that opinion. 12 The test must therefore be whether the particular activity was among or is akin to labor union activities with which Congress must be taken to have been familiar when this measure was enacted. Accepting payments even where services are refused is such an activity. The Circuit Court has referred to the 'stand-by' orchestra device, by which a union local requires that its members be substituted for visiting musicians, or, if the producer or conductor insists upon using his own musicians, that the members of the local be paid the sums which they would have earned had they performed. That similar devices are employed in other trades is well known. It is admitted here that the stand-by musician has a 'job' even though he renders no actual service. There can be no question that he demands the payment of money regardless of the management's willingness to accept his labor. If, as it is agreed, the musician would escape punishment under this Act even though he obtained his 'stand-by job' by force or threats, it is certainly difficult to see how a teamster could be punished for engaging in the same practice. It is not our province either to approve or disapprove such tactics. But we do believe that they are not 'the activities of \n\n[315 \nU.S. 521, 536]\n\u00a0\n predatory criminal gangs of the Kelly and Dillinger types' at which the Act was aimed, and that on the contrary they are among those practices of labor unions which were intended to remain beyond its ban.\n This does not mean that such activities are beyond the reach of federal legislative control. Nor does it mean that they need go unpunished. The power of state and local authorities to punish acts of violence is beyond question. It is not diminished or affected by the circumstance that the violence may be the outgrowth of a labor dispute. The use of violence disclosed by this record is plainly subject to the ordinary criminal law.\n As we have said, the evidence with respect to the crucial issues was conflicting. Thus, the jury might have believed that in some instances the defendants refused to do any driving or unloading when requested to do so, that in other cases they did not offer to work, that in other cases their offers were rejected, and that in still other cases they actually did some or all of the driving and unloading. In the early stages written contracts were not in existence; later, a number of the owners signed contracts and the defendants performed the services for which they called.\n The jury's task was difficult. The trial lasted six weeks. The jury required two days in which to reach a verdict, and twice during that period it sought further instructions from the Court, particularly with reference to the law relating to labor activity. In such circumstances, where acts of violence naturally would influence the minds of the jury, the instructions were of vital importance, especially as they affected the question of whether the payments which the defendants conspired to obtain fell within the exception contained in  2(a). The trial judge made a number of statements which were \n\n[315 \nU.S. 521, 537]\n\u00a0\n relevant to this issue, but we agree with the Circuit Court that the following were decisive:\n'If the jury find that the sums of money paid by the truck operators were not wages so paid in return for services performed by such defendants, but were payments made by the operators in order to induce the defendants to refrain from interfering unlawfully with the operation of their trucks, then the sums in question may not be regarded as wages paid by a bona fide employer to a bona fide employee.\n\n'The fact that any defendant may have done some work on a truck of an operator is not conclusive as to whether payments received by such defendants were wages; the jury may consider the performance of work by a defendant as evidence of the nature of the relationship between the defendant and the operator as establishing the status of a bona fide employer and a bona fide employee. If, however, what the operator was paying for was not labor performed but merely for protection from interference by the defendants with the operation of operator's trucks, the fact that a defendant may have done some work on an operator's truck is not conclusive.'\n\n These instructions embody the rule for which the government contends, and which we think is erroneous for the reasons we have given. Under them the jury was free to return a verdict of guilty if it found that the motive of the owners in making the payments was to prevent further damage and injury rather than to secure the services of the defendants. Whether or not the defendants were guilty of conspiracy thus became contingent upon the purposes of others and not upon their own aims and objectives. Moreover, the charge failed correctly to explain the legal consequences of proof that the owners had rejected bona fide offers by the defendants to perform \n\n[315 \nU.S. 521, 538]\n\u00a0\n the services. As we have said, the jury was bound to acquit the defendants if it found that their objective and purpose was to obtain by the use or threat of violence the chance to work for the money but to accept the money even if the employers refused to permit them to work. While the 48th, 49th and 58th instructions requested by the defendants, all of which were refused, do not constitute a complete exposition of the rules which we regard as applicable to this case, they cover a good deal of the ground and should have been granted. The 48th states that 'it is not an offense under the Anti-Racketeering Act for anyone to obtain employment by the use or threat of violence if the intention is to actually work for the pay received, and to give an honest day's work for a day's wage.' The 49th declared that 'it is not the purpose of the Anti-Racketeering Act to prevent labor unions from attempting to obtain employment for their members, ... and that the use of violence or the threat of violence for such purposes, while punishable under the laws, is not punishable under the Anti-Racketeering Act.' The 58th requested charge read as follows:\n'I charge you that in order that the defendants herein may be convicted under any one of the four counts of the Anti-Racketeering indictment, you must find a conspiracy under such counts; and that in order to sustain the charge of conspiracy under any one of the counts under the Anti-Racketeering indictment, the proof must show not only that individual defendants obtained money without rendering adequate service, but that it was the aim and object of the conspiracy that ... (they)13 should obtain money without rendering adequate service therefor.' \n\n[315 \nU.S. 521, 539]\n\u00a0\n Since the instructions denied and the misleading instructions actually given go to what is indeed the heart of the case, we hold that the convictions cannot stand and that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be affirmed.\n\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS and Mr. Justice JACKSON took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE, dissenting.\n I think the judgment should be reversed, and the convictions affirmed, subject only to an examination of the sufficiency of the evidence as to some of the respondents, and to a consideration of whether the union itself is a 'person' within the meaning of the statute.\n Respondents, who are members of a labor union, were convicted of conspiracy to violate the Anti-Racketeering Act, 18 U.S.C.A.  420a et seq. They, or some of them, lay in wait for trucks passing from New Jersey to New York, forced their way onto the trucks, and by beating or threats of beating the drivers procured payments to themselves from the drivers or their employers of a sum of money for each truck, $9.42 for a large truck and $8.41 for a small one, said to be the equivalent of the union wage scale for a day's work. In some instances they assisted or offered to assist in unloading the truck and in others they disappeared as soon as the money was paid without rendering or offering to render any service.\n The Anti-Racketeering Act condemns the obtaining or conspiracy to obtain the payment of money or delivery of property by 'the use of ... force, violence, or coercion ....' To this definition of the offense Congress added two-and only two-qualifications. It does not embrace the 'payment of wages by a bona-fide employer to a bona-fide employee', and the provisions of the Act are \n\n[315 \nU.S. 521, 540]\n\u00a0\n not to be applied so as to 'affect the rights of bona-fide labor organizations in lawfully carrying out the legitimate objects thereof, as such rights are expressed in existing statutes of the United States'.\n There is abundant evidence in the record from which the jury could have concluded that respondents, or some of them, conspired to compel by force and violence the truck drivers or their employers to pay the sums of money to respondents or some of them; that the payments were made by the drivers or truck owners to purchase immunity from the violence of respondents and for no other reason; and that this was the end knowingly sought by respondents.\n I can only conclude that such conduct accompanied by such a purpose constitutes a violation of the statute even though the defendants stood ready to unload the trucks in the event that they were hired to do so. Unless the language of the statute is to be disregarded, one who has rejected the proffered service and pays money only in order to purchase immunity from violence is not a bona fide employer and is not paying the extorted money as wages. The character of what the drivers or owners did and intended to do-pay money to avoid a beating-was not altered by the willingness of the payee to accept as wages for services rendered what he in fact intentionally exacted from the driver or owner as the purchase price of immunity from assault, and what he intended so to exact whether the proffered services were accepted or not. It is no answer to say that the guilt of a defendant is personal and cannot be made to depend upon the acts and intention of another. Such an answer if valid would render common law robbery an innocent pastime. For there can be no robbery unless the purpose of the victim in handing over the money is to avoid force. Precisely as under the present statute, the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 521, 541]\n\u00a0\n robber's use of force and its intended effect on the victim are essential elements of the crime both of which the prosecutor must prove. Under this statute when both are present the crime is complete, irrespective of other motives which may actuate the offender, if he is also aware, as we must take it the jury found, that the money is not in fact paid as wages by a bona fide employer. It is a contradiction in terms to say that the payment of money forcibly extorted by a payee who is in any case a lawbreaker, and paid only to secure immunity from violence, without establishment of an employment relationship or the rendering of services, is a good faith payment or receipt of wages.\n Even though the procuring of jobs by violence is not within the Act, and though this includes the 'stand-by' job where no actual service is rendered, the granted immunity, unless its words be disregarded, does not extend to the case where the immediate objective is to force the payment of money regardless of the victim's willingness to accept and treat the extortioner as an employee. It was for the jury to say whether such was the objective of respondents and whether they were aware that the money was paid because of their violence and not as wages.\n When the Anti-Racketeering Act was under consideration by Congress, no member of Congress and no labor leader had the temerity to suggest that such payments, made only to secure immunity from violence and intentionally compelled by assault and battery, could be regarded as the payment of 'wages by a bona-fide employer' or that the compulsion of such payments is a legitimate object of a labor union, or was ever made so by any statute of the United States. I am unable to concur in that suggestion now. It follows that all the defendants who conspired to compel such payments by force and violence, regardless of the willingness of the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 521, 542]\n\u00a0\n victims to accept them as employees, were rightly convicted.\n If I am right in this conclusion there was no error in the instructions to the jury. All the counts of the indictment were for conspiracy to violate the statute. The jury was told that to convict it must find conspiracy or agreement by respondents to violate the statute and that they must have the purpose or intention to commit the crime which it defined. As I have said, the intention to commit the offense includes the intention to use force and violence on the victim and the intention that the victim shall pay because of it. The jury was then instructed that the offense defined by the statute was the obtaining of money or property by force and violence but that 'the jury may not find the defendants guilty on any count of the Anti-Racketeering Act indictment if the money which they are charged with having obtained from truck owners through the use of force and violence or threats of force and violence was paid as wages, and if the defendants who received the money were bona fide employees and the truck operators who paid the money were bona fide employers ... If the jury find that the sums of money paid by the truck operators were not wages so paid in return for services performed by such defendants, but were payments made by the operators in order to induce the defendants to refrain from interfering unlawfully with the operation of their trucks, then the sums in question may not be regarded as wages paid by a bona fide employer to a bona fide employee ... If, however, what the operator was paying for was not labor performed but merely for protection from interference by the defendants with the operation of the operator's trucks, the fact that a defendant may have done some work on an operator's truck is not conclusive.'\n Respondents' 48th and 49th requests were rightly refused. So far as they involved a ruling that the obtaining \n\n[315 \nU.S. 521, 543]\n\u00a0\n of employment by force and violence does not constitute the offense, the court had already ruled specifically that there could be no substantive offense unless the payment of money or property had been obtained by force. But in any case both requests were erroneous because they made respondents' willingness to work the test of guilt, regardless of the intended and actual effect of the violence on the victims in compelling them to pay the money not as wages but in order to secure immunity from assault. The first part of the 58th request likewise had already been charged. The rest was plainly defective since it required an acquittal unless it was the aim and object of the conspiracy that 'all of the conspirators should obtain money without rendering adequate service therefor.' Upon any theory of the meaning of the statute, it was not necessary for the Government to show that it was the object of the conspiracy that 'all the conspirators' should receive payments of money. They would be equally guilty if they had conspired to procure the payments to some. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 48 Stat. 979, U.S.C., Title 18,  420a, 18 U.S.C.A.  420a.

In the District Court, a demurrer to an indictment was sustained on the sole ground that sections 3 and 4 of the Hatch Act, 'An act to prevent pernicious political activities' approved August 2, 1939, 53 Stat. 1147, set out below1 were inapplicable to a state primary. \n2\n Neither the assignment of errors nor the jurisdictional statement specifies any other statute under which the indictment might have been found.\n Defendants, employees of the Works Progress Administration and a municipal Chief of Police, were indicted under Count I for threatening, on May 6, 1940, to deprive a named person of employment, made possible by an Act of Congress, unless he voted for and supported in the Florida primary, defendants' candidates for various national and state offices, and under Count II for promising on May 23rd continued and more remunerative employment if that person did support them. In each count it was alleged that: 'Frank M.

The bill to enjoin the alleged violations of the Act was dismissed by the District Court (40 F.Supp. 852) on the authority of United States v. General Electric Co., \n272 \nU.S. 476\n, 47 S.Ct. 192. The case is here on appeal. 15 U.S.C.  29, 15 U.S.C.A.  29, 32 Stat. 823, 36 Stat. 1167; 28 U.S.C.  345, 28 U.S.C.A.  345, Judicial Code,  238.\n The appellees are Masonite Corporation, Celotex Corporation, Certain- Teed Products Corporation, Johns-Manville Sales Corporation, Insulite Company, Flintkote Company, National Gypsum Company, Wood Conversion Company, Armstrong Cork Company, and Dant & Russell, Inc. Each is engaged either in manufacturing and selling building materials, or in selling building materials manufactured by others. All maintain selling organizations and to a large extent compete in the same markets. As we shall see, some have competing patents, though others do not. Masonite is a manufacturer and distributor of hardboard. Hardboard-a homogeneous, hard, dense, grainless, synthetic board-is made from wood chips. It has a high tensile strength, low water absorption and a density that ranges from 30 to 60 lbs. per \n\n[316 \nU.S. 265, 268]\n\u00a0\n cubic foot. It is used in the building industry as wallboard, panelling, flooring, ceilings and forms into which concrete is poured. It also has numerous industrial uses. Masonite began its production of hardboard in 1926 and distributed it through its own selling organization. Between March 30, 1926 and March 20, 1928, four patents were issued to it, the claims of which covered both hardboard and the processes for making it. Celotex for some period prior to 1928 had been manufacturing and selling insulation board-a fibre board which has a density of less than 30 lbs. per cubic foot and which is softer and lighter, has a lower tensile strength, and is less resistant to water than hardboard. In 1928 Celotex announced that it intended to begin the manufacture of hardboard from bagasse, a waste product from the grinding of sugar cane. It began production in 1929. Several patents were issued to it. Late in 1928 Masonite notified Celotex that its hardboard infringed Masonite's patents. Various discussions were had with a view of avoiding patent litigation by entering into a cross-licensing agreement. Masonite refused. Celotex continued to manufacture and sell hardboard. Its production increased from about 800,000 square feet in 1929 to about 12,000,000 square feet in 1933. It sold its product in competition with Masonite's hardboard and marketed it at prices lower than Masonite sold its hardboard. In 1931 Masonite instituted suit against Celotex for infringement of one of its patents. The District Court held Masonite's patent valid but not infringed. Masonite Corp. v. Celotex Co., 1 F.Supp. 494. Masonite appealed. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that Masonite's patent was both valid and infringed. 3 Cir., 66 F.2d 451. A petition for a writ of certiorari was filed in this Court in September, 1933. About that time Masonite renewed negotiations with Celotex. Those negotiations resulted in a settlement of the patent litigation and in the execution of the so-called \n\n[316 \nU.S. 265, 269]\n\u00a0\n 'agency' agreement of October 10, 19331-one of the agreements which is here attacked and which we discuss later.\n Shortly after the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals in the patent litigation between Celotex and Masonite, the latter company sent the same proposed 'agency' agreement which it had worked out with Celotex to various of the appellees. Johns-Manville Sales Corporation, National Gypsum Company, Armstrong Newport Company (predecessor of Armstrong Cork Company), Hawaiian Cane Products Ltd. (assignor of Certain-Teed Products Corporation), and Wood Conversion Company each executed identical agreements with Masonite on various dates between October 31, 1933 and June 25, 1934. As each agreement was made Masonite informed the other party of the existence and terms of each of the agreements which Masonite had previously made with the others. And as each contract was executed Masonite sent copies to the companies which had previously executed similar contracts.\n Insulite, a manufacturer of insulation board, began producing hardboard in 1930. Its production rose from about 4,500,000 square feet in 1932 to about 9,000,000 square feet in 1933 and amounted to over 7,000,000 square feet annually in 1934 and 1935. There was some evidence that it was selling hardboard at prices lower than those of Masonite. It was advised by Masonite in July, 1933, of possible legal action if it continued to manufacture and sell hardboard. It received from Masonite a copy of the proposed 'agency' agreement. It formally advised Ma- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 265, 270]\n\u00a0\n sonite of its refusal to enter into any such agreement in December, 1933. In March, 1934, Masonite filed suit against a dealer who handled Insulite's hardboard charging infringement of one of Masonite's patents. Insulite undertook the defense; but before issue was joined negotiations between Insulite and Masonite resulted in the execution in February, 1935 of a so-called 'agency' agreement substantially identical with the agreement between Masonite and Celotex. \n2\n At that time Insulite knew that Masonite and the other companies had previously executed the other agreements.\n Disputes arose between Masonite and the so-called 'agents' concerning the operation and construction of the 'agency' agreements. As a result, the agreements were modified in 1936. Each agreement when executed in 1936 was placed in escrow. The escrow agreement was signed by each of the companies and included the name of each of the other 'agents'. Each 'agent' knew at that time that Masonite proposed to make substantially identical agreements with the others. The escrow agreement provided that it should become effective only when all the 'agents' had agreed to it. The new agreements became effective October 29, 1936. In 1937 Flintkote Company and Dant & Russell, Inc., entered into identical agreements with Masonite. Though their agreements differed somewhat from the 1936 agreements, they were substantially similar for present purposes. Both companies knew when they signed the contracts that similar 'agency' agreements existed between Masonite and the other appellees.\n By each of the 1933 agreements Masonite designated the other party as an 'agent' and appointed it as a 'del \n\n[316 \nU.S. 265, 271]\n\u00a0\n credere factor' to sell Masonite's hardboard products. The 'agent' expressly acknowledged the validity of Masonite's hardboard patents so long as the agreement remained in force. The 'agent' agreed to promote the sale of Masonite hardboards. Masonite agreed to manufacture designated hardboard products in specified sizes and to ship on orders and specifications from the 'agent' to any place within the continental United States or Hawaii. Masonite agreed to designate from time to time the minimum selling price and the maximum terms and conditions of sale at which the 'agent' might sell Masonite's products. The list prices and terms of sale were to be the minimum prices and maximum terms of sale at which Masonite was either offering or making sales to its customers. The right to change the list prices and terms of sale was vested solely in Masonite and might be exercised on 10 days notice. It was agreed that Masonite was bound to adhere to the prices, and terms and conditions of sale which it fixed for its 'agents'. In case the 'agent' sold for less than the minimum price it was obligated to pay liquidated damages at a specified rate. On direct shipments to the 'agent' the hardboards 'shall be received and held on consignment' and 'title thereto shall remain' in Masonite until sold by the 'agent'. The minimum prices were f.o.b. Masonite's factory, the 'agent' paying freight and transportation costs and sales and other taxes. The 'agent' also agreed at its expense to carry insurance on all products consigned to it. The 'agent's' compensation was fixed by way of specified commissions on each sale. The 'agent' was prohibited from making sales (except for offsized boards) to any person other than specified classes. Those provisions permitted the 'agent' to sell only to the construction industry, the industrial market being reserved for Masonite. The 'agent' agreed to compensate Masonite by advancing one-half of the difference between the list price and the agent's discount within 20 \n\n[316 \nU.S. 265, 272]\n\u00a0\n days after the close of the month in which the order was shipped and the balance within 20 days after the close of the month in which the products were sold by the 'agent' to its customers. In case of direct shipments by Masonite to the customers of the 'agent' the latter agreed to pay the entire amount due Masonite within 20 days after the close of the month in which the shipment was made. The 'agent' agreed not to use the trade name or the trade marks of Masonite. But the latter agreed to mark, without extra cost, all hardboard with the 'agent's' or its customer's name or trade mark if the 'agent' or customers so desired. And Masonite reserved the right to mark all products sold by the 'agent' with Masonite's patent notice. Masonite warranted that the products were to be 'good, workmanlike products of a character and quality equal to that currently manufactured by it and sold to its customers.' Its liability was to be limited to replacing without cost to the 'agent' any 'defective material when the defect is one of manufacture'. The 'agent' agreed to make monthly reports on inventory consigned and on hand. For any default of the 'agent' Masonite could terminate the arrangement on 30 days' notice. Masonite could also terminate in case ofthe bankruptcy, receivership, or insolvency of the 'agent' or in case the 'agent' failed to order from Masonite at least 1,500,000 square feet of hardboard products for any six months' period. The 'agent' could terminate the agreement on six months' written notice. On termination of the agreement the 'agent' agreed to 'purchase and pay for all products consigned to it and unsold'; or at the option of Masonite the latter might have the products returned to it and refund to the 'agent' all advances made by the 'agent' to or for Masonite's account. Masonite agreed to issue to the 'agent' at its request 'a license to manufacture and sell hard boards' under its patents on specified terms and conditions and on payment of designated sums-$200,000 if \n\n[316 \nU.S. 265, 273]\n\u00a0\n the license was issued before December 31, 1934, and decreasing amounts if the license was issued at subsequent dates. Masonite reserved the right to inspect and examine, through certified public accountants, the physical inventory and the books and records of the 'agent' relating to the transactions covered by the agreement. Masonite agreed to save harmless and protect the 'agent' and its customers against any claim that the hardboards infringed any patent owned by others than the parties to the agreement. Provisions for arbitration and for assignment of the agreement were included. And it was provided that the agreement should continue 'during the life of that one' of specified patents of Masonite 'having the longest term to run, including any reissues, extensions or improvements thereof', unless the agreement was sooner terminated by either party. Each agreement had attached a form of 'license' to manufacture and sell to be used in case the option license was exercised. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[316 \nU.S. 265, 274]\n\u00a0\n We need not stop to analyze the 1936 agreements. They contained numerous changes and elaborations. But they are not important for the purposes of this case since the pattern of the relationship between appellees was fixed in 1933 and its fundamental characteristics were maintained, not basically altered, in 1936. Nor need we stop to explore all of the contentions made by the United States. They include arguments that there has been an illegal division of markets (Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, \n175 \nU.S. 211\n, 20 S.Ct. 96); that the 'agency' agreements have been used to control unlawfully other materials sold in combination with hardboard, the subject matter of Masonite's patents (Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Dev. Corp., \n283 \nU.S. 27\n, 51 S. Ct. 334); that in some instances the combination unlawfully controlled the price of hardboard 'owned' by the 'agents' (Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, \n309 \nU.S. 436\n, 60 S.Ct. 618); and that the arrangement included agreements to suppress the use of patents contrary to the rule of Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 20\n, 33 S.Ct. 9, and Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 163, 174\n, 51 S.Ct. 421, 425. But we can put these contentions to one side without expressing an opinion on them. For there is one phase of the case which is decisive. That is the agreement for price-fixing.\n But for Masonite's patents and the del credere agency agreements there can be no doubt that this is a price-fixing combination which is illegal per se under the Sherman Act. United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., \n273 \nU.S. 392\n, 47 S.Ct. 377, 50 A.L.R. 989; Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, \n309 \nU.S. 436\n, 60 S.Ct. 618; United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., \n310 \nU.S. 150\n, 60 S.Ct. 811. That is true though the District Court found that \n\n[316 \nU.S. 265, 275]\n\u00a0\n in negotiating and entering into the first agreements each appellee, other than Masonite, acted independently of the others, negotiated only with Masonite, desired the agreement regardless of the action that might be taken by any of the others, did not require as a condition of its acceptance that Masonite make such an agreement with any of the others, and had no discussions with any of the others. It is not clear at what precise point of time each appellee became aware of the fact that its contract was not an isolated transaction but part of a larger arrangement. But it is clear that as the arrangement continued each became familiar with its purpose and scope. Here as in Interstate Circuit, Inc., v. United States, \n306 \nU.S. 208, 226\n, 59 S.Ct. 467, 474, 'It was enough that, knowing that concerted action was contemplated and invited, the distributors gave their adherence to the scheme and participated in it.' The circumstances surrounding the making of the 1936 agreements and the joinder in 1937 of the two other companies leave no room for doubt that all had an awareness of the general scope and purpose of the undertaking. As this Court stated in the Interstate Circuit case (page 227 of 306 U.S., page 474 of 59 S.Ct.): 'It is elementary that an unlawful conspiracy may be and often is formed without simultaneous action or agreement on the part of the conspirators. ... Acceptance by competitors, without previous agreement, of an invitation to participate in a plan, the necessary consequence of which, if carried out, is restraint of interstate commerce, is sufficient to establish an unlawful conspiracy under the Sherman Act.' And as respects statements of various appellees that they did not intend to join a combination or to fix prices, we need only say that they 'must be held to have intended the necessary and direct consequences of their acts, and cannot be heard to say the contrary.' United States v. Patten, \n226 \nU.S. 525, 543\n, 33 S.Ct. 141, 145, 44 L.R.A.,N.S., 325. Nor can the fact that Masonite alone fixed the prices and that the other appellees never consulted with Mason- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 265, 276]\n\u00a0\n ite concerning them make the combination any the less illegal. Prices are fixed when they are agreed upon. United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., supra, 310 U.S., page 222, 60 S.Ct. page 843. The fixing of prices by one member of a group pursuant to express delegation, acquiescence, or understanding is just as illegal as the fixing of prices by direct, joint action. Id. Since there was price-fixing, the fact that there were business reasons which made the arrangements desirable to the appellees, the fact that the effect of the combination may have been to increase the distribution of hardboard without increase of price to the consumer or even to promote competition between dealers, or the fact that from other points of view the arrangements might be deemed to have desirable consequences would be no more a legal justification for price- fixing than were the 'competitive evils' in the Socony-Vacuum case.\n But it is urged that the arrangement is saved from the Sherman Act by the General Electric case. The District Court so held, as we have noted. In that connection the District Court found that Masonite's patents on hardboard were 'fundamental and basic', that there was no monopoly or restraint other than the monopoly or restraint granted by the patents, that the parties had an honest and sincere intent to recognize and exercise the rights belonging to Masonite under its patents, and that the agreements constituted a 'true agency' to carry out that purpose. We assume arguendo that the patents in question, owned by Masonite, are valid. But we do not agree that the 'agency' device saved the arrangement from the Sherman Act.\n Del credere agency has an ancient lineage and has been put to numerous business and mercantile uses. Chorley, Del Credere, 45 Law Quarterly Rev. 221; Mechem, Agency, 2d Ed. ch. IV. But however useful it may be in allocating risks between the parties and determining their rights inter se, its terms do not necessarily control \n\n[316 \nU.S. 265, 277]\n\u00a0\n when the rights of others intervene, whether they be creditors or the sovereign. See Klaus, Sale, Agency and Price Maintenance, 28 Col.L.Rev. 441, 443-450. We assume in this case that the agreements constituted the appellees as del credere agents of Masonite. But that circumstance does not prevent the arrangement from running afoul of the Sherman Act. The owner of a patent cannot extend his statutory grant by contract or agreement. A patent affords no immunity for a monopoly not fairly or plainly within the grant. We have recently stated in Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., \n314 \nU.S. 488\n, 62 S.Ct. 402, 405, 86 L.Ed. --, decided January 5, 1942, 'the public policy which includes inventions within the granted monopoly excludes from it all that is not embraced in the invention. It equally forbids the use of the patent to secure an exclusive right or limited monopoly not granted by the Patent Office and which it is contrary to public policy to grant.' Beyond the limited monopoly which is granted, the arrangements by which the patent is utilized are subject to the general law. Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. United States, supra; Boston Store v. American Graphophone Co., \n246 \nU.S. 8, 25\n, 38 S.Ct. 257, 260, Ann.Cas 1918C, 447; Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, supra.\n We do not have here any question as to the validity of a license to manufacture and sell, since none ofthe 'agents' exercised its option to acquire such a license from Masonite. Hence we need not reach the problems presented by Bement & Sons v. National Harrow Co., \n186 \nU.S. 70\n, 22 S.Ct. 747, and that part of the General Electric case which dealt with the license to Westinghouse Company. Rather we are concerned here only with a license to vend. But it will not do to say that since the patentee has the power to refuse a license, he has the lesser power to license on his own conditions. There are strict limitations on the power of the patentee to attach conditions to the use of the patented article. As Chief Justice Taney said in Bloomer v. McQuewan, 14 How. 539, 549, when the patented product \n\n[316 \nU.S. 265, 278]\n\u00a0\n 'PASSES TO THE HANDS OF THE PURCHASER, IT is no longer within the limits of the monopoly. It passes outside of it, and is no longer under the protection of the act of Congress.' And see Adams v. Burke, 17 Wall. 453; Hobbie v. Jennison, \n149 \nU.S. 355\n, 13 S.Ct. 879. In applying that rule this Court has quite consistently refused to allow the form into which the parties chose to cast the transaction to govern. The test has been whether or not there has been such a disposition of the article that it may fairly be said that the patentee has received his reward for the use of the article. Straus v. Victor Talking Machine Co., \n243 \nU.S. 490\n, 37 S.Ct. 412, L.R.A.1917E, 1196, Ann.Cas.1918A, 955; Boston Store v. American Graphophone Co., supra. And see United States v. Univis Lens Co., Inc., \n316 \nU.S. 241\n, 62 S.Ct. 1088, 86 L.Ed. --, decided this day. In determining whether or not a particular transaction comes within the rule of the Bloomer case regard must be had for the dominant concern of the patent system. As stated by Mr. Justice Story in Pennock v. Dialogue, alogue, 2 Pet. 1, 19, the promotion of the progress of science and the useful arts is the 'main object'; reward of inventors is secondary and merely a means to that end. Or, in the words of Mr. Justice Deniel in Kendall v. Winsor, 21 How. 322, 329, 'Whilst the remuneration of genius and useful ingenuity is a duty incumbent upon the public, the rights and welfare of the community must be fairly dealt with and effectually guarded. Considerations of individual emolument can never be permitted to operate to the injury of these.' And see Blount Mfg. Co. v. Yale & Towne Mfg. Co., C.C., 166 F. 555.\n That must be the point of departure for decision on the facts of cases such as the present one lest the limited patent privilege be enlarged by private agreements so as to by-pass the Sherman Act. Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, supra, 309 U.S. pages 456-459, 60 S.Ct. pages 625, 626. Certainly, if the del credere agency device were given broad approval, whole industries could be knit together so as to regulate prices and suppress competition. That would allow the patent \n\n[316 \nU.S. 265, 279]\n\u00a0\n owner under the guise of his patent monopoly not merely to secure a reward for his invention but to secure protection from competition which the patent law unaided by restrictive agreements does not afford. Doubtless there is a proper area for utilization by a patentee of a del credere agent in the sale or disposition of the patented article. A patentee who employs such an agent to distribute his product certainly is not enlarging the scope of his patent privilege if it may fairly be said that that distribution is part of the patentee's own business and operates only to secure to him the reward for his invention which Congress has provided. But where he utilizes the sales organization of another business-a business with which he has no intimate relationship-quite different problems are posed since such a regimentation of a marketing system is peculiarly susceptible to the restraints of trade which the Sherman Act condemns. And when it is clear, as it is in this case, that the marketing systems utilized by means of the del credere agency agreements are those of competitors of the patentee and that the purpose is to fix prices at which the competitors may market the product, the device is without more an enlargement of the limited patent privilege and a violation of the Sherman Act. In such a case the patentee exhausts his limited privilege when he disposes of the product to the del credere agent. He then has, so far as the Sherman Act is concerned, no greater rights to price maintenance4 than the owner of an unpatented commodity would have. Dr. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 265, 280]\n\u00a0\n Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Parks & Sons Co., \n220 \nU.S. 373\n, 31 S.Ct. 376. Our reasons for that conclusion are as follows:\n Congress has provided that a patentee shall have the 'exclusive right to make, use, and vend the invention or discovery' for a limited period. 46 Stat. 376, 35 U.S.C.  40, 35 U.S.C.A.  40. But the scope of the right to 'vend' cannot be determined by reference to the private law of sales alone. Since patents are privileges restrictive of a free economy, the rights which Congress has attached to them must be strictly construed so as not to derogate from the general law beyond the necessary requirements of the patent statute. United States v. Univis Lens Co., Inc., supra. So far as the Sherman Act is concerned the result must turn not on the skill with which counsel has manipulated the concepts of 'sale' and 'agency' but on the significance of the business practices in terms of restraint of trade.\n In this case some of the appellees had patents on hardboard, some did not. But each was tied to Masonite by an agreement which expressly recognized the validity of Masonite's patents during the life of the agreement and which required the distribution of the patented product at fixed prices. In the General Electric case the Court thought that the purpose and effect of the marketing plan was to secure to the patentee only a reward for his invention. We cannot agree that that is true here. In this case the price regulation was based on mutual agreement among distributors of competing products, some of whom had competing patents, as we have noted. None of these patents, except possibly some held by Celotex, had been held to conflict with or infringe the Masonite patents. Nor are we warranted in assuming, in absence of a a definite adjudication, that one grant by the Patent Office is more valid than another. It is true that the District Court found that both before and after the agreements in question the various appellees had been active in attempting to find a substitute for the patented hard- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 265, 281]\n\u00a0\n board which would not infringe Masonite's so-called 'basic' patents; that they were not successful in that search; that the agreements did not discourage or dissuade them from their efforts to discover or develop non- infringing products; that they were willing and intended to terminate their respective agency agreements whenever it should become commercially possible to offer a competitive non-infringing product; and that many of the appellees have in fact distributed products which were in many respects competitive with hardboard. But those circumstances are not controlling.\n The power of Masonite to fix the price of the product which it manufactures, and which the entire group sells and with respect to which all have been and are now actual or potential competitors, is a powerful inducement to abandon competition. The extent to which that inducement in a given case will have or has had the desired effect is difficult, if not impossible, of measurement. The forces which that influence puts to work are subtle and incalculable. Active and vigorous competition then tend to be impaired not from any preference of the public for the patented product but from the preference of the competitors for a mutual arrangement for price-fixing which promises more profit if the parties abandon rather than maintain competition. The presence of competing patents serves merely to accentuate that tendency and to underline the potency of the forces at work. Control over prices thus becomes an actual or potential brake on competition. This kind of marketing device thus actually or potentially throttles or suppresses competing and non-infringing products and tends to place a premium on the abandonment of competition. It is outside our competence to inquire whether the result was or was not beneficent or whether the evil was or was not realized. As in case of an appraisal of the reasonableness of prices which \n\n[316 \nU.S. 265, 282]\n\u00a0\n are fixed, such a determination could satisfactorily be made 'only after a complete survey of our economic organization and a choice between rival philosophies' (United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., supra, 273 U.S. page 398, 47 S.Ct. page 379, 50 A.L.R. 989) and only after weighing a host of intangibles. United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., supra. The power of this type of combination to inflict the kind of public injury which the Sherman Act condemns renders it illegal per se. If it were sanctioned in this situation it would permit the patentee to add to his domain at public expense by obtaining command over a competitor. He would then not only secure a reward for his invention; he would enhance the value of his own trade position by eliminating or impairing competition. That would be no more permissible than a contract between a copyright owner and one who has no copyright, or a contract between two copyright owners or patentees, to restrain the competitive distribution of the copyrighted or patented articles in the open market. Interstate Circuit, Inc., v. United States, supra, 306 U.S. page 230, 59 S.Ct. page 476. As stated in Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. United States, supra, 226 U.S. page 49, 33 S.Ct. page 15, rights conferred by patents 'do not give any more than other rights a universal license against positive prohibitions. The Sherman law is a limitation of rights, rights which may be pushed to evil consequences, and therefore restrained.'\n Since the transactions here challenged were in interstate commerce no question as to the violation of the Sherman Act remains.\n But it is urged that the agreements made by the appellees in 1941 after the present suit was instituted mark an abandonment of the former combination and that since the new arrangement is unobjectionable, there is nothing to enjoin. The difficulty with that contention is that the 1941 agreements, though improved models of an agency arrangement, removed none of the features which we have found to be fatal. They still are unmistakable \n\n[316 \nU.S. 265, 283]\n\u00a0\n pricefixing agreements with competitors. And if there were any lingering doubt as to whether the appellees were parties to a conspiracy it is dispelled at this point. A committee of the appellees was appointed to draft the new agreement. The agreement was completed after meetings at which representatives of all of the appellees attended. The 1941 agreements were the product of joint and concerted action.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS and Mr. Justice JACKSON did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In 1932 receivers for Celotex were appointed by the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and an ancillary receiver was appointed by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The agreement with Masonite was authorized by those courts. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] At the time Insulite entered into this agreement with Masonite its parent company was in receivership in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. The receivership court authorized Insulite to execute the agreement with Masonite. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] There were in some cases supplemental agreements. Thus Celotex agreed to withdraw its petition for a writ of certiorari in this Court, Masonite waived an accounting in connection with that infringement suit, and each of the parties agreed to pay its own costs and expenses incurred in that litigation. In the case of Insulite, Masonite agreed to dismiss the patent suit which it had instituted against one of Insulite's dealers without prejudice to the patent claims of either party. Masonite also agreed to purchase a press from Insulite and to lease that press to Insulite on condition that any hardboard made with it should be of the type theretofore manufactured by Insulite and should not be marketed except 'by sale for export only'. Masonite could terminate Insulite's right to manufacture for export by offering to sell Insulite hardboard for that purpose. This agreement was without prejudice to Masonite's rights or the rights of its foreign licensees under Masonite's foreign patents.\n In 1937 both Insulite and Masonite had applications for patents relating to hardboard pending in the Patent Office. Certain claims of these applications were involved in interference proceedings. Masonite was contending that Insulite was infringing its patents in Finland. By contract the interference proceedings were settled in 1938 by Masonite conceding priority to certain patent claims of Insulite and by Insulite giving Masonite as exclusive royalty-free license under all of Insulite's patents and patent applications relating to hardboard. The license excluded Insulite from using the patents. The alleged infringement of the Finnish patents was settled by Masonite assigning its Finnish patents to Insulite. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] It should be noted in this connection that the Miller-Tydings Act, 50 Stat. 693, 15 U.S.C.A.  1, which amended  1 of the Sherman Act so as to legalize certain types of resale price agreements expressly excluded 'any contract or agreement, providing for the establishment or maintenance of minimum resale prices on any commodity herein involved, between manufacturers, or between producers, or between wholesalers, or between brokers, or between factors, or between retailers, or between persons, firms, or corporations in competition with each other.' \n\n\n\n\n","141":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. NUNNALLY INV. CO.(1942)\nNo. 990\nArgued: Decided: May 11, 1942\n\n\n\n\n[316 \nU.S. 258, 259]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Arnold Raum, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Wm. A. Sutherland, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit against the United States to recover taxes for the year 1920. In that year the taxpayer, the respondent here, sold its business and all its assets to another corporation. The consideration consisted of cash and the assumption of certain of the respondent's obligations, including federal taxes for previous years. The purchaser paid part of these taxes in 1920, the remainder in 1921 and 1922. In determining a deficiency for the year 1920, the Commissioner employed a lower basis of the assets sold than was used by the respondent. The Commissioner computed the selling price by including the full amount of the taxes which the purchaser agreed to assume. After paying the assessed tax, the respondent filed a claim for refund, alleging only that the Commissioner had understated the basis of the assets sold. In due course a suit was brought against the Collector in the District Court. A settlement was reached under which judgment for the taxpayer was entered. In accordance with their agreement, neither party appealed.\n Thereafter, the respondent filed a second refund claim, asserting that the taxes assumed by the purchaser which were not paid in 1920 were not taxable to the respondent in that year. This claim was rejected, and a suit against the United States was begun in the Court of Claims. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 258, 260]\n\u00a0\n Holding that the judgment against the Collector in the District Court was not res judicata of the taxpayer's claim in this suit against the United States, the Court of Claims (with one judge dissenting) gave judgment for the respondent. 36 F.Supp. 332. In view of the importance of this question in the administration of the federal income tax law and its relation to the decision in Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, \n289 \nU.S. 373\n, 53 S.Ct. 620, we brought the case here. \n314 \nU.S. 705\n, 62 S.Ct. 409, 86 L. Ed. --.\n Nearly a quarter-century ago in Sage v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 33\n, 39 S.Ct. 415, this Court upon full consideration announced the doctrine that the United States is a 'stranger' to a judgment resulting from a suit brought against a collector, and that such a judgment is, therefore, not a bar in a subsequent action upon the same claim against the United States. This was not a novel doctrine. The result was drawn from the conception of a suit against a collector as 'personal', since he was personally responsible for illegally exacting monies under the claim that they were due as taxes. Such a 'personal' remedy against the collector, derived from the common-law action of indebitatus assumpsit, has always been part of our fiscal administration. Unless the application given to this remedy by the doctrine of the Sage case has been displaced by Congress or renounced by later decisions of this Court, the judgment must stand. Concededly Congress has not done so. And although recognition has been made of the technical nature of a suit against a collector, no support can be found for the contention that the Sage doctrine has been discarded as an anachronism. On the contrary, the rule has been reaffirmed in an unbroken line of authority.\n Soon after the decision in the Sage case, the question was presented whether an action against a collector could be continued against his successor. This Court held that it could not, because the Sage case had settled that such a suit was 'personal'. See Smietanka v. Indiana Steel \n\n[316 \nU.S. 258, 261]\n\u00a0\n Co., \n257 \nU.S. 1\n, 42 S.Ct. 1; Union Trust Co. v. Wardell, \n258 \nU.S. 537\n, 42 S.Ct. 393. In Bankers' Coal Co. v. Burnet, \n287 \nU.S. 308\n, 53 S.Ct. 150, a suit against a collector with respect to taxes for the years 1914-1919 had resulted in a determination that the taxpayer was entitled to a depletion allowance of five cents per ton on coal mine royalties. It was contended that this determination was res judicata of that issue in a subsequent action against the Commissioner relating to taxes for later years. The Court, again relying on the Sage case, rejected the argument in these words: 'With respect to this contention it is sufficient to say that the suit in the District Court was not against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the respondent here, but against the collector, judgment against whom is not res adjudicata against the Commissioner or the United States.' 287 U.S. at page 312, 53 S.Ct. at page 151.\n The Government leans heavily upon Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, \n289 \nU.S. 373\n, 53 S.Ct. 620. In that case the constitutionality of  1014 of the Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 253, 343, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Acts, page 128, providing that a taxpayer may recover an unlawful federal tax even though he paid the tax without protest, was upheld as applied to a payment without protest made prior to the enactment of the provision. In reaching this conclusion, the Court noted that under R.S.  989, 28 U.S.C .  842, 28 U.S.C.A.  842, a collector who acts under the directions of the Secretary of the Treasury, or other proper officer of the Government, 'is entitled as of right to a certificate converting the suit against him into one against the government. ... A suit against a collector who has collected a tax in the fulfillment of a ministerial duty is to-day an anomalous relic of bygone modes of thought. He is not suable as a trespasser, nor is he to pay out of his own purse. He is made a defendant because the statute has said for many years that such a remedy shall exist, though he has been guilty of no wrong, and though another is to pay. ... There may have been utility in such procedural \n\n[316 \nU.S. 258, 262]\n\u00a0\n devices in days when the government was not suable as freely as now. ... They have little utility to-day, at all events where the complaint against the officer shows upon its face that in the process of collecting he was acting in the line of duty, and that in the line of duty he has turned the money over. In such circumstances his presence as a defendant is merely a remedial expedient for bringing the government into court.' 289 U.S. at pages 381-383, 53 S.Ct. at page 623\n\n\n The Government urges that even though the Moore Ice Cream case was not concerned with the conclusiveness of a judgment in a suit against the collector, its rationale undermined the Sage doctrine. But such has not been the influence of the Moore Ice Cream case on the subsequent course of decisions relevant to our purpose. Tait v. Western Maryland Ry. Co., \n289 \nU.S. 620\n, 53 S.Ct. 706, decided by a unanimous Court three weeks after the decision in the Moore Ice Cream case, is incontrovertible proof that the Sage doctrine was left unimpaired. The Court there held that a judgment in a suit against the Commissioner was binding in a subsequent action against the United States and the collector. The doctrine in the Sage case was explicitly reaffirmed: 'In a suit for unlawful exaction the liability of a collector is not official but personal. Sage v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 33\n, 39 S.Ct. 415; Smietanka v. Indiana Steel Co., \n257 \nU.S. 1\n, 42 S.Ct. 1; Graham and Foster v. Goodcell, \n282 \nU.S. 409, 430\n, 51 S.Ct. 186 (194). And for this reason a judgment in a suit to which he was a party does not conclude the Commissioner or the United States. Bankers' Pocahontas Coal Co. v. Burnet, \n287 \nU.S. 308, 311\n, 53 S.Ct. 150. We think, however, that where a question has been adjudged as between a taxpayer and the government or its official agent, the Commissioner, the collector, being an official inferior in authority, and acting under them, is in such privity with them that he is estopped by the judgment.' 298 U.S. at page 627, 53 S.Ct. at page 708.\n More recently, in Sunshine Coal Co. v. Adkins, \n310 \nU.S. 381\n, 60 S.Ct. 907, where the principle of res judicata was applied to \n\n[316 \nU.S. 258, 263]\n\u00a0\n suits to which an administrative agency was a party, the Court again expressly adhered to the doctrine of the Sage case: 'Cases holding that a judgment in a suit against a collector for unlawful exaction is not a bar to a subsequent suit by or against the Commissioner or the United States ( Sage v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 33\n, 39 S.Ct. 415; Bankers' Pocahontas Coal Co. v. Burnet, \n287 \nU.S. 308\n, 53 S.Ct. 150) are not in point, since the suit against the collector is 'personal and its incidents, such as the nature of the defenses open and the allowance of interest, are different.\" 310 U.S. at page 403, 60 S.Ct. at page 917. And earlier in this term in United States v. Kales, \n314 \nU.S. 186\n, 62 S.Ct. 214, 86 L.Ed. --, in speaking of the right of a taxpayer to maintain separate suits against a collector and the government for tax payments made to two collectors on income derived from a single transaction in a single tax year, the Court said: 'The judgment against the collector is a personal judgment to which the United States is a stranger except as it has obligated itself to pay it. See Sage v. United States, supra; Smietanka v. Indiana Steel Co., supra, 257 U.S. pages 4, 5, 42 S.Ct. at pages 1, 2. While the statutes have for most practical purposes reduced the personal liability of the collector to a fiction, the course of the legislation indicates clearly enough that it is a fiction intended to be acted upon to the extent that the right to maintain the suit and its incidents, until judgment rendered, are to be left undisturbed. ... The right to pursue the common law action against the collector is too deeply imbedded in the statutes and judicial decisions of the United States to admit of so radical a departure from its traditional use and consequences as the Government now urges, without further Congressional action.' 314 U.S. at pages 199, 200, 62 S.Ct. at page 220, 86 L.Ed. --.\n In summary, therefore, an imposing series of opinions has fortified the original authority of the Sage doctrine. No doubt the precise question raised in each of these cases was different from the one now before us, and each case might have been decided without reference to the prin- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 258, 264]\n\u00a0\n ciples underlying the rule in the Sage case. But this only serves to emphasize the obduracy of the doctrine as part of the historical scheme of revenue administration. It would have been easy in all of these cases to dissipate the force of the doctrine which the Sage case represents by rejecting it and resting the decision in that case upon the alternative ground afforded by the Act of July 27, 1912, c. 256, 37 Stat. 240. That this long line of cases should have referred to and relied upon the Sage case without rejecting the doctrine for which it was cited only underlines still further its persistence.\n Even when this Court found that the common-law right to sue the collector had argumentatively been withdrawn, see Cary v. Curtis, 3 How. 236, Congress promptly restored that right. Act of February 26, 1845, c. 22, 5 Stat. 727. The problem of legal remedies appropriate for fiscal administration rests within easy Congressional control. Congress can deal with the matter comprehensively, unembarrassed by the limitations of a litigation involving only one phase of a complex problem. The Government itself does not now ask us to jettison the whole notion of suing a collector personally. It merely asks us to eliminate one consequence of that conception. In the field of custom duties Congress has devised a comprehensive and interrelated scheme of administrative and judicial remedies. See Act of June 17, 1930, 46 Stat. 590, 734, 19 U.S.C .  1514-1515, 19 U.S.C.A.  1514, 1515; Freund, Administrative Powers over Persons and Property, pp. 553-60. If the doctrine of the Sage case is now to be abandoned, such a determination of policy in the administration of the income tax law should be made by Congress, which maintains a Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation charged with the duty of investigating the operation of the federal revenue laws and recommending such legislation as may be deemed desirable.\n Affirmed. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 258, 265]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice JACKSON took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, and Mr. Justice BYRNES dissent for the reasons (1) that here, unlike the situation in United States v. Kales, \n314 \nU.S. 186\n, 62 S.Ct. 214, 86 L.Ed. --, the taxpayer had but a single cause of action and could have raised every issue with respect to the validity of the taxes in the earlier suit; (2) that here, unlike the situation in Sage v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 33, 38\n, 39 S., 39 S. Ct. 415, 416, there had been no intervening legislation which created rights and lifted the bar of the judgment in the earlier suit; and (3) that in the earlier suit the United States became 'a party to the judgment as a matter of law' (Griswold, Res Judicata in Federal Tax Cases, 46 Yale L.Journ. 1320, 1342) since in these days the presence of the collector as a defendant who acts 'in the line of duty' is 'merely a remedial expedient for bringing the government into court.'

Bennett, of New York City, for respondent. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 210]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought by the United States to recover the assets of the New York branch of the First Russian Insurance Co. which remained in the hands of repondent after the payment of all domestic creditors. The material allegations of the complaint were in brief as follows:\n The First Russian Insurance Co., organized under the laws of the former Empire of Russia, established a New York branch in 1907. It deposited with the Superintendent of Insurance, pursuant to the laws of New York, certain assets to secure payment of claims resulting from transactions of its New York branch. By certain laws, decrees, enactments and orders in 1918 and 1919 the Russian Government nationalized the business of insurance and all of the property, whereever situated, of all Russian insurance companies (including the First Russian \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 211]\n\u00a0\n Insurance Co.), and discharged and cancelled all the debts of such companies and the rights of all shareholders in all such property. The New York branch of the First Russian Insurance Co. continued to do business in New York until 1925. At that time respondent, pursuant to an order of the Supreme Court of New York, took possession of its assets for a determination and report upon the claims of the policyholders and creditors in the United States. Thereafter all claims of domestic creditors, i.e., all claims arising out of the business of the New York branch, were paid by respondent, leaving a balance in his hands of more than $1,000,000. In 1931 the New York Court of Appeals (People, by Beha, v. First Russian Ins. Co., 255 N.Y. 415, 175 N.E. 114) directed respondent to dispose of that balance as follows: first, to pay claims of foreign creditors who had filed attachment prior to the commencement of the liquidation proceeding and also such claims as were filed prior to the entry of the order on remittitur of that court; and second, to pay any surplus to a quorum of the board of directors of the company. Pursuant to that mandate, respondent proceeded with the liquidation of the claims of the foreign creditors. Some payments were made thereon. The major portion of the allowed claims, however, were not paid, a stay having been granted pending disposition of the claim of the United States. On November 16, 1933, the United States recognized the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as the de jure Government of Russia and as an incident to that recognition accepted an assignment (known as the Litvinov Assignment) of certain claims. \n1\n The Litvinov Assignment was in the form of a letter dated November 16, 1933, to the President of the United States from Maxim Litvinov, People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, reading as follows: \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 212]\n\u00a0\n 'Following our conversations I have the honor to inform you that the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics agrees that, preparatory to a final settlement of the claims and counter claims between the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America and the claims of their nationals, the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics will not take any steps to enforce any decisions of courts or initiate any new litigations for the amounts admitted to be due or that may be found to be due it, as the successor of prior Governments of Russia, or otherwise, from American nationals, including corporations, companies, partnerships, or associations, and also the claim against the United States of the Russian Volunteer Fleet, now in litigation in the United States Court of Claims, and will not object to such amounts being assigned and does hereby release and assign all such amounts to the Government of the United States, the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to be duly notified in each case of any amount realized by the Government of the United States from such release and assignment.\n'The Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics further agrees, preparatory to the settlement referred to above not to make any claims with respect to:\n\n'(a) judgments rendered or that may be rendered by American courts in so far as they relate to property, or rights, or interests therein, in which the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or its nationals may have had or may claim to have an interest; or,\n\n'(b) acts done or settlements made by or with the Government of the United States, or public officials in the United States, or its nationals, relating to property, credits, or obligations of any Government of Russia or nationals thereof.'\n\n This was acknowledged by the President on the same date. The acknowledgement, after setting forth the terms of the assignment, concluded: \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 213]\n\u00a0\n 'I am glad to have these undertakings by your Government and I shall be pleased to notify your Government in each case of any amount realized by the Government of the United States from the release and assignment to it of the amounts admitted to be due, or that may be found to be due, the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and of the amount that may be found to be due on the claim of the Russian Volunteer Fleet.'\n On November 14, 1934, the United States brought an action in the federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, seeking to recover the assets in the hands of respondent. This Court held in United States v. Bank of New York & Trust Co., \n296 \nU.S. 463\n, 56 S.Ct. 343, that the well settled 'principles governing the convenient and orderly administration of justice require that the jurisdiction of the state court should be respected' (page 480 of 296 U.S., page 348 of 56 S. Ct.); and that whatever might be 'the effect of recognition' of the Russian Government, it did not terminate the state proceedings. Page 479 of 296 U.S., page 348 of 56 S.Ct.. The United States was remitted to the state court for determination of its claim, no opinion being intimated on the merits. Page 481 of 296 U.S., page 348 of 56 S.Ct.. The United States then moved for leave to intervene in the liquidation proceedings. Its motion was denied 'without prejudice to the institution of the time-honored form of action'. That order was affirmed on appeal.\n Thereafter the present suit was instituted in the Supreme Court of New York. The defendants, other than respondent, were certain designated policy holders and other creditors who had presented in the liquidation proceedings claims against the corporation. The complaint prayed, inter alia, that the United States be adjudged to be the sole and exclusive owner entitled to immediate possession of the entire surplus fund in the hands of the respondent.\n Respondent's answer denied the allegations of the complaint that title to the funds in question passed to the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 214]\n\u00a0\n United States and that the Russian decrees had the effect claimed. It also set forth various affirmative defenses-that the order of distribution pursuant to the decree in People, by Beha, v. First Russian Ins. Co., 255 N.Y. 415, 175 N.E. 114 could not be affected by the Litvinov Assignment; that the Litvinov Assignment was unenforceable because it was conditioned upon a final settlement of claims and counter claims which had not been accomplished; that under Russian law the nationalization decrees in question had no effect on property not factually taken into possession by the Russian Government prior to May 22, 1922; that the Russian decrees had no extraterritorial effect, according to Russian law; that if the decrees were given extraterritorial effect, they were confiscatory and their recognition would be unconstitutional and contrary to the public policy of the United States and of the State of New York; and that the United States under the Litvinov Assignment acted merely as a collection agency for the Russian Government and hence was foreclosed from asserting any title to the property in question.\n The answer was filed in March, 1938. In April, 1939 the New York Court of Appeals decided Moscow Fire Ins. Co. v. Bank of New York & Trust Co., 280 N.Y. 286, 20 N.E.2d 758. In May, 1939 respondent (but not the other defendants) moved pursuant to Rule 113 of the Rules of the New York Civil Practice Act and  476 of that Act for an order dismissing the complaint and awarding summary judgment in favor of respondent 'on the ground that there is no merit to the action and that it is insufficient in law'. The affidavit in support of the motion stated that there was 'no dispute as to the facts'; that the separate defenses to the complaint 'need not now be considered for the complaint standing alone is insufficient in law'; that the facts in the Moscow case and the instant one, so far as material, were 'parallel' and the Russian de- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 215]\n\u00a0\n crees the same; and that the Moscow case authoritatively settled the principles of law governing the instant one. The affidavit read in opposition to the motion stated that a petition for certiorari in the Moscow case was about to be filed in this Court; that the motion was premature and should be denied or decision thereon withheld pending the final decision of this Court. On June 29, 1939, the Supreme Court of New York granted the motion and dismissed the complaint 'on the merits', citing only the Moscow case in support of its action. On September 2, 1939, a petition for certiorari in the Moscow case was filed in this Court. The judgment in that case was affirmed here by an equally divided Court. United States v. Moscow Fire Ins. Co., \n309 \nU.S. 624\n, 60 S.Ct. 725. Subsequently the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York affirmed, without opinion, the order of dismissal in the instant case. The Court of Appeals affirmed with a per curiam opinion (284 N.Y. 555, 32 N.E. 2d 552) which after noting that the decision below was 'in accord with the decision' in the Moscow case stated:\n'Three of the judges of this court concurred in a forceful opinion dissenting from the court's decision in that case, but the decision left open no question which has been argued upon this appeal. We are agreed that without again considering such questions this court should, in determining title to assets of First Russian Insurance Company, deposited in this State, apply in this case the same rules of law which the court applied in the earlier case in determining title to the assets of Moscow Fire Insurance Company deposited here.'\n\n We granted the petition for certiorari because of the nature and public importance of the questions raised. \n313 \nU.S. 553\n, 61 S.Ct. 960\n\n\n First. Respondent insists that the complaint in this action was identical in substance and sought the same relief as the petition of the United States in the Moscow case, and that his answer set up the same defenses as were suc- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 216]\n\u00a0\n cessfully sustained against the United States by the defendants in that case. He also maintains that both parties agreed on the motion for summary judgment that the decision in the Moscow case governed this cause, leaving no issues to be tried. We agree with those contentions. It is in accord not only with the motion papers but also with the ruling of the New York Court of Appeals that the Moscow case 'left open no question which has been argued upon this appeal.' In view of that ruling we are not free to inquire, as petitioner suggests, into the propriety under New York practice of grounding the motion for summary judgment on the record in the Moscow case. That is distinctly a question of state law on which New York has the last word.\n But it does not follow, as respondent urges, that the writ should be dismissed as improvidently granted. The Moscow case is not res judicata since respondent was not a party to that suit. Stone v. Farmers' Bank of Kentucky, \n174 \nU.S. 409\n, 19 S.Ct. 880; Rudd v. Cornell, 171 N.Y. 114, 127, 128, 63 N.E. 823; St. John v. Fowler, 229 N.Y. 270, 274, 128 N.E. 199. Nor was our affirmance of the judgment in that case by an equally divided court an authoritative precedent. While it was conclusive and binding upon the parties as respects that controversy (Durant v. Essex Co., 7 Wall. 107), the lack of an agreement by a majority of the Court on the principles of law involved prevents it from being an authoritative determination for other cases. Hertz v. Woodman, \n218 \nU.S. 205, 213\n, 214 S., 30 S.Ct. 621, 622, 623.\n The upshot of the matter is that we now reach the issues in the Moscow case insofar as they are embraced in the pleadings in this case. And there is no reason why we cannot take judicial notice of the record in this Court of the Moscow case. Bienville Water Supply Co. v. Mobile, \n186 \nU.S. 212, 217\n, 22 S.Ct. 820, 822; Dimmick v. Tompkins, \n194 \nU.S. 540, 548\n, 24 S.Ct. 780, 781; Freshman v. Atkins, \n269 \nU.S. 121, 124\n, 46 S.Ct. 41, 42. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 217]\n\u00a0\n Second: The New York Court of Appeals held in the Moscow case that the Russian decrees2 in question had no extraterritorial effect. If that is true, it is decisive of the present controversy. For the United States acquired under the Litvinov Assignment only such rights as Russia had. Guaranty Trust Co. v. United States, \n304 \nU.S. 126, 143\n, 58 S.Ct. 785, 793. If the Russian decrees left the New York assets of the Russian insurance companies unaffected, then Russia had nothing here to assign. But that question of foreign law is not to be determined exclusively by the state court. The claim of the United States based on the Litvinov Assignment raises a federal question. United States v. Belmont, \n301 \nU.S. 324\n, 57 S.Ct. 758. This Court will review or independently determine all questions on which a federal right is necessarily dependent. United States v. Ansonia Brass & \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 218]\n\u00a0\n Copper Co., \n218 \nU.S. 452, 462\n, 463 S., 471, 31 S.Ct. 49, 50, 51, 54; Ancient Egyptian Order v. Michaux, \n279 \nU.S. 737, 744\n, 745 S., 49 S.Ct. 485, 488; Broad River Power Co. v. South Carolina, \n281 \nU.S. 537, 540\n, 50 S.Ct. 401, 402; Pierre v. Louisiana, \n306 \nU.S. 354, 358\n, 59 S.Ct. 536, 538. Here title obtained under the Litvinov Assignment depends on a correct interpretation of Russian law. As in cases arising under the full faith and credit clause (Huntington v. Attrill, \n146 \nU.S. 657, 684\n, 13 S.Ct. 224, 234; Adam v. Saenger, \n303 \nU.S. 59, 64\n, 58 S.Ct. 454, 457), these questions of foreign law on which the asserted federal right is based are not peculiarly within the cognizance of the local courts. While deference will be given to the determination of the state court, its conclusion is not accepted as final.\n We do not stop to review all the evidence in the voluminous record of the Moscow case bearing on the question of the extraterritorial effect of the Russian decrees of nationalization, except to note that the expert testimony tendered by the United States gave great credence to its position. Subsequent to the hearings in that case, however, the United States, through diplomatic channels, requested the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Government to obtain an official declaration by the Commissariat for Justice of the R.S.F.S.R. which would make clear, as a matter of Russian law, the intended effect of the Russian decree3 nationalizing insurance companies \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 219]\n\u00a0\n upon the funds of such companies outside of Russia. The official declaration, dated November 28, 1837, reads as follows:\n'The People's Commissariat for Justice of the R.S.F.S.R. certifies that by virtue of the laws of the organs of the Soviet Government all nationalized funds and property of \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 220]\n\u00a0\n former private enterprises and companies, in particular, by virtue of the decree of November 28, 1918 (Collection of Laws of the R.S.F.S.R., 1918, No. 86, Article 904), the funds and property of former insurance companies, constitute the property of the State, irrespective of the nature of the property, and irrespective of whether it was situated within the territorial limits of the R.S.F.S.R. or abroad.'\n\n The referee in the Moscow case found, and the evidence supported his finding, that the Commissariat for Justice has power to interpret existing Russian law. That being true this official declaration is conclusive so far as the intended extraterritorial effect of the Russian decree is concerned. This official declaration was before the court below though it was not a part of the record. It was tendered pursuant to  391 of the New York Civil Practice Act as amended by L.1933, c. 690.4 In New York it would seem that foreign law must be found by the court (or in case of a jury trial, binding instructions must be \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 221]\n\u00a0\n given), though procedural considerations require it to be presented as a question of fact. Fitzpatrick v. International Railway Co., 252 N.Y. 127, 169 N.E. 112, 68 A.L.R. 801; Petrogradsky M. K. Bank v. National City Bank, 253 N.Y. 23, 170 N.E. 479. And under  391, as amended, it is clear that the New York appellate court has authority to consider appropriate decisions interpreting foreign law even though they are rendered subsequent to the trial. Los Angeles Investment Securities Corp. v. Joslyn, 282 N.Y. 438, 26 N.E.2d 968. We can take such notice of the foreign law as the New York court could have taken. \n5\n Adam v. Saenger, supra. We conclude that this official declaration of Russian law was not only properly before the court on appeal but also that it was embraced within those 'written authorities' which  391 authorizes the court to consider even though not introduced in evidence on the trial. For while it was not 'printed', it would seem to be 'other written law' of unquestioned authenticity and authority within the meaning of  391.\n We hold that so far as its intended effect6 is concerned the Russian decree embraced the New York assets of the First Russian Insurance Co.\n Third: The question of whether the decree should be given extraterritorial effect is of course a distinct matter. One primary issue raised in that connection is whether under our constitutional system New York law can be allowed to stand in the way.\n The decision of the New York Court of Appeals in the Moscow case is unequivocal. It held that 'under the law of this State such confiscatory decrees do not affect the property claimed here' (280 N.Y. page 314, 20 N. E.2d page 769); \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 222]\n\u00a0\n that the property of the New York branch acquired a 'character of its own' which was 'dependent' on the law of New York (page 310 of 280 N.Y., page 767 of 20 N.E.2d); that no 'rule of comity and no act of the United States government constrains this State to abandon any part of its control or to share it with a foreign State' (page 310 of 280 N.Y., page 767 of 20 N.E. 2d); that although the Russian decree effected the death of the parent company, the situs of the property of the New York branch was in New York; and that no principle of law forces New York to forsake the method of distribution authorized in the earlier appeal (People, by Beha, v. First Russian Ins. Co., 255 N.Y. 415, 175 N.E. 114) and to hold that 'the method which in 1931 conformed to the exactions of justice and equity must be rejected because retroactively it has become unlawful' (page 312 of 280 N. Y., page 768 of 20 N.E.2d).\n It is one thing to hold as was done in Guaranty Trust Co. v. United States, supra, 304 U.S. page 142, 58 S.Ct. page 793, that under the Litvinov Assignment the United States did not acquire 'a right free of a pre-existing infirmity' such as the running of the statute of limitations against the Russian Government, its assignor. Unlike the problem presented here and in the Moscow case, that holding in no way sanctions the asserted power of New York to deny enforcement of a claim under the Litvinov Assignment because of an overriding policy of the State which denies validity in New York of the Russian decrees on which the assigned claims rest. That power was denied New York in United States v. Belmont, supra. With one qualification to be noted, the Belmont case is determinative of the present controversy.\n That case involved the right of the United States under the Litvinov Assignment to recover from a custodian or stakeholder in New York funds which had been nationalized and appropriated by the Russian decrees.\n This Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Sutherland, held that the conduct of foreign relations is committed by the Constitution to the political departments of the Fed- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 223]\n\u00a0\n eral Government; that the propriety of the exercise of that power is not open to judicial inquiry; and that recognition of a foreign sovereign conclusively binds the courts and 'is retroactive and validates all actions and conduct of the government so recognized from the commencement of its existence.' Page 328 of 301 U.S., page 760 of 57 S.Ct.. It further held (page 330 of 301 U.S., page 760 of 57 S.Ct.) that recognition of the Soviet Government, the establishment of diplomatic relations with it, and the Litvinov Assignment were 'all parts of one transaction, resulting in an international compact between the two governments.' After stating that 'in respect of what was done here, the Executive had authority to speak as the sole organ' of the national government, it added (page 330 of 301 U.S., page 761 of 57 S.Ct.): 'The assignment and the agreements in connection therewith did not, as in the case of treaties, as that term is used in the treaty making clause of the Constitution (Art. 2,  2), require the advice and consent of the Senate.' It held (page 331 of 301 U.S., page 761 of 57 S.Ct.) that the 'external powers of the United States are to be exercised without regard to state laws or policies. The supremacy of a treaty in this respect has been recognized from the beginning.' And it added that 'all international compacts and agreements' are to be treated with similar dignity for the reason that 'complete power over international affairs is in the national government and is not and cannot be subject to any curtailment or interference on the part of the several states.' Page 331 of 301 U.S., page 761 of 57 S.Ct.. This Court did not stop to inquire whether in fact there was any policy of New York which enforcement of the Litvinov Assignment would infringe since 'no state policy can prevail against the international compact here involved.' Page 327 of 301 U.S., page 759 of 57 S.Ct..\n The New York Court of Appeals in the Moscow case, 280 N.Y. 309, 20 N. E.2d 758 distinguished the Belmont case on the ground that it was decided on the sufficiency of the pleadings, the demurrer to the complaint admitting that under the Russian decree the property was confiscated by the Russian Government and then trans- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 224]\n\u00a0\n ferred to the United States under the Litvinov Assignment. But, as we have seen, the Russian decree in question was intended to have an extraterritorial effect and to embrace funds of the kind which are here involved. Nor can there be any serious doubt that claims of the kind here in question were included in the Litvinov Assignment. \n7\n It is broad and inclusive. It should be inter- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 225]\n\u00a0\n preted consonantly with the purpose of the compact to eliminate all possible sources of friction between these two great nations. See Tucker v. Alexandroff, \n183 \nU.S. 424, 437\n, 22 S.Ct. 195, 200; Jordan v. K. Tashiro, \n278 \nU.S. 123, 127\n, 49 S.Ct. 47, 48. Strict construction would run counter to that national policy. For, as we shall see, the existence of unpaid claims against Russia and its nationals which were held in this country and which the Litvinov Assignment was intended to secure, had long been one impediment to resumption of friendly relations between these two great powers. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 226]\n\u00a0\n The holding in the Belmont case is therefore determinative of the present controversy unless the stake of the foreign creditors in this liquidation proceeding and the provision which New York has provided for their protection call for a different result.\n Fourth: The Belmont case forecloses any relief to the Russian corporation. For this Court held in that case (301 U.S. at page 332, 57 S. Ct. at page 761): '... our Constitution, laws, and policies have no extraterritorial operation, unless in respect of our own citizens. ... What another country has done in the way of taking over property of its nationals, and especially of its corporations, is not a matter for judicial consideration here. Such nationals must look to their own government for any redress to which they may be entitled.'\n But it is urged that different considerations apply in case of the foreign creditors8 to whom the New York Court of Appeals (People, by Beha, v. First Russian Ins. Co., 255 N.Y. 415, 175 N.E. 114) ordered distribution of these funds. The argument is that their rights in these funds have vested by virtue of the New York decree; that to deprive them of the property would violate the Fifth Amendment which extends its protection to aliens as well as to citizens; and that the Litvinov Assignment cannot deprive New York of its power to administer the balance of the fund in accordance with its laws for the benefit of these creditors.\n At the outset it should be noted that, so far as appears, all creditors whose claims arose out of dealings with the New York branch have been paid. Thus we are not faced with the question whether New York's policy of protecting \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 227]\n\u00a0\n the so-called local creditors by giving them priority in the assets deposited with the State (Matter of People by Stoddard, 242 N.Y. 148, 158, 159, 151 N.E. 159, 45 A.L.R. 622) should be recognized within the rule of Clark v. Williard, \n294 \nU.S. 211\n, 55 S.Ct. 356, 98 A.L.R. 347, or should yield to the Federal policy expressed in the international compact or agreement. Santovincenzo v. Egan, \n284 \nU.S. 30, 40\n, 52 S.Ct. 81, 84; United States v. Belmont, supra. We intimate no opinion on that question. The contest here is between the United States and creditors of the Russian corporation who, we assume, are not citizens of this country and whose claims did not arise out of transactions with the New York branch. The United States is seeking to protect not only claims which it holds but also claims of its nationals. H.Rep. No. 865, 76th Cong ., 1st Sess. Such claims did not arise out of transactions with this Russian corporation; they are, however, claims against Russia or its nationals. The existence of such claims and their non-payment had for years been one of the barriers to recognition of the Soviet regime by the Executive Department. Graham, Russian-American Relations, 1917-1933: An Interpretation, 28 Am.Pol.Sc.Rev. 387; 1 Hackworth, Digest of International Law (1940) pp. 302-304. The purpose of the discussions leading to the policy of recognition was to resolve 'all questions outstanding' between the two nations. Establishment of Diplomatic Relations with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Dept. of State, Eastern European Series, No. 1 (1933), p. 1. Settlement of all American claims against Russia was one method of removing some of the prior objections to recognition based on the Soviet policy of nationalization. The Litvinov Assignment was not only part and parcel of the new policy of recognition (id., p. 13); it was also the method adopted by the Executive Department for alleviating in this country the rigors of nationalization. Congress tacitly recognized that policy. Acting in anticipation of the realization of funds under the Litvinov \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 228]\n\u00a0\n Assignment (H.Rep. No. 865, 76th Cong., 1st Sess.) it authorized the appointment of a Commissioner to determine the claims of American nationals against the Soviet Government. Joint Resolution of August 4, 1939, 53 Stat. 1199.\n If the President had the power to determine the policy which was to govern the question of recognition, then the Fifth Amendment does not stand in the way of giving full force and effect to the Litvinov Assignment. To be sure, aliens as well as citizens are entitled to the protection of the Fifth Amendment. Russian Volunteer Fleet v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 481\n, 51 S.Ct. 229. A State is not precluded, however, by the Fourteenth Amendment from according priority to local creditors as against creditors who are nationals of foreign countries and whose claims arose abroad. Disconto Gesellschaft v. Umbreit, \n208 \nU.S. 570\n, 28 S.Ct. 337. By the same token, the Federal Government is not barred by the Fifth Amendment from securing for itself and our nationals priority against such creditors. And it matters not that the procedure adopted by the Federal Government is globular and involves a regrouping of assets. There is no Constitutional reason why this Government need act as the collection agent for nationals of other countries when it takes steps to protect itself or its own nationals on external debts. There is no reason why it may not through such devices as the Litvinov Assignment make itself and its nationals whole from assets here before it permits such assets to go abroad in satisfaction of claims of aliens made elsewhere and not incurred in connection with business conducted in this country. The fact that New York has marshaled the claims of the foreign creditors here involved and authorized their payment does not give them immunity from that general rule.\n If the priority had been accorded American claims by treaty with Russia, there would be no doubt as to its validity. Cf. Santovincenzo v. Egan, supra. The same result \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 229]\n\u00a0\n obtains here. The powers of the President in the conduct of foreign relations included the power, without consent of the Senate, to determine the public policy of the United States with respect to the Russian nationalization decrees. 'What government is to be regarded here as representative of a foreign sovereign state is a political rather than a judicial question, and is to be determined by the political department of the government.' Guaranty Trust Co. v. United States, supra, 304 U.S. page 137, 58 S.Ct. page 791. That authority is not limited to a determination of the government to be recognized. It includes the power to determine the policy which is to govern the question of recognition. Objections to the underlying policy as well as objections to recognition are to be addressed to the political department and not to the courts. See Guaranty Trust Co. v. United States, supra, 304 U.S. page 138, 58 S.Ct. page 791; Kennett v. Chambers, 14 How. 38, 50, 51. As we have noted, this Court in the Belmont case recognized that the Litvinov Assignment was an international compact which did not require the participation of the Senate. It stated (301 U.S. pages 330, 331, 57 S.Ct. pages 760, 761): 'There are many such compacts, of which a protocol, a modus vivendi, a postal convention, and agreements like that now under consideration are illustrations.' And see Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, \n292 \nU.S. 313, 331\n, 54 S.Ct. 745, 751; United States v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., \n299 \nU.S. 304, 318\n, 57 S.Ct. 216, 220. Recognition is not always absolute; it is sometimes conditional. 1 Moore, International Law Digest (1906), pp. 73-74; 1 Hackworth, Digest of International Law (1940), pp. 192-195. Power to remove such obstacles to full recognition as settlement of claims of our nationals (Levitan, Executive Agreements, 35 Ill.L.Rev. 365, 382-385) certainly is a modest implied power of the President who is the 'sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations.' United States v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., supra, 299 U.S. page 320, 57 S.Ct. page 221. Effectiveness in handling the delicate problems of foreign relations requires no less. Unless \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 230]\n\u00a0\n such a power exists, the power of recognition might be thwarted or seriously diluted. No such obstacle can be placed in the way of rehabilitation of relations between this country and another nation, unless the historic conception of the powers and responsibilities of the President in the conduct of foreign affairs (see Moore, Treaties and Executive Agreements, 20 Pol.Sc.Q. 385, 403-417) is to be drastically revised. It was the judgment of the political department that full recognition of the Soviet Government required the settlement of all outstanding problems including the claims of our nationals. Recognition and the Litvinov Assignment were interdependent. We would usurp the executive function if we held that that decision was not final and conclusive in the courts.\n'All constitutional acts of power, whether in the executive or in the judicial department, have as much legal validity and obligation as if they proceeded from the legislature; ....' The Federalist, No. 64. A treaty is a 'Law of the Land' under the supremacy clause, Art. VI, Cl. 2, of the Constitution. Such international compacts and agreements as the Litvinov Assignment have a similar dignity. United States v. Belmont, supra, 301 U. S. page 331, 57 S.Ct. page 761. See Corwin, The President, Office & Powers (1940), pp. 228-240.\n\n It is of course true that even treaties with foreign nations will be carefully construed so as not to derogate from the authority and jurisdiction of the States of this nation unless clearly necessary to effectuate the national policy. Guaranty Trust Co. v. United States, supra, 304 U.S. page 143, 58 S.Ct. page 793, and cases cited. For example in Todok v. Union State Bank, \n281 \nU.S. 449\n, 50 S.Ct. 363, this Court took pains in its construction of a treaty, relating to the power of an alien to dispose of property in this country, not to invalidate the provisions of state law governing such dispositions. Frequently the obligation of a treaty will be dependent on state law. Prevost v. Greneaux, 19 How. 1. But state \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 231]\n\u00a0\n law must yield when it is inconsistent with or impairs the policy or provisions of a treaty or of an international compact or agreement. See Nielsen v. Johnson, \n279 \nU.S. 47\n, 49 S.Ct. 223. Then the power of a State to refuse enforcement of rights based on foreign law which runs counter to the public policy of the forum (Griffin v. McCoach, \n313 \nU.S. 498, 506\n, 61 S.Ct. 1023, 1027, 134 A.L.R. 1462) must give way before the superior Federal policy evidenced by a treaty or international compact or agreement. Santovincenzo v. Egan, supra; United States v. Belmont, supra.\n Enforcement of New York's policy as formulated by the Moscow case would collide with and subtract from the Federal policy, whether it was premised on the absense of extraterritorial effect of the Russian decrees, the conception of the New York branch as a distinct juristic personality, or disapproval by New York of the Russian program a nationalization. \n9\n For the Moscow case refuses to give effect or recognition in New York to acts of the Soviet Government which the United States by its policy of recognition agreed no longer to question. Enforcement of such state policies would indeed tend to restore some of the precise impediments to friendly relations which the President intended to remove on inauguration of the policy of recognition of the Soviet Government. In the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 232]\n\u00a0\n first place, such action by New York, no matter what gloss be given it, amounts to official disapproval or non-recognition of the nationalization program of the Soviet Government. That disapproval or non-recognition is in the face of a disavowal by the United States of any official concern with that program. It is in the face of the underlying policy adopted by the United States when it recognized the Soviet Government. In the second place, to the extent that the action of the State in refusing enforcement of the Litvinov Assignment results in reduction or non-payment of claims of our nationals, it helps keep alive one source of friction which the policy of recognition intended to remove. Thus the action of New York tends to restore some of the precise irritants which had long affected the relations between these two great nations and which the policy of recognition was designed to eliminate.\n We recently stated in Hines v. Davidowitz, \n312 \nU.S. 52, 68\n, 61 S.Ct. 399, 404, that the field which affects international relations is 'the one aspect of our government that from the first has been most generally conceded imperatively to demand broad national authority'; and that any state power which may exist 'is restricted to the narrowest of limits'. There we were dealing with the question as to whether a state statute regulating aliens survived a similar federal statute. We held that it did not. Here we are dealing with an exclusive federal function. If state laws and policies did not yield before the exercise of the external powers of the United States, then our foreign policy might be thwarted. These are delicate matters. If state action could defeat or alter our foreign policy, serious consequences might ensue. The nation as a whole would be held to answer if a State created difficulties with a foreign power. Cf. Chy Lung v. Freeman, \n92 \nU.S. 275, 279\n, 280 S.. Certainly the conditions for 'enduring friendship' between the nations, which the policy of recognition in this instance was de- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 233]\n\u00a0\n signed to effectuate, 10 are not likely to flourish where contrary to national policy a lingering atmosphere of hostility is created by state action.\n Such considerations underly the principle of Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., \n246 \nU.S. 297, 302\n, 303 S., 38 S.Ct. 309, 310, 311, that when a revolutionary government is recognized as a de jure government, 'such recognition is retroactive in effect and validates all the actions and conduct of the government so recognized from the commencement of its existence.' They also explain the rule expressed in Underhill v. Hernandez, \n168 \nU.S. 250, 252\n, 18 S.Ct. 83, 84, that 'the courts of one country will not sit in judgment on the acts of the government of another done within its own territory.'\n The action of New York in this case amounts in substance to a rejection of a part of the policy underlying recognition by this nation of Soviet Russia. Such power is not accorded a State in our constitutional system. To permit it would be to sanction a dangerous invasion of Federal authority. For it would 'imperil the amicable relations between governments and vex the peace of nations.' Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., supra, 246 U.S. page 304, 38 S.Ct. page 311. It would tend to disturb that equilibrium in our foreign relations which the political departments of our national government had diligently endeavored to establish.\n We repeat that there are limitations on the sovereignty of the States. No State can rewrite our foreign policy to conform to its own domestic policies. Power over external affairs is not shared by the States; it is vested in the national government exclusively. It need not be so exercised as to conform to state laws or state policies whether they be expressed in constitutions, statutes, or judicial decrees. And the policies of the States become wholly irrelevant to judicial inquiry, when the United States, act- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 234]\n\u00a0\n ing within its constitutional sphere, seeks enforcement of its foreign policy in the courts. For such reasons, Mr. Justice Sutherland stated in United States v. Belmont, supra, 301 U.S. page 331, 57 S.Ct. page 761, 'In respect of all international negotiations and compacts, and in respect of our foreign relations generally, state lines disappear. As to such purposes the state of New York does not exist.'\n We hold that the right to the funds or property in question became vested in the Soviet Government as the successor to the First Russian Insurance Co.; that this right has passed to the United States under the Litvinov Assignment; and that the United States is entitled to the property as against the corporation and the foreign creditors.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Supreme Court of New York for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice REED and Mr. Justice JACKSON did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER.\n The nature of the controversy makes it appropriate to add a few observations to my Brother DOUGLAS' opinion.\n Legal ideas like other organisms cannot survive severance from their congenial environment. Concepts like 'situs' and 'jurisdiction' and 'comity' summarize views evolved by the judicial process, in the absence of controlling legislation, for the settlement of domestic issues. To utilize such concepts for the solution of controversies international in nature, even though they are presented to the courts in the form of a private litigation, is to invoke a narrow and inadmissible frame of reference.\n The expropriation decrees of the U.S.S.R. gave rise to extensive litigation among various classes of claimants to \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 235]\n\u00a0\n funds belonging to Russian companies doing business or keeping accounts abroad. England and New York were the most active centers of this litigation. The opinions in the many cases before their courts constitute a sizeable library. They all derive from a single theme-the effect of the Russian expropriation decrees upon particular claims, in some cases before and in some cases after recognition of the U.S.S.R., either de jure or de facto. One cannot read this body of judicial opinions, in the Divisional Court, the Court of Appeals and the House of Lords, in the New York Supreme Court, the Appellate Division, and the Court of Appeals, and not be left with the conviction that they are the product largely of casuistry, confusion, and indecision. See Jaffe, Judicial Aspects of Foreign Relations, passim. The difficulties were inherent in the problems that confronted the courts. They were due to what Chief Judge Cardozo called 'the hazards and embarrassments growing out of the confiscatory decrees of the Russian Soviet Republic', Matter of People, by Beha, v. Russian Reinsurance Co., 255 N.Y. 415, 420, 175 N.E. 114, 115, and to the endeavor to adjust these 'hazards and embarrassments' to 'the largest considerations of public policy and justice', James & Co. v. Second Russian Insurance Co., 239 N.Y. 248, 256, 146 N.E. 369, 370, 37 A.L.R. 720, when private claims to funds covered by the expropriation decrees were before the courts, particularly at a time when non-recognition was our national policy.\n The opinion show both the English and the New York courts struggling to deal with these business consequences of major international complications through the application of traditional judicial concepts. 'Situs', 'jurisdiction', 'comity', 'domestication' and 'dissolution' of corporations, and other legal ideas that often enough in litigation of a purely domestic nature prove their limitations as instruments for solution or even as means for analysis, were pressed into service for adjudicating claims \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 236]\n\u00a0\n whose international implications could not be sterilized. This accounts for the divergence of views among the judges and for such contradictory and confusing rulings as the series of New York cases, from Wulfsohn v. Soviet Republic, 234 N.Y. 372, 138 N.E. 24, to the ruling now under review, Moscow Fire Ins. Co. v. Bank of New York & Trust Co., 280 N.Y. 286, 20 N.E. 2d 758, accounts for Russian Commercial and Industrial Bank v. Comptoir d'Escompte de Mulhouse, (1925) A.C. 112, compared with Lazard Brothers & Co. v. Midland Bank, (1933) A.C. 289, and for the fantastic result of the decision in Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. State of Russia, 2 Cir., 21 F.2d 396, in which the Kerensky re gime was, in accordance with diplomatic determination, treated as the existing Russian government a decade after its extenction.\n Courts could hardly escape perplexities when citizens asserted claims to Russian funds within the control of the forum. But a totally different situation was presented when all claims of local creditors were satisfied and only the conflicting claims of Russia and of former Russian creditors were involved. In the particular circumstances of Russian insurance companies doing business in New York, the State Superintendent of Insurance took possession of the assets of the Russian branches in New York to conserve them for the benefit of those entitled to them. Liquidation followed, domestic creditors and policy holders were paid, and the Superintendent found a large surplus on his hands. As statutory liquidator, the Superintendent of Insurance took the ground that 'in view of the hazards and uncertainties of the Russian situation, the surplus should not be paid to any one, but should be left in his hands indefinitely, until a government recognized by the United States shall function in the territory of what was once the Russian Empire.' People, by Beha, v. Russian Reinsurance Co., 255 N.Y. 415, 421, 175 N.E. 114, 115. So the Appellate Division decreed. Matter of People, by Beha, 229 App.Div. 637, 243 N.Y.S. 35. But the Court of Appeals \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 237]\n\u00a0\n reversed and the scramble among the foreign claimants was allowed to proceed. People, by Beha, v. Russian Reinsurance Co., 255 N.Y. 415, 175 N. E. 114. The Court of Appeals held that the retention of the surplus funds in the custody of the Superintendent of Insurance until the international relations between the United States and Russia had been formalized 'did not solve the problem. It adjourned it sine die.' But adjournment, it may be suggested, is sometimes a constructive interim solution to avoid a temporizing and premature measure giving rise to new difficulties. Such I believe to have been the mischief that was bound to follow the rejection of the Superintendent's policy of conservation of the surplus Russian funds until recognition. Their disposition was inescapably entangled in recognition.\n In the immediate case the United States sues, in effect, as the assignee of the Russian government for claims by that government against the Russian Insurance Company for monies in deposit in New York to which no American citizen makes claim. No manner of speech can change the central fact that here are monies which belonged to a Russian company and for which the Russian government has decreed payment to itself.\n And so the question is whether New York can bar Russia from realizing on its decrees against these funds in New York after formal recognition by the United States of Russia and in light of the circumstances that led up to recognition and the exchange of notes that attended it. For New York to deny the effectiveness of these Russian decrees under such circumstances would be to oppose, at least in some respects, its notions as to the effect which should be accorded recognition as against that entertained by the national authority for conducting our foreign affairs. And the result is the same whether New York accomplishes it because its courts invoke judicial views regarding the enforcement of foreign expropriation decrees, or regarding the survival in New York of a Russian \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 238]\n\u00a0\n business which according to Russian law had ceased to exist, or regarding the power of New York courts over funds of Russian companies owing from New York creditors. If this Court is not bound by the construction which the New York Court of Appeals places upon complicated transactions in New York in determining whether they come within the protection of the Constitution against impairing the obligations of contract, we certainly should not be bound by that court's construction of transactions so entangled in international significance as the status of New York branches of Russian companies and the disposition of their assets. Compare Appleby v. City of New York, \n271 \nU.S. 364\n, 46 S.Ct. 569 and Irving Trust Company v. Day, \n314 \nU.S. 566\n, 62 S.Ct. 398, 86 L.Ed. --. When the decision of a question of fact or of local law is so interwoven with the decision of a question of national authority that the one necessarily involves the other, we are not foreclosed by the state court's determination of the facts or of the local law. Otherwise national authority could be frustrated by local rulings. See Creswill v. Knights of pythias, \n225 \nU.S. 246\n, 32 S.Ct. 822; Davis v. Wechsler, \n263 \nU.S. 22\n, 44 S.Ct. 13.\n It is not consonant with the sturdy conduct of our foreign relations that the effect of Russian decrees upon Russian funds in this country should depend on such gossamer distinctions as those by which courts have determined that Russian branches survive the death of their Russian origin. When courts deal with such essentially political phenomena as the taking over of Russian businesses by the Russian government by resorting to the forms and phrases of conventional corporation law, they inevitably fall into a dialectic quagmire. With commendable candor, the House of Lords frankly confessed as much when it practically overruled Russian Commercial and Industrial Bank v. Comptoir d'Escompete de Mulhouse, supra, saying through Lord Wright, 'the whole matter has now to be reconsidered in the light of new evidence and of the historical evolution \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 239]\n\u00a0\n of ten years.' Lazard Brothers & Co. v. Midland Bank, (1933) A.C. 289, 300.\n For we are not dealing here with physical property-whether chattels or realty. We are dealing with intangible rights, with choses in action. The fact that these claims were reduced to money does not change the character of the claims and certainly is too tenuous a thread on which to determine issues affecting the relation between nations. Corporeal property may give rise to rules of law which, we have held, even in purely domestic controversies ought not to be transferred to the adjudication of impalpable claims such as are here in controversy. Curry v. McCanless, \n307 \nU.S. 357\n, 363 et seq., 59 S.Ct. 900, 903, 123 A.L.R. 162.\n As between the states, due regard for their respective governmental acts is written into the Constitution by the Full Faith and Credit Clause, Art. IV,  1. But the scope of its operation-when may the policy of one state deny the consequences of a transaction authorized by the laws of another-has given rise to a long history of judicial subtleties which hardly commend themselves for transfer to the solution of analogous problems between friendly nations. See Huntington v. Attrill, \n146 \nU.S. 657\n, 13 S.Ct. 224; Finney v. Guy, \n189 \nU.S. 335\n, 23 S.Ct. 558; Milwaukee County v. M. E. White Co., \n296 \nU.S. 268\n, 56 S.Ct. 229; Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm., \n306 \nU.S. 493, 502\n, 59 S.Ct. 629, 633; Pink v. A.A.A. Highway Express, \n314 \nU.S. 201\n, 62 S.Ct. 241, 86 L.Ed. --, 137 A.L.R. 957.\n For more than fifteen years formal relations between the United States and Russia were broken because of serious differences between the two countries regarding the consequences to us of two major Russian policies. This complicated process of friction, abstention from friendly relations, efforts at accommodation, and negotiations for removing the causes of friction are summarized by the delusively simple concept of 'non- recognition'. The history of Russo-American relations leaves no room for doubt that the two underlying sources of difficulty were \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 240]\n\u00a0\n Russian propaganda and expropriation. Had any state court during this period given comfort to the Russian views in this contest between its government and ours, it would, to that extent, have interfered with the conduct of our foreign relations by the Executive even if it had purported to do so under the guise of enforcing state law in a matter of local policy. On the contrary, during this period of non-recognition New York denied Russia access to her courts and did so on the single and conclusive ground: 'We should do nothing to thwart the policy which the United States has adopted.' Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic v. Cibrario, 235 N.Y. 255, 263, 139 N.E. 259, 262. Similarly, no invocation of a local rule governing 'situs' or the survival of a domesticated corporation, however applicable in an ordinary case, is within the competence of a state court if it would thwart to any extent 'the policy which the United States has adopted' when the President reestablished friendly relations in 1933.\n And it would be thwarted if the judgment below were allowed to stand.\n That the President's control of foreign relations includes the settlement of claims is indisputable. Thus, referring to the adhesion of the United States to the Dawes Plan, Secretary of State Hughes reported 'that this agreement was negotiated under the long-recognized authority of the President of the United States to arrange for the payment of claims in favor of the United States and its nationals. The exercise of this authority has many illustrations, one of which is the Agreement of 1901 for the so-called Boxer Indemnity.' (Secretary Hughes to President Coolidge, February 3, 1925, MS., Department of State, quoted in 5 Hackworth, Digest of Int. Law, c. 16,  514.) The President's power to negotiate such a settlement is the same whether it is an isolated transaction between this country and a friendly nation, or is part of a complicated negotiation to restore normal relations, as was the case with Russia. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 241]\n\u00a0\n That the power to establish such normal relations with a foreign country belongs to the President is equally indisputable. Recognition of a foreign country is not a theoretical problem or an exercise in abstract symbolism. It is the assertion of national power directed towards safeguarding and promoting our interests and those of civilization. Recognition of a revoluntionary government normally involves the removal of areas of friction. As often as not, areas of friction are removed by the adjustment of claims pressed by this country on behalf of its nationals against a new re gime.\n Such a settlement was made by the President when this country resumed normal relations with Russia. The two chief barriers to renewed friendship with Russia-intrusive propaganda and the effects of expropriation decrees upon our nationals-were at the core of our negotiations in 1933, as they had been for a good many years. The exchanges between the President and Ambassador Litvinov must be read not in isolation but as the culmination of difficulties and dealings extending over fifteen years. And they must be read not as self-contained technical documents, like a marine insurance contract or a bill of lading, but as characteristically delicate and elusive expressions of diplomacy. The draftsmen of such notes must save sensibilities and avoid the explicitness on which diplomatic negotiations so easily founder.\n The controlling history of the Soviet re gime and of this country's relations with it must be read between the lines of the Roosevelt-Litvinov Agreement. One needs to be no expert in Russian law to know that the expropriation decrees intended to sweep the assets of Russian companies taken over by that government into Russia's control no matter where those assets were credited. Equally clear is it that the assignment by Russia meant to give the United States as part of the comprehensive settlement everything that Russia claimed under its laws against \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 242]\n\u00a0\n Russians. It does violence to the course of negotiations between the United States and Russia and to the scope of the final adjustment to assume that a settlement thus made on behalf of the United States-to settle both money claims and to soothe feelings-was to be qualified by the variant notions of the courts of the forty-eight states regarding 'situs' or 'jurisdiction' over intangibles or the survival of extinct Russian corporations. In our dealings with the outside world the United States speaks with one voice and acts as one, unembarrassed by the complications as to domestic issues which are inherent in the distribution of political power between the national government and the individual states.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE, dissenting.\n I think the judgment should be affirmed.\n As my brethren are content to rest their decision on the authority of the dictum in United States v. Belmont, \n301 \nU.S. 324\n, 57 S.Ct. 758, without the aid of any pertinent decision of this Court, I think a word should be said of the authority and reasoning of the Belmont case and of the principles which I think are controlling here.\n In the Belmont case the United States brought suit in the federal court to recover a debt alleged to be due upon a deposit account of a Russian national with a New York banker. The complaint set up the confiscation of the account by decrees of the Soviet Government and the transfer of the debt to the United States by the Litvinov assignment, concurrently with our diplomatic recognition of that Government. It was not alleged, nor did it appear, that the New York courts had, subsequent to recognition, refused to give effect to the Soviet decrees as operating to transfer the title of Russian nationals to property located in New York. No such national or any adverse claimant was a party to the suit. In sustaining the complaint against demurrer this Court said (page 332 of 301 U.S., page 762 of 57 S.Ct.): 'In so holding, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 243]\n\u00a0\n we deal only with the case as now presented and with the parties now before us. We do not consider the status of adverse claims, if there be any, of others not parties to this action. And nothing we have said is to be construed as foreclosing the assertion of any such claim to the fund involved, by intervention or other appropriate proceeding. We decide only that the complaint alleges facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the respondents.'\n The questions thus explicitly reserved are presented by the case now before us. The courts of New York, in the exercise of the constitutional authority ordinarily possessed by state courts to declare the rules of law applicable to property located within their territorial limits, have refused to recognize the Soviet decrees as depriving creditors and other claimants representing the interests of the insurance company of their rights under New York law. Numerous individual creditors and other claimants, and the New York Superintendent of Insurance, who represents all claimants, are parties to the present suit and assert their claims to the exclusion of the United States.\n It is true that this Court, in the Belmont case, indulged in some remarks as to the effect on New York law of our diplomatic recognition of the Soviet Government and of the assignment of all its claims against American nationals to the United States. Upon the basis of these observations it thought that the New York courts were bound to recognize and apply the Soviet decrees to property which was located in New York when the decrees were promulgated. But all this was predicated upon the mistaken assumption that by disregarding the decrees the New York courts would be giving an extraterritorial effect to New York law. These observations were irrelevant to the decision there announced and, for reasons shortly to be given, I think plainly inapplicable here. They were but obiter dicta which, so far as they have not been discredited by \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 244]\n\u00a0\n our decision in Guaranty Trust Co. v. United States, \n304 \nU.S. 126\n, 58 S.Ct. 785, and so far as they now merit it 'may be respected, but ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit, when the very point is presented for decision.' Chief Justice Marshall in Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399; Mr. Justice Sutherland in Williams v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 553, 568\n, 53 S.Ct. 751, 755.\n We have no concern here with the wisdom of the rules of law which the New York courts have adopted in this case or their consonance with the most enlightened principles of jurisprudence. State questions do not become federal questions because they are difficult or because we may think that the state courts have given wrong answers to them. The only questions before us are whether New York has constitutional authority to adopt its own rules of law defining rights in property located in the state, and if so whether that authority has been curtailed by the exercise of a superior federal power by recognition of the Soviet Government and acceptance of its assignment to the United States of claims against American nationals, including the New York property.\n I shall state my grounds for thinking that the pronouncements in the Belmont case, on which the Court relies for the answer to these questions, are without the support of reason or accepted principles of law. No one doubts that the Soviet decrees are the acts of the government of the Russian state which is sovereign in its own territory, and that in consequence of our recognition of that government they will be so treated by our State Department. As such, when they affect property which was located in Russia at the time of their promulgation, they are subject to inquiry if at all only through our State Department and not in our courts. Underhill v. Hernandez, \n168 \nU.S. 250\n, 18 S.Ct. 83; Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., \n246 \nU.S. 297\n, 38 S.Ct. 309; Ricaud v. American Metal Co., \n246 \nU.S. 304\n, 308-310, 38 S.Ct. 312, 313, 314; Salimoff & Co. v. Standard Oil Co., 262 N.Y. 220, \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 245]\n\u00a0\n 186 N.E. 679, 89 A.L.R. 345. But the property to which the New York judgment relates has at all relevant times been in New York in the custody of the Superintendent of Insurance as security for the policies of the insurance company, and is now in the Superintendent's custody as Liquidator acting under the direction of the New York cours. United States v. Bank of New York & Trust Co., \n296 \nU.S. 463, 478\n, 479 S., 56 S.Ct. 343, 347, 348. In administering and distributing the property thus within their control, the New York courts are free to apply their own rules of law including their own doctrines of conflict of laws, see Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64, 78\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 822, 114 A.L.R. 1487; Griffin v. McCoach, \n313 \nU.S. 498\n, 61 S.Ct. 1023, 134 A.L.R. 1462; Kryger v. Wilson, \n242 \nU.S. 171, 176\n, 37 S.Ct. 34, 35, except insofar as they are subject to the requirements of the full faith and credit clause-a clause applicable only to the judgments and public acts of states of the Union and not those of foreign states. Aetna Life Insurance Co. v. Tremblay, \n223 \nU.S. 185\n, 32 S.Ct. 309; cf. Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 13 Pet. 519, 589, 590; Bond v. Hume, \n243 \nU.S. 15, 21\n, 22 S., 37 S.Ct. 366, 368.\n This Court has repeatedly decided that the extent to which a state court will follow the rules of law of a recognized foreign country in preference to its own is wholly a matter of comity, and that in the absence of relevant treaty obligations the application in the courts of a state of its own rules of law rather than those of a foreign country raises no federal question. Rose v. Himely, 4 Cranch 241; Harrison v. Sterry, 5 Cranch 289; United States v. Crosby, 7 Cranch 115; Oakey v. Bennett, 11 How. 33, 43-46; Hilton v. Guyot, \n159 \nU.S. 113, 165\n, 166 S., 16 S.Ct. 139, 144; Disconto Gesellschaft v. Umbreit, \n208 \nU.S. 570\n, 28 S.Ct. 337; cf. Baglin v. Cusenier Co., \n221 \nU.S. 580\n, 594-597, 31 S.Ct. 669, 672, 673; United States v. Guaranty Trust Co., \n293 \nU.S. 340\n, 345-347, 55 S.Ct. 221, 95 A.L.R. 651. This is equally the case when a state of the Union refuses to apply the law of a sister state, if there is no question of full faith and credit, Kryger v. Wilson, supra; Finney v. Guy, \n189 \nU.S. 335, 340\n, 346 S., 23 S.Ct. 558, 562; Alropa Corp. v. Kirchwehm, \n313 \nU.S. 549\n, 61 S.Ct. 1120; see Milwaukee County \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 246]\n\u00a0\n v. M. E. White Co., \n296 \nU.S. 268, 272\n, 273 S., 56 S.Ct. 229, 231, 232, or due process, Home Ins. Co. v. Dick, \n281 \nU.S. 397\n, 50 S.Ct. 338, 74 A.L.R. 701. So clearly was this thought to be an appropriate exercise of the power of a forum over property within its territorial jurisdiction that this Court, in Ingenohl v. Walter E. Olsen & Co., \n273 \nU.S. 541, 544\n, 545 S., 47 S.Ct. 451, 452, accepted as beyond all doubt the right of the British courts in Hong Kong to refuse recognition to the American alien property custodian's transfer of exclusive rights to the use of a trademark in Hong Kong, and the Court gave effect here to the Hong Kong judgment.\n In the application of this doctrine this Court has often held that a state following its own law and policy may refuse to give effect to a transfer made elsewhere of property which is within its own territorial limits. Green v. Van Buskirk, 5 Wall. 307, 311, 312; Hervey v. Rhode Island Locomotive Works, \n93 \nU.S. 664\n; Security Trust Co. v. Dodd, Mead & Co., \n173 \nU.S. 624\n, 19 S.Ct. 545; Clark v. Williard, \n292 \nU.S. 112, 122\n, 54 S.Ct. 615, 619; Clark v. Williard, \n294 \nU.S. 211\n, 55 S.Ct. 356, 98 A.L.R. 347. So far is a state free in this respect that the full faith and credit clause does not preclude the attachment by local creditors of the property within the state of a foreign corporation, all of whose property has been previously transferred in the state of its incorporation to a statutory successor for the benefit of creditors. Clark v. Williard, supra; Fischer v. American United Life Ins. Co., \n314 \nU.S. 549\n, 62 S.Ct. 380, 86 L.Ed. --, decided this term. Due process under the Fifth Amendment, the benefits of which extend to alien friends as well as to citizens, Russian Volunteer Fleet v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 481\n, 51 S.Ct. 229, does not call for any different conclusion. Disconto Gesellschaft v. Umbreit, supra, 208 U.S. pages 579, 580, 28 S.Ct. pages 339, 340.\n At least since 1797, Barclay v. Russell, 3 Vesey, Jr., 424, 428, 433, the English courts have consistently held that foreign confiscatory decrees do not operate to transfer title to property located in England even if the decrees were so intended, whether the foreign government has or has not been recognized by the British Government. Lecouturier \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 247]\n\u00a0\n v. Rey, (1910) A.C. 262, 265. Cf. also Folliott v. Ogden, 1 H.Black. 123, 135-36, affirmed 3 T.R. 726, affirmed, 4 Brown's Cases in Parl., 111; and Wolff v. Oxholm, 6 M. & S. 92, both of which may have carried the doctrine of non-recognition of foreign confiscatory decrees even further. See Holdsworth, The History of Acts of State in English Law, 41 Columbia L.Rev. 1313, 1325-26. The English courts have applied this rule in litigation arising out of the Russian decrees, holding that they are not effectual to transfer title to property situated in Great Britain. Sedgwick Collins & Co. v. Rossia Insurance Co., (1926) 1 K.B. 1, 15, affirmed, (1927) A.C. 95; The Jupiter (No. 3), (1927) P. 122, 144-46, affirmed, (1927) P. 250, 253- 55; In re Russian Bank for Foreign Trade, (1933) 1 Ch. 745, 767-68. The same doctrine has prevailed in the case of the Spanish confiscatory decrees, Banco de Vizcaya v. Don Alfonso, (1935) 1 K.B. 140, 144-45, as well as with respect to seizures by the American alien property custodian. Sutherland v. Administrator of German Property, (1934) 1 K.B. 423; and see the decision of the British court for Hong Kong discussed in Ingenohl v. Walter E. Olsen & Co., supra, and the Privy Council's decision in Ingenohl v. Wing On & Co., 44 Patents Journal 343, 359, 360. In no case in which there was occasion to decide the question has recognition been thought to have subordinated the law of the forum, with respect to property situated within its territorial jurisdiction to that of the recognized state. Never has the forum's refusal to follow foreign transfers of title to such property been considered inconsistent with the most friendly relations with the recognized foreign government, or even with an active military alliance at the time of the transfer.\n It is plain that under New York law the claimants in this case, both creditors and those asserting rights of the insurance company, have enforcible rights with respect to the property located there which have been recognized \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 248]\n\u00a0\n though not created by the judgments of its courts. The conclusion is inescapable that had there been no assignment and this suit had been maintained by the Soviet Government subsequent to recognition, or by a private individual claiming under an assignment from it, the decision of the New York court would have presented no question reviewable here.\n The only question remaining is whether the circumstances in the present case that the Russian decrees preceded recognition and that the assignment was to the United States, which here appears in the role of plaintiff, call for any different result. If they do, then recognition and the assignment have operated to give to the United States rights which its assignor did not have. They have compelled the state to surrender its own rules of law applicable to property within its limits, and to substitute rules of Russian law for them. A potency would thus be attributed to the recognition and assignment which is lacking to the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution. See Clark v. Williard, supra; Fischer v. American United Life Ins. Co., supra.\n In deciding any federal question involved, it can make no difference to us whether New York has chosen to express its public policy by statute or merely by the common law determinations of its courts. Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, supra; Skiriotes v. Florida, \n313 \nU.S. 69, 79\n, 61 S.Ct. 924, 930; Hebert v. Louisiana, \n272 \nU.S. 312, 316\n, 47 S.Ct. 103, 104, 48 A.L.R. 1102. The state court's repeated declaration of a policy of treating the New York branch of the insurance company as a 'complete and separate organization' would permit satisfaction of whatever claims of foreign creditors, as well as those of sister states, that New York deems provable against the local fund. But if my brethren are correct in concluding that all foreign creditors must be deprived of access to the fund, it would seem to follow-since the Soviet decrees have exempted no class of creditors-that the rights of \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 249]\n\u00a0\n creditors in New York or in sister states, or any other rights in the property recognized by New York law, must equally be ousted by virtue of the extraterritorial effect given to the decrees by the present decision. For statutory priorities of New York policyholders or New York lienholders, and the common law priorities and system of distribution which the judgment below endeavored to effectuate and preserve intact, must alike yield to the superior force said to have been imparted to the Soviet decrees by the recognition and assignment. Nothing in the Litvinov assignment or in the negotiations for recognition suggests an intention to impose upon the states discriminations between New York and other creditors which would sustain the former's liens while obliterating those of the latter. If the Litvinov assignment overrides state policies which protect foreign creditors, it can hardly be thought to do less to domestic creditors, whether of New York or a sister state.\n I assume for present purposes that these sweeping alterations of the rights of states and of persons could be achieved by treaty or even executive agreement, although we are referred to no authority which would sustain such an exercise of power as is said to have been exerted here by mere assignment unratified by the Senate. It is true that in according recognition and in establishing friendly relations with a foreign country this Government speaks for all the forty-eight states. But it was never true that recognition alters the substantive law of any state or prescribes uniform state law for the nationals of the recognized country. On the contrary it does not even secure for them equality of treatment in the several states or equal treatment with citizens in any state save as the Constitution demands it. Patsone v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 138\n, 34 S. Ct. 281; Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197\n, 44 S.Ct. 15; State of Ohio ex rel. Clarke v. Deckebach, \n274 \nU.S. 392\n, 47 S. Ct. 630 and cases cited. Those are ends which can be achieved only by the assumption of some \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 250]\n\u00a0\n form of obligation expressed or fairly to be inferred from its words.\n Recognition, like treaty making, is a political act and both may be upon terms and conditions. But that fact no more forecloses this Court, where it is called upon to adjudicate private rights, from inquiry as to what those terms and conditions are than it precludes, in like circumstances, a court's ascertaining the true scope and meaning of a treaty. Of course the national power may by appropriate constitutional means override the power of states and the rights of individuals. But without collision between them there is no such loss of power or impairment of rights, and it cannot be known whether state law and private rights collide with political acts expressed in treaties or executive agreements until their respective boundaries are defined.\n It would seem therefore that in deciding this case some inquiry should have been made to ascertain what public policy or binding rule of conduct with respect to state power and individual rights has been proclaimed by the recognition of the Soviet Government and the assignment of its claims to the United States. The mere act of recognition and the bare transfer of the claims of the Soviet Government to the United States can of themselves hardly be taken to have any such effect, and they can be regarded as intended to do so only if that purpose is made evident by their terms, read in the light of diplomatic exchanges between the two countries and of the surrounding circumstances. Even when courts deal with the language of diplomacy, some foundation must be laid for inferring an obligation where previously there was none, and some expression must be found in the conduct of foreign relations which fairly indicates an intention to assume it. Otherwise courts rather than the executive may shape and define foreign policy which the executive has not adopted. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 251]\n\u00a0\n We are not pointed to anything on the face of the documents or in the diplomatic correspondence which even suggests that the United States was to be placed in a better position with respect to the claim which it now asserts, than was the Soviet Government and nationals. Nor is there any intimation in them that recognition was to give to prior public acts of the Soviet Government any greater extraterritorial effect than attaches to such acts occurring after recognition-acts which by the common understanding of English and American courts are ordinarily deemed to be without extraterritorial force, and which in any event have never before been considered to restrict the power of the states to apply their own rules of law to foreign owned property within their territory. As we decided in Guaranty Trust Co. v. United States, supra, 304 U.S. page 143, 58 S.Ct. page 794, and as the opinion of the Court now appears to concede, there is nothing in any of the relevant documents 'to suggest that the United States was to acquire or exert any greater rights than its transferor or that the President by mere executive action purported or intended to alter or diminish the rights of the (New York) debtor with respect to any assigned claims, or that the United States, as assignee, is to do more than the Soviet Government could have done after diplomatic recognition-that is, collect the claims in conformity to local law'.\n Recognition opens our courts to the recognized government and its nationals, see Guaranty Trust Co. v. United States, supra, 304 U.S. page 140, 58 S.Ct. page 792. It accepts the acts of that Government within its own territory as the acts of the sovereign, including its acts as a de facto government before recognition, see Underhill v. Hernandez, supra; Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., supra; Ricaud v. American Metal Co., supra. But until now recognition of a foreign government by this Government has never been thought to serve as a full faith and \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 252]\n\u00a0\n credit clause compelling obedience here to the laws and public acts of the recognized government with respect to property and transactions in this country. One could as well argue that by the Soviet Government's recognition of our own government, which accompanied the transactions now under consideration, it had undertaken to apply in Russia the New York law applicable to Russian Property in New York. Cf. Ingenohl v. Walter E. Olsen & Co., supra; Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm ., \n306 \nU.S. 493, 501\n, 502 S., 59 S.Ct. 629, 632, 633.\n In Guaranty Trust Co. v. United States, supra, this Court unanimously rejected the contention that the recognition of the Soviet Government operated to curtail or impair rights derived from the application of state laws and policy within the state's own territory. It was argued by the Government that recognition operated retroactively for the period of the de facto government to set aside rights acquired in the United States in consequence of this government's prior recognition of the Russian Provisional Government. This argument we said, page 140 of 304 U.S., page 792 of 58 S.Ct., 'ignores the distinction between the effect of our recognition of a foreign government with respect to its acts within its own territory prior to recognition, and the effect upon previous transactions consummated here between its predecessor and our own nationals. The one operates only to validate to a limited extent acts of a de facto government which, by virtue of the recognition, has become a government de jure. But it does not follow that recognition renders of no effect transactions here with a prior recognized government in conformity to the declared policy of our own Government.' Even though the two governments might have stipulated for alteration by this Government of its municipal law, and the consequent surrender of the rights of individuals, the substance of the Court's decision was that such an abdication of domestic law and policy is not a necessary or customary incident \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 253]\n\u00a0\n of recognition or fairly to be inferred from it. No more can recognition be said to imply a deprivation of the constitutional rights of states of the Union, and of individuals arising out of their laws and policy, which are binding on the Federal Government except as the act of recognition is accompanied by some affirmative exercise of federal power which purports to set them aside.\n Nor can I find in the surrounding circumstances or in the history of the diplomatic relations of the two countries any basis for saying that there was any policy of either to give a different or larger effect to recognition and the assignment than would ordinarily attach to them. It is significant that the account of the negotiations published by the State Department (Establishment of Diplomatic Relations with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Eastern European Series No. 1), and the report of subsequent negotiations for adjustment of the claims of the two countries submitted to Congress by the Secretary of State (H.Rep. No. 865, 76th Cong ., 1st Sess.) give no intimation of such a policy. Even the diplomatic correspondence between the two countries of January 7, 1937, to which the opinion of the Court refers, and which occurred long after the United States had entered the Moscow Fire Insurance Company litigation, merely repeated the language of the assignment without suggesting that its purpose had been to override applicable state law.\n That the assignment after recognition had wide scope for application without reading into it any attempt to set aside our local laws and rights accruing under them is evident. It was not limited in its application to property alleged to be confiscated under the Soviet decrees. Included in the assignment by its terms were all 'amounts admitted to be due or that may be found to be due it (the Soviet Government), as the successor of prior Governments of Russia, or otherwise, from American nationals'. It included claims of the prior governments of \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 254]\n\u00a0\n Russia, not arising out of confiscatory decrees, and also claims like that of the Russian Volunteer Fleet, growing out of our own expropriation during the war of the property of Russian nationals. The assignment was far from an idle ceremony if treated as transferring only the rights which it purports to assign. Large sums of money have already been collected under it and other amounts are in process of collection without overturning the law of the states where the claims have been asserted. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n At the time of the assignment it was not known what position the courts of this country would take with respect to property here, claimed to have been confiscated by the Soviet decrees. But it must have been known to the two governments that the English courts, notwithstanding British recognition of the Soviet government, had refused to apply the Soviet decrees as affecting property located in England. Sedgwick Collins & Co. v. Rossia Insurance Co. supra; The Jupiter (No. 3), supra; In re Russian Bank for Foreign Trade, supra. It must also have been known that the similar views expressed by the New York courts before recognition with respect to property situated in New York raised at least a strong possibility that mere recognition would not alter the result in that state. Sokoloff v. National City Bank, 239 N.Y. 158, 167-169, 145 N.E. 917, 37 A. L.R. 712; James & Co. v. Second Russian Ins. Co., 239 N.Y. 248, 257, 146 N. E. 369, 37 A.L.R. 720; Joint Stock Co. v. National City Bank, 240 N.Y. 368, 148 N.E. 552; Petrogradsky M.K. Bank v. National City Bank, 253 N.Y. 23, 29, 170 N.E. 479. The assignment plainly contemplated that this, like every other question affecting liability, was to be litigated in the courts of this country, since the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 255]\n\u00a0\n assignment only purported to assign amounts admitted to be due or 'that may be found to be due.' It was only in the courts where the debtor or the property was located that the amounts assigned would normally be 'found to be due'. Cf. United States v. Bank of New York, supra.\n By transferring claims of every kind, against American nationals, to the United States and leaving to it their collection, the parties necessarily remitted to the courts of this country the determination of the amounts due upon this Government's undertaking to report the amounts collected as 'preparatory to a final settlement of the claims and counterclaims' asserted by the two governments. They thus ended the necessity of diplomatic discussion of the validity of the claims, and so removed a probable source of friction between the two countries. In all this I can find no hint that the rules of decision in American courts were not to be those afforded by the law customarily applied in those courts. But if it was the purpose of either government to override local law and policy of the states and to prescribe a different rule of decision from that hitherto recognized by any court, it would seem to have been both natural and needful to have expressed it in some form of undertaking indicating such an intention. The only obligation to be found in the assignment and its acknowledgment by the President is that of the United States, already mentioned, to report the amounts collected. This can hardly be said to be an undertaking to strike down valid defenses to the assigned claims. Treaties, to say nothing of executive agreements and assignments which are mere transfers of rights, have hitherto been construed not to override state law or policy unless it is reasonably evident from their language that such was the intention. Guaranty Trust Co. v. United States, supra, 304 U.S. page 143, 58 S.Ct. page 793; Todok v. Union State Bank, \n281 \nU.S. 449, 454\n, 50 S.Ct. 363, 365; Rocca v. Thompson, \n223 \nU.S. 317\n, 329-334, 32 S.Ct. 207, 209, 211; Disconto \n\n[315 \nU.S. 203, 256]\n\u00a0\n Gesellschaft v. Umbreit, supra, 208 U.S. page 582, 28 S.Ct. page 341; Pearl Assur. Co. v. Harrington, D.C., 38 F.Supp. 411, 413, 414, affirmed, \n313 \nU.S. 549\n, 61 S.Ct. 1120; Patsone v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 138, 145\n, 146 S., 34 S.Ct. 281, 282, 283; cf. Liverpool Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 10 Wall. 566, 568, 576, 577. The practical consequences of the present decision would seem to be, in every case of recognition of a foreign government, to foist upon the executive the responsibility for subordinating domestic to foreign law in conflicts cases, whether intended or not, unless such a purpose is affirmatively disclaimed.\n Under our dual system of government there are many circumstances in which the legislative and executive branches of the national government may, by affirmative action expressing its policy, enlarge the exercise of federal authority and thus diminish the power which otherwise might be exercised by the states. It is indispensable to the orderly administration of the system that such alteration of powers and the consequent impairment of state and private rights should not turn on conceptions of policy which, if ever entertained by the only branch of the government authorized to adopt it, has been left unexpressed. It is not for this Court to adopt policy, the making of which has been by the Constitution committed to other branches of the government. It is not its function to supply a policy where none has been declared or defined and none can be inferred.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Establishment of Diplomatic Relations with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Dept. of State, Eastern European Series, No. 1 (1933) for the various documents pertaining to recognition. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The three decrees on which the United States placed primary emphasis (apart from the one set forth in note 3, infra) were described in the findings of the referee in the Moscow case as follows:\n'88. The decree of November 18, 1919 on the annulment of life insurance contracts abolished insurance of life in all its forms in the Republic and annulled all contracts with insurance companies and savings banks with respect to the insurance of life, capital and income.\n\n'89. The decree of the Soviet of People's Commissars dated March 4, 1919, on the liquidation of obligations of State enterprises, provided that stock certificates and shares of joint stock companies, whose enterprises have been either nationalized or sequestered, are annulled and are provided that such enterprises are free from the payment of all debts to private persons and enterprises which have arisen prior to the nationalization of these enterprises, including payments on bond loans with the exception only of wages due to workers and employees.\n\n'90. The decree of the Soviet of People's Commissars dated June 28, 1918 provides in Article I that the commercial and industrial enterprises enumerated therein, which are located within the boundaries of the Soviet Republic, together with all their capital and property, regardless of what the latter may consist, are declared the property of the Republic.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Relevant portions of the Insurance Decree dated November 28, 1918, translated in accordance with the findings of the referee in the Moscow case, are:\n'603. On the organization of the insurance business in the Russian Republic.\n\n'(1) Insurance in all its forms, such as: fire insurance, insurance of shipments, life insurance, accident insurance, hail insurance, livestock insurance, insurance against failure of crops, etc. is hereby proclaimed as a State monopoly.\n\n'Note. Mutual insurance of movable goods and merchandise by the cooperative organizations is conducted on a special basis.\n\n'(2) All private insurance companies and organizations (stock and share holding, also mutual) upon issuance of this decree are subject to liquidation; former rural* (People's Soviet) and municipal mutual insurance organizations operating within the boundaries of the Russian Republic are hereby proclaimed the property of the Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic. \n\n[\nFootnote *\n] 'zemskie.'\n\n'(3) For the immediate organization of the insurance business and for the liquidation of parts of insurance institutions, which have become the property of the Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic, a Commission is established under the Supreme Soviet of National Econmy, consisting of representatives of the Supreme Soviet of National Economy, the People's Commissariats of Commerce and Industry, Interior Affairs, the Commissar of Insurance and Fire Prevention, Finances, Labor, and State Control, and of Soviet Insurance Organizations (People's Soviet and Municipal Mutual).\n\n'Note. The same Commission is charged with the liquidating of private insurance organizations, all property and assets of which, remaining on hand after their liquidation, shall become the property of the Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic.\n\n'(4) The above-mentioned reorganization and liquidation of existing insurance organizations and institutions shall be accomplished not later than the first day of April 1919.\n\n'(8) The present decree comes into force on the day of its publication.'\n\n The referee in the Moscow case found that upon publication of this decree all Russian insurance companies were prohibited from engaging in the insurance business in Russia; that they became subject to liquidation and were dissolved; that all of their assets in Russia became the property of the State; that on publication of the decree, the directors of the companies lost all power to act as directors or conservators of the property or to represent the companies in any way; and that the Russian Government became the statutory successor and domiciliary liquidator of companies whose property was nationalized. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] That section reads:\n'A printed copy of a statute, or other written law, of another state, or of a territory, or of a foreign country, or a printed copy of a proclamation, edict, decree or ordinance, by the executive power thereof, contained in a book or publication purporting or proved to have been published by the authority thereof, or proved to be commonly admitted as evidence of the existing law in the judicial tribunals thereof, is presumptive evidence of the statute, law, proclamation, edict, decree or ordinance. The unwritten or common law of another state, or of a territory, or of a foreign country, may be proved as a fact by oral evidence. The books of reports of cases adjudged in the courts thereof must also be admitted as presumptive evidence of the unwritten or common law thereof. The law of such state or territory or foreign country is to be determined by the court or referee and included in the findings of the court or referee or charged to the jury, as the caes may be. Such finding or charge is subject to review on appeal. In determining such law, neither the trial court nor any appellate court shall be limited to the evidence produced on the trial by the parties, but may consult any of the written authorities above named in this section, with the same force and effect as if the same had been admitted in evidence.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Hence the denial of the motion of the United States to certify the official declaration as part of the record of the Moscow case in this Court (Moscow Fire Ins. Co. v. Bank of New York & Trust Co., 281 N.Y. 818, 24 N.E.2d 487) would seem immaterial to our right to consult it. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] See also note 7, infra. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] A clarification of the Litvinov Assignment was made in an exchange of letters between the American Charge d'Affairs and the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs on January 7, 1937. The letter of the former read:\n'I have the honor to inform you that it is the understanding of the Government of the United States that the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics considers that by and upon the formation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the adoption of the Constitution of 1923 of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics acquired the right to dispose of the property, rights, or interests therein located abroad of all corporations and companies which had therefore been nationalized by decrees of the constituent republics or their predecessors.\n\n'The Government of the United States further understands that it was the purpose and intention of the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to assign to the Government of the United States, among other amounts, all the amounts admitted to be due or that may be found to be due not only the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics but also the constituent republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or their predecessors from American nationals, including corporations, companies, partnerships, or associations, and also the claim against the United States of the Russian Volunteer Fleet, in litigation in the United States Court of Claims, and that the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics did release and assign all such amounts to the Government of the United States by virtue of the note addressed by you to the President of the United States on November 16, 1933.\n\n'Will you be good enough to confirm the understanding which the Government of the United States has in this matter, concerning the law of the Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic, the Constitution and laws of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the intention and purpose of the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in the above- mentioned assignment?'\n\n The reply of the People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs was:\n'In reply to your note of January 7, 1937, I have the honor to inform you that the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics considers that by and upon the formation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the adoption of the Constitution of 1923 of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics acquired the right to dispose of the property, rights, or interests therein located abroad of all corporations and companies which had theretofore been nationalized by decrees of the constituent republics or their predecessors. \n\n'You are further informed that it was the purpose and intention of the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to assign to the Government of the United States, among other amounts, all the amounts admitted to be due or that may be found to be due not only the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics but also the constituent republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or their predecessors from American nationals, including corporations, companies, partnerships, or associations, and also the claim against the United States of the Russian Volunteer Fleet, in litigation in the United States Court of Claims, and that the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics did release and assign all such amounts to the Government of the United States by virtue of the note addressed by me to the President of the United States on November 16, 1933.\n\n'I have the honor, therefore, to confirm the understanding, as expressed in your note of January 7, 1937, which the Government of the United States has in this matter, concerning the law of the Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic, the Constitution and laws of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the intention and purpose of the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in the above- mentioned assignment.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] In view of the disposition which we make of this case, we express no view on whether these creditors would be barred from asserting their claims here by virtue of the ruling in Canada Southern Ry. Co. v. Gebhard, \n109 \nU.S. 527, 538\n, 3 S.Ct. 363, 370, that 'anything done at the legal home of the corporation, under the authority of such laws, which discharges it from liability there, discharges it everywhere.' \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] In this connection it should be noted that  977-b of the New York Civil Practice Act provides for the appointment of a receiver to liquidate local assets of a foreign corporation where, inter alia, it has been dissolved, liquidated, or nationalized. Subdivision 19 of that section provides in part: '... such liquidation, dissolution, nationalization, expiration of its existence, or repeal, suspension, revocation or annulment of its charter or organic law in the country of its domicile, or any confiscatory law or decree thereof, shall not be deemed to have any extra-territorial effect or validity as to the property, tangible or intangible debts, demands or choses in action of such corporation within the state or any debts or obligations owing to such corporation from persons, firms or corporations residing, sojourning or doing business in the state.' \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Establishment of Diplomatic Relations with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, supra note 1, p. 20. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] By June 30, 1938, the sums collected by virtue of the Litvinov assignment amounted to $1,706,443.

Gen., and Mr. Valentine Brookes, of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n Mr. R. Aubrey Bogley, of Washington, D.C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We granted certiorari to review a judgment against the United States by the Court of Claims, 95 Ct.Cl. 84, interpreting a widely used standard form construction contract in a manner alleged to be in conflict with this Court's interpretation of an analogous contract in H. E. Crook Co., Inc., v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 4\n, 46 S.Ct. 184.\n Respondent agreed to install plumbing. heating, and electrical equipment in a Veterans' Home to be erected at Togus, Maine, while another contractor was to do the general work of preparing the site and constructing the building. Respondent agreed, for a stipulated price, to begin work upon notice to proceed and to finish by the time the work had been completed by the principal contractor. If respondent failed to complete the work within the time thus set, the government was entitled to terminate the contract or to require the payment of liquidated damages. The length of time allowed the principal contractor under his contract, subject to certain qualifications discussed below, was 250 days, and it was into this schedule that respondent was to coordinate his own activity. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 61, 63]\n\u00a0\n The government gave notice to the general contractor to begin work on May 9, 1932. On May 12, respondent was notified to begin and early in June its superintendent arrived in Maine with tools and equipment. Upon his arrival he found that the general contractor had been stopped by the government because of the unexpected discovery of an unsuitable soil condition. It became necessary to change the site of the building and to alter the specifications, and because of the delay attendant upon preparing a new foundation, respondent was unable to begin work until October. As a consequence, overhead expenses accumulated during the period of delay, and much of the work which respondent's employees otherwise would have done either during warm weather or after the building was enclosed was done outside in cold weather.\n Because of the delay and pursuant to the adjustment clauses of the contract the government extended the time of performance by respondent and because of structural changes, it re-adjusted the amount due. It increased payments to the principal contractor, reduced the payment to respondent by about $1,000 because of construction economies under the new plans, and waived any claim to liquidated damages for the period of the extension. The hospital was completed some months after it would have been finished had it not been for the change of plan.\n The respondent was paid the full amount agreed on for the work it did. It then sued for about $25,000 for damages alleged to have been suffered due to delay for which the government was responsible. The Court of Claims held the government was liable for damages resulting solely from delay, but found that $13,600 of the alleged loss was due to respondent's own faulty estimate and financial conditions, and that $3,000 of it was caused by respondent's and the principal contractor's delays. Respondent sought no review of denial of this part of its \n\n[317 \nU.S. 61, 64]\n\u00a0\n claim. However, the court concluded that the balance claimed, $9,349, arose from overhead costs during the summer of 1932 when the new foundation was being prepared and from a decrease in labor effectiveness resulting because much of the work had to be done outside in cold weather. The judgment rendered under this conclusion is what we have before us.\n The chief issues of the case are whether the delay in commencing the construction was a breach of contract by the government; whether, regardless of the answer to that question, respondent was entitled to an equitable adjustment for damages resulting from the delay, in addition to the extension of time already granted; and whether respondent is barred from any recovery because he failed to appeal certain decisions affecting his contract to the chief officer of the department. Under the view we take of the first two of these questions, it is unnecessary to answer the third.\n I. The government contends, as it did in the Crook case, supra, that the change in specifications resulting in delay was not a breach of the contract, but in accordance with its terms; that the extent of its obligation for permitted changes was fixed by the contract; and that for delay the government was required to do no more than grant an extension of time. Put another way, the government concedes that if an alteration of plan required respondent to use an extra 50 tons of steel, the government would be liable for the value of the steel and the cost of installation; but it argues that under the terms of this contract an extension of time should be accepted as full equitable adjustment for all damages caused by the fact that the work was done at the later period made necessary by the permitted change. Essentially it repeats the doctrine of Chouteau v. United States, \n95 \nU.S. 61\n, 68: 'For the reasonable cost and expenses of the changes made in the construction, payment was to be made; but for any in- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 61, 65]\n\u00a0\n crease in the cost of the work not changed, no provision was made.'\n We agree with this view. We do not think the terms of the contract bound the government to have the contemplated structure ready for respondent at a fixed time. Provisions of the contract showed that the dates were tentative and subject to modification by the government. The contractor was absolved from payment of prescribed liquidated damages for delay, if it resulted from a number of causes, including 'acts of Government' and 'unusually severe weather.' The government reserved the right to make changes which might interrupt the work, and even to suspend any portion of the construction if it were deemed necessary. Respondent was required to adjust its work to that of the general contractor, so that delay by the general contractor would necessarily delay respondent's work. Under these circumstances it seems appropriate to repeat what was said in the Crook case, that 'When such a situation was displayed by the contract it was not to be expected that the Government should bind itself to a fixed time for the work to come to an end, and there is not a word in the instrument by which it did so, unless an undertaking contrary to what seems to us the implication is implied.' H. E. Crook Company, Inc., v. United States, supra, \n270 \nU.S. 6\n, 46 S.Ct. 184. Decisions of this Court prior to the Crook case also make it clear that contracts such as this do not bind the government to have the property ready for work by a contractor at a particular time. Wells Bros. Co. v. United States, \n254 \nU.S. 83, 86\n, 41 S.Ct. 34, 35; Chouteau v. United States, supra; cf. United States v. Smith, \n94 \nU.S. 214\n, 217.\n As pointed out, the delay here resulted from a change in specifications made necessary by discovery of soil unsuitable for foundation purposes. The government having reserved the right to make such changes upon discovery of 'subsurface and (or) latent conditions at the \n\n[317 \nU.S. 61, 66]\n\u00a0\n site materially differing from those shown on the drawings or indicated by the specifications', delays incident to the permitted changes cannot amount to a breach of contract. If there are right to recover damages there the government exercises its reserved power to delay, they must be found in the particular provisions fixing the rights of the parties.\n II. Two of the Judges of the Court of Claims thought consequential damages resulting from delay were recoverable under paragraphs 4 and 3 of the contract. These paragraphs1 deal with colsely related problems. Article 3, entitled 'Changes', governs the procedure under which the goverment may alter the specifications of the contract for general causes. Article 4, entitled 'Changed Conditions', governs the procedure under which the government may alter the contract to meet unanticipated physical conditions. Article 4 incorporates by reference \n\n[317 \nU.S. 61, 67]\n\u00a0\n the same machinery of adjustments as that specified in article 3. Both clauses essentially provide that if changes are made affecting an increase or decrease of cost or affecting the length of time of performance, and equitabl adjustment shall be made.\n Clearly questions of interpretation in clauses so similar should, if possible, be resolved in the same fashion in each of them. Clause 4 was added to the standard form contract since clause 3, and we therefore turn first to decisions interpreting the latter clause. The Court of Claims, relying on principles announced in the Chouteau, Wells, and Crook cases, supra, has uniformly held that the 'increase or decrease of cost' language in Sec. 3, and in similar clauses, is not broad enough to include damages for delay; that 'It was never contemplated ... that delays incident to changes would subject the Government to damage beyond that involved in the changes themselves.' Moran Bros. Co. v. United States, 61 Ct.Cl. 73, 102; and for the same view, see McCord v. United States, 9 Ct.Cl. 155, 169; Swift et al. v. United States, 14 Ct.Cl. 208, 231; Griffiths v. United States, 74 Ct.Cl. 245, 255.\n Were this a matter of first impression, we would again come to the same conclusion regarding this clause. It seems wholly reasonable that 'an increase or decrease in the amount due' should be met with an alteration of price, and that 'an increase or decrease ... in the time required' should be met with alteration of the time allowed; for 'increase or decrease of cost' plainly applies to the changes in cost due to the structural changes required by the altered specification and not to consequential damages which might flow from delay taken care of in the 'difference in time' provision. The provision as to time serves the large purpose of removing from persons in the position of respondent liability for 'delay' beyond the stipulated date for which they might otherwise have \n\n[317 \nU.S. 61, 68]\n\u00a0\n their contract terminated or might be required to pay liquidated damages without fault.\n Despite the similarity of the two clauses, a minority of the court below has in this instance concluded that they may be distinguished and that respondent is entitled to damages for delay under clause 4. In supporting this view, respondents here rely primarily on Rust Engineering Co. v. United States, 86 Ct.Cl. 461, 475, where the court below distinguishes the two clauses by saying that the type of change contemplated in clause 4 is more basic than that under clause 3, and that therefore different liabilities should attach: 'The changes made necessary by reason of the conditions encountered in excavating for the foundation of the building were not reasonable changes within the scope of the drawings and specifications as contemplated in Art. 3 of the contract, but represented important changes based upon changed conditions which were unknown and materially different from those shown on the drawings or indicated in the specifications. Such changes were, therefore, clearly not within the contemplation of either party to the contract at the time it was made. ...' And see Sobel v. United States, 88 Ct.Cl. 149, 165.\n No such strained distinction between paragraphs 3 and 4 can stand. It does not help to argue that the changes made under clause 4 'are not within the contemplation of either party', since the changes made under clause 3 are also not contemplated in advance. Both clauses deal with changes made necessary by new plans or new discoveries made subsequent to the signing of the contract. For delays incident to such unanticipated changes, the contractor was under either section to be granted a 'compensating extension of time.' Wells Bros. Co. v. United States, supra, \n254 \nU.S. 86\n, 41 S.Ct. 35. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 61, 69]\n\u00a0\n In this case there were two consequences of the discovery that the Home could not be built as originally planned. One was an alteration of specifications, which resulted in slight cut in respondent's outlay and in his compensation. The other was the delay itself and for this the time necessary to perform the contract was equitably adjusted by extension, thereby relieving respondent of liquidated damages which could otherwise have been imposed. Under the terms of the contract, it is entitled to no more.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Article 3.

STATE OF NEW YORK(1942)\nNo. 238\nArgued: February 2, 1942Decided: March 2, 1942\n\n\n\n As Amended April 13, 1942. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 510, 511]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Francis Biddle, Atty. Gen., J. Louis Monarch, of Washington, D.C., and Henry Epstein, of Albany, N.Y., for the United States.\n Mr. Wm. Gerard Ryan, of Albany, N.Y., for the State of New York.\n\n Mr. Justice BYRNES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The United States and the State of New York seek review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversing in part a District Court order for the distribution of the assets of a bankrupt estate. The Independent Automobile Forwarding Corporation was adjudicated a bankrupt on April 26, 1938. A total of $3053.20 eventually became available for distribution. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 510, 512]\n\u00a0\n This amount was insufficient even to meet those claims of the federal and state governments which were assertedly entitled to priority as taxes under  64, sub. a(4) of the Bankruptcy Act. \n1\n The federal claims of this character were for amounts due under  801 and 802 of Title VIII and under  901 of Title IX of the Social Security Act,2 and for certain taxes as to which no question is raised in this case. The state claims were for payments due its unemployment insurance fund, and for taxes not in issue here.\n The state's appeal from the District Court's first order of distribution was discontinued by agreement of the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 510, 513]\n\u00a0\n parties because the Social Security Act had been extensively amended while the appeal was pending. \n3\n A second order was thereupon entered by the District Court. The state again appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals. It contended that the share of the assets granted to the federal government was excessive for three reasons: (1) the claim based on  801 of Title VIII of the Social Security Act was a claim for a debt rather than for taxes and thus was not entitled to priority under  64, sub. a (4) of the Bankruptcy Act; (2) no more than 10% of the claim based on  901 of Title IX of the Social Security Act was entitled to allowance because the balance constituted a claim for a penalty rather than a tax and thus fell within the prohibition of s 57, sub. j of the Bankruptcy Act;4 and (3) the credit against the Title IX claim provided for in  902, 42 U.S.C.A.  1102, was incorrectly calculated. The Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the state's contention with respect to the Title VIII claim and reversed to that extent the order of the District Court, but rejected the state's arguments with respect to the claim under Title IX.\n First. The claim based on Title VIII. Section 801 bears the heading 'Income tax on employees' and provides for a tax 'upon the income of every individual' equal to 1 per centum of the wages received by him with respect to employment during 1937.5 Section 802(a) provides that this tax 'shall be collected by the employer of the taxpayer, by deducting the amount of the tax from the wages as and when paid.' The employer is made \n\n[315 \nU.S. 510, 514]\n\u00a0\n liable for the payment of the tax. By regulation, pursuant to Title VIII,6 the Treasury Department has explicitly ruled that the tax may be assessed against the employer, regardless of whether he has in fact deducted it from the employee's wages. The Circuit Court (118 F.2d 537, 539) held that the employer was liable 'only as an agent bound to pay whether its duty to collect was performed or not' and that his liability was for a debt rather than for taxes.\n As authority for this view it relied upon its decision of the same date in City of New York v. Feiring, 2 Cir., 118 F.2d 329. The city sales tax involved in that case was laid upon receipts from sales of personal property. The vendor was required to collect the amount of the tax from the vendee separately from the sales price. He was obliged to report periodically concerning his receipts from sales and to turn over to the City Comptroller the taxes due, whether or not he had actually collected them from the purchasers. If the vendor failed to collect the tax, the vendee was required to report the transaction and to pay the tax directly. Thus, the procedure contemplated was that the purchaser should bear the burden of the tax, but that the seller should collect and transmit it to the Comptroller. If the seller did not obtain it from the purchaser, however, the Comptroller was authorized to proceed to collect it from either of them. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the claim of the City against a bankrupt vendor for the amount of the sales tax outstanding was a claim for a debt and not for taxes, within the meaning of  64, sub. a(4). We reversed this decision and held that the burden imposed upon the seller by the city taxing act had 'all the characteristics of a tax entitled to priority' under  64, sub. a(4). \n313 \nU.S. 283\n, 61 S.Ct. 1028, 1030\n\n\n\n\n[315 \nU.S. 510, 515]\n\u00a0\n We think that our decision in the Feiring case is controlling here. The New York City sales tax involved in that case and the obligation imposed by  801 and 802 of Title VIII of the Social Security Act cannot be distinguished in any material respect. It was observed in the Feiring case that while the sales tax was intended to rest upon the purchaser 'in its normal operation', 'both the vendor and the vendee are made liable for payment of the tax in invitum ... and the tax may be summarily collected by distraint of the property of either the seller or the buyer.' \n313 \nU.S. 283\n, at page 287, 61 S.Ct. 1028, at page 1030. The burden of the tax provided for by  801 and 802 likewise will normally rest upon the employee, but the Commissioner of Internal Revenue may proceed to collect it from the employer whether or not he has deducted it from the wages of the employee.\n Two distinctions between the cases are urged by the State. One is that  802(a) of Title VIII provides that the tax 'shall be collected by the employer of the taxpayer' and thus reveals a Congressional intent that only a claim against the employee should be treated as one for a tax. The other asserted distinction is that Title VIII in its entirety is designed to impose two distinct taxes;  801 imposes an 'income tax' upon the employee, while  804 imposes an 'excise tax' upon the employer. \n7\n But a tax for purposes of  64, sub. a(4) includes any 'pecuniary burden laid upon individuals or property for the purpose of supporting the government,' by whatever name it may \n\n[315 \nU.S. 510, 516]\n\u00a0\n be called. State of New Jersey v. Anderson, \n203 \nU.S. 483, 492\n, 27 S.Ct. 137, 140. Although he may not be referred to in  801 and 802 as the taxpayer, and although he may also be subject to the 'excise tax' prescribed by  804, the plain fact is that the employer is liable for the  801 tax whether or not he has collected it from his employees. We therefore hold that the Title VIII claim of the United States against the estate of this bankrupt employer is entitled to the priority afforded by  64, sub. a(4).\n Second. The claim under Title IX. Section 901 imposes upon this employer, in addition to the obligations discussed above, an 'excise tax' equal to 2 per centum of the total wages payable by him during 1937. Section 902, however, permits him to credit 'against the tax imposed by  901 (section 1101 of this chapter)' the amount of his 1937 contributions to the State unemployment fund, but provides that the total credit 'shall not exceed 90 per centum of the tax against which it is credited.'\n\n\n (a)\n The State contends that  902(a) in effect exacts a penalty, equal to 90% of the amount of the tax levied by  901, from an employer who fails to make the payments to the State unemployment fund required by state law. Since  57, sub. j of the Bankruptcy Act provides that claims by the United States for penalties are not allowable,8 it argues, only 10% of the tax imposed by  901 is actually a tax for purposes of  64, sub. a ( 4) of the Bankruptcy Act. There is no merit to this contention. While the issue here is cast in somewhat different terms, it is similar in outline to that raised by the constitutional objection to the Act which was set to rest in Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, \n301 \nU.S. 548\n, 57 S.Ct. 883, 109 A.L.R. 1293. There it was argued that the 90% credit provisions amounted to coercion of the States which was repugnant to the Tenth Amendment and to the federal system. The Court recognized that the effect of the scheme was to encourage the States to \n\n[315 \nU.S. 510, 517]\n\u00a0\n establish and maintain unemployment insurance funds and thus to cooperate with the federal government in meeting a common problem. It observed that 'every rebate from a tax when conditioned upon conduct is in some measure a temptation' but it concluded that 'to hold that motive or temptation is equivalent to coercion is to plunge the law in endless difficulties', and to accept 'a philosophical determinism by which choice becomes impossible.' 301 U.S. at pages 589, 590, 57 S.Ct. at page 892, 109 A.L.R. 1293. These considerations are equally pertinent to the suggestion that the 90% rebate arrangement constitutes the imposition of a 'penalty' within the meaning of  57, sub. j upon an employer who fails or refuses to contribute to a state fund. The amount of the tax assessable under  901 is definite and fixed, once the single variable, the total of the wages paid during the year, is determined. Although the employer is free to obtain a credit against it by contributing to his state fund, it cannot be said that it is any the less a tax because the employer has failed, either through choice or lack of resources, to make such a contribution. Either the state or the federal government must provide the money to meet the requirements of relief to the unemployed. By his contributions to the state, an employer has diminished the demand upon the financial resources of the federal government. But by his failure to contribute, the employer has increased this demand and sharpened the necessity for obtaining the revenues required to satisfy it. The effort by the United States to obtain the revenue by denying the credit must be regarded as the levying of a tax and not as the exaction of a penalty. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n[315 \nU.S. 510, 518]\n\u00a0\n (b) Finally the state contends that the District Court applied an incorrect formula in determining the amount of the credit deductible under  902. Section 902 provides: 'The taxpayer may credit against the tax imposed by  901 (section 1101 of this chapter) of this chapter the amount of contributions, with respect to employment during the taxable year, paid by him (before the date of filing his return for the taxable year)10 into an unemployment fund under a State law. The total credit allowed to a taxpayer under this section for all contributions paid into unemployment funds with respect to employment during such taxable year shall not exceed 90 per centum of the tax against which it is credited ....' In the case of a bankrupt who has not made any contribution to the state unemployment fund at the time of adjudication and whose assets are insufficient to meet the total of the claims of equal priority, the calculation of the credit is beset with some difficulty. The amount available for the state's claim for its unemplyment insurance fund is contingent upon the sums allowed on the other claims, including that of the federal government under  901. The amount to be allowed on the claim of the United States is in turn dependent upon the credit deductible from it under the terms of  902. And this credit under  902 is determined by the sum granted on the state's unemployment insurance fund claim.\n Because of this mutual dependence the courts below have accepted and approved an algebraic solution of the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 510, 519]\n\u00a0\n problem. Under this solution the claim for the tax assessed under  901 is diminished by sub. tracting from it an amount equal to the sum allowed to the State for its unemployment fund. The formula by which this is accomplished is reducible to a quadratic equation capable of solution by the recognized method.\n As against this algebraic solution, the State urges an arithmetical calculation which would afford it a larger share of the assets. In brief, the State's theory is as follows: The amount of each of the several claims of the State and of the United States should be divided by the total of such claims. The percentage of the assets due on each claim is thus determined. The total of the assets available is then multiplied in turn by these percentages, and the actual sum to be allowed on each claim is found. However, the amount allowed on the federal government's claim under  901 is then multiplied by 10%. The sum equal to this 10% is thereupon conclusively granted to the United States. But the remaining amount, equal to 90%, is returned to the estate as a second fund to be divided among all the claims in the same manner. The share of this second fund which by this computation would go to the United States on its  901 claim is again multiplied by 10%, with the balance of 90% returning to form a third fund. The process is repeated until the still undistributed assets reach a vanishing point.\n It will be observed that while the one solution is algebraic and the other arithmetic, there is little to choose between them in terms of complexity. The obvious fact is that neither the Bankruptcy Act nor the Social Security Act afford the courts any meaningful assistance in solving the problem raised by this case. And their legislative history is equally barren.\n The State objects to the formula applied below because its effect is to accord the United States a larger sum in dollars and cents on its  901 claim than it would \n\n[315 \nU.S. 510, 520]\n\u00a0\n receive if the available assets were sufficient to discharge in full all of the priority claims. This is true because, under  902, the United States would be entitled to no more than 10% of its  901 claim if the unemployment fund claim of the State was paid in full. We agree that this result is somewhat incongruous. However, the method of computation urged by the State embodies so basic an error that we cannot accept it. Section 902 permits the credit 'against the tax imposed by  901 (section 1101 of this chapter).' Under the State's formula the credit is reckoned in terms of a sum determined by that formula to be actually available to the United States on its  901 claim rather than in terms of the whole amount actually due under that section. We think that the words 'the tax imposed' must mean 'the tax demanded' or 'assessed' or 'due'. It can hardly be thought to mean 'the tax paid' or 'the amount available for payment of the tax'. The formula adopted by the District Court avoids this error by crediting the undetermined sum available to the state unemployment fund against the total tax assessed or claimed under  901. We therefor hold that the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals did not err in adopting and using that formula.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed with respect to the claim under Title VIII, but is otherwise affirmed. The case is remanded to permit the reinstatement of the judgment of the District Court.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Section 64. ( 104.) Debts which have priority. a.

UNITED STATES(1942)\nNo. 973\nArgued: Decided: May 25, 1942\n\n\n\n\n[316 \nU.S. 342, 343]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James E. Fahey and Mr. A. Shelby Winstead, both of Louisville, Ky ., for petitioner.\n Mr. H. G. Ingraham, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n In 1937 petitioner was tried and convicted on an indictment charging him with violation of section 2(a) and (b) of the Act of May 18, 1934, 12 U.S.C.  588b, 12 U.S.C.A.  588b, which respectively define the offenses ( a) of taking or attempting to take by force from any person money or property belonging to a bank insured with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and (b) in the commission of such offense, assaulting any person, or putting in jeopardy the life of any person by use of a dangerous weapon.\n The first count of the indictment charged the forcible taking of money of the bank from the person of another. The second count charged the same taking by use of a dangerous weapon, and the third alleged a conspiracy of petitioner with others to commit the offenses set out in the first two counts. Petitioner was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment on count 1, and a year and a day on each of counts 2 and 3, the three sentences to run consecutively. He took no appeal but two years later moved in the trial court to set aside the sentence on the first count on the ground that the offense charged in the first was included in that charged in the second. The district court denied the motion, holding that its jurisdiction of the cause ended with the term of court in which petitioner was sentenced. 38 F.Supp. 610. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 342, 344]\n\u00a0\n After the lapse of more than the five days prescribed by Rule III of the Rules in Criminal Cases, 18 U.S.C.A. following section 688, but less than the three months prescribed by  8(c) of the Act of February 13, 1925, 28 U.S.C.  230, 28 U.S.C.A.  230, petitioner filed a notice of appeal and asked leave to appeal in forma pauperis, which the district court allowed. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the order denying petitioner's application 'upon the grounds and for the reasons set forth in the opinion of the District Judge'. 124 F.2d 1019. We granted certiorari on a petition filed more than thirty days after the entry of judgment by the court below and requested counsel, in presenting the case here, to discuss the questions whether the time for appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals and for petition for certiorari to this Court are governed by the Rules in Criminal Cases, and if not what statute applies. \n316 \nU.S. 652\n, 62 S.Ct. 1033, 86 L.Ed. --.\n Rule XI of the Criminal Rules provides that 'Petition to the Supreme Court of the United States for writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the appellate court shall be made within thirty (30) days after the entry of the judgment of that court.' If the judgment of the Court of Appeals is one to which Rule XI applies, the petition for certiorari was filed too late and we are without jurisdiction. Petitioner insists that the present proceeding is one not embraced in the Criminal Rules since they make no provision governing the appeal from the order of the district court; that consequently certiorari to review the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, as in other proceedings not within the Criminal Rules, is governed by  8(a) of the Act of February 13, 1925, as amended, 28 U.S.C.  350, 28 U.S.C.A.  350, which allows three months for filing the petition. Cf. Nye v. United States, \n313 \nU.S. 33, 43\n, 44 S., 61 S.Ct. 810, 813\n\n\n The Criminal Rules were promulgated by this Court, \n292 \nU.S. 661\n, 54 S. Ct. xxxvii, pursuant to the Act of March 8, 1934, 18 U.S.C.  688, 18 U.S. C.A.  688, which authorized the Court to adopt 'rules \n\n[316 \nU.S. 342, 345]\n\u00a0\n of practice and procedure with respect to any or all proceedings after verdict, or finding of guilt by the court if a jury has been waived, or plea of guilty, in criminal cases in district courts of the United States.' The statute expressly authorized the Court to 'prescribe the times for and manner of taking appeals and applying for writs of certiorari'. In adopting the rules it was the purpose of this Court to expedite appeals in criminal proceedings, and as declared in its order promulgating them they were to apply 'in all proceedings' after pleas or verdict or finding of guilt and 'in all subsequent proceedings in such cases in the United States Circuit Courts of Appeals ... and in the Supreme Court of the United States.'\n The failure to provide in Rule III or elsewhere for appealing an order like the present from the district court to the Circuit Court of Appeals is a casus omissus which left in full force  8(c) of the Judiciary Act of February 13, 1925, 28 U.S.C.  230, 28 U.S.C.A.  230, which requires application for the allowance of appeals to the Circuit Court of Appeals to be made within three months after the entry of the order appealed from. But the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals in this case is a judgment in a criminal proceeding after verdict and judgment of conviction, and the petition for certiorari to review the judgment is a 'subsequent proceeding' in such a case to which Rule XI specifically applies.\n We see no reason for excepting the petition for certiorari from the thirty-day limitation of Rule XI merely because the draftsmen omitted to provide in Rule III for an appeal from the order of the district court in cases like the present. On the contrary, since the purpose in adopting the Rules was to expedite criminal appeals, and the Rules in terms apply to petitions for certiorari in criminal cases, the express requirements of Rule XI cannot rightly be disregarded even though the general purpose was not \n\n[316 \nU.S. 342, 346]\n\u00a0\n made completely effective because of the failure to provide a short period for appeal from the order of the district court. Despite this omission, Rule XI has made the purpose effective in the case of review by certiorari in this Court.\n The writ will accordingly be dismissed for failure to comply with Rule XI. We have no occasion to pass on the question whether the district court's denial of the application, on a ground which the Government suggests was erroneous, will bar a subsequent application to the district court for similar relief.\n Writ dismissed. \n\n\n\n","146":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. UNIVIS LENS CO.(1942)\nNo. 855\nArgued: Decided: May 11, 1942\n\n\n\n Appeals from the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 241, 242]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Francis Biddle, Atty. Gen., Samuel S. Isseks, Sp. Asst. to Atty Gen., and Thurman Arnold, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n Mr. H. A. Toulmin, Jr., of Dayton, Ohio, for Univis Lens Co., Inc., et al.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases come here on direct appeal and cross appeal from a judgment of the district court granting in part and denying in part the Government's prayer for an in- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 241, 243]\n\u00a0\n junction restraining violations of  1 and 3 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C .  1, 3, 15 U.S.C.A.  1, 3, which make unlawful and contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the states. The principal questions for decision are:\n First: Whether the system established and maintained by the Univis Corporation, appellee and cross appellant, for licensing the manufacture and sale of patented multifocal eyeglass lenses is excluded by the patent monopoly from the operation of the Sherman Act.\n Second: Whether if not so excluded the resale price provisions of the licensing system are within the prohibition of the Sherman Act and not exempted from it by the provisions of the Miller-Tydings Act amendment of  1 of the Sherman Act, 50 Stat. 693, 15 U.S.C.A.  1.\n Appellee, Univis Lens Company, was the owner of a number of patents and two trademarks relating to multifocal lenses. In 1931 it organized appellee, Univis Corporation. The Lens Company then acquired and now holds a majority of the stock of the corporation. The individual appellees are the principal stockholders of the Lens Company. They are stockholders in the Corporation and are the principal officers of both corporations, which may for the purposes of this suit be treated as though they were a single corporation. Upon the organization of the Corporation, the Lens Company transferred to it all its interest in the patents and trademarks presently involved, and the Corporation then proceeded to set up and has since maintained the licensing system which the Government now assails.\n The relevant features of the system are as follows: The Corporation licenses the Lens Company to manufacture lens blanks and to sell them to designated licensees of the Corporation, upon the Lens Company's payment to the Corporation of an agreed royalty of 50 cents a pair. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 241, 244]\n\u00a0\n The lens blanks are rough opaque pieces of glass of suitable size, design and composition for use, when ground and polished, as multifocal lenses in eyeglasses. Each blank is composed of two or more pieces of glass of different refractive power, of such size, shape, and composition and so disposed that when fused together in the blank it is said to conform to the specifications and claims of some one of the Corporation's patents.\n The Corporation also issues three classes of licenses-licenses to wholesalers, to finishing retailers and to prescription retailers. The licenses to wholesalers authorize the licensees to purchase the blanks from the Lens Company, to finish them by grinding and polishing, and to sell them to prescription licensees only at prices fixed by the Corporation licensor. In finishing the lenses so as to make them an effective aid to vision of the prospective wearer, to whom the prescription retailer sells, it is necessary for the wholesaler, by grinding the blanks, to conform their curvatures to the prescription supplied by the retailer with his order. By the terms of the license the wholesalers are required to keep full accounts of all sales, showing the sales prices of lenses and the names of the purchasers, and to make them available to representatives of the Corporation.\n The licenses to finishing retailers-who purchase the blanks from the Lens Company, grind and polish them and adjust the lenses, in frames or supports, to the eyes of the consumers-contain similar provisions. The retailers are licensed to purchase the blanks of the Lens Company and to sell them to their customers at prices prescribed by the Corporation licensor.\n Both the licenses to wholesalers and to finishing retailers require the licensee to notify the Corporation 'of any violation on the part of any jobbers or other licensees of the agreements respectively made by them with the Corporation, and to assist the Corporation in all possible ways \n\n[316 \nU.S. 241, 245]\n\u00a0\n in securing evidence against, and enforcing its agreements with such jobbers and licensees'.\n The licenses to prescription retailers, who are without facilities for grinding and finishing the lenses, but who prescribe and adjust glasses for their customers, are signed both by the Corporation and a licensor wholesaler, and grant to the retailer a 'franchise to prescribe anf fit Univis lenses', in return for which the prescription retailer agrees to sell finished lenses only to consumers and only at prices prescribed by the Corporation.\n All the licenses to wholesalers and retailers recite the Corporation's ownership of the lens patents and purport to confer on the licensee the privilege of selling the patented invention in the manner and to the extent stated. No royalties are exacted of any of the licensees other than the 50 cents collected by the Corporation for each pair of blanks sold by the Lens Company. The rewards of the corporate appellees for the exploitation of the patents and the patented lenses are derived wholly from the sales by the Lens Company of the blanks, from the proceeds of which the 50 cent royalty is paid.\n The prices prescribed and maintained under the licensing system are: $ 3.25 a pair for the blanks sold by the Lens Company to wholesalers, and $4 a pair for those sold to finishing retailers; $7 a pair for finished lenses sold by wholesalers; $16 a pair for white, and $20 for tinted, lenses sold to consumers by prescription and finishing retailers.\n The Corporation pursues the policy of issuing licenses to 'qualified licensees' who, it is said, are required to maintain 'high standards of practice' and to be skilled in the performance of the services which they undertake to render. According to the Corporation's instructions to its field representatives, 'price cutters' are not eligible as prescription retailer licensees. Inquiry is made to ascertain whether prospective licensees advertise prices, and whether they are considered in their communities to \n\n[316 \nU.S. 241, 246]\n\u00a0\n be price cutters. The Corporation cancels licenses principally because of the failure of licensees to adhere to the price fixing provisions but also because they advertise prices or the acceptance of installment payments, or for other forms of advertising objectionable to it; for selling Univis lenses to customers other than those designated by the Corporation; for not giving a certain percentage of the licensees' multifocal lens business to Univis; because the licensee is located in a drug, department or jewelry store, or because the licensee engaged in price cutting in the sale of the products of other manufacturers.\n For a time the Corporation licensed approximately 20 per cent of the retailers in a locality. It now licenses a larger percentage but not more than 50 per cent. There are approximately 330 wholesaler licensees, 325 finishing retailer licensees and 6,500 prescription retailer licensees located in various states of the Union including New York and the District of Columbia. The Corporation, by its representatives, solicits licenses and negotiates with licensees in the towns and cities where they conduct their business, including the Southern District of New York. The Lens Company, whose annual sales volume is approximately $1,000,000, ships blanks in interstate commerce from its factory in Ohio to wholesalers and finishing licensees in the various places where they are located, including the Southern District, where its representatives visit licensees for the purpose of instructing them in finishing lens blanks and for promoting sales of Univis lenses. The facts amply established the venue of the court below. Eastman Kodak Co. v. Southern Photo Co., \n273 \nU.S. 359, 373\n, 47 S.Ct. 400, 403.\n Of the sixteen patents owned by the Corporation three are unrelated to the issues of the present case; five are for methods of producing lenses utilized by the Lens Company in manufacturing blanks and do not concern any method or process employed by the licensees who finish \n\n[316 \nU.S. 241, 247]\n\u00a0\n the lens blanks. Each of the remaining eight patents relates to the shape, size, composition and disposition of the pieces of glass of different refractive power in the blanks into which they are fused.\n The district court found, 41 F.Supp. 258, that the claims of each of these eight patents are for a finished lens and that consequently the wholesalers and finishing retailers, in grinding and polishing each lens, practice in part the patent, in conformity to which the Lens Company has manufactured the blanks which it supplies. The court thought that without the granted license the final step in finishing the lens would infringe the patent and concluded that for this reason the Corporation could condition its licenses upon the maintenance by the licensee of the prescribed retail price. See United States v. General Electric Co., \n272 \nU.S. 476\n, 47 S.Ct. 192. But it held that the prescription retailer licenses are unlawful because their restrictions upon the resale of the finished product are not within the patent monopoly and are proscribed by the Sherman Act.\n It also held that certain 'fair trade agreements' entered into by the Lens Company with the licensees for the control of resale prices of the finished lenses, were not within the exception to the Sherman Act created by the Miller-Tydings Act. This was because the Lens Company had undertaken to fix the resale price of the finished lenses, which are a different product from the lens blanks which it manufactures and sells. The court accordingly limited the relief which it granted to an injunction restraining respondents from carrying out or enforcing the restrictive provisions of the prescription retailer licenses and the fair trade agreements, and from using its licensing system-as has been done in one instance-as the means of preventing a particular competitor from manufacturing and distributing multifocal lens blank similar in appearance to those produced by the Lens Company. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 241, 248]\n\u00a0\n The Government has not put in issue the validity of the lens patents, but argues that their scope does not extend beyond the structure of the lens blanks and consequently affords no basis for the Corporation's restrictions on the sale of the finished lenses which the wholesalers and finishing retailers fashion from blanks purchased from the Lens Company. It insists that the novel features of the invention do not include more than the combination of shape, size and arrangement of the described pieces of glass when they are fused into the blank; that the grinding and polishing of the blank involve no practice and add no feature not common to the finishing and 'fitting' of other types of multifocal lenses which are not covered by the patents; and that their scope cannot be lawfully extended to a procedure not in itself novel merely because it is applied to an article which embodies the only novel features of the alleged invention, and has by the sale become a lawful subject of commerce.\n The record gives no account of the prior art and does not provide us with other material to which, if available, resort might appropriately be had in determining the nature of an alleged invention and the validity and scope of the patent claims founded upon it. In any event we find it unnecessary, in the circumstances of this case, to decide whether, as the court below held, the patent claims can rightly be said to include the finishing of the blanks.\n As appellees concede, the invention of only a single lens patent is utilized in making each blank and finishing it as a lens. We therefore put to one side questions which might arise if the finisher of a particular lens blank utilized the invention of some patent other than the patent which was practiced in part by the manufacture of the blank. And we assume for present purposes, without deciding, that the patent is not fully practiced until the finishing licensee has ground and polished the blank so that it will \n\n[316 \nU.S. 241, 249]\n\u00a0\n serve its purpose as a lens. But merely because the licensee takes the final step in the manufacture of the patented product, by doing work on the blank which he has purchased from the patentee's licensee, it does not follow that the patentee can control the price at which the finished lens is sold.\n Notwithstanding the assumption which we have made as to the scope of the patent, each blank, as appellees insist, embodies essential features of the patented device and is without utility until it is ground and polished as the finished lens of the patent. We may assume also, as appellees contend, that sale of the blanks by an unlicensed manufacturer to an unlicensed finisher for their completion would constitute contributory infringement by the seller. Leeds & Catlin v. Victor Talking Machine Co., \n213 \nU.S. 325, 332\n, 333 S., 29 S.Ct. 503, 505; cf. Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Corp., \n283 \nU.S. 27, 34\n, 51 S.Ct. 334, 336.\n But in any case it is plain that where the sale of the blank is by the patentee or his licensee-here the Lens Company-to a finisher, the only use to which it could be put and the only object of the sale is to enable the latter to grind and polish it for use as a lens by the prospective wearer. An incident to the purchase of any article, whether patented or unpatented, is the right to use and sell it, and upon familiar principles the authorized sale of an article which is capable of use only in practicing the patent is a relinquishment of the patent monopoly with respect to the article sold. Leitch Mfg. Co. v. Barber Co., \n302 \nU.S. 458, 460\n, 461 S., 58 S.Ct. 288, 289; B. B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis, \n314 \nU.S. 495\n, 62 S.Ct. 406, 86 L.Ed. --. Sale of a lens blank by the patentee or by his licensee is thus in itself both a complete transfer of ownership of the blank, which is within the protection of the patent law, and a license to practice the final stage of the patent procedure. In the present case the entire consideration and compensation for both is the purchase price \n\n[316 \nU.S. 241, 250]\n\u00a0\n paid by the finishing licensee to the Lens Company. We have no question here of what other stipulations, for royalties or otherwise, might have been exacted as a part of the entire transaction, which do not seek to control the disposition of the patented article after the sale. The question is whether the patentee or his licensee, no longer aided by the patent, may lawfully exercise such control.\n The declared purpose of the patent law is to promote the progress of science and the useful arts by granting to the inventor a limited monopoly, the exercise of which will enable him to secure the financial rewards for his invention. Constitution of the United States, Art. I,  8, Cl. 8; 35 U. S.C.  31, 40, 35 U.S.C.A.  31, 40. The full extent of the monopoly is the patentee's 'exclusive right to make use, and vend the invention or discovery'. The patentee may surrender his monopoly in whole by the sale of his patent or in part by the sale of an artile embodying the invention. His monopoly remains so long as he retains the ownership of the patented article. But sale of it exhausts the monopoly in that article and the patentee may not thereafter, by virtue of his patent, control the use or disposition of the article. Bloomer v. McQuewan, 14 How. 539, 549, 550; Adams v. Burke, 17 Wall. 453; Hobbie v. Jennison, \n149 \nU.S. 355\n, 13 S.Ct. 879. Hence the patentee cannot control the resale price of patented articles which he has sold, either by resort to an infringement suit, or, consistently with the Sherman Act ( unless the Miller-Tydings Act applies), by stipulating for price maintenance by his vendees. Bauer & Cie v. O'Donnell, \n229 \nU.S. 1\n, 33 S.Ct. 616, 50 L.R.A.,N.S., 1185, Ann.Cas.1915A, 150; Boston Store v. American Graphophone Co., \n246 \nU.S. 8\n, 38 S.Ct. 257, Ann. Cas.1918C, 447; Straus v. Victor Talking Machine Co., \n243 \nU.S. 490\n, 37 S. Ct. 412, L.R.A.1917E, 1196, Ann.Cas.1918A, 955; Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, \n309 \nU.S. 436, 456\n, 457 S., 60 S.Ct. 618, 625, and cases cited.\n We think that all the considerations which support these results lead to the conclusion that where one has sold \n\n[316 \nU.S. 241, 251]\n\u00a0\n an uncompleted article which, because it embodies essential features of his patented invention, is within the protection of his patent, and has destined the article to be finished by the purchaser in conformity to the patent, he has sold his invention so far as it is or may be embodied in that particular article. The reward he was demanded and received is for the article and the invention which it embodies and which his vendee is to practice upon it. He has thus parted with his right to assert the patent monopoly with respect to it and is no longer free to control the price at which it may be sold either in its unfinished or finished form. No one would doubt that if the patentee's licensee had sold the blanks to a wholesaler or finishing retailer, without more, the purchaser would not infringe by grinding and selling them. The added stipulation by the patentee fixing resale prices derives no support from the patent and must stand on the same footing under the Sherman Act as like stipulations with respect to unpatented commodities. Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, supra.\n Our decisions have uniformly recognized that the purpose of the patent law is fulfiled with respect to any particular article when the patentee has received his reward for the use of his invention by the sale of the article, and that once that purpose is realized the patent law affords no basis for restraining the use and enjoyment of the thing sold. Adams v. Burke, supra, 17 Wall. page 456; Keeler v. Standard Folding Bed Co., \n157 \nU.S. 659\n, 15 S.Ct. 738; Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., \n243 \nU.S. 502\n, 37 S.Ct. 416, L.R.A. 1917E, 1187, Ann.Cas.1918A, 959; and see cases collected in General Talking Pictures Co. v. Western Electric Co., \n305 \nU.S. 124\n, 128, note 1, 59 S.Ct. 116, 118. In construing and applying the patent law so as to give effect to the public policy which limits the granted monopoly strictly to the terms of the statutory grant, Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., \n314 \nU.S. 488\n, 62 S.Ct. 402, 86 L.Ed. --, the particular form or method by which the monopoly is \n\n[316 \nU.S. 241, 252]\n\u00a0\n sought to be extended is immaterial. The first vending of any article manufactured under a patent puts the article beyond the reach of the monopoly which that patent confers. Whether the licensee sells the patented article in its completed form or sells it before completion for the purpose of enabling the buyer to finish and sell it, he has equally parted with the article, and made it the vehicle for transferring to the buyer ownership of the invention with respect to that article. To that extent he has parted with his patent monopoly in either case, and has received in the purchase price every benefit of that monopoly which the patent law secures to him. If he were permitted to control the price at which it could be sold by others he would extend his monopoly quite as much in the one case as in the other, and he would extend it beyond the fair meaning of the patent statutes and the construction which has hitherto been given to them.\n There is thus no occasion for our reconsideration, as the Government asks, of United States v. General Electric Co., supra, on which appellees rely. The Court in that case was at a paints to point out that a patentee who manufactures the product protected by the patent and fails to retain his ownership in it can not control the price at which it is sold by his distributors. 272 U.S. at page 489, 47 S.Ct. at page 196. Accordingly neither the Lens Company nor the Corporation, by virtue of the patents, could after the sale of the lens blank exercise any further control over the article sold.\n The price fixing features of appellees' licensing system, which are not within the protection of the patent law, violate the Sherman Act save only as the fair trade agreements may bring them within the Miller-Tydings Act. Agreements for price maintenance of articles moving in interstate commerce are, without more, unreasonable restraints within the meaning of the Sherman Act because they eliminate competition, United States v. Trenton Pot- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 241, 253]\n\u00a0\n teries, \n273 \nU.S. 392\n, 47 S.Ct. 377, 50 A.L.R. 989; United States v. Socony Vacuum, \n310 \nU.S. 150\n, 60 S.Ct. 811, and restrictions imposed by the seller upon resale prices of articles moving in interstate commerce were, until the enactment of the Miller-Tydings Act, 50 Stat. 693, 15 U.S.C.A.  1 consistently held to be violations of the Sherman Act. Ethyl Gasoline Co. v. United States, supra, 309 U.S., page 457, 60 S.Ct. page 625, and cases cited.\n The Miller-Tydings Act provides that nothing in the Sherman Act 'shall render illegal, contracts or agreements prescribing minimum prices for the resale of a commodity which bears, or the label or container of which bears, the trade mark, brand, or name of the producer or distributor of such commodity and which is in free and open competition with commodities of the same general class produced or distributed by others ....' whenever such agreements are lawful where the resale is made.\n The contracts entered into by the Lens Company with the licensees of the Corporation stipulate for the maintenance of the prices which are prescribed by the licensing system. Appellees assert and we assume for present purposes that the blanks which the Lens Company sells and the finished lenses are marked by appellees' trademark as required by the statute. In the contracts the Lens Company is designated as the manufacturer of 'eye glass lenses' which are distributed and sold under the trade-mark of the manufacturer. But the Lens Company manufactures the blanks and not the finished lenses to which the resale prices apply. It is therefore not the manufacturer of the 'commodity' which the licensees sell, and the licensees are not engaged in the 'resale' of the same commodity they buy. We find nothing in the language of the Miller-Tydings Act, or in its legislative history to indicate that its provisions were to be so applied to products manufactured in successive stages by different processors that the first would be free to control the price of \n\n[316 \nU.S. 241, 254]\n\u00a0\n his successors. The prescribed prices are thus not within the Miller- Tydings exception to the Sherman Act.\n Appellees stress the features of their licensing system by which it is said they protect the public interest and their own good will by the selection as licensees of those who are specially skilled and competent to render the service which they undertake. But if we assume that such restrictions might otherwise be valid, cf. Fashion Guild v. Trade Commission, \n312 \nU.S. 457, 467\n, 668 S., 61 S.Ct. 703, 707, these features are so interwoven with and identified with the price restrictions which are the core of the licensing system that the case is an appropriate one for the suppression of the entire licensing scheme even though some of its features, independently established, might have been ued for lawful purposes. Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, supra, 309 U.S. page 461, 60 S.Ct. page 627. The injunction of the district court will therefore be continued, and extended so as to suppress all the license contracts and the maintenance of the licensing system which appellees have established, other than the Corporation's license to the Lens Company.

WAYNE PUMP CO.(1942)\nNo. 81\nArgued: November 16, 1942Decided: December 7, 1942\n\n\n\n Appeals from the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Illinois. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 200, 201]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Thurman Arnold, Asst. Atty. Gen., for appellant.\n Mr. Edward R. Johnston, of Chicago, Ill., for appellee Wayne Pump Co. et al.\n Mr. James H. Winston, of Chicago, Ill., for appellee Gilbert & Barker Mfg. Co. et al.\n Mr. Harold F. McGuire, of Washington, D.C., for appellee Veeder-Root, Inc., et al.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are companion appeals from orders sustaining demurrers to indictments for violations of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq. The indictment in No. 81 charges the defendants, manufacturers of gasoline pumps, a manufacturer of gasoline computing mechanisms and a gasoline pump manufacturing association, and certain of their officers, with conspiracy extending from 1932 to the date of the indictment, January 31, 1941, to fix the prices of computer pumps in interstate trade and commerce, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Computer pumps are gasoline pumps embodying a mechanism which calculates, measures, displays and records the quantities and prices of gasoline passing through the pumps to the purchasers. In No. 82 the defendants are the same except that the association and its officer are omitted. This latter indictment varies from the former in that in two counts it charges a conspiracy to monopolize the manufacture and sale of computer pumps and computing mechanisms in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[317 \nU.S. 200, 202]\n\u00a0\n The facts alleged to support the charge in the count for price fixing and those to support the count for monopolizing are substantially the same. The counts vary only as to the purposes alleged. The same means allegedly are employed to carry out each conspiracy. As similar legal issues arise in each case and as our conclusions upon each count are based upon the same reasoning, it is not necessary to make further differentiations between the counts. One opinion was handed down by the district court. It sets out the indictments quite fully. United States v. Wayne Pump Company, D.C., 44 F.Supp. 949.\n As our decision does not and cannot in our view consider the correctness of a trial court's judgment that an indictment failed properly to allege the facts establishing a crime (United States v. Sanges, \n144 \nU.S. 310\n, 12 S.Ct. 609; United States v. Burroughs, \n289 \nU.S. 159\n, 53 S.Ct. 574) we do not set out the allegations of these counts in extenso. This has been done in United States v. Wayne Pump Company, supra. We shall state here for convenience in getting a focus on the problem only that the counts of the indictments charged conspiracies among the defendants to fix prices on and monopolize the interstate trade in computer pumps and \n\n[317 \nU.S. 200, 203]\n\u00a0\n computing mechanisms by a scheme for using patent rights and licenses to manufacture under them.\n The defendants demurred to the indictments as insufficient in law to state an offense. It was said in the demurrers that the indictments failed to describe or particularize the offense attempted to be charged with sufficient definiteness, certainty or specificity to inform the defendants of the nature and causes of the accusations or to enable them to plead an acquittal or conviction thereunder in bar of other proceedings.\n The trial court sustained the demurrers to each count from which ruling appeals to this Court were prayed under the Criminal Appeals Act, 34 Stat. 1246. That statute authorizes an appeal to this Court 'from a decision or judgment quashing, setting aside, or sustaining a demurrer to, any indictment, or any count thereof, where such decision or judgment is based upon the invalidity, or construction of the statute upon which the indictment is founded.' \n2\n We have no jurisdiction if the judgment below is not so based. United States v. Hastings, \n296 \nU.S. 188\n, 56 S.Ct. 218; United States v. Halsey, Stuart & Co., \n296 \nU.S. 451\n, 56 S.Ct. 299; United States v. Borden Co., \n308 \nU.S. 188\n, 60 S.Ct. 182.\n In their statement opposing jurisdiction appellees contended that the demurrers were sustained because of the insufficiency of the indictments as pleadings, as distinguished from a construction of the statute upon which the indictments were based and therefore questioned our \n\n[317 \nU.S. 200, 204]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction under the Act. We postponed decision of this question to the argument on the merits and we now come to its decision.\n There is disagreement between the parties as to whether the district court sustained the demurrers on the ground of the deficiency of the pleadings as well as upon a construction of the statute. The language of the opinion makes it apparent to us that the district court's conclusion was at least in part bottomed upon the indefiniteness, uncertainty and lack of specificity of the indictments. In the opinion it is said, 44 F. Supp. 949, 956:\n'There is no charge that defendants fixed the prices of gasoline pumps generally, or restricted their manufacture and sale. They are charged only with fixing the prices of computer pumps, a right which the Wayne Pump Company already had under the statutory monopoly granted by the Government when its patent was issued. What is meant by the phrase 'used the Jauch patent' is not quite clear. If the defendants did more than enter into ordinary patent license agreements, under the terms of which the Wayne Pump Company, as owner of the patent, licensed the others to manufacture computer pumps, and fixed the prices at which the pumps should be sold; or if the Government claims that these defendants were involved in some offense under the Sherman Act other than the exercise of a patent monopoly, then such offense should be set out clearly in the indictments.'\n\n The court further said, 44 F.Supp. 956:\n'How they took joint action or entered into joint agreements to use the Jauch patent to achieve the alleged illegal objectives, or how they went outside the monopoly granted to the patentee and its licensees, is nowhere set out in the indictments.'\n\n The lower court in United States v. Colgate & Co., D.C., 253 F. 522, affirmed \n250 \nU.S. 300\n, 39 S.Ct. 465, 7 A.L.R. 443, had criticized an indictment \n\n[317 \nU.S. 200, 205]\n\u00a0\n because of failure to set out facts against any set of wholesalers or retailers alleged to have acted in combination with the defendant. In this case, commenting upon what is said to be a similar situation, the district court said, 44 F.Supp. 958:\n'So in the case at bar, if these conditions exist, the Government should have no difficulty in setting forth at least one specific instance of where defendants determined the resale price at which jobbers might resell computer pumps. If this condition does exist, surely the Government must be in possession of the facts, and they should be set out in the indictments, so as to reasonably inform defendants of the offense with which they are charged.'\n\n The opinion added, 44 F.Supp. 958:\n'The Government in its argument insists that competing patents are here involved, and that a monopoly of competing patents was acquired by some of the defendants in furtherance of the plan to carry out the conspiracy, but the indictments set out no facts whereby to identify these competing patents, nor in what manner nor by whom such monopoly in them was acquired.'\n\n Finally the trial court concluded, 44 F.Supp. 959:\n'It is fundamental that in every indictment the defendant is entitled to be informed with such definiteness and certainty of the accusations against him as will enable him to make his defense, and avail himself of acquittal or conviction in any further prosecution for the same offense. Having in mind that the subject matter of the instant indictments is protected by a patent, I am of the opinion that the defendants here have not been furnished with such definite and particular allegations of fact as will meet this test. The charges are much too general. They do not adequately describe the nature of the alleged unlawful conspiracy agreements or arrangements which defendants are accused of having made, nor show how the defendants \n\n[317 \nU.S. 200, 206]\n\u00a0\n became parties thereto, nor how they collaborated in doing the unlawful things; nor set out any unlawful means whereby the unlawful objectives were accomplished.'\n\n Further, the district court, in our opinion, made it altogether clear that it was not determining solely the limits of a patent monopoly. It pointed out that a patentee might license (44 F.Supp. 954) as it chose, provided only that in so doing it did not violate any other law. The Sherman Act was in mind. The court said, 44 F.Supp. 956:\n'While ownership of the patent gives to the patentee a complete monopoly within the field of his patent, it of course does not give him any license to violate the provisions of the Sherman Act or of any other law. Under his monopoly he may not use his patent as a pretext for fixing prices on an unpatented article of commerce; nor fix the resale price on his patented article; nor make use of 'tying clauses.\"\n\n The government of course recognizes that the opinion manifests the district court's view that the indictment failed to allege violations of the Sherman Act with sufficient definiteness and particularity. But the government urges that such a ruling arose from the district court's error in holding on the merits that the facts set out in the indictment do not charge, as a matter of substance, crimes within the meaning of the Sherman Act. It is the government's contention that after making this fundamental ruling, the district court 'then simply went on to say that the indictments are defective as pleadings if they are intended to charge crimes within the Sherman Act as that Act is construed by the court below.'\n We do not read the district court's opinion in that way. Where a court interprets a criminal statute so as to exclude certain acts and transactions from its reach, it would of necessity also hold expressly or impliedly, as the government suggests, that the indictment considered \n\n[317 \nU.S. 200, 207]\n\u00a0\n merely as a pleading was defective. Yet, the essence of the ruling would be based upon a construction of the statute. We accept as correct, for the purposes of this discussion only, the government's understanding of the opinion as holding that the allegations of the indictment, considered in substance and apart from required specificity, did not allege violations of the Sherman Act. It was a statutory construction such as that just stated which led this Court to accept jurisdiction under the Criminal Appeals Act in United States v. Hastings, \n296 \nU.S. 188, 195\n, 56 S.Ct. 218, 221.\n In the light of the opinion, however, we conclude that the judgment upholding the demurrer was based also on grounds independent of the construction of the statute involved. The demurrers upon which the ruling below was based show on their face, as appears from the typical example below, that they were aimed not at the coverage of the Sherman Act but at the form of the indictments. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[317 \nU.S. 200, 208]\n\u00a0\n This was the objection determined by the court. The excerpts from the opinion quoted above are conclusive, we think, that the District Court rested its ruling on the insufficiency of the pleading as an independent ground.\n Since the judgment below was not placed solely upon the invalidity or construction of the statute but had an additional and independent ground, the Criminal Appeals Act does not authorize review. United States v. Hastings, \n296 \nU.S. 188, 193\n, 56 S.Ct. 218, 220; United States v. Halsey, Stuart & Co., \n296 \nU.S. 451\n, 56 S.Ct. 299; United States v. Borden Co., \n308 \nU.S. 188, 193\n, 60 S.Ct. 182, 185.4 Any contrary holding would be to assume a power of review not bestowed by Congress. \n5\n Furthermore, at the time of the entry of the District Court judgment, there was no provision for review of orders sustaining demurrers upon grounds other than those involving the construction of the basic statute.\n The Criminal Appeals Act,6 under which the government brought these cases here, now contains a provision \n\n[317 \nU.S. 200, 209]\n\u00a0\n for a remand to the circuit court of appeals if review by this Court on direct appeal is found to be unauthorized. The government does not differ with appellees' specific statement that the new provision is inapplicable to this appeal. We do not think that it is applicable. Six weeks after time to appeal had expired7 the act was amended. \n8\n The amendment for the first time permits appeals to the circuit courts of appeals from orders sustaining a demurrer to an indictment in cases not directly appealable to this Court. The time to appeal to all courts remains unchanged. The amendment provides that 'if an appeal shall be taken pursuant to this Act ( section) to the Supreme Court of the United States which, in the opinion of that Court, should have been taken to a circuit court of appeals ... the Supreme Court of the United States shall remand the cause to the circuit court of appeals ... which shall then have jurisdiction to hear and determine the same as if the appeal had been taken to that court in the first instance; ....' This language directs the remand of a case in which the appeal, at the time it was taken, should have been taken to the circuit court of appeals but was instead erroneously taken to this Court. It is intended to save to the government the right of appeals which might otherwise be lost by its erroneous view as to the proper appellate tribunal. \n9\n At the time the instant appeals were \n\n[317 \nU.S. 200, 210]\n\u00a0\n taken there was no statutory authority for an appeal to the circuit court of appeals and therefore no room for an erroneous choice between appellate courts. Consequently, the proviso has no application. To hold otherwise would be to give a right of appeal where none existed at the time the appeal was taken. While this might be permissible if there were such a legislative intention, the amendment is not retrospective in terms. Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, \n174 \nU.S. 445, 478\n, 19 S.Ct. 722, 734; Freeborn v. Smith, 2 Wall. 160. Nor does it appear that Congress had the instant case in mind in enacting the amendment. H. Rouw Co. v. Crivella, \n310 \nU.S. 612\n, 60 S.Ct. 1084. We therefore view the right to appeal and the court to which an appeal lies as they existed at the time the appeal was taken. Gwin v. United States, \n184 \nU.S. 669, 674\n, 22 S.Ct. 526, 528.\n Dismissed.\n Mr. Justice JACKSON took no part in the consideration of these appeals.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice MURPHY and I are of the view that the judgments should be reversed. In our opinion the District Court's rulings that the indictments were defective resulted from interpretations of the Sherman Act and the patent law which are erroneous in light of United States v. Masonite Corporation, \n316 \nU.S. 265\n, 62 S.Ct. 1070, and related cases. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 1: 'Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal . ...

Said indictment and each count thereof, in violation of the rights guaranteed to said defendants by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, fails to describe and particularize the offenses attempted to be charged therein with sufficient definiteness, certainty and specificity to inform them of the nature and cause of the accusation, to enable them to prepare and make their defense thereto, and to enable them to plead an acquittal or a conviction thereunder in bar of any other proceedings against them based on the matters or things, or any of them, on which said indictment is based.\n\n'2. The averments of said indictment, and each count thereof, purporting to charge a combination and conspiracy to monopolize the manufacture and sale of computer pumps and a combination and conspiracy to monopolize the manufacture and sale of computing mechanisms are mere conclusions.\n\n'3. Said indictment fails to make averments sufficient to identify and describe the supposed combination and conspiracy in each count of said indictment alleged, in that it does not allege with particularity any of the following:\n\n'(a) The factual basis upon which the United States relies for its charge that said combinations and conspiracies exist or have existed;\n\n'(b) The manner of formation of the supposed combinations and conspiracies;\n\n'(c) The terms of the supposed combinations and conspiracies; or\n\n'(d) The manner in and by which it is claimed that said defendants became parties to the supposed combinations or conspiracies.\n\n'4. The averments in said indictment and each count thereof with respect to the supposed combinations and conspiracies to monopolize, and the intended means for the accomplishment thereof, are so vague, indefinite, uncertain, and conclusory in character as to fail to apprise said defendants of the manner in which the prosecution claims that they have violated the law pertaining to combination or conspiracy to monopolize the manufacture and sale of computer pumps or the manufacture and sale of computing mechanisms.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] At one time, this Court permitted review under the Criminal Appeals Act of questions of statutory construction even where such questions were not the sole basis of the judgment.

Chanler, of New York City (Messrs. Leo Brown and William B. Trafford, both of New York City, on the brief), for petitioner.\n Mr. Walter W. Land, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The respondent, a citizen of Florida, owns a former United States Navy submarine which he exhibits for profit. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 52, 53]\n\u00a0\n In 1940 he brought it to New York City and moored it at a State pier in the East River. He prepared and printed a handbill advertising the boat and soliciting visitors for a stated admission fee. On his attempting to distribute the bill in the city streets, he was advised by the petitioner, as Police Commissioner, that this activity would violate  318 of the Sanitary Code which forbids distribution in the streets of commercial and business advertising matter,1 but was told that he might freely distribute handbills solely devoted to 'information or a public protest.'\n Respondent thereupon prepared and showed to the petitioner, in proof form, a double-faced handbill. On one side was a revision of the original, altered by the removal of the statement as to admission fee but consisting only of commercial advertising. On the other side was a protest against the action of the City Dock Department in refusing the respondent wharfage facilities at a city pier for the exhibition of his submarine, but no commercial advertising. The Police Department advised that distribution of a bill containing only the protest would not violate  318, and would not be restrained, but that distribution of the double-faced bill was prohibited. The respondent, nevertheless, proceeded with the printing of his proposed bill and started to distribute it. He was restrained by the police. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 52, 54]\n\u00a0\n Respondent then brought this suit to enjoin the petitioner from interfering with the distribution. In his complaint he alleged diversity of citizenship; an amount in controversy in excess of $3,000; the acts and threats of the petitioner under the purported authority of  318; asserted a consequent violation of  1 of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution; and prayed an injunction. The District Court granted an interlocutory injunction,2 and after trial on a stipulation from which the facts appear as above recited, granted a permanent injunction. The Circuit Court of Appeals, by a divided court, affirmed. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The question is whether the application of the ordinance to the respondent's activity was, in the circumstances, an unconstitutional abridgement of the freedom of the press and of speech.\n\n 1. \nThis court has unequivocally held that the streets are proper places for the exercise of the freedom of communicating information and disseminating opinion and that, though the states and municipalities may appropriately regulate the privilege in the public interest, they may not unduly burden or proscribe its employment in these public thoroughfares. We are equally clear that the Constitution imposes no such restraint on government as respects purely commercial advertising. Whether, and to what extent, one may promote or pursue a gainful occupation in the streets, to what extent such activity shall be adjudged a derogation of the public right of user, are matters for legislative judgment. The question is not whether the legislative body may interfere with the harmless pursuit of a lawful business, but whether it must permit such pursuit by what it deems an undesirable invasion of, or interference with, the full and free use of the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 52, 55]\n\u00a0\n highways by the people in fulfillment of the public use to which streets are dedicated. If the respondent was attempting to use the streets of New York by distributing commercial advertising, the prohibition of the code provision was lawfully invoked against his conduct.\n\n 2. \nThe respondent contends that, in truth, he was engaged in the dissemination of matter proper for public information, none the less so because there was inextricably attached to the medium of such dissemination commercial advertising matter. The court below appears to have taken this view since it adverts to the difficulty of apportioning, in a given case, the contents of the communication as between what is of public interest and what is for private profit. We need not indulge nice appraisal based upon subtle distinctions in the present instance nor assume possible cases not now presented. It is enough for the present purpose that the stipulated facts justify the conclusion that the affixing of the protest against official conduct to the advertising circular was with the intent, and for the purpose, of evading the prohibition of the ordinance. If that evasion were successful, every merchant who desires to broadcast advertising leaflets in the streets need only append a civic appeal, or a moral platitude, to achieve immunity from the law's command.\n The decree is reversed.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Handbills, cards and circulars.-No person shall throw, cast or distribute or cause or permit to be thrown, cast or distributed, any handbill, circular, card, booklet, placard or other advertising matter whatsoever, in or upon any street or public place, or in a front yard or court yard, or on any stoop, or in the vestibule or any hall of any building, or in a letter-box therein; provided that nothing herein contained shall be deemed to prohibit or otherwise regulate the delivery of any such matter by the United States postal service, or prohibit the distribution of sample copies of newspapers regularly sold by the copy or by annual subscription.

JOHNSTON(1942)\nNo. 1006\nArgued: Decided: April 27, 1942\n\n\n\n\n[316 \nU.S. 101, 102]\n\u00a0\n Harmon M. Waley, pro se.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n Petitioner filed his petition for habeas corpus in the district court, alleging upon oath that he had been cocerced, by intimidation and threats by an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to plead guilty to an indictment for kidnapping, and that he is held in custody by respondent under the consequent judgment of conviction and commitment.\n The petition stated generally that threats of Federal Bureau of Investigation agents to throw petitioner out of a window and 'beat me up' 'didn't bother me'. But it specifically alleged that petitioner's plea of guilty had been induced by the threats of a named Federal Bureau of Investigation agent to publish false statements and manufacture false evidence that the kidnapped person had been injured, and by such publications and false evidence to incite the public and to cause the State of Washington to hang the petitioner and the other defendants. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 101, 103]\n\u00a0\n The district court ordered respondent to show cause why a writ should not issue and appointed counsel to represent petitioner. Respondent's return to the order included certified copies of the docket entries, indictment, transcript of proceedings on arraignment, entry of plea, judgment and sentence, and commitment papers. The transcript discloses that the trial court had explained to petitioner his right to be assisted by counsel and had appointed counsel who represented him at the trial. The return also included an affidavit of a special agent of the Bureau of Investigation, not the one mentioned in the petition, stating that petitioner, in affiant's presence, voluntarily signed two statements confessing his guilt, and that no threat or promise to petitioner of any kind was made in affiant's presence. The return made no denial of the allegations of coercion specifically set forth and relied on in the petition.\n The district court denied the application for the writ without hearing evidence and without directing the production of the prisoner in court. It concluded that the allegations of coercion by threatening to publish false statements and manufacture false evidence were inconsistent with petitioner's statement that threats by Government agents to throw him out of the window and beat him up 'didn't bother' him; that the transcript filed with the return showed that petitioner was neither 'actuated nor induced by fear'; and that an earlier decision of the sentencing judge denying petitioner's application for a writ of coram nobis was res judicata.\n The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the order of the district court, 124 F.2d 587, 588. In view of the fact that petitioner when he pleaded guilty had been represented by counsel, a majority of the court thought he could not by habeas corpus attack his sentence on the ground that his plea was coerced. The opinion states that petitioner 'waived the defense and the constitutional \n\n[316 \nU.S. 101, 104]\n\u00a0\n right if any he had, and cannot assert it now on habeas corpus proceedings'. The case is before us on a motion of petitioner to proceed in forma pauperis on his petition for certiorari and the Government's confession of error. We grant the motion and the petition for certiorari.\n The Government confesses error for the reason that the habeas corpus petition raises the material issue whether the plea was in fact coerced by the particular threats alleged which stand undenied on the record, and that upon that issue petitioner is entitled to a hearing in accordance with Walker v. Johnston, \n312 \nU.S. 275\n, 61 S.Ct. 574.\n True, petitioner's allegations in the circumstances of this case may tax credulity. But in view of their specific nature, their lack of any necessary relation to the other threats alleged, and the failure of respondent to deny or to account for his failure to deny them specifically, we cannot say that the issue was not one calling for a hearing within the principles laid down in Walker v. Johnston, supra. If the allegations are found to be true, petitioner's constitutional rights were infringed. For a conviction on a plea of guilty coerced by a federal law enforcement officer is no more consistent with due process than a conviction supported by a coerced confession. Bram v. United States, \n168 \nU.S. 532, 543\n, 18 S.Ct. 183, 187; Chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227\n, 60 S.Ct. 472. And if his plea was so coerced as to deprive it of validity to support the conviction, the coercion likewise deprived it of validity as a waiver of his right to assail the conviction. Johnson v.

BELO CORP.(1942)\nNo. 622\nArgued: April 6, 1942Decided: June 8, 1942\n\n\n\n\n[316 \nU.S. 624, 625]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles Fahy, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Maurice E. Purnell, of Dallas, Tex., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BYRNES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a proceeding by the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor to restrain the respondent corporation from alleged violation of the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 624, 626]\n\u00a0\n Fair Labor Standards Act. \n1\n The Administrator sought to prevent the use by respondent under certain contracts with its employees of wage agreements deemed by the Administrator violative of the time and a half for overtime provisions of section 7(a)2 as implemented by section 15(a)(1) and (2).3 \n\n[316 \nU.S. 624, 627]\n\u00a0\n The respondent, a Texas corporation, is the publisher of the Dallas Morning News and other periodicals, and the owner and operator of radio station WFAA. It has some 600 employees. Those in the mechanical departments work under a collective bargaining agreement and are not involved in the present dispute. The others, and particularly those in the newspaper business, work irregular hours. Prior to the effective date of the Act, October 24, 1938, respondent had been paying all but two or three of these employees more than the minimum wage required by the Act. They received vacations of approximately two weeks each year at full pay; special bonuses at the end of the year amounting to approximately one week's earnings; and full pay during periods of illness, sometimes continuing for weeks and sometimes for months. At the time of the trial 28 superannuated employees were carried on the payroll at full rates of pay. Employees were permitted absences to attend to personal affairs without deductions from pay. When they were required to work long hours in any week, they were given compensating time off in succeeding weeks. Life insurance was carried for them at respondent's expense.\n After the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  201 et seq., but before its effective date, respondent endeavored to adjust its compensation system to meet the requirements of the Act by negotiating a contract with each of its employees except those in the mechanical departments. These contracts were in the form of letters stating terms which were agreed to by the employees. The following is a typical letter: \n\n[316 \nU.S. 624, 628]\n\u00a0\n 'The Fair Labor Standards Act which goes into effect on October 24, 1938, provides for the following minimum wages and maximum hours of employment:\n'First year-25\u00f5 per hour minimum 44 hours maximum per week\n\n'Second year-30\u00f5 per hour minimum 42 hours maximum per week\n\n'Third year-40\u00f5 per hour minimum4 40 hours maximum per week\n\n except that employees may work more than the number of hours specified above, provided that overtime rates shall be a minimum of one and one-half times the basic rate.\n'In order to conform our employment arrangements to the scheme of the Act without reducing the amount of money which you receive each week, we advise that from and after October 24, 1938, your basic rate of pay will be ..... 67 ..... cents per hour for the first forty-four hours each week, and that for time over forty-four hours each week you will receive for each hour of work not less than one and one-half time such basic rate above mentioned, with a guaranty on our part that you shall receive weekly, for regular time and for such overtime as the necessities of the business may demand, a sum not less than ..... $40 ......'\n\n In most cases, as in this example, the specified hourly rate was fixed at 1\/60th of the guaranteed weekly wage. The result was that during the first year under the Act when the statutory maximum of regular hours was 44, the employee was required to work 54 1\/2 hours before he became entitled to any pay in addition to the weekly guaranty. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[316 \nU.S. 624, 629]\n\u00a0\n When the employee worked enough hours at the contract rate to earn more than the guaranty, the surplus time was paid for at the rate of 150% of the hourly contract wage. If the employee received an increase in pay, the hourly rate and weekly rate were readjusted.\n For eighteen months the system embodied in these contracts was followed to the apparent satisfaction of employer and employees. Respondent was then advised that the arrangement was in violation of the Act and that it was liable to its employees in an amount of from 30 to 60 thousand dollars. It was informed by the regional director in Dallas and by an official in the Administrator's office in Washington that an employee's complaint had precipitated the investigation. These officials declined to give the name of the employee.\n Respondent thereupon brought suit for a declaratory judgment in the District Court for the Northern District of Texas joining the regional director and three of its employees as defendants. The defendant employees answered that they and all the other employees affected by the system approved of it. The regional director moved to dismiss on two grounds, one of which was that he represented none of the employees. The motion to dismiss was denied. A. H. Belo Corporation v. Street, D.C., 35 F.Supp. 430. In the meantime petitioner instituted this suit to enjoin respondent from continuing to operate the wage system based upon its contracts with its employees. The two suits were consolidated and tried together. The District Court entered a declaratory judgment for the respondent and dismissed the bill for an injunction. 36 F.Supp. 907.\n Petitioner appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals from the dismissal of its complaint. That Court affirmed the judgment of the District Court. Fleming v. A. H. Belo Corporation, 5 Cir., 121 F.2d 207, 210. It found that the contracts were 'actual bona fide contracts of employment' and that 'they were intended to, and did, really fix the regular rates at which each employee was \n\n[316 \nU.S. 624, 630]\n\u00a0\n employed.' We granted certiorari because of the importance of the question in the administration of the Act. \n314 \nU.S. 601\n, 62 S.Ct. 137, 86 L.Ed. --.\n It is no doubt true, as petitioner contends, that the purpose of respondent's arrangement with its employees was to permit as far as possible the payment of the same total weekly wage after the Act as before. But nothing in the Act bars an employer from contracting with his employees to pay them the same wages that they received previously, so long as the new rate equals or exceeds the minimum required by the Act. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The Act requires that for each hour of work beyond the statutory maximum the employees must be paid 'not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.' This case turns upon the meaning of the words 'the regular rate at which he is employed.' Re- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 624, 631]\n\u00a0\n spondent contends that the regular rate under the illustrative contract, which is set out above and to which we shall refer throughout, is 67 cents an hour. Petitioner argues, however, that the 67 cents hourly rate mentioned in the contract is meaningless and that the agreement is in effect for a weekly salary of $40 without regard to fluctuations in the number of hours worked each week. Treating the contract as one for a fixed weekly salary, he urges that the regular hourly rate for any single week is the quotient of the $40 guaranty divided by the number of hours actually worked in that week. \n7\n Under this formula the employee is entitled to the regular hourly rate thus determined for the first 44 hours8 each week and to not less than one and one-half times that rate for each hour thereafter.\n In its initial stage the question to which this dispute gives rise is a question of law, a question of interpretation of the statutory term 'regular rate'. But it is agreed that as a matter of law employer and employee may establish the 'regular rate' by contract. In the case before us such an effort has been made, and in the example given the regular rate has been specified as 67 cents an hour. The difficulty arises from the inclusion of the $40 guaranty. The problem is whether the intention of the parties to set 67 cents an hour as the regular rate squares with their intention to guarantee a weekly income of $40. The Administrator's position is that these two objectives are inherently inconsistent and that the intention to fix the regular hourly rate at 67 cents is overridden by the intention to guarantee the $40 per week.\n We cannot agree. In the first place, when an employee works more than 54 1\/2 hours in a single week, he is admittedly entitled to more than the $ 40 guarantee. The record \n\n[316 \nU.S. 624, 632]\n\u00a0\n shows that in such a case, the employee is paid at the rate of $1.00 an hour (150% $.67) for each hour of overtime. In this situation, then, it is clearly the guaranty that becomes inoperative and the 67 cent hourly rate fixed by the contract that is controlling.\n In the second place, although it is perfectly true that when the employee works less than 54 1\/2 hours during the week his pay is determined by the $40 guaranty, it does not dispose of the problem simply to say this. The question remains whether the $40 contemplates compensation for overtime as well as basic pay. The contract says that the employee is to receive 67 cents an hour for the first 44 hours and 'not less than one and one-half time such basic rate' for each hour over 44. Consequently, if an employee works 50 hours in a given week, it might reasonably be said that his $40 wage consists of $29.48 for the first 44 hour (44 $.67) plus $10.52 for the remaining six hours (6 $1.753). To be sure, $1.753 is more than 150% of $.67. But the Act does not prohibit paying more; it requires only that the overtime rate be 'not less than' 150% of the basic rate. It is also true that under this formula the overtime rate per hour may vary from week to week. But nothing in the Act forbids such fluctuation.\n The gist of the Administrator's objection to this interpretation is that both the basic rate and the overtime rate are so 'artificial' that the parties to the contract cannot fairly be supposed to have intended that it be so construed. It cannot be denied that the flexibility of the overtime rate is considerable, but this flexibility may well have been intended if it was the only means of securing uniformity in weekly income. Moreover, under the Administrator's interpretation, the regular rate in the example given is $40 divided by the number of hours worked each week. Since the number of hours worked fluctuates so drastically from week to week, this 'regular' rate is certainly 'irregular' in a mathematical sense. And inasmuch as it cannot be \n\n[316 \nU.S. 624, 633]\n\u00a0\n calculated until after the workweek has been completed, it is difficult to say that it is 'regular' in the sense that either employer or employee knows what it is or can plan on the basis of it.\n The artificiality of the method urged by the Administrator is accentuated by the nature of his counter-proposal of two plans by which the weekly wage of an employee whose hours vary from week to week may be stabilized. One of these officially approved plans is known as the 'time- off plan' and is explained in Interpretative Bulletin No. 4. Under this plan the employment must be placed upon an hourly rate basis with no mention of a guaranty. The pay days must be spaced at intervals of two weeks or longer. If the pay period is set at two weeks and the employee is required to work overtime during the first week, he is given sufficient time off during the second week to keep his paycheck at a constant level. In our view this counter-proposal far exceeds in technicality the plan adopted by respondent. Moreover its operation is to provide a ceiling but not a floor for the wage. Since the pay is by the hour and there is no guaranty, in a pay period in which an employee works few hours, his wage may fall far below the level aimed at.\n The other officially approved arrangement is known as the 'pre- payment plan', and is also explained in Bulletin No. 4. Under this plan virtually the same arrangement as that which we have been using as an example can stand. That is to say, an employee may be promised 67 cents an hour for the first 44 hours, $1.00 for each hour over 44,9 with a guaranty of $40 a week. However, in any week in which the employee's earnings at the stated hourly rates do not equal the $40 guaranty, the balance necessary to fulfill the guaranty must be treated as a loan to him. If \n\n[316 \nU.S. 624, 634]\n\u00a0\n in any succeeding week his earnings at the stated hourly rates exceed the guaranty, the excess is withheld by the employer as a repayment of the loan. But if his earnings do not exceed the guaranty in any succeeding week, and after receiving his pay check he does not return to work, the employer is presumed to make an effort to collect the excess amount paid to the employee in a previous week. If the employer does not recover this excess amount, then for all practical purposes the plan operates just as does the plan followed by the respondent in this case. About the only difference is that one is called a 'guaranty plan' while the other is called a 'pre-payment plan'. In the opinion of the Administrator, the 'pre- payment plan' is lawful; the 'guaranty plan' is unlawful.\n But the guaranty contract in this case carries out the intention of the Congress. It specifies a basic hourly rate of pay and not less than time and a half that rate for every hour of overtime work beyond the maximum hours fixed by the Act. It is entirely unlike the Missel case, Overnight Motor Transp. Co. v. Missel, \n316 \nU.S. 572\n, 62 S.Ct. 1216, 86 L. Ed. --, decided this day. In the contract in that case there is no stated hourly wage and no provision for overtime. Under the decision in that case an employer who engages a worker for a fixed weekly wage of $40 for irregular hours and works him 65 hours (in a year when the maximum workweek is 44 hours), owes the employee $46.38. See Missel case. For the same hours under the Belo contract, at the hourly contract rate of 67 cents, the worker would receive $50.48. There is a difference in compensation, but that is the agreement of the parties and it is within the letter and the intention of the law.\n The problem presented by this case is difficult-difficult because we are asked to provide a rigid definition of 'regular rate' when Congress has failed to provide one. Presumably Congress refrained from attempting such a definition because the employment relationships to which the Act would apply were so various and unpredictable. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 624, 635]\n\u00a0\n And that which it was unwise for Congress to do, this Court should not do. When employer and employees have agreed upon an arrangement which has proven mutually satisfactory, we should not upset it and approve an inflexible and artificial interpretation of the Act which finds no support in its text and which as a practical matter eliminates the possibility of steady income to employees with irregular hours. Where the question is as close as this one, it is well to follow the Congressional lead and to afford the fullest possible scope to agreements among the individuals who are actually affected. This policy is based upon a common sene recognition of the special problems confronting employer and employee in businesses where the work hours fluctuae from week to week and from day to day. Many such employees value the security of a regular weekly income. They want to operate on a family budget, to make commitments for payments on homes and automobiles and insurance. Congress has said nothing to prevent this desirable objective. This Court should not.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice REED, dissenting.\n The Court holds, 'When employer and employees have agreed upon an arrangement which has proven mutually satisfactory, we should not upset it and approve an inflexible and artificial interpretation of the Act which finds no support in its text and which as a practical matter eliminates the possibility of steady income to employees with irregular hours.' Yet it is recognized by the Court that the validity of the contract 'turns upon the meaning of the words 'the regular rate at which he is employed,\" the phrase left undefined by Congress, which it is said the courts also should leave undefined and flexible. Not only does the Court's conclusion assume that the typical Belo contract conforms to the Fair Labor Standards Act by the provision for hourly wages and time and a half for over- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 624, 636]\n\u00a0\n time, but in the opinion just announced, the Court approves this type contract for hiring 'so long as the new rate equals or exceeds the minimum required by the Act.' In so deciding the Court gives the phrase 'regular rate' an interpretation as inflexible and artificial as that which it condemns.\n The Court's interpretation that, in the absence of bad faith, any form of contract which assures the payment of the minimum wage and the required overtime complies with the Act may be assumed to be correct. But since the overtime hours must be compensated 'at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed' (Sec. 7(a)(3 )), the regular rate cannot be left without 'definition', 'flexible' or unfound for this case. And once so found, it must be applied to the circumstances of this litigation. No all inclusive definition will be attempted. The possibilities of variation in contracts are too great. Certainly, however, the Court does not mean to say that the employer and employee may capriciously select a certain figure, unrelated to the wages paid, and say 'That is the regular rate of employment.' Every contract of employment is assumed, by the statute, to contain a 'regular rate,' and for each contract it is a legal, not a factual, conclusion. What that rate is here is the object of our inquiry. Once determined for this case, that conclusion becomes a precedent for other similar contracts and so in one sense, whether we wish it or not, a definition to be applied in the administration of the Act.\n This Court accepts the view that the Fair Labor Standards Act was intended not only to put a floor under wages but also a ceiling over hours. The limitation of hours in turn had two purposes-the spreading of work and extra compensation for overtime, no matter how high the regular wage may be. Overnight Motor Transportation Co. v. Missel, \n316 \nU.S. 572\n, 62 S.Ct. 1216, 86 L.Ed. --, decided June 8, 1942. Since overtime pay must at least equal time and a half the regular rate, as section 7(a) \n\n[316 \nU.S. 624, 637]\n\u00a0\n specifies, employers and employees may not be permitted to contract in avoidance of the statutory requirement. Contracts for a regular rate per hour conform easily to the requirements but contracts for compensation in other forms compel an analysis of their terms to find the regular rate. Fixed salaries, as this Court agrees today in Missel's case, are to be reduced to hourly rates on the basis of a week as the unit of time. Belo's contract contains elements both of hourly wage and fixed weekly wage contracts. We come then to this point. Are the contracts here involved for weekly wages with variable hours or for hourly rates with time and a half of such rates for overtime? If the latter, respondent contends the Act has left him free to contract with his employees at such hourly regular rates as may be agreed upon, limited only by the minimum wage requirements. As a court, we must appraise the nature of these contracts and in my judgment they are agreements for weekly wages for variable hours, with a provision for additional compensation per hour contingent upon work in excess of an ascertainable number of hours-the number of hours of work required for the wages earned under the hourly wage terms of the contract to equal the guaranty. 1 Until these hours are exceeded, the stipulated wage per hour has no demonstrable effect.\n The contracts stated they were drawn to comply with the 'scheme of the Act without reducing' weekly wages. The hourly rate was customarily written as one-sixtieth of the weekly wages. The overtime above the maximum hours was set at 150% of the hourly wage or one-fortieth of the weekly. This was then followed by a guaranty that the employee should 'receive weekly,' for regular and overtime, the former weekly wage. This guaranty was the dominating feature of the contract. Without the guaranty, the adoption of a low hourly rate would encounter \n\n[316 \nU.S. 624, 638]\n\u00a0\n the full weight of employee bargaining power. The guaranty avoids this conflict by fixing the minimum weekly wage. This guaranty controls the weekly wage up to 54 1\/2 hours of work, the number of hours contracted for by Belo without paying more than the fixed weekly wage. In a 54 1\/2 hour week or less the regular rate should be the guaranty divided by the hours actually worked.\n It seems obvious that the guaranty was the heart of the arrangement. The effect of the contract in the illustrative case is to pay 73 cents an hour for work up to 54 1\/2 hours and $1.00 (expressed in the circumlocution of time and a half 67 cents) for overtime beyond those hours, with a guaranty that there will be $40 worth of work each week. The 'basic' hourly rate, the hours contracted for at the basic rate and the stated percentage paid for overtime may be varied without effect on earnings provided the guaranty and real overtime rate are kept fixed. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The employee willing, the number of hours which must be worked to earn the guaranty can be increased by suitable adjustment of the contract figures of hourly rate, hours contracted and overtime percentages. By such a \n\n[316 \nU.S. 624, 639]\n\u00a0\n verbal device, astute management may avoid many of the disadvantages of ordinary overtime, chief of which is a definite increase in the cost of labor as soon as the hours worked exceed the statutory workweek. If the intention of Congress is to require at least time and a half for overtime work beyond a fixed maximum number of hours (40, 42 or 44 hours), that intention is frustrated by today's holding. Under Missel's case, an employer who engages a worker for a fixed weekly wage of $40 for irregular hours and works him 54 1\/2 hours a week in a year with a 44 hour maximum, owes $43.86. Under the Belo contract, the worker would receive $40. Because there is no increase of labor cost between the statutory maximum and the hours contracted for (54 1\/2), the employer has a financial inducement to require hours beyond the statutory maximum.\n As pointed out above, this contract is not only an agreement to pay a fixed wage, $40.00, for variable hours up to 54 1\/2, but there is a provision for additional compensation for the hours over the contract maximum. Where the hours worked exceed the number necessary to entitle the employee to hourly pay under the contract, equal in the aggregate to the guaranty, the employee is entitled to receive his regular rate for the statutory maximum hours and 150% of that rate for all overtime. The contracts in most instances fixed the basic rate at one-sixtieth of the guaranty, but the effect of the guaranty, in our view, is to make the regular rate of employment for the precise number of hours necessary under the contract to earn the guaranty, the quotient of the guaranty divided by the hours. \n3\n For \n\n[316 \nU.S. 624, 640]\n\u00a0\n the surplus hours over 54 1\/2 the same regular rate continues to be applicable. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n It is the guaranty which gives character to these contracts, which determines the amount to be received by the employee under its terms, except in the instances of work beyond 54 1\/2 hours. It is only work beyond the 54 1\/2 hours which calls for extra pay from the employer. Consequently it seems proper to find the regular rate of employment by using the guarantee as the dividend and the maximum hours possible without increased contract pay as the divisor. The objection that this permits statutory overtime pay to be computed on contract overtime pay springs from the wording of the contract making the guarantee cover overtime up to the 54 1\/2 hours. This objection loses its force with the determination that the guaranty fixes the quality of the contract, rather than the so- called basic or hourly rate of pay.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be reversed and this action remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.\n Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MURPHY join in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Enforcement of the requirements of the Act by injunction is authorized by section 17.

Whatever the legal effect of this language, it is certainly not a prohibition and the Administrator does not rely upon it. The finding of the Circuit Court of Appeals that respondent's effort to maintain the weekly incomes of its employees at their pre-Act level was in good faith gains support from the circumstance that at the very time when respondent was formulating its new wage policy the Wage and Hour Administrator declared:\n'Clerical forces, we all feel, are included in the Act. But I cannot see where there is going to be any practical difficulty there because your clerical force in any plant of any consequence certainly is earning on a basis of more than 25 cents an hour weekly wages divided by the hours they work. If they are well above 25 cents an hour, it seems to me that there would not be much question about time and a half for overtime, because you could figure in that weekly wage that time and a half over the 44 hours had been given consideration as remuneration for their full week's pay.'\n\n Speech before the Southern States Industrial Council at Birmingham, Alabama, on September 29, 1938. 3 Wage and Hour Reporter 228. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] This has been the Administrator's interpretation of the Act, as set forth in Interpretative Bulletin No. 4, issued October 21, 1938 and revised in November, 1940. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] For the first year after passage of the Act; now 40 hours. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] It should be noted that respondent's contract, set out above, does not fix $1.00 as the hourly rate for overtime.

Ransom and William Robert Ming, Jr., both of Washington, D.C., and J. M. Burford, of Dallas, Tex., for petitioner.\n Mr. Spurgeon E. Bell and Pat Coon, Jr., both of Austin, Tex., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BYRNES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner William Ward, a negro, was indicted at the September, 1939 term of the District Court of Titus County, Texas for the murder of Levi Brown, a white man. He was placed on trial at that term but the jury \n\n[316 \nU.S. 547, 548]\n\u00a0\n was unable to agree upon a verdict. At the January, 1941 term he was again tried and found guilty of murder without malice, the jury assessing his punishment at confinement in the State penitentiary for three years. Upon appeal the Court of Criminal Appeals reversed the judgment of the District Court. On the State's motion for rehearing the Court reversed itself and affirmed the judgment. Petitioner's motion for rehearing was denied, one Judge dissenting. 158 S.W.2d 516. A petition for a writ of certiorari was granted in forma pauperis. \n316 \nU.S. 653\n, 62 S.Ct. 1040, 86 L.Ed. --.\n The evidence introduced at the trial was such that the jury could have drawn the following conclusions: The deceased, who was seventy-two years old, lived in Omaha, in Morris county. He had previously resided at Mount Pleasant, in the adjoining county of Titus. He went to Mt. Pleasant on Saturday, June 24, 1939. On Saturday evening he was seen for the last time, talking to petitioner and a negro woman on a street corner two and a half blocks south of where his body was found. He then moved off northward along the street followed at a little distance by petitioner and the woman. A short time later petitioner and the woman returned to the corner. They separated there and she walked off to the south while he returned in the direction in which the deceased had gone. The body was discovered on Sunday morning lying in a field in grass about knee high. There were no signs of a struggle and no evidence of robbery. The skin on the neck was bruised and discolored, the face was swollen and the eyes distended. The front of the trousers was open and there was blood on the tail of the shirt. For some time the deceased had been afflicted with a heart ailment and under advice of his physician regularly took digitalis. He had taken a dose on Saturday before leaving his home. The examining physician, however, found that death was due to strangulation. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 547, 549]\n\u00a0\n The Court of Criminal Appeals in its final opinion denying petitioner's motion for a rehearing (158 S.W.2d 523) concluded: 'It may be stated bluntly that no conviction could be sustained in the present case without the confession of appellant.' The details of the confession need not be recited. It is sufficient to say that in it petitioner stated that under his agreement with deceased he was to receive one dollar; that the deceased refused to pay him and cursed him and hit him; that he grabbed the deceased, choked him for nearly five minutes, and not knowing whether he was dead or alive left him on the ground.\n Petitioner contends that this confession was signed by him only after he had been arrested without a warrant, taken from his home town, driven for three days from county to county, placed in a jail more than 100 miles from his home, questioned continuously, and beaten, whipped and burned by the officer to whom the confession was finally made. We granted certiorari in order to determine whether the confession was the result of such coercion and duress that its use by the State at the trial constituted a denial of the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n In its first opinion reversing the judgment of conviction the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals concluded that the methods employed in obtaining the confession violated applicable Texas statutes. It added that the reversal of the conviction was 'in keeping with the recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in White v. State of Texas, \n310 \nU.S. 530\n, 60 S.Ct. 1032,' in which we set aside a conviction because it was based upon a confession obtained by means repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. But in its second opinion reinstating the judgment of conviction the Court of Criminal Appeals decided that there was a conflict of evidence with respect to the issues upon which the admissibility of the confession \n\n[316 \nU.S. 547, 550]\n\u00a0\n depended and that the question of admissibility was solely for the jury and had been submitted with proper instructions. It concluded that 'no matter what our personal belief might be, we do not feel that we have, nor do we usurp the power to set aside the finding of this jury in the case at bar.'\n Each State has the right to prescribe the tests governing the admissibility of a confession. In various States there may be various tests. But when, as in this case, the question is properly raised as to whether a defendant has been denied the due process of law guaranteed by the Federal Constitution, we cannot be precluded by the verdict of a jury from determining whether the circumstances under which the confession was made were such that its admission in evidence amounts to a denial of due process.\n The undisputed evidence shows that the signing of the confession was preceded by the following events. Petitioner was employed as a house servant in Mount Pleasant by Judge S. B. Caldwell, a member of the bar of Titus county. When the body of the deceased was discovered on Sunday, June 25, petitioner was taken to the court house for questioning along with several other negroes. He pleaded his innocence. During the examination he was slapped by a constable named Redfearn who gave as his reason that petitioner told him he 'didn't know what he was talking about and Quilla Gaddis was a liar.' Having no justification for holding him in custody, the county attorney at the request of Judge Caldwell let petitioner return to his home. Thereafter, on Sunday and Monday, he was questioned by officers several times and reiterated his assertions of innocence. On Tuesday the officers were still questioning several negroes in connection with their investigation of the crime. According to the county attorney they had no evidence by Tuesday night to justify the arrest of petitioner. On that night while petitioner was attending a party at his church in Mount Pleasant, he was called \n\n[316 \nU.S. 547, 551]\n\u00a0\n out, handcuffed, and taken into custody by the sheriff of Morris county, which adjoins Titus county. The sheriff was not accompanied by any officer of Titus county. He took petitioner and another negro in his car and drove them out of the city to Hart's Creek where he had arranged to meet Constable Redfearn of Titus county, the man who had slapped petitioner on Sunday. The officers then carried petitioner and two other negroes to Daingerfield in Morris county where the deceased had resided, then to Pittsburg in Camp county, and then to Gilmer in Upshur county where he spent the night in jail. On Wednesday night he was taken back to jail in Pittsburg. Constable Redfearn visited him from time to time and on Thursday morning took him to Tyler in Smith county where Redfearn placed him in the custody of two highway patrolmen, advising them of the details of the crime. About thirty minutes later the patrolmen carried petitioner to Athens, in Henderson county, and turned him over to Sheriff Sweeten. Athens is 110 miles from Mount Pleasant. During this time he had been questioned continuously. According to the county attorney of Titus county, who questioned petitioner in three different jails on three different days, petitioner stated once in Gilmer and again in Pittsburg that he would be glad to make any statement that 'I wanted him to make but that he didn't do it.' After Sheriff Sweeten had talked to petitioner, the latter signed the confession before a county attorney. Within six hours after his arrival in Athens he was returned to Tyler. Eventually he was taken back to Gilmer where he was kept until the trial.\n These facts are not disputed. Petitioner's contention that he was beaten, whipped and burned by Sheriff Sweeten just before the confession was made, however, was squarely denied. All of the officers involved asserted that he had not been mistreated, with the exception of the slap by Redfearn. Sweeten's explanation of how the confession was \n\n[316 \nU.S. 547, 552]\n\u00a0\n obtained was: 'We just talked that confession out of him. It took us 20 to 30 minutes to get that confession.' And one of the patrolmen who took petitioner to the jail in Athens stated: 'We just talked to him to get that statement. Yes sir, we just sweet talked him out of it.' Several witnesses who were not officers testified that they had examined petitioner's body and found no bruises or burns. Only the sheriff of Titus county corroborated petitioner's charges. He testified that when petitioner was back in the Gilmer jail several days after the confession, 'I saw some marks on his neck and shoulders and arms that appeared to be cigarette stub burns. Yes sir, they were fresh. There were several of them on his body.'\n Conceding that the question of physical mistreatment was conclusively resolved by the jury's verdict, we return to the admitted facts. There can be no doubt that from first to last the officers acted without authority of law. The sheriff of Morris county had no power to arrest petitioner in Titus county. Without the boundaries of Morris county he had no more authority than any private citizen. Ledbetter v. State, 23 Tex.App. 247, 5 S.W. 226; Hooper v. Diesher, Tex.Civ.App., 113 S.W.2d 966, 967. Nor did Constable Redfearn of Titus county have the right to take petitioner into custody. Under Article 215 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure the sheriff must procure a warrant before making an arrest unless he has been advised by a credible person that a felony has been committed and that the offender is about to escape. See Rutherford v. State, 104 Tex.Cr.R. 127, 283 S.W. 512. And Article 217 provides that the person making the arrest must immediately take the person arrested before the magistrate if the arrest is made without a warrant. Neither the sheriff of Morris county nor Constable Redfearn made any effort to secure a warrant. Instead of taking petitioner to the nearest magistrate they took him away from the nearest magistrate. There was no pretense that the arrest was made because of informa- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 547, 553]\n\u00a0\n tion that he was about to escape. He had been released on Sunday after his first detention and on Tuesday evening he was attending a party at his church, when the sheriff of Morris county arrested him.\n Petitioner contends that he was moved from Titus county because the officers feared that if he were placed in jail there Judge Caldwell would apply for a writ of habeas corpus to secure his release, and because they would be able to obtain the confession from him more easily in a strange place. The State's answer is that the officers' purpose was to protect him from threatened mob violence.\n In the first place the procedure required by law was not observed in making the removal. Article 262 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that if there is no safe jail in the county in which the prosecution is carried on, the magistrate may commit the prisoner to the nearest safe jail in any other county. Here no application was made to a magistrate for a committal to a jail in another county.\n In the second place the evidence of threatened mob violence is extremely vague and by no means adequately explains the course of the officers' activities. The only testimony on this subject is that in Morris county where deceased lived, one or two persons had expressed the opinion that the man who killed him should be given a 'neck-tie party' and that some people in Titus county had talked about the 'possibility of threatening mob violence'. Yet immediately after the arrest petitioner was taken into Morris county where the feeling was supposedly running highest. In conversation with two attorneys in Mount Pleasant prior to the Tuesday night arrest, Constable Redfearn complained about 'the trouble we were having in questioning William Ward' because of Judge Caldwell's interference. At the trial he stated: 'In moving the defendant, as I have testified, the sole and only consideration in doing so was to get a statement from the negro in talking to him alone or in connection with others who \n\n[316 \nU.S. 547, 554]\n\u00a0\n possibly knew something about the crime and I was protecting him against rumors of possible mob violence.' Rolston, county attorney of Titus county, was asked at the trial whether the reason for taking petitioner out of Titus county was to prevent Judge Caldwell 'from getting out a writ of habeas corpus'. He replied: 'I do not know whether that is all the reason or not. I didn't advise the officers to take him out. ... I know there was some plan on foot to take him out.' And he testified further: 'It is a fact that Mr. Redfearn and some of the other officers told me about the Edwards negro, that they were going to try to get them out of Mount Pleasant and question her and then question William and try to confront the two with the statement of each other and try to get them to break down and tell the truth about it.'\n Speaking of the conduct of the officers, the Court of Criminal Appeals in its first opinion said: 'We give effect to the good faith and intent of the officers in moving appellant out of Titus County in order to secure his safety. Yet we cannot subscribe to the idea that it was necessary to carry him 110 miles, to Athens, Texas, for that purpose. That such was not the reason appellant was carried to Athens is demonstrated by the fact that he was kept there only twenty or thirty minutes,1 and was carried back to Tyler, immediately after he had made the confession. The conclusion is inescapable that he was carried to Athens as part of the plan to 'get a statement from the negro,' and which had failed up to that time.' We are not persuaded that the initial removal of petitioner from Titus county was prompted by fear for his safety, but we concur in the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 547, 555]\n\u00a0\n Texas Court's opinion as to the motive that prompted the officers to transport him as far as Athens.\n The effect of moving an ignorant negro by night and day to strange towns, telling him of threats of mob violence, and questioning him continuously is evident from petitioner's statement to County Attorney Rolston that he would be glad to make any statement that Rolston desired. Disregarding petitioner's claims that he was whipped and burned, we must conclude that this confession was not free and voluntary but was the product of coercion and duress, that petitioner was no longer able freely to admit or to deny or to refuse to answer, and that he was willing to make any statement that the officers wanted him to make.\n This Court has set aside convictions based upon confessions extorted from ignorant persons who have been subjected to persistent and protracted questioning, or who have been threatened with mob violence, or who have been unlawfully held incommunicado without advice of friends or counsel, or who have been taken at night to lonely and isolated places for questioning. \n2\n Any one of these grounds would be sufficient cause for reversal. All of them are to be found in this case.\n The use of a confession obtained under such circumstances is a denial of due process and the judgment of conviction must be reversed.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It appears from the record that petitioner was actually in Athens for several hours. However, the significant fact that he was returned to Tyler immediately after signing the confession is not controverted. It is difficult to imagine that the object in carrying him from Tyler to Athens was to secure him from harm. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Ziang Sum War v.

Frank Settle and Sam Clammer, both of Tulsa, Okl., for petitioner.\n Mr. Davis Scarborough, of Abilene, Tex., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We are concerned here, as in Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, \n316 \nU.S. 517\n, 62 S.Ct. 1116, 86 L.Ed 1638, with a problem of statutory delineation, not \n\n[317 \nU.S. 88, 90]\n\u00a0\n constitutional power, in the application of the Fair Labor Standards Act1 to a particular situation. This is an action to recover unpaid overtime compensation and an equal amount as liquidated damages brought by respondent employees under  16(b). We must decide whether respondents are engaged 'in the production of goods for commerce' within the meaning of  7(a) of the Act. The district court held that they were so engaged, and, since petitioner had failed to compensate them for overtime hours as required by  7(b), accordingly rendered judgment for each respondent in the appropriate amount. \n2\n The Circuit Cuort of Appeals affirmed with an immaterial modification,3 and the case comes here on certiorari.\n The application of the Act depends upon the character of the employees' activities. Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, supra, 316 U.S. at page 524, 62 S.Ct. at page 1120, 86 l.Ed. --. The burden was therefore upon respondents to prove that in the course of performing their services for petitioner and without regard to the nature of its business, they were, as its employees, engaged in the production of goods, within the meaning of the Act, and that such production was for interstate commerce. We agree with both courts below that respondents have sustained that burden.\n Petitioner is the owner and operator of rotary drilling equipment and machinery, who contracts with the owners or lessees of oil lands to drill holes to an agreed-upon depth short of the oil sand stratum. When that depth is reached, the rotary rig is removed, and the machinery and crew move on to other locations. For reasons peculiar to the oil industry, a cable drilling crew then undertakes with cable tools to 'bring in' the well or else demonstrate that it is a dry hole. Respondents were employed by peti- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 88, 91]\n\u00a0\n tioner as members of its rotary drilling crew and worked on approximately thirty-two wells in the Panhandle Oil Field of Texas; thirty-one of those wells produced oil, and the other one produced gas. Petitioner was not the owner or lessee of any of the lands on which respondents drilled, and was not shown to have any interest therein or in the oil produced.\n In  3(j) Congress has broadly defined the term, 'produced',4 and has provided that 'an employee shall be deemed to have been engaged in the production of goods if such employee was employed in producing, manufacturing, mining, handling, transporting, or in any other manner working on such goods, or in any process or occupation necessary to the production thereof, in any State'. Whether or not respondents, in drilling to a specified depth short of oil, may be regarded as engaged in producing or mining, and we certainly are not to be understood as intimating that they may not, recognition of the obvious requiries us to hold that at the very least they were engaged in a 'process or occupation necessary to the production' of oil. Oil is obtained only by piercing the earth's surface; drilling a well is a necessary part of the productive process to which it is intimately related. The connection between respondents' activities in partially drilling wells and the capture of oil is quite substantial, and those activities certainly bear as 'close and immediate tie' to production as did the services of the building maintenance workers held within the Act in Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, supra, 316 U.S. at pages 525, 526, 62 S. Ct. at page 1121\n\n\n The evidence supports the finding that some of the oil produced ultimately found its way into interstate commerce. All the wells had pipeline connections, some of them being with petroleum companies operating on a \n\n[317 \nU.S. 88, 92]\n\u00a0\n national scale, wherein the oil was commingled with the production of other wells. Officials of the State of Texas testified that some crude oil is shipped out of the State by these pipelines and that a large percentage of crude oil sent to refineries in Texas thereafter passes out of the State in the form of refined products.\n Petitioner contests the applicability of the Act on the ground that it, as an independent contractor not financially interested in the wells, had no intention, expectation or belief that any oil produced would be shipped in interstate comemrce, and cites as support United States v. Darby, \n312 \nU.S. 100, 118\n, 657 S., 61 S.Ct. 451, 459, 132 A.L.R. 1430, where it was said that the 'production for commerce' intended by Congress includes 'at least production of goods, which at the time of production, the employer, according to the normal course of his business, intends or expects to move in interstate commerce although, through the exigencies of the business, all of the goods may not thereafter actually enter interstate commerce'. Respondents counter with the proposition that it is enough that the owners of the oil wells expected the oil produced to move across state lines, but the Government does not ask,5 and there is no need for, us to pass upon that proposition. The Act extends at least to the employer who expects goods to move in interstate commerce. United States v. Darby, supra. Assuming that such expectation, or a reasonable basis therefor, was necessary on petitioner's part before the application of the Act to petitioner, it is here present. The record contains ample indication that there were reasonable grounds for petitioner to anticipate, at the time of drilling, that oil produced by the wells drilled, would move into other states. Petitioner, closely identified as it is with \n\n[317 \nU.S. 88, 93]\n\u00a0\n the business of oil production, cannot escape the impact of the Act by a transparent claim of ignorance of the interstate character of the Texas oil industry. St. John v. Brown, D.C., 38 F.Supp. 385, 388; cf. Fleming v. Enterprise Box Co., D.C., 37 F.Supp. 331, 334, 335, affirmed 5 Cir., 125 F. 2d 897.\n One final contention merits but slight consideration. Respondents were employed on the basis of an eight hour day and regularly worked seven days a week, receiving fixed wages ranging from $6.50 to $11 per day. There was no agreement providing for an hourly rate of pay or that the weekly salary included additional compensation for overtime hours. Petitioner urges that it complied with the overtime compensation requirements of the Act because respondents received wages in excess of the statutory minimum wage, including time and one-half of that minimum wage for all overtime hours, which wages respondents impliedly agreed included overtime compensation by accepting them. A similar argument was squarely rejected in Overnight Motor Transp. Co. v. Missel, \n316 \nU.S. 572\n, 62 S.Ct. 1216.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n I dissent, as I did in Kirschbaum v. Walling, \n316 \nU.S. 517\n, 62 S.Ct. 1116, and for the same reason. But I think the present a more extravagant application of the statute than that there approved. We may assume that Congress, in drafting the Act, had in mind the practical, as distinguished from a theoretical, distinction between what is national and what is local,-between what, in fact, touches interstate commerce and what, in truth, is intrastate.\n The phrases on which respondents rely are these: An employee 'who is engaged in (interstate) commerce or in the production of goods for ( interstate) commerce. ...'  7(a), 29 U.S.C.A.  207(a); and \"Produced' means produced, manufactured, \n\n[317 \nU.S. 88, 94]\n\u00a0\n mined, handled, or in any other manner worked on in any State; and for the purposes of this Act (chapter) an employee shall be deemed to have been engaged in the production of goods if such employee was employed in producing, manufacturing, mining, handling, transporting, or in any other manner working on such goods, or in any process or occupation necessary to the production thereof, in any State.'  3(j), 29 U.S.C.A.  203(j).\n The opinion disavows any thought that the respondents may be classed as those who mine the oil which passes into commerce; but this seems to be a reservation intended not to preclude such a holding. The Court relies, rather, on the Act's inclusion of anyone employed 'in any process or occupation necessary to the production' of goods for commerce.\n The reasoning seems to be as follows. The oil will pass into commerce if it is mined. But it cannot be mined unless somebody drills a well. An independent contractor's men do part of the drilling. Their work is 'necessary' to the mining and the transportation of the oil. So they fall within the Act.\n This is to ignore all practical distinction between what is parochial and what is national. It is but the application to the practical affairs of life of a philosophic and impractical test. It is but to repeat, in another form, the old story of the pebble thrown into the pool, and the theoretically infinite extent of the resulting waves, albeit too tiny to be seen or felt by the exercise of one's senses.\n The labor of the man who made the tools which drilled the well, that of the sawyer who cut the wood incidentally used, that of him who mined the iron of which the tools were made, are all just as necessary to the ultimate extraction of oil as the labor of respondents. Each is an antecedent of the consequent,-the production of the goods for commerce. Indeed, if respondents were not fed, they could not have drilled the well, and the oil would not have \n\n[317 \nU.S. 88, 95]\n\u00a0\n gone into commerce. Is the cook's work 'necessary' to the production of the oil, and within the Act?\n I think Congress could not and did not intend to exert its granted power over interstate commerce upon what in practice and common understanding is purely local activity, on the pretext that everything everybody does is a contributing cause to the existence of commerce between the states, and in that sense necessary to its existence. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 52 Stat. 1060, 29 U.S.C.  201 et seq., 29 U.S.C.A.  201 et seq. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 40 F.Supp. 272. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 5 Cir., 124 F.2d 42. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] \"Produced' means produced, manufactured, mined, handled, or in any other manner worked on in any State;' \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Solicitor General submitted a brief on behalf of the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, United States Department of Labor, as amicus curiae. \n\n\n\n\n","153":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWHITE v.

Int.Rev.Acts, page 441, on amounts paid 'as dues or membership fees to any social, athletic, or sporting club or organization, if the dues or fees of an active resident annual member are in excess of $25 per year.'\n Since 1929 and during the period here in question the Club's by-laws provided for 'Annual Dues' of $50, which entitled a member to all the privileges of the Club except golf. By paying $35 more, for 'Limited Privileges,' a member became entitled to play golf during the year, except on specified days; by paying $50, for 'Full Privileges,' he got the privilege of playing at any time during the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 32, 34]\n\u00a0\n year. All but a small portion of the members acquired golf privileges of one sort or the other.\n Various forms of 'Family Privileges,' entitling one or more of a member's family to use the club house and to play tennis and golf, could be had by a member upon payment of specified additional sums, which were less if he had golf privileges than if he did not.\n The club year began January first, and, according to the by-laws, 'dues and fees' were payable on March first. The practice was to bill members during March for 'dues' and 'privileges' for the year. Privileges were acquired informally, the practice being to let the Club's officers know either orally or in writing what privileges were desired. A member was billed for the privileges he had previously held if he had not indicated that he no longer desired them, but if he later gave notice that he did not desire a given privilege, no attempt was made to collect the amount billed for it. If a member requested privileges prior to August first, he was billed for the full year; for privileges thereafter requested he was billed for only half a year. Suitable adjustment was also made if privileges were dropped in the middle of the year.\n During the period from November 27, 1931, to January 9, 1935, taxes in the amount of $9,211.25 were exacted on account of payments to the Club for the various 'privileges' mentioned above. On November 16, 1935, the Club duly filed claims for refund on behalf of its members, and after the Commissioner of Internal Revenue had rejected them, it instituted suits in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the three Collectors of Internal Revenue to whom the taxes had been paid. The District Court entered judgments for the Club, and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed them upon consolidated appeal. 117 F.2d 146. Certiorari was granted in this \n\n[315 \nU.S. 32, 35]\n\u00a0\n case and in Merion Cricket Club v. United States, decided by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, 119 F.2d 578, because of an asserted conflict between the two decisions. White v. Winchester Country Club, \n313 \nU.S. 555\n, 61 S.Ct. 1104; Merion Cricket Club v. United States, \n314 \nU.S. 589\n, 62 S.Ct. 59, 85 L.Ed. --.\n The generality of 'dues or membership fees,' the words by which the governing statute designates the payments upon which the tax is laid, necessitates consideration of their legislative background. Earlier Revenue Acts-those of 1917, 1918, 1921, and 1924-had laid a tax in the same terms upon payments to clubs such as the respondent. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The Treasury construed these words on several occasions not long after they were first employed in these Revenue Acts. Treasury Regulations 43 (Part 2), Art. 12, issued under the Revenue Act of 1918, and approved March 28, 1919, gave as examples of their applicability the following: '(5) A certain golf club's dues are $15 per year. Of this amount $10 is expended in the purchase for the member of a season ticket to a municipal golf course. The whole $15 is, nevertheless, taxable as dues. (6) A certain golf club charges a 'green' fee of $1 for each guest that uses the course. Such a fee is not paid 'as dues or membership fees,' and is, therefore, not taxable as such. (7) The members of a certain curling club pay annual dues of $20. By the payment of $10 extra per year the privilege of skating on the club's rink can be secured for the member's family. A payment of this extra $10 is taxable as a membership fee.' The same examples are given in this Article as revised on December 3, 1920, with the addition of the following example: '(13) A certain golf club the dues and fees of which are taxable issues to \n\n[315 \nU.S. 32, 36]\n\u00a0\n wives of members cards entitling them to the use of the course for one year, making a charge of $10 therefor. The amounts paid for such cards are taxable.'\n These examples were retained in three subsequent editions of the Regulations, issued under the Revenue Acts of 1921 and 1924, which also added the generalized statements that subject to the tax 'are extra charges which are imposed upon members for the privilege of using certain additional facilities for a period of time, as, for example, an additional charge of $60 per annum imposed upon members of a country club for the privilege of using the golf links. A 'greens fee' charged to a guest is not taxable, unless the right or privilege granted in return is for a period of time, such as a season.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Further, albeit slight, evidence of the Treasury's view is found in S. T. 357, Cum. Bul. I-1, p. 434, as follows: 'Where a payment for the use of golf links or similar privilege afforded by a club ... covers a period of time, such as a season, it is subject to the tax on dues .... This applies alike to payments made by members and nonmembers.'\n On December 30, 1925, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts held, however, that a charge to a member for the use of a club's golf course for a period of six months was not included within the words 'dues or membership fees,' on the ground that they 'were meant to cover only fixed and definite charges applicable to all members of each particular class of membership.' Weld v. Nichols, 9 F.2d 977.\n No appeal from this decision was perfected, a bill of exceptions being withdrawn by the Government on March 23, 1926. The Revenue Act of 1926 which, like its prede- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 32, 37]\n\u00a0\n cessors, contained the words 'dues or membership fees' without any definition thereof, was approved on February 26, 1926. Thereafter, and on May 21, 1926, a revision of the Regulations was promulgated which omitted all the matter quoted above except examples (5) and (6).3 The Revenue Act of 1928, containing an express definition of 'dues and membership fees' in a respect not here material,4 was enacted while the Regulation was in the same form,5 and before any court had decided another case like the Weld case. Subsequent editions of the Treasury Regulations, issued after the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1928 and before any further statutory treatment of the subject, retained example (6), but substituted for example (5) the following: 'A certain golf club has two classes of members. Class A members pay $40 per year dues and are entitled to the full privileges of the club, including the use of the golf course. Class B members pay $25 per year dues and are entitled to the privileges of the clubhouse, but do not enjoy the privilege of the golf course. The total dues of $40 paid by class A members are subject to tax, and, since the dues of such members are in excess of $25 per year, the dues of $25 paid by class B members are also subject to the tax.' 6 \n\n[315 \nU.S. 32, 38]\n\u00a0\n During a period after the decision of the Weld case the Treasury apparently sought to determine taxability under the doctrine of that case, rather than according to its own prior views. In 1930, and before the beginning of the period involved in this case there issued, however, a General Counsel's Memorandum7 which, while paying lip service to the doctrine of the Weld case, construed and applied it in such manner as to require the imposition of a tax on facts apparently substantially similar to those before us here. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has consistently followed this decision since its promulgation. Efforts were made in cases subsequently litigated in the courts to obtain decisions fixing the meaning of 'definite and fixed charge' and 'particular class of membership' as used in the statement of the Weld doctrine, resulting in holdings of taxability in three instances,8 and of nontaxability in three besides the present. \n9\n Foran v. McLaughlin, 9 Cir., 59 F.2d 158, certiorari denied \n287 \nU.S. 637\n, 53 S.Ct. 87, the first court decision rendered after the decision of the Weld case itself, held that the payments in question did constitute dues or membership fees. Since the decision of this case, the Commissioner has allowed no claims for refunds on the basis of the Weld case, as he had done in some previous instances.\n Section 543(b) of the Revenue Act of 1941, Pub. No. 250, 77th Cong., 1st Sess., 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  1712(a), the first statutory treatment of the subject since the Revenue Act of 1928, explicitly defined 'dues', and thereby clearly included the types of pay- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 32, 39]\n\u00a0\n ments here in question. \n10\n The legislative history of this redefinition is inconclusive in respect of the earlier intention of Congress. \n11\n The action of Congress in thus explictly defining the existing statutory term is at least as consistent with dissatisfaction on its part with the course of judicial decision as to its meaning as with the existence of an intention to change the law. If any inference is to be drawn from this spelling out of the meaning of 'dues,' it is one supporting the validity of the construction set forth and adhered to by the Treasury before the Weld case, which was substantially adopted by the newly enacted definition. Compare Mason v. Routzahn, \n275 \nU.S. 175, 178\n, 48 S.Ct. 50, 51.\n Nor do we find the reenactments of the words 'fees or membership dues' while the Weld case was on the books to be controlling, or even significant, as expressions of Congressional intent. Passage of the Revenue Act of 1926 so soon after the decision of the Weld case, and while the Treasury Regulation dealing in terms with the same problem was still in force on the books, of course avails the respondent nothing.\n So far as we have been able to ascertain, the Treasury's revision of the Regulation was made in the belief that it was bound to follow the Weld case; we cannot assume that the Treasury did more than bow to the District Court. The revision of the Regulation is of ambiguous import, but in any event it signifies no voluntary change in the opinion of the Treasury as to the meaning of the statute. Even if we could assume that the Treasury made a complete and voluntary about face after the decision of the \n\n[315 \nU.S. 32, 40]\n\u00a0\n Weld case and before the enactment of the 1928 Act, and that the new doctrine came within the scope of the cases applying the 'reenactment rule,' 12 this would be bootless to the petitioner, whose claim covers a period commencing after the 1930 decision of the General Counsel of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, supra, which favors the imposition of the tax here. If this decision marked a departure from doctrine espoused by the Treasury after the Weld case, it was a departure which was within the power of the Treasury to make for the period in question. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n Nor was the Weld case itself in any sense adopted by the enactment of the 1928 Act. It stood alone when that Act was passed, and 'one decision construing an act does not approach the dignity of a well settled interpretation.' \n14\n It was patently incomplete as an exposition of doctrine, and as a District Court decision it had quite restricted direct applicability.\n Having tested respondent's proffered constructional crutches and found them unsound, we must decide the meaning of the statute without their aid. We reject the doctrine of the Weld case as being intrinsically unsound, and as having been demonstrated by subsequent cases to be unworkable in practice. We also reject as an aid to decision the inquiry made in several cases as to whether the payment in question was in consequence of a 'recurring contractual obligation,'15 since whether such is the case depends merely upon the mechanics of the particular club's finances-a properly immaterial factor. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 32, 41]\n\u00a0\n Consideration of the nature of club activity is a necessary preliminary to the formulation of a test of what constitutes a 'due or membership fee.' So far as finances go, the fundamental notion of Club activity is that operating expenses are shared without insistence upon equivalence between the proportion of an individual's contributions and the proportion of the benefits he receives. 16 Thus, on the one hand, payment of the price of an individual dinner at the club dining room or of a single round of golf lacks the element of making common cause inherent in the idea of club activity. But, on the other hand, payment for the right to repeated and general use of a common club facility for an appreciable period of time has that element and amounts to a 'due or membership fee' if the payment is not fixed by each occasion of actual use. Such was the case here, and we therefore hold that the payments in question were subject to the tax.\n These are in substance the views expressed by the Treasury shortly after 'dues or membership fees' was first employed in the Revenue Acts, and consistently pressed by the Treasury, except as it thought judicial authority dictated otherwise. Its substantially contemporaneous expressions of opinion are highly relevant and material evidence of the probable general understanding of the times and of the opinions of men who probably were active in the drafting of the statute. As such they are entitled to serious consideration, independently alike of reenactments of the statute while it was in force on the books and of any temporary abandonment in consequence of disregard by judicial decision. \n 17\n\u00a0\n\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n]  701 of the Revenue Act of 1917, 40 Stat. 300, 319;  801 of the Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1057, 1121;  801 of the Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 227, 291;  501 of the Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 253, 321, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, page 91. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Treasury Regulations 43 (Part 2), Art. 9, as issued January 11, 1922 under the Revenue Act of 1921, and as revised April 18, 1922; Treasury Regulations 43 (Part 2), Art. 9, under the Revenue Act of 1924. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Treasury Regulations 43 (Part 2), Art. 9, under the Revenue Act of 1926. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Section 413 of the Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 791, 864, 26 U.S.C.

FILBURN(1942)\nNo. 59\nArgued: October 13, 1942Decided: November 9, 1942\n\n\n\n On Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of Ohio.\n Messrs. Francis Biddle, Atty. Gen., and Charles Fahy, Sol. Gen., for appellants.\n\n\n[317 \nU.S. 111, 113]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Webb R. Clark, of Dayton, Ohio, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellee filed his complaint against the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States, three members of the County Agricultural Conservation Committee for Montgomery County, Ohio, and a member of the State Agricultural Conservation Committee for Ohio. He sought to enjoin enforcement against himself of the marketing penalty imposed by the amendment of May 26, 1941,1 to the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938,2 upon that part of his 1941 wheat crop which was available for marketing in excess of the marketing quota established for his farm. He also sought a declaratory judgment that the wheat marketing quota provisions of the Act as amended and applicable to him were unconstitutional because not sus- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 111, 114]\n\u00a0\n tainable under the Commerce Clause or consistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n The Secretary moved to dismiss the action against him for improper venue but later waived his objection and filed an answer. The other appellants moved to dismiss on the ground that they had no power or authority to enforce the wheat marketing quota provisions of the Act, and after their motion was denied they answered, reserving exceptions to the ruling on their motion to dismiss. \n3\n The case was submitted for decision on the pleadings and upon a stipulation of facts.\n The appellee for many years past has owned and operated a small farm in Montgomery County, Ohio, maintaining a herd of dairy cattle, selling milk, raising poultry, and selling poultry and eggs. It has been his practice to raise a small acreage of winter wheat, sown in the Fall and harvested in the following July; to sell a portion of the crop; to feed part to poultry and livestock on the farm, some of which is sold; to use some in making flour for home consumption; and to keep the rest for the following seeding. The intended disposition of the crop here involved has not been expressly stated.\n In July of 1940, pursuant to the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as then amended, there were established for the appellee's 1941 crop a wheat acreage allotment of 11.1 acres and a normal yield of 20.1 bushels of wheat an acre. He was given notice of such allotment in July of 1940 before the Fall planting of his 1941 crop of wheat, and again in July of 1941, before it was harvested. He sowed, however, 23 acres, and harvested from his 11.9 acres of excess acreage 239 bushels, which under the terms of the Act as amended on May 26, 1941, constituted farm \n\n[317 \nU.S. 111, 115]\n\u00a0\n marketing excess, subject to a penalty of 49 cents a bushel, or $117.11 in all. The appellee has not paid the penalty and he has not postponed or avoided it by storing the excess under regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture, or by delivering it up to the Secretary. The Committee, therefore, refused him a marketing card, which was, under the terms of Regulations promulgated by the Secretary, necessary to protect a buyer from liability to the penalty and upon its protecting lien. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The general scheme of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 as related to wheat is to control the volume moving in interstate and foreign commerce in order to avoid surpluses and shortages and the consequent abnormally low or high wheat prices and obstructions to commerce. \n5\n Within prescribed limits and by prescribed standards the Secretary of Agriculture is directed to ascertain and proclaim each year a national acreage allotment for the next crop of wheat, which is then apportioned to the states and their counties, and is eventually broken up into allotments for individual farms. \n6\n Loans and payments to wheat farmers are authorized in stated circumstances. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The Act provides further that whenever it appears that the total supply of wheat as of the beginning of any marketing year, beginning July 1, will exceed a normal year's domestic consumption and export by more than 35 per cent, the Secretary shall so proclaim not later than May 15 prior to the beginning of such marketing year; and that during the marketing year a compulsory national marketing quota shall be in effect with respect to the marketing \n\n[317 \nU.S. 111, 116]\n\u00a0\n of wheat. \n8\n Between the issuance of the proclamation and June 10, the Secretary must, however, conduct a referendum of farmers who will be subject to the quota to determine whether they favor or oppose it; and if more than one-third of the farmers voting in the referendum do oppose, the Secretary must prior to the effective date of the quota by proclamation suspend its operation. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n On May 19, 1941 the Secretary of Agriculture made a radio address to the wheat farmers of the United States in which he advocated approval of the quotas and called attention to the pendency of the amendment of May 26, 1941, which had at the time been sent by Congress to the White House, and pointed out its provision for an increase in the loans on wheat to 85 per cent of parity. He made no mention of the fact that it also increased the penalty from 15 cents a bushel to one-half of the parity loan rate of about 98 cents, but stated that 'Because of the uncertain world situation, we deliberately planted several million extra acres of wheat. ... Farmers should not be penalized because they have provided insurance against shortages of food.'\n Pursuant to the Act, the referendum of wheat growers was held on May 31, 1941. According to the required published statement of the Secretary of Agriculture, 81 per cent of those voting favored the marketing quota, with 19 per cent opposed.\n The court below held, with one judge dissenting, that the speech of the Secretary invalidated the referendum; and that the amendment of May 26, 1941, 'in so far as it increased the penalty for the farm marketing excess over the fifteen cents per bushel prevailing at the time of planting and subjected the entire crop to a lien for the payment thereof,' should not be applied to the appellee because \n\n[317 \nU.S. 111, 117]\n\u00a0\n as so applied it was retroactive and in violation of the Fifth Amendment; and, alternatively, because the equities of the case so required Filburn v. Helke, D.C., 43 F.Supp. 1017. Its judgment permanently enjoined appellants from collecting a marketing penalty of more than 15 cents a bushel on the farm marketing excess of appellee's 1941 wheat crop, from subjecting appellee's entire 1941 crop to a lien for the payment of the penalty, and from collecting a 15-cent penalty except in accordance with the provisions of  339 of the Act as that section stood prior to the amendment of May 26, 1941.10 The Secretary and his co-defendants have appealed. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n I.\n\n\n The holding of the court below that the Secretary's speech invalidated the referendum is manifest error. Read as a whole and in the context of world events that constituted his principal theme, the penalties of which he spoke were more likely those in the form of ruinously low prices resulting from the excess supply rather than the penalties prescribed in the Act. But under any interpretation the speech cannot be given the effect of invalidating the referendum. There is no evidence that any voter put upon the Secretary's words the interpretation that impressed the court below or was in any way misled. There is no showing that the speech influenced the outcome of the referendum. The record in fact does not show that any, and does not suggest a basis for even a guess as to how many, of the voting farmers dropped work to listen to 'Wheat Farmers and the Battle for \n\n[317 \nU.S. 111, 118]\n\u00a0\n Democracy' at 11:30 in the morning of May 19th, which was a busy hour in one of the busiest of seasons. If this discourse intended reference to this legislation at all, it was of course a public Act, whose terms were readily available, and the speech did not purport to be an exposition of its provisions.\n To hold that a speech by a Cabinet officer, which failed to meet judicial ideals of clarity, precision, and exhaustiveness, may defeat a policy embodied in an Act of Congress, would invest communication between administrators and the people with perils heretofore unsuspected. Moreover, we should have to conclude that such an officer is able to do by accident what he has no power to do by design. Appellee's complaint, in so far as it is based on this speech, is frivolous, and the injunction, in so far as it rests on this ground, is unwarranted. United States v. Rock Royal Cooperative, \n307 \nU.S. 533\n, 59 S.Ct. 993\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\n It is urged that under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, Article I,  8, clause 3, Congress does not possess the power it has in this instance sought to exercise. The question would merit little consideration since our decision in United States v. Darby, \n312 \nU.S. 100\n, 61 S.Ct. 451, 132 A.L.R. 1430,12 sustaining the federal power to regulate production of goods for commerce except for the fact that this Act extends federal regulation to production not intended in any part for commerce but wholly for consumption on the farm. The Act includes a definition of 'market' and its derivatives so that as related to wheat in addition to its conventional meaning it also means to dispose of 'by feeding (in any \n\n[317 \nU.S. 111, 119]\n\u00a0\n form) to poultry or livestock which, or the products of which, are sold, bartered, or exchanged, or to be so disposed of.' 13 Hence, marketing quotas not only embrace all that may be sold without penalty but also what may be consumed on the premises. Wheat produced on excess acreage is designated as 'available for marketing' as so defined and the penalty is imposed thereon. \n14\n Penalties do not depend upon whether any part of the wheat either within or without the quota is sold or intended to be sold. The sum of this is that the Federal Government fixes a quota including all that the farmer may harvest for sale or for his own farm needs, and declares that wheat produced on excess acreage may neither be disposed of nor used except upon payment of the penalty or except it is stored as required by the Act or delivered to the Secretary of Agriculture.\n Appellee says that this is a regulation of production and consumption of wheat. Such activities are, he urges, beyond the reach of Congressional power under the Commerce Clause, since they are local in character, and their effects upon interstate commerce are at most 'indirect.' In answer the Government argues that the statute regulates neither production nor consumption, but only marketing; and, in the alternative, that if the Act does go beyond the regulation of marketing it is sustainable as a 'necessary and proper'15 implementation of the power of Congress over interstate commerce.\n The Government's concern lest the Act be held to be a regulation of production or consumption rather than of marketing is attributable to a few dicta and decisions of this Court which might be understood to lay it down that activities such as 'production,' 'manufacturing,' and \n\n[317 \nU.S. 111, 120]\n\u00a0\n 'mining' are strictly 'local' and, except in special circumstances which are not present here, cannot be regulated under the commerce power because their effects upon interstate commerce are, as matter of law, only 'indirect.' \n16\n Even today, when this power has been held to have great latitude, there is no decision of this Court that such activities may be regulated where no part of the product is intended for interstate commerce or intermingled with the subjects thereof. We believe that a review of the course of decision under the Commerce Clause will make plain, however, that questions of the power of Congress are not to be decided by reference to any formula which would give controlling force to nomenclature such as 'production' and 'indirect' and foreclose consideration of the actual effects of the activity in question upon interstate commerce.\n At the beginning Chief Justice Marshall described the Federal commerce power with a breadth never yet exceeded. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 194, 195. He made emphatic the embracing and penetrating nature of this power by warning that effective restraints on its exercise must proceed from political rather than from judicial processes. 9 Wheat. at page 197. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 111, 121]\n\u00a0\n For nearly a century, however, decisions of this Court under the Commerce Clause dealt rarely with questions of what Congress might do in the exercise of its granted power under the Clause and almost entirely with the permissibility of state activity which it was claimed discriminated against or burdened interstate commerce. During this period there was perhaps little occasion for the affirmative exercise of the commerce power, and the influence of the Clause on American life and law was a negative one, resulting almost wholly from its operation as a restraint upon the powers of the states. In discussion and decision the point of reference instead of being what was 'necessary and proper' to the exercise by Congress of its granted power, was often some concept of sovereignty thought to be implicit in the status of statehood. Certain activities such as 'production,' 'manufacturing,' and 'mining' were occasionally said to be within the province of state governments and beyond the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n It was not until 1887 with the enactment of the Interstate Commerce Act18 that the interstate commerce power began to exert positive influence in American law and life. This first important federal resort to the commerce power was followed in 1890 by the Sherman Anti-Trust Act19 and, thereafter, mainly after 1903, by many others. These statutes ushered in new phases of adjudication, which required the Court to approach the interpretation of the Commerce Clause in the light of an actual exercise by Congress of its power thereunder.\n When it first dealt with this new legislation, the Court adhered to its earlier pronouncements, and allowed but \n\n[317 \nU.S. 111, 122]\n\u00a0\n little scope to the power of Congress. United States v. E. C. Knight Co., \n156 \nU.S. 1\n, 15 S.Ct. 249. 20 These earlier pronouncements also played an important part in several of the five cases in which this Court later held that Acts of Congress under the Commerce Clause were in excess of its power. \n21\n\u00a0\n\n Even while important opinions in this line of restrictive authority were being written, however, other cases called forth broader interpretations of the Commerce Clause destined to supersede the earlier ones, and to bring about a return to the principles first enunciated by Chief Justice Marshall in Gibbons v. Ogden, supra.\n Not long after the decision of United States v. E. C. Knight Co., supra, Mr. Justice Holmes, in sustaining the exercise of national power over intrastate activity, stated for the Court that 'commerce among the states is not a technical legal conception, but a practical one, drawn from the course of business.' Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 398\n, 25 S.Ct. 276, 280. It was soon demonstrated that the effects of many kinds of intrastate activity upon interstate commerce were such as to make them a proper subject of federal regulation. \n22\n In some cases sustaining the exercise of federal power over intrastate matters the term 'direct' \n\n[317 \nU.S. 111, 123]\n\u00a0\n was used for the purpose of stating, rather than of reaching, a result;23 in others it was treated as synonymous with 'substantial' or 'material;'24 and in others it was not used at all. \n25\n Of late its use has been abandoned in cases dealing with questions of federal power under the Commerce Clause.\n In the Shreveport Rate Cases (Houston, E. & W.T.R. Co. v. United States), \n234 \nU.S. 342\n, 34 S.Ct. 833, the Court held that railroad rates of an admittedly intrastate character and fixed by authority of the state might, nevertheless, be revised by the Federal Government because of the economic effects which they had upon interstate commerce. The opinion of Mr. Justice Hughes found federal intervention constitutionally authorized because of 'matters having such a close and substantial relation to interstate traffic that the control is essential or appropriate to the security of that traffic, to the efficiency of the interstate service, and to the maintenance of the conditions under which interstate commerce may be conducted upon fair terms and without molestation or hindrance.' 234 U.S. at page 351, 34 S.Ct. at page 836.\n The Court's recognition of the relevance of the economic effects in the application of the Commerce Clause ex- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 111, 124]\n\u00a0\n emplified by this statement has made the mechanical application of legal formulas no longer feasible. Once an economic measure of the reach of the power granted to Congress in the Commerce Clause is accepted, questions of federal power cannot be decided simply by finding the activity in question to be 'production' nor can consideration of its economic effects be foreclosed by calling them 'indirect.' The present Chief Justice has said in summary of the present state of the law: 'The commerce power is not confined in its exercise to the regulation of commerce among the states. It extends to those activities intrastate which so affect interstate commerce, or the exertion of the power of Congress over it, as to make regulation of them appropriate means to the attainment of a legitimate end, the effective execution of the granted power to regulate interstate commerce. ... The power of Congress over interstate commerce is plenary and complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution . ... It follows that no form of state activity can constitutionally thwart the regulatory power granted by the commerce clause to Congress. Hence the reach of that power extends to those intrastate activities which in a substantial way interfere with or obstruct the exercise of the granted power.' United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co., \n315 \nU.S. 110, 119\n, 62 S.Ct. 523, 526.\n Whether the subject of the regulation in question was 'production,' 'consumption,' or 'marketing' is, therefore, not material for purposes of deciding the question of federal power before us. That an activity is of local character may help in a doubtful case to determine whether Congress intended to reach it. \n26\n The same consideration might help in determining whether in the absence of Congressional action it would be permissible for the state \n\n[317 \nU.S. 111, 125]\n\u00a0\n to exert its power on the subject matter, even though in so doing it to some degree affected interstate commerce. But even if appellee's activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce and this irrespective of whether such effect is what might at some earlier time have been defined as 'direct' or 'indirect.'\n The parties have stipulated a summary of the economics of the wheat industry. Commerce among the states in wheat is large and important. Although wheat is raised in every state but one, production in most states is not equal to consumption. Sixteen states on average have had a surplus of wheat above their own requirements for feed, seed, and food. Thirty-two states and the District of Columbia, where production has been below consumption, have looked to these surplus-producing states for their supply as well as for wheat for export and carryover.\n The wheat industry has been a problem industry for some years. Largely as a result of increased foreign production and import restrictions, annual exports of wheat and flour from the United States during the ten-year period ending in 1940 averaged less than 10 per cent of total production, while during the 1920's they averaged more than 25 per cent. The decline in the export trade has left a large surplus in production which in connection with an abnormally large supply of wheat and other grains in recent years caused congestion in a number of markets; tied up railroad cars; and caused elevators in some instances to turn away grains, and railroads to institute embargoes to prevent further congestion.\n Many countries, both importing and exporting, have sought to modify the impact of the world market conditions on their own economy. Importing countries have taken measures to stimulate production and self-sufficiency. The four large exporting countries of Argen- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 111, 126]\n\u00a0\n tina, Australia, Canada, and the United States have all undertaken various programs for the relief of growers. Such measures have been designed in part at least to protect the domestic price received by producers. Such plans have generally evolved towards control by the central government. \n27\n\u00a0\n\n In the absence of regulation the price of wheat in the United States would be much affected by world conditions. During 1941 producers who cooperated with the Agricultural Adjustment program received an average price on the farm of about $1.16 a bushel as compared with the world market price of 40 cents a bushel.\n Differences in farming conditions, however, make these benefits mean different things to different wheat growers. There are several large areas of specialization in wheat, and the concentration on this crop reaches 27 percent of the crop land, and the average harvest runs as high as \n\n[317 \nU.S. 111, 127]\n\u00a0\n 155 acres. Except for some use of wheat as stock feed and for seed, the practice is to sell the crop for cash. Wheat from such areas constitutes the bulk of the interstate commerce therein.\n On the other hand, in some New England states less than one percent of the crop land is devoted to wheat, and the average harvest is less than five acres per farm. In 1940 the average percentage of the total wheat production that was sold in each state as measured by value ranged from 29 per cent thereof in Wisconsin to 90 per cent in Washington. Except in regions of large-scale production, wheat is usually grown in rotation with other crops; for a nurse crop for grass seeding; and as a cover crop to prevent soil erosion and leaching. Some is sold, some kept for seed, and a percentage of the total production much larger than in areas of specialization is consumed on the farm and grown for such purpose. Such farmers, while growing some wheat, may even find the balance of their interest on the consumer's side.\n The effect of consumption of homegrown wheat on interstate commerce is due to the fact that it constitutes the most variable factor in the disappearance of the wheat crop. Consumption on the farm where grown appears to vary in an amount greater than 20 per cent of average production. The total amount of wheat consumed as food varies but relatively little, and use as seed is relatively constant.\n The maintenance by government regulation of a price for wheat undoubtedly can be accomplished as effectively by sustaining or increasing the demand as by limiting the supply. The effect of the statute before us is to restrict the amount which may be produced for market and the extent as well to which one may forestall resort to the market by producing to meet his own needs. That appellee's own contribution to the demand for wheat may be trivial by itself is not enough to remove him from the \n\n[317 \nU.S. 111, 128]\n\u00a0\n scope of federal regulation where, as here, his contribution, taken together with that of many others similarly situated, is far from trivial. National Labor Relations Board v. Fainblatt, \n306 \nU.S. 601\n, 606, et seq., \n307 \nU.S. 609\n, 59 S.Ct. 668; United States v. Darby, supra, 312 U.S. at page 123, 61 S.Ct. 461, 132 A.L.R. 1430.\n It is well established by decisions of this Court that the power to regulate commerce includes the power to regulate the prices at which commodities in that commerce are dealt in and practices affecting such prices. \n28\n One of the primary purposes of the Act in question was to increase the market price of wheat and to that end to limit the volume thereof that could affect the market. It can hardly be denied that a factor of such volume and variability as home-consumed wheat would have a substantial influence on price and market conditions. This may arise because being in marketable condition such wheat overhangs the market and if induced by rising prices tends to flow into the market and check price increases. But if we assume that it is never marketed, it supplies a need of the man who grew it which would otherwise be reflected by purchases in the open market. Home-grown wheat in this sense competes with wheat in commerce. The stimulation of commerce is a use of the regulatory function quite as definitely as prohibitions or restrictions thereon. This record leaves us in no doubt that Congress \n\n[317 \nU.S. 111, 129]\n\u00a0\n may properly have considered that wheat consumed on the farm where grown if wholly outside the scheme of regulation would have a substantial effect in defeating and obstructing its purpose to stimulate trade therein at increased prices.\n It is said, however, that this Act, forcing some farmers into the market to buy what they could provide for themselves, is an unfair promotion of the markets and prices of specializing wheat growers. It is of the essence of regulation that it lays a restraining hand on the selfinterest of the regulated and that advantages from the regulation commonly fall to others. The conflicts of economic interest between the regulated and those who advantage by it are wisely left under our system to resolution by the Congress under its more flexible and responsible legislative process. \n29\n Such conflicts rarely lend themselves to judicial determination. And with the wisdom, workability, or fairness, of the plan of regulation we have nothing to do.\n\n\n III.\n\n\n The statute is also challenged as a deprivation of property without due process of law contrary to the Fifth Amendment, both because of its regulatory effect on the appellee and because of its alleged retroactive effect. The court below sustained the plea on the ground of forbidden retroactivity 'or in the alternative, that the equities of the case as shown by the record favor the plaintiff.' 43 F.Supp. 1017, 1019. An Act of Congress is not to be refused application by the courts as arbitrary and capricious and forbidden by the Due Process Clause merely \n\n[317 \nU.S. 111, 130]\n\u00a0\n because it is deemed in a particular case to work an inequitable result.\n Appellee's claim that the Act works a deprivation of due process even apart from its allegedly retroactive effect is not persuasive. Control of total supply, upon which the whole statutory plan is based, depends upon control of individual supply. Appellee's claim is not that his quota represented less than a fair share of the national quota, but that the Fifth Amendment requires that he be free from penalty for planting wheat and disposing of his crop as he sees fit.\n We do not agree. In its effort to control total supply, the Government gave the farmer a choice which was, of course, designed to encourage cooperation and discourage non-cooperation. The farmer who planted within his allotment was in effect guaranteed a minimum return much above what his wheat would have brought if sold on a world market basis. Exemption from the applicability of quotas was made in favor of small producers. \n30\n The farmer who produced in excess of his quota might escape penalty by delivering his wheat to the Secretary or by storing it with the privilege of sale without penalty in a later year to fill out his quota, or irrespective of quotas if they are no longer in effect, and he could obtain a loan of 60 per cent of the rate for cooperators, or about 59 cents a bushel, on so much of his wheat as would be subject to penalty if marketed. \n31\n Finally, he might make other disposition of his wheat, subject to the penalty. It is agreed \n\n[317 \nU.S. 111, 131]\n\u00a0\n that as the result of the wheat programs he is able to market his wheat at a price 'far above any world price based on the natural reaction of supply and demand.' We can hardly find a denial of due process in these circumstances, particularly since it is even doubtful that appellee's burdens under the program outweigh his benefits. It is hardly lack of due process for the Government to regulate that which it subsidizes.\n The amendment of May 26, 1941 is said to be invalidly retroactive in two respects: first, in that it increased the penalty from 15 cents to 49 cents a bushel; secondly, in that by the new definition of 'farm marketing excess' it subjected to the penalty wheat which had theretofore been subject to no penalty at all, i.e., wheat not 'marketed' as defined in the Act.\n It is not to be denied that between seed time and harvest important changes were made in the Act which affected the desirability and advantage of planting the excess acreage. The law as it stood when the appellee planted his crop made the quota for his farm the normal or the actual production of the acreage allotment, whichever was greater, plus any carry- over wheat that he could have marketed without penalty in the preceding marketing year. \n32\n The Act also provided that the farmer who, while quotas were in effect, marketed wheat in excess of the quota for the farm on which it was produced should be subject to a penalty of 15 cents a bushel on the excess so marketed. \n33\n Marketing of wheat was defined as including disposition 'by feeding (in any form) to poultry or livestock which, or the products of which, are sold, bartered, or exchanged, ....'34 The amendment of May 26, \n\n[317 \nU.S. 111, 132]\n\u00a0\n 1941, made before the appellee had harvested the growing crop, changed the quota and penalty provisions. The quota for each farm became the actual production of acreage planted to wheat less the normal or the actual production, whichever was smaller, of any excess acreage. \n35\n Wheat in excess of this quota, known as the 'farm-marketing excess' and declared by the amendment to be 'regarded as available for marketing' was subjected to a penalty fixed at 50 per cent of the basic loan rate for cooperators,36 or 49 cents, instead of the penalty of 15 cents which obtained at the time of planting. At the same time there was authorized an increase in the amount of the loan which might be made to non-cooperators such as the appellee upon wheat which 'would be subject to penalty if marketed' from about 34 cents per bushel to about 59 cents. \n37\n The entire crop was subjected by the amendment to a lien for the payment of the penalty.\n The penalty provided by the amendment can be postponed or avoided only by storing the farm marketing excess according to regulations promulgated by the Secretary or by delivering it to him without compensation; \n\n[317 \nU.S. 111, 133]\n\u00a0\n and the penalty is incurred and becomes due on threshing. \n38\n Thus the penalty was contingent upon an act which appellee committed not before but after the enactment of the statute, and had he chosen to cut his excess and cure it or feed it as hay, or to reap and feed it with the head and straw together, no penalty would have been demanded. Such manner of consumption is not uncommon. Only when he threshed and thereby made it a part of the bulk of wheat overhanging the market did he become subject to penalty. He has made no effort to show that the value of his excess wheat consumed without threshing was less than it would have been had it been threshed while subject to the statutory provisions in force at the time of planting. Concurrently with the increase in the amount of the penalty Congress authorized a substantial increase in the amount of the loan which might be made to cooperators upon stored farm marketing excess wheat. That appellee is the worse off for the aggregate of this legislation does not appear; it only appears that if he could get all that the Government gives and do nothing that the Government asks, he would be better off than this law allows. To deny him this is not to deny him due process of law. Cf. Mulford v. Smith, \n307 \nU.S. 38\n, 59 S.Ct. 648.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 55 Stat. 203, 7 U.S.C.

A condition of sale to the Board, which buys at pegged prices, is the producer's agreement to become subject to restrictions on planting. See Nolan, Argentine Grain Price Guaranty, Foreign Agriculture (Office of Foreign Agricultural Relations, Department of Agriculture) May, 1942, pp. 185, 202. The Australian system of regulation includes the licensing of growers, who may not sow more than the amount licensed, and who may be compelled to cut part of their crops for hay if a heavy crop is in prospect. See Wright, Australian Wheat Stabilization, Foreign Agriculture (Office of Foreign Agricultural Relations, Department of Agriculture) September, 1942, pp. 329, 336. The Canadian Wheat Board has wide control over the marketing of wheat by the individual producer. 4 Geo. VI, c. 25,  5. Canadian wheat has also been the subject of numerous Orders in Council. E.g., 6 Proclamations and Orders in Council (1942) 183, which gives the Wheat Board full control of sale, delivery, milling and disposition by any person or individual.

CO. v. UNITED SHOE MACHINERY CORP.(1942)\nNo. 332\nArgued: February 13, 1942Decided: May 25, 1942\n\n\n\n Messrs. H. A. Toulmin, Jr., and H. A. Toulmin, both of Dayton, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Mr. Harrison F. Lyman, of Boston, Mass., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The suit was for the infringement of Claims 6, 23, 42, 85, and 91 of the McFeely Patent No. 1,558,737 for improvements in automatic heel lasting machines. The District Court held the claims valid and infringed. \n1\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 365]\n\u00a0\n The defendant sought certiorari on the ground that the claims were invalid under recent decisions of this court because they constituted attempts to repatent a broad combination of old devices,-bed lasters and automatic tackers-and embodied only aggregations of new unpatentable mechanisms with old mechanical combinations. In pressing us to grant the writ, the petitioner insisted that it desired no retrial of the facts but merely a proper application of the law to the facts found by the courts below. We granted the writ. \n314 \nU.S. 600\n, 62 S.Ct. 124, 86 L.Ed. --.\n In the manufacture of shoes, after the upper, the lining, and the counter have been placed on a wooden last, and an insole has been tacked to the last, the protruding edges of the materials are flattened over the insole and tacked down at the toe and shank of the shoe. The next operation is 'heel seat lasting', which consists of conforming the upper materials and insole snugly to the contour of the heel of the last and fastening them down with tacks. Originally this was done by hand. Later so- called 'bed' machines were used which employed horizontally moving plates called 'wipers' to flatten the projecting materials over the heel seat, where they were tacked by hand. Heel lasting on a bed machine involves the repeated use of levers and a foot treadle, and the result is not uniform.\n March 2, 1915, McFeely obtained a patent for a machine which would automatically perform, in one power stroke, the wiping and tacking necessary to complete the process of heel seat lasting. In this patent he claimed numerous combinations of means to accomplish specific steps in the process, amongst others combinations to effect the clamping of the last, and positioning it during the process, and to operate the wipers and the tackers in proper relation to the last. A declared purpose was that the machine should be able to last the heels of shoes of different sizes. One machine was built in accordance with the patent and used for some time. It was found to work satisfactorily on \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 366]\n\u00a0\n shoes of a small range of sizes but not to work on shoes of a wide range of sizes as would be required in the operations of the ordinary factory.\n October 27, 1925, McFeely obtained the patent involved in this case for improvements3 of the lasting machine described in his earlier patent. The improvements embodied in the claims in suit had to do with a new combination of elements for clamping the last in the machine, a new combination of elements for the operation of wipers and tackers in fixed relation to each other and to the heel of the last, and a new combination of means for positioning the last vertically and automatically altering the position during the operation. A manual adjustment was a part of each of these combinations by which the heel clamping, the wiping and tacking, and the vertical positioning mechanisms could be adjusted in advance for different sizes of shoes The respondent is the assignee of both McFeely patents.\n The petitioner purchased from a German maker, and used, four machines which were found by the courts below to be exact copies of the respondent's commercial machines made under the patent in suit. So thorough was the imitation that even minor features not covered by the patent were copied. At the time of the trial alterations had been made in the petitioner's machines, but the courts below found that these were for the purpose of avoiding infringement and that they were not effective to that end.\n If the petitioner's statements in support of the application for certiorari are taken at face value, the point for decision is extremely narrow. In argument, however, the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 367]\n\u00a0\n petitioner sought to overturn the concurrent findings below and to have us redetermine the question of the novelty and usefulness of the improvements described in the combination claims held valid and infringed.\n The courts below have concurrently found that none of the earlier patents cited, including that of McFeely, embodied the combinations of the challenged claims covering means for clamping and holding the last, means for the movement of wipers and tackers in fixed relation to each other, and means for the timed vertical positioning of the last during the power stroke of the machine, each combination including means for manually adjusting the mechanism in advance for different sizes of shoes. These findings are to the effect that the new combinations, while they involve old mechanical constructions, combine these in a new way so as to produce an improved result. These are findings of fact, 4 despite the petitioner's apparent contention to the contrary, and we will not disturb such concurrent findings where as here, there is evidence to support them. \n5\n The claim that the combinations are merely of old elements, which perform no new function and produce no new result, must be overruled.\n We come to the petitioner's contention that the courts below have held the patent valid and infringed on the theory that the improvements and adjustments disclosed in the claims entitle McFeely to repatent the entire combination of the old devices, known as bed lasters and automatic tackers. Petitioenr argues that they have so held only because the mechanism of the patented machine permits of its operation upon a wider range of sizes of shoes \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 368]\n\u00a0\n than the machine earlier patented and that it does so operate merely because of three trifling mechanical adjustments which it embodies.\n The contention is not in accord with the holdings below. It is true that both courts found that manual adjustments are provided which are not found in the earlier McFeely patent or in the prior art as applied to the three combinations embodied in the claims in suit. But the findings do not stop there. In respect of each claimed combination, both courts have found that they embody other improvements, in addition to mere manual preliminary adjustments and that each combination exhibits invention in that its elements cooperate in a new and useful way to accomplish an improved result.\n The petitioner, however, contends that the breadth of the claims in suit is such that, instead of patenting the combinations claimed as improvements over the prior art, and restricting the claims to the improvements, the patentee sought to blanket every machine which combines the old bed laster with the equally old automatic tacking device. It is said that our decisions in Bassick Mfg. Co. v. R. M. Hollingshead Co., \n298 \nU.S. 415\n, 56 S.Ct. 787; and Lincoln Engineering Co. v. Stewart-Warner Corp., \n303 \nU.S. 545\n, 58 S.Ct. 662, forbid any such extension of the patent monopoly.\n We think, however, that each of the claims is confined to a combination of specified means applicable only to a restricted portion and function of the whole machine. In stating his claims the patentee sometimes says 'a machine of the class described having, in combination , ....' Obviously, no machine will infringe which does not have in combination te means specified in each of the claims for accomplishing the particular portion of the total operation covered by the claim. Other claims refer to 'a lasting mechanism of the class described having, in combination, ....' The same comment is applicable. Other claims read: 'In a machine of the class described, the combina- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 369]\n\u00a0\n tion ....' Such preliminary statement is commonly and properly used to specify the type of machine in which the claimed subsidiary combination of elements works an improvement over the prior art. \n6\n In describing the novel combinations embodied in the claims, it was necessary to make reference to certain portions of the machine in connection with which the new combinations were to operate and with which they were to dovetail,7 but, in mentioning these other mechanical parts, the claim does not purport to embody them as elements of the claimed combination. To construe such a claim for a combination of new elements intended to be embodied in some well recognized mechanical aggregation, such as a sewing machine or a washing machine, as a claim covering all the mechanical details, or all the well known parts of the machine would be to nullify every patent for an improvement in a type of machine long in use and would invalidate thousands of patents for improvements in standard machines. It would be difficult to describe an improvement in a washing machine without naming such a machine as the thing to which the patent is addressed and equally difficult to refrain from referring to various parts of the machine, such as the tub or the motor which actuates the washer. But it has never been thought that a claim limited to an improvement in some element of the machine is, by such reference, rendered bad as claiming a monopoly of tubs or motors used in washing machines. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 370]\n\u00a0\n Bassick Mfg. Co. v. R. M. Hollingshead Co., supra, and Lincoln Engineering Co. v. Stewart-Warner Corp., supra, lend no support to the petitioner's argument. Those were suits for contributory infringement. In the Bassick case, the invention was of an improved pin fitting for receiving grease. The combination claimed was stated as a combination of a grease gun, a coupler, and a pin fitting of the improved type. It was sought to convict one who sold grease guns, common in the prior art, of contributory infringement because the seller knew, and intended, that the guns should be used with the improved pin fitting. The effort was to extend the monopoly embodied in the improved pin fitting so as to prevent sale or use of well known grease guns of the prior art, although whatever was novel in the improved pin fitting was peculiar to itself and had nothing to do with the grease gun commonly used in connection with all pin fittings. Had the claim merely recited that it applied to an improved type of pin fitting to be used in connection with grease guns and couplers, the claim for the pin fitting would have been good and would not have been rendered bad by the statement that the fitting was intended for use in connection with those other instrumentalities.\n The Lincoln Engineering case went on the same principle.\n The present suit for infringement is not for the use of an automatic bed lasting and tacking machine as such. It is for the use in such a machine of improvements of certain features of the machine. The respondent does not pretend to fix liability on the petitioner for contributory infringement by reason of the use of an automatic power driven lasting and tacking machine which does not employ the novel improvements of the combinations claimed, and could not do so. It is admitted, as it must be, that the petitioner is free to use the machine shown in the first McFeely patent which has expired, or any other automatic \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 371]\n\u00a0\n lasting and tacking machine which does not embody the three improvements covered by the claims in suit. \n8\n It is not free, however, to use such a machine if it embodies any one of the three combinations embraced in those claims respectively. The use of these combinations is the basis of its liability for infringement.\n The decree is\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MURPHY concur.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n In 1873, Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking for this Court in Carlton v. Bokee, said: 'We think it proper to reiterate our disapprobation of these ingenious attempts to expand a simple invention of a distinct device into an all-embracing claim, calculated by its wide generalizations and ambiguous language to discourage further invention in the same department of industry and to cover antecedent inventions. Without deciding that a repetition of substantially the same claim in different words will vitiate a patent, we hold that where a specification by ambiguity and a needless multiplication of nebulous claims is calculated to deceive and mislead the public, the patnt is void.' 17 Wall. 463, 471, 472. I believe that the patent of which the five claims now held valid are a part embodies every oen of the vices referred to by Mr. Justice Bradley and many more besides.\n I recognize that the automatic power-driven heel seat laster, the machine to which these five claims relate, is a great technological achievement. But it is not the work of a single person, nor can it be attributed to any one generation. On the contrary, it represents the sum of gradual developments wrought by the skill, perseverance, \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 372]\n\u00a0\n and creative genius of countless persons throughout many centuries. To this finished machine contributions have been made by those who first harnessed steam, gas, and electricity to machinery as well as those who discovered and used in combination cams, pivots, pulleys, belts, latches, triggers, springs and spring latches, brakes and brake blocks.\n The exact date of the first use of machines in the manufacture of shoes is not known. But we know that in 1790, Thomas Saint secured a patent in England on a machine for the fastening of soles to uppers; and that in 1810, M. I. Brunel secured a patent in this country on a machine to perform the same function. The progress of the art for the next fifty years culminated in the stitching machine jointly patented by Blake and McKay in 1860. By 1876 this and subsequent McKay shoe machines were earning more than a half million dollars in annual patent royalties for him, and had given him the dominant position in the industry. During this period another current of invention produced the cable nailing machine which cut nails and drove them automatically. And in 1883, Jan Ernst Matzeliger invented and patented a machine which 'could simultaneously and in a minute's time hold the last in place to receive the leather; move it forward step by step so that the other coaching parts might draw the leather over the heel; properly punch and grip the upper and draw it down over the last; lay the leather properly at the heel and toe; feed the nails and hold them in position for driving; and then discharge the completed shoe from the machine.' \n1\n The foregoing inventions and numerous others patented and put into use by the close of the century completely transformed the nature of shoe manufacturing. Reviewing these and other developments, the United States Census Report of 1900 concluded that 'the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 373]\n\u00a0\n genius of the American inventor had provided for every detail of shoemaking, even the smallest processes being performed by mechanical devices of some kind.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The United Shoe Machinery Company was formed in 1899. It combined in one enterprise the more important companies in the shoe machinery industry at the time, and brought under unified control the multitude of patents which those companies owned. Since that time the United Shoe Machinery Company or its parent, the United Shoe Machinery Corporation, which is the respondent in this case, has continuously and overwhelmingly dominated the industry. The shoe machinery patents which the respondent had acquired by 1918 were recognized by this Court to be 'too great in number for explanation or enumeration.' United States v. United Shoe Mach. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 32, 40\n, 38 S.Ct. 473, 476. In 1920, the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri found that the respondent controlled, through its system of leasing, at least 95% of all the shoe machinery used in the United States. See United Shoe Mach. Corp. v. United States, \n258 \nU.S. 451, 455\n, 42 S.Ct. 363, 364.\n The narrow field into which the patent in controversy was projected had already been so crowded by prior patents, a multitude of which were owned by the respondent, that the area left for patentable invention was very small. As the brief treatment in the Court's opinion indi- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 374]\n\u00a0\n cates, the inventions set out in the claims now held valid, if inventions at all, are comparatively simple improvements of an automatic power-driven heel seat lasting machine.\n The work of a heel seat lasting machine is to bend and flatten out the overlapping part of the shoe upper over the insole and then tack it down so that it will be ready for attaching the heel. In the performance of these operations the incompleted shoe is firmly held by a clasping device in a proper position to permit the leather to be bent and flattened by 'wipers' and fastened to the insole by 'tackers.'\n It is to the clasping device, the wipers, and the tackers that the asserted improvements relate. The operation of these parts must be carefully coordinated, and the coordination must be maintained when the machine is adjusted for different sizes of shoes. Means to accomplish the necessary coordination over a range of different sizes had been claimed in a prior patent3 which like the patent in suit was issued to Ronald F. McFeely and assigned to the respondent. The courts below found and the respondent here argues that although the machine made in accordance with the first McFeely patent 'successfully lasted shoes of specific sizes, it proved incapable of operating satisfactorily upon a range of sizes large enough to adapt it for commercial operation in the ordinary shoe factory.' 6 Cir., 121 F.2d 273, 278.\n The improvements said to cure the deficiencies in the earlier machine are covered in the five claims here held valid. Insofar as these claims set out anything not contained in the first McFeely patent, the modifications are \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 375]\n\u00a0\n not at all complex. The tackers and wipers, formerly connected in a manner which permitted some slight independence of movement, were now rigidly interconnected so that one could not move without the other; and a handle was substituted for a screw nut as a means of making a preliminary manual adjustment for shoes of different sizes. Changes of equal simplicity were made in the 'hold-down' and the 'heel band', two of the parts which clasp the shoe and hold it in place during the actual lasting process.\n There is no doubt that the United Shoe Machinery Corporation, particularly since it maintains a patent department in which patent lawyers are regularly employed, could have caused these simple improvements to be patented separately and without ambiguity or prolixity. No possible justification can be offered for inextricably combining the description of the alleged improvements with a description of a complete lasting machine. Let us now turn to the patent in suit to see how far it meets the requirement of R.S.  4888, 35 U.S.C.  33, 35 U.S.C.A.  33, that a patentee 'shall particularly point out and distinctly claim the part, improvement, or combination which he claims as his invention or discovery.'\n The patent as a whole sets out 137 claims covering 16 large closely printed pages; it includes 11 1\/2 more pages of specifications and numerous drawings; it has a text of more than 25,000 words, about 14,000 of which are devoted to the claims. Remarks of Judge Learned Hand, made with respect to a patent much shorter than the one before us, are pertinent here: 'Such claims violate the very purpose of any claims at all, which is to define the forbidden field. In such a waste of abstract verbiage .... It takes the scholastic ingenuity of a St. Thomas with the patience of a yogi to decipher their meaning, as they stand.' Victor Talking Mach. Co. v. Thomas A. Edison, Inc., 2 Cir., 229 F. 999, 1001. Alexander Graham Bell's basic patent on the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 376]\n\u00a0\n telephone, a pioneer invention,4 affords an illuminating contrast. All of Bell's claims-he found five ample-contain in the aggregate 229 words, less than many single claims of this patent; and the entire text of his patent is about one-tenth the length of this one. \n5\n The second McFeely patent, unlike Bell's, discloses no pioneer invention. On the contrary McFeely stated in his application that he was seeking to patent improvements. Yet, the features of a heel seat laster are set out so comprehensively and in such detail that a trained person would be able to build a complete machine with only this improvement patent as his primary source of information.\n If the machine as a whole were being claimed in the second McFeely, arguments of some plausibility could perhaps be made to justify the length of the patent. For the automatic heel seat laster in its entirety is a highly complex machine combining a number of interrelated mechanisms in a manner which as the court below pointed out enables it to perform its intricate function 'in the fraction of a second and too swiftly for the eye to follow.' 6 Cir., 121 F.2d 273, 274. But we must not allow ourselves to confuse the old and the new. The impressive speed of the machine is not the result of the improvements. Like most of the other admirable qualities of the machine as a whole it was attainable before the improvements were patented and to it the improvements made no contribution.\n Even if there is some conceivable basis for crediting the machine as a whole to McFeely's genius, he was not entitled to claim it in this patent. For his earlier patent, even lengthier than this one, had described and claimed as patentable invention every feature of the machine except the minor improvements to which we have referred. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 377]\n\u00a0\n One who invents improvements on a prior invention, whether his own or someone else's, may patent the improvements separately. But I do not believe that our patent system was intended to allow the indiscriminate jumbling of the new and the old which would permit the inventor of improvements to extend his domain of monopoly by perpetuating rights in old inventions beyond the 17 years period Congress has provided.\n If we turn from the patent as a whole to the individual claims we find in many of them the same ground for criticism: The introduction of something new is taken as an occasion for reclaiming the old. Claim 42, one of the five claims held valid and infringed, is illustrative. In these proceedings, the respondent makes this claim the basis of his assertion that the second McFeely embodies a patentable improvement in the hold-down mechanism, the part of the machine which holds the shoe in the appropriate vertical position during the lasting operation. But there is no clear and distinct statement in Claim 42 so limiting its scope. On the contrary, the trial court referred to this claim as 'a general claim covering the machine based on the McFeely patent in suit' (29 F.Supp. 1015, 1018), and the language of the claim itself purports to cover a 'machine of the class described.' \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 378]\n\u00a0\n Not only does 42 claim many old elements, but they are claimed in the same manner and with the same emphasis as the hold-down mechanism. Included among these old elements are: 'clamping means to embrace one end of a last and shoe'; 'end wipers positioned to operate on the edges of the upper at the said end of the shoe'; 'a support for a last and shoe constructed and arranged for manually effected movement to engage the last and shoe with (the) clamping means and hold-down'; and 'mechanism operative to actuate the wipers to break down the edge of the upper over the bottom of the positioned last and shoe'. All of these old elements were to operate in exactly the same manner prescribed either in the first McFeely or other prior patents and they were to perform the same functions they had always performed.\n We have held that if a claim does not contain a distinct and specific statement of what the patentee claims to be new, it is void. General Electric Co. v. Wabash Corp., \n304 \nU.S. 364\n, 58 S.Ct. 899. And we have also held void a claim which sets out an improvement of one part of an old combination but at the same time purports to cover the improvement in combination with old parts which perform no new function. Lincoln Co. v. Stewart-Warner Corp., \n303 \nU.S. 545\n, 58 S.Ct. 662. Claim 42, today held valid, clearly violates both of these standards. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 379]\n\u00a0\n I believe it could be conclusively shown that almost all of the 137 claims are objectionable for one or both of the same reasons as Claim 42. But the unnecessary length of this patent makes it impracticable to present a complete exposition of the vices of each separate claim in a judicial opinion. It may be possible, however, to suggest in a few brief statements the extent of the deficiencies and their cumulative tendency 'to deceive and mislead the public' with respect to the scope of the patent. Carlton v. Bokee, supra, 17 Wall. page 472.\n Of the 137 claims, 68 purport to cover in unambiguous language either 'a machine of the class described' or 'a lasting machine' or 'a heel seat lasting mechanism' without any hint of limitation to a claimed improvement. The use of such broad language cannot be dismissed as an inconsequential matter of form, since in substance these claims embrace with varying degrees of comprehensiveness all the fundamental features of an automatic power driven heel seat laster. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 380]\n\u00a0\n All but one8 of the remaining 79 claims are introduced by the somewhat limiting phrase 'in a machine of the class described.' But in almost all of these the introduction is followed by a recital of old elements claimed in the same manner as they were in the earlier McFeely9 and here again the aggregate effect is to reclaim a heel seat lasting machine in its entirety.\n Recent studies conducted by the Temporary National Economic Committee show that the technique employed in the second McFeely patent is not unusual. \n10\n In essence, \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 381]\n\u00a0\n it is an attempt to utilize minor improvements to perpetuate exclusive enjoyment of a major instrument of production which rightfully belongs to the public. Distinct separation of the new would afford guidance to those who wished to use the old when the exclusive rights to it expired. On the other hand, blurring the lines of separation places anyone who attempts to use any part of the amalgam in jeopardy of burdensome infringement suits. Where the patent owner has ample resources to bear the costs of repeated litigation, the power of the infringement suit to stifle competition is increased. And where potential competitors are weak and few, it may afford a practically complete protection for the preservation of undeserved monopoly.\n The circumstances here are most favorable for the use of patent privileges as a deterrent to all competition. By its vagueness and generality, the patent in suit creates an overhanging threat to anyone who might want to produce any kind of heel seat lasting machinery. And this threat is intensified by the universal recognition of the patent owner's long established rule over the entire shoe machinery industry.\n Moreover, it is entirely unrealistic to judge this patent in isolation. It is a stage of a process which the record shows \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 382]\n\u00a0\n began years before and is still continuing, a process by which it appears possible for the respondent to make the monopoly endless. The first McFeely patent, assigned to the respondent, embraced the whole universe of prior development in heel seat lasting machines. About a year after it was issued the United Shoe Machinery Company became the owner of another patent on a lasting machine, Brock No. 1,188,616. The 77 claims of this patent reembody too many of the features previously covered by the first McFeely to allow enumeration here. Four years later, Pym No. 1,368,968, also on a lasting machine, was issued and assigned to the respondent. Of the 172 claims of this patent there is another multitude embodying identical features of the first McFeely. Although applied for about a year after the first McFeely, the patent in suit was not issued until 1925, four years after the Pym patent. The second McFeely appears to be only the currently used weapon; the record reveals another in the respondent's arsenal, awaiting service when this one is no longer useful. \n11\n To date the series of overlapping patents has been continuous. There is no reason to suppose that abandonment of so successful a practice is contemplated for the future.\n The discouragement to future invention and the potentialities of deceiving and misleading the public which this Court condemned 70 years ago are here present in fullest measure. Carlton v. Bokee, supra. Opposed to departure from the salutary rule announced by Mr. Justice Bradley, I believe the patent before us should be declared void. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 383]\n\u00a0\n II.\n In addition to the foregoing reasons for declaring the entire patent void, there is an independent narrower ground for reversing the decision below. The five claims here relied upon set out only an aggregation of old elements not constituting patentable invention. \n12\n And where as here an appellate court can determine from a mere construction and comparison of patents that an alleged new invention is in reality identical with inventions claimed in prior patents, the question of patentability should be reviewed. Heald v. Rice, \n104 \nU.S. 737\n, 749. Cf. Singer Company v. Cramer, \n192 \nU.S. 265, 275\n, 24 S.Ct. 291, 295.\n It was the view of both courts below that although a machine manufactured under McFeely's earlier patent had 'successfully lasted shoes of specific sizes, it proved incapable of operating satisfactorily upon a range of sizes large enough to adapt it for commercial operation in the ordinary shoe factory.' The five claims in suit relate to three small adjustments of the first McFeely machine intended to cure this alleged deficiency. The respondent nowhere asserts that the adjustments were intended to accomplish any other purpose or that in fact they did. Nor did the courts below rest their conclusions upon findings that any other purpose was accomplished. They found novelty and usefulness in the increased adaptability of the later machines over a wider range of sizes; and in the minor mechanical changes made to cure the shortcomings of the earlier machine, they found patentable invention. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 384]\n\u00a0\n But novelty and usefulness are not enough, for to be patentable, improvements 'must, under the Constitution and the statute, amount to an invention or discovery.' Thompson v. Boisselier, \n114 \nU.S. 1, 11\n, 5 S.Ct. 1042, 1048. And even though improvements produce 'a more convenient and economical mechanism', or a 'more convenient and more salable' product, or a machine of 'greater precision', they are not patentable if they 'sprang naturally from the expected skill of the maker's calling.' \n13\n As this Court said in 1875, 'Perfection of workmanship, however much it may increase the convenience, extend the use, or diminish expense, is not patentable.' Reckendorfer v. Faber, \n92 \nU.S. 347, 356\n, 357 S.. Cf. Cuno Corp. v. Automatic Devices Corp., \n314 \nU.S. 84\n, 90- 92, 62 S.Ct. 37, 40, 41, 86 L.Ed. --.\n A comparison of the patent in suit with patents of the past shows that the improvements here were but duplications of old elements to obtain an old result and their application to the first McFeely machine was no more than a common mechanical expedient. The objective, adapting the machine to shoes of different sizes, suggests its own means of accomplishment.\n Even before 1900, automatic tacking machines and automatic wiping machines, adaptable to shoes of different sizes, had been in use commercially. In connection with the issuance of his earlier patent, McFeely represented that he had succeeded in combining tackers and wipers in a single machine and that his patent therefore set out a pioneer invention, disclosing the first machine organized for the entire process of heel seat lasting. The United Shoe Machinery Company built a machine in accordance with the patent and placed it in a factory for testing pur- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 385]\n\u00a0\n poses. Shoes lasted on it were sold to the factory owner's regular shoe trade. McFeely had described in detail means to set the parts before the lasting operation began so that the machine would properly do its work whatever the size of the shoe. \n14\n It is said the tests revealed that these preliminary adjustment devices were not adequate to accommodate all sizes although they did permit the machine to function satisfactorily on some.\n The problem was to enable the operator in advance to enlarge or diminish the area within which the tackers, wipers, and shoe clasping devices would do their work as the shoe to be lasted might be larger or smaller. The most obvious answer was adjustments to permit appropriate positioning of the parts. Three separate hand adjustments were therefore provided to set the tackerwiper combination, the heel clasping device, and the hold-down mechanism. The adjustments were so arranged that the operator of the machine could either by use of a set screw or handle place these separate parts in appropriate positions for the particular size of shoe to be lasted. The positions set by the operator are maintained until reset for shoes of another size.\n Technological knowledge and development had advanced too far by 1916 to warrant elevation of such hand adjustments to the privileged position reserved for inventions. Either in or out of the combination these adjust- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 386]\n\u00a0\n ments performed no more than the old functions that adjustments by hand levers and set screws had always performed. Yet without these hand adjustments the problem alleged to have been revealed by operation of the first McFeely machine would not have been met. For hand adjustments were the indispensable elements of the claimed improvements. Since I believe that such adjustments should not be raised to the dignity of patentable invention, I think the five claims should be held invalid.\n No argument is made that the remaining elements standing alone would have caused the machine to function satisfactorily on shoes of all sizes. Nevertheless, I shall give the reasons for my belief that there is not patentable invention in the remaining elements of the five claims.\n Tacker-Wiper Connection. In the first machine, the tackers and wipers were loosely connected in a manner allowing a slight independence of movement. Demonstration of the machine indicated that more satisfactory results would be obtained if tackers and wipers maintained a fixed relationship to each other throughout all the movements of the lasting operation. Here again the problem suggested its own answer. It is difficult to imagine that any mechanic would be ignorant of the principle that if two parts are fastened together, they will move simultaneously. The change in the tacker-wiper mechanism was no more than the application of this principle. Tackers and wipers were more rigidly interconnected. Even if such an expedient could ever have been invention, it had been anticipated in the field of shoe machinery as far back as 1881, when George W. Copeland, Matthias Brock, and Joseph E. Crisp obtained Patent No. 244,714 on an automatic power-driven lasting machine which claimed a combination of wiper plates and fasteners to be moved simultaneously to the proper position for wiping and fastening the sole. I can see no evidence whatever of an exercise of \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 387]\n\u00a0\n the inventive faculty in the fastening of tackers and wipers rigidly together so as to cause them to move simultaneously and maintain a fixed relationship with each other.\n Heel Band and Hold-Down. The first McFeely, as had many prior patents, described a U-shaped leather heel band adapted to grip and hold the shoe while it was wiped and tacked. It is asserted that the patent in suit added attachments which permit the heel band to slide relative to its supports. The first McFeely also described a hold-down device for maintaining the shoe in appropriate vertical position for the lasting operations. It is asserted that the claim of the second McFeely which provides for the hold-down mechanism modifies the first by introducing a new 'sequence of operations.' The asserted modifications of both heel band and hold-down are claimed in conjunction with the hand adjustments previously discussed.\n Since the beginning of shoe lasting, it has been recognized that the shoe must be held firmly in the proper position for wiping and tacking. Heels bands and hold-downs similar to those claimed here appear in the record in numerous drawings, specifications, and claims of a long series of patents prior to the one before us. The great number of patents, embodying apparently limitless variations of the same basic principles, suggests that the public had before McFeely's second patent already paid in fullest measure for heel bands and hold-downs.\n Examination of only three of these patents-Plant No. 958,280 (1910), Keyes No. 1,023,854 (1912), and Brock No. 1,188,616 (1916)-is enough to show complete anticipation of the entire principle of the sliding heel band capable of forward and backward movement if not every essential mechanical detail.\n The general claim of the second McFeely which sets out the hold-down mechanism is said to provide for a 'particular sequence' of operations. Insofar as the ambiguities \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 388]\n\u00a0\n of this claim15 permit such a deduction, there is nevertheless a failure to disclose any patentable invention. Of course, the sequence of operations in which the hold-down plays a crucial part is important. For the shoe must be maintained in such a vertical position that the successive strokes of the wipers will perform their proper function. If the shoe is too low with respect to the wipers, the leather will not be bent down sufficiently far; if the shoe is too high with respect to the wipers, the wipers will hit the shoe below the insole and therefore will not produce any bending of the leather at all. But in setting out a mechanism to insure the proper relationship between the level of the shoe and the level of the wipers during successive strokes of the machine, the second McFeely patent is by no means new. Claim 49 of the first McFeely patent includes a 'provision for changing relatively the plane of action of the wipers and the position of the shoe between successive actuations of the wipers.' And in Claim 164 of the first McFeely it appears that the hold-down mechanism was recognized as having a major rule in accomplishing this purpose. For Claim 164 specifically provides 'means for automatically actuating the hold down upwardly and then downwardly again between the initial advance of the wiper and a final retraction of the wiper.' If the 'sequence' of the second McFeely is any different, the difference cannot be seen in the provisions of the claim relied upon, nor is it explained in the record; if, as I believe, the 'sequence' in both patents is the same, the second is invalid because anticipated.\n In short, this record shows that the old elements composing the asserted improvements here had been described and redescribed, claimed and reclaimed as patentable inventions. The respondent has used every one of \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 389]\n\u00a0\n them in previous patents now expired. It should not be allowed to continue its exclusive control over their use and enjoyment.\n There is perhaps another possible ground for concluding that the five claims set out patentable invention. Conceivably the three asserted improvements, although each separately is no more than a mechanical expedient or a simple adaptation of prior invention, could be accepted in combination as an exercise of the inventive faculty. The court below apparently did evaluate the improvements in combination, for it found that taken together, they resulted in a 'new unitary mode of operation of the entire machine.' 6 Cir., 121 F.2d 273, 278. But the statement is unexplained, and I cannot find support for it in the record. On the contrary, comparison of the first and second McFeely patents shows that the basic mode of operation of the entire machine in both was identical. In the earlier machine, the shoe was placed on a last at the end of a jack, firmly held in position while the wiping and tacking took place, and then released. In these fundamental respects, the mode of operation provided for in the second McFeely patent is the same, whatever modifications McFeely may have added for the purpose of increasing adaptability to different sizes of shoes not having affected it in the slightest.\n In any event, 'each claim must stand or fall, as itself sufficiently defining invention, independently of the others.' Altoona Theatres v. American Tri-Ergon Corp., \n294 \nU.S. 477, 487\n, 55 S.Ct. 455, 459. None of the five claims here in suit discloses a 'new unitary mode of operation of the entire machine.' Even if it were possible to deduce from the five claims taken together that McFeely had made such a disclosure, nevertheless the patent ought not to be treated as if the disclosure had actually been made in appropriate form. For the creation of a sixth claim, a combination of the other \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 390]\n\u00a0\n five, which McFeely himself failed to include in his patent would entail a kind of constructive patenting procedure for which there is no judicial or statutory precedent.\n The courts below concluded that the five claims in suit embodied patentable invention. In reaching this conclusion, which I believe is overwhelmingly refuted by examination of the claims themselves against the background of prior developments in the art, heavy reliance was placed on two extrinsic considerations: commercial success and the presumption of validity arising from the fact of issuance of a patent by the Patent Office.\n Commercial Success. When it is a close question whether the changes embodied in a later patent are a sufficient advance over earlier patents to constitute patentable invention, the measure of commercial success of the later patent has been recognized by courts as affording some aid in reaching a conclusion. But while commercial success has been said to have relevance in resolving doubts, Smith v. Hall, \n301 \nU.S. 216, 233\n, 57 S.Ct. 711, 718, it cannot transform an exercise of the common skill of a calling or an adaptation readily suggested by experience with prior inventions or an aggregation of familiar mechanical expedients into patentable invention. Cf. Hildreth v. Mastoras, \n257 \nU.S. 27, 34\n, 42 S.Ct. 20, 23. And where the patent in question reembodies a prior patent not yet expired, its commercial success does quite the reverse of establishing patentability; it establishes the seriousness of the infringement. If the reembodied prior patent has expired, or if it is owned by the owner of the later patent, commercial success is one index of success in appropriating what should have been available to the public or in extending special privileges beyond the legally permitted term.\n I have already given the reasons which convince me that no patentable invention is set out in the five claims in suit. The force of none of those reasons is affected by the commercial success which the respondent has realized. After \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 391]\n\u00a0\n examining the record, I can find no serious doubts to be resolved. All I can deduce from the commercial success of the respondent with these machines is the magnitude of the consequences to the public who have had to pay for the respondent's extension of an undeserved monopoly through the use of an invalid patent.\n Even if the issue of patentable invention were a doubtful one, the force of deductions that might normally be drawn from commercial success is greatly reduced in the circumstances of this case. For, by virtue of its dominant position in the shoe machinery industry, the United Shoe Machinery Corporation was not seriously threatened by loss of business to competitors when it withdrew the first McFeely machine from commercial use. Because there was no compelling economic incentive to hasten the commercial adaptation of the first McFeely machine, the inferences to be made from its withdrawal are extremely weak. Controlling the shoe machinery business to the extent that it did, the respondent was able to accelerate or delay the commercial exploitation of its heel seat lasting machine at its pleasure.\n Moreover, the record indicates that the commercial success relied upon by the courts below would be inconclusive with respect to the second McFeely patent under any circumstances. For there is uncontroverted testimony that of the 1250 later machines in commercial use only 12 were built in accordance with the disclosures of the second McFeely patent. The remainder embody features set out in a subsequent patent, Jorgensen No. 1, 852,015, or a prior patent, Hoyt No. 1,508,394, (declared invalid by the court below) or both. Since I believe that the commercial success of the respondent's machine could in no event establish the validity of the five claims in suit, I do not find it necessary to determine how much of the commercial success of the respondent's machines is to be attributed to features not set out in the second McFeely \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 392]\n\u00a0\n patent. Such a determination does not appear to have been made in the entire course of proceedings in this case.\n Presumption of validity arising from issuance. Quoting from the opinion of this Court in Radio Corp. v. Radio Laboratories, \n293 \nU.S. 1, 8\n, 55 S.Ct. 928, 931, the court below stated that the present case obliged it 'to give consideration to the rule that 'one otherwise an infringer who assails the validity of a patent fair upon its face bears a heavy burden of persuasion, and fails unless his evidence has more than a dubious preponderance.\" 6 Cir., 121 F.2d 273, 277. For reasons I have already set out I can agree neither that the second McFeely is 'a patent fair upon its face' nor that the evidence of non-patentability has no more than a 'dubious preponderance.' Hence, the prerequisites for establishing a presumption of validity are not here present. In the absence of a statutory prescription to the contrary, I see no reason for extending the presumption of validity arising from the mere issuance of a patent beyond the narrow compass indicated by the passage quoted from the Radio Corporation case.\n On the other hand, there are many positive reasons for not doing so. A patent is a grant of exclusive privilege. Yet it is normally issued in a non-adversary proceeding. Indeed, it is the practice of the Patent Office to keep patent applications on file in secrecy until the time of issuance. 16 The public, who will be exclude for 17 years from the field granted to the applicant, are represented only insofar as the enormous volume of business permits the examining staff of the Patent Office to watch out for the public interest. \n17\n Moreover, the patent examiner, unlike the court in an infringement suit, does not have the benefit of the \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 393]\n\u00a0\n researches of opposing counsel upon the state of the prior art. Even where the Patent Office conducts interference proceedings for the purpose of determining priority of invention, a contestant is not permitted to prove that a stranger to the proceedings was the first inventor. He can oppose only his own claim of priority against that of the other party. See Loftin v. Smith, Cust. & Pat.App., 126 F.2d 514, 515.\n Whatever the small weight to be given to the presumption arising from issuance of a patent, it is here overcome by the special circumstance of this case. For the patent in suit like the prior one on which it is asserted to have made improvements was issued to the same patentee and assigned to the same owner. In this kind of situation, the burden of establishing the validity of the second patent is increased, this Court having said that in this 'class of cases it must distinctly appear that the invention covered by the later patent was a separate invention, distinctly different and independent from that covered by the first patent.' Miller v. Eagle Manufacturing Co., \n151 \nU.S. 186, 198\n, 14 S.Ct. 310, 315. At very best, the presumption of validity arising from the mere issuance of a patent might be permitted to tip the scale when other considerations leave the issue of patentability in equilibrium. In the present case, I believe that the emphasis of the court below on this presumption was entirely misplaced.\n As I view this patent its total impact is appalling. Out of its great bulk, the respondent is able to assert only three simple improvements embraced in five claims. And on examination, it appears that these improvements fall far below the established requirements of patentable invention. Yet by its terms the patent as a whole purports to appropriate for exclusive use, not merely these improvements, but a major instrument of production in its entirety. Furthermore, this patent is one of a group which seems to have an interminable capacity for self-perpetua- \n\n[316 \nU.S. 364, 394]\n\u00a0\n tion If judicial approval is to be given to patents of this kind, the public benefits which might reasonably be hoped for under the constitutional provisions and the federal statutes relating to patents can never be attained. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 29 F.Supp. 1015. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 6 Cir., 121 F.2d 273. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 'Any person who has invented or discovered any new and useful ... machine ... or any new and useful improvements thereof ... may ... obtain a patent therefor.'

Nobody, however, dare use the present type of ... machine because of improvements covered by minor patents. Likewise, if the original patent protection obtained on particular machines should not be sustained by the Courts, yet a second line of defense patents covering details and improvements may become a most valuable asset.\n\n'It has always been our ambition to obtain patents which will be related to furnace, melting and refining, feeding, delivery, forming, automatic handling, carrying, stacking and annealing. Conceivably we might lose patent domination of one or more important links, but still retain practical control of the whole chain by means of controlling the most efficient form of the other links.' TNEC Hearings, 777-778.\n\n Cf. TNEC Monograph No. 31, 160: 'A patent provides a sanction but it is about to expire-by some means or other its life must be prolonged. An improvement alone is hardly enough; its importance must be magnified until the line between invention and improvement is completely blurred. A multiplication of improvements is far better; it creates at least an appearance that an industrial art is being transformed.' \n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Jorgensen No. 1,852,015, issued in 1932 and assigned to the respondent, purports to cover improvements on a machine for shaping shoe uppers 'over lasts or other forms.'

Payne, of Dallas, Tex., for respondent Union Terminal Co.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question presented by both these cases is whether a railroad company operating a terminal subject to the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C.A .  181 et seq. and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C.A.  201 et seq., is required by those statutes, in the absence of a negotiated agreement respecting wages, to pay 'red caps' a fixed minimum hourly wage irrespective of the tips from passengers received by the red caps, or whether an accounting and guarantee plan which leaves all tips with the red caps and assures them that each will receive at least the minimum wage is valid.\n The Fair Labor Standards Act is not intended to do away with tipping. Nor does it appear that Congress intended by the general minimum wage to give the tipping employments an earnings-preference over the non-service vocations. The petitioners do not dispute the railroad's contention that, during the entire period, each red cap received as earnings-cash pay plus tips-a sum equal to the required minimum wage. Nor is there denial of increased pay to the red caps on account of the minimum wage guarantee of the challenged plan as compared with the former tipping system. The guarantee also betters the mischief of irregular income from tips and increases wage security. The desirability of considering tips in setting a minimum wage, that is whether tips from the viewpoint of social welfare should be counted as part of \n\n[315 \nU.S. 386, 389]\n\u00a0\n that legal wage, is not for judicial decision. \n1\n We deal here only with the petitioners' assertion that the wages Act requires railroads to pay the red caps the minimum wage without regard to their earnings from tips.\n The cases have a common background. Prior to October 24, 1938, the effective date of the Fair Labor Standands Act, the red caps at the terminals in question performed their familiar tasks without reward other than the tips of the passengers, and although subject to considerable supervision by the terminals2 were not officially considered employees. On September 29, 1938, the Interstate Commerce Commission, acting under  1 of the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C.  151, 45 U.S.C.A.  151, ruled that red caps in cities of over 100,000 population were employees within that Act. 229 I.C.C. 410.\n Subsequent to that ruling the parallel series of events culminating in the two controversies now before us, while differing in details, followed the same general pattern. In No. 112 nothing further occurred until the Fair Labor Standards Act became effective. At that time the Jacksonville Terminal, in supposed compliance with the Act, began paying its red caps in cash the amount by which the statutory minimum wage exceeded each red cap's receipts in tips. This system in some form was used at the terminal until July 1, 1940. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 386, 390]\n\u00a0\n In the belief that the Act required payment of the minimum wage wighout deduction of tips, the red caps, by their representative, Williams, brought an action against the terminal in United States District Court for the recovery of unpaid minimum wages between October 24, 1938, and July 1, 1940, and an equal additional amount as liquidated damages. Jurisdiction of the action was conferred by  24(8) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  41(8), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(8), and by  16(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C.  216(b), 29 U.S.C.A.  216(b).3 The terminal answered and moved for summary judgment. Upon consideration of the exhibits, depositions, and stipulated facts the trial judge granted the motion, and the circuit court of appeals affirmed. 5 Cir., 118 F.2d 324. Because of the importance of the question whether the tips could be treated as payment of the statutory wage, the petition of the red caps' representative for certiorari was granted. \n314 \nU.S. 590\n, 62 S.Ct. 64, 86 L.Ed. --.\n Section 6 of the Act requires every employer to pay each employee engaged in interstate commerce wages at \n\n[315 \nU.S. 386, 391]\n\u00a0\n the prescribed rates per hour. \n4\n Violation of that requirement renders the employer liable for the unpaid wages and for liquidated damages recoverable in an action by the employees' designated agent or representative. \n5\n Since the terminal admitted by stipulation that Williams was the red caps' authorized representative ad litem, that the red caps were its employees, and that they were engaged in interstate commerce, the sole issue was whether the payment required by  6 of the Act had been made.\n The evidence, taken most favorably to the red caps, discloses the following. About October 24, 1938, the effec- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 386, 392]\n\u00a0\n tive date of the Act, the terminal issued a written notice to each red cap:\n'Jacksonville, Florida,\n\n'Oct. 24th, 1938.\n\n'To Red Cap ...,\n\n'Jacksonville Terminal Company:\n\n'In view of the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act, effective October 24, 1938, and in consideration of your hereafter engaging in the handling of hand beggage and traveling effects of passengers or otherwise assisting them at or about stations or destinations, it will be necessary that you report daily to the undersigned the amounts received by you as tips or remuneration for such services.\n\n'The carrier hereby guarantees to each person continuing such service after October 24, 1938 compensation which, together with and including the sums of money received as above provided, which will not be less than the minimum wage provided by law.\n\n'You are privileged to retain subject to their being credited on such guarantee all such tips or remuneration received by you except such portion thereof as may be required of you by the undersigned for taxes of any character imposed upon you by law and collectible by the undersigned.\n\n'All the matters above referred to are subject to the right of the carrier to determine from time to time the number and identity of persons to be permitted to engage in said work and the hours to be devoted thereto, to establish rules and regulations relating to the manner, method and place of rendition of such service, and the accounting required.\n\n'Jacksonville Terminal Company.\n\n'By J. L. Wilkes,\n\n'President-General Manager.' \n\n[315 \nU.S. 386, 393]\n\u00a0\n On November 3rd L. L. Wooten, the General Chairman of the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, received the red caps' designation of the Brotherhood as their bargaining representative. November 4th he saw a copy of the terminal's notice. In the meantime he had written Wilkes on October 25th that in view of the I.C.C. decision he considered the red caps covered by the collective labor agreement of February 1, 1937, between the Brotherhood and the terminal, and within the union's jurisdiction. After the designation the Brotherhood, continually protesting the invalidity of the existing accounting and guarantee system,6 attempted negotiations with the Terminal for a red cap contract. Eventually, June 16, 1939, a contract limited to hours of service and working conditions was signed. Meanwhile the red caps continued their accustomed activities, made the reports, kept the tips, and accepted the sums proffered them by the terminal. At first no receipts for wage payments were required at Jacksonville; later receipts were introduced expressly reserving the red caps' right to sue for additional amounts under the Act. \n7\n On July 1, 1940, the terminal inaugurated a new system of charging passengers ten cents per parcel for red cap service, and paying the red caps an hourly wage. An agreement with the Brotherhood reducing this arrangement to writing and ending the controversial accounting and guarantee system was signed August 9th.\n\n\n\n[315 \nU.S. 386, 394]\n\u00a0\n\n No. 1023\n is a similar proceeding brought against the Union Terminal Company by Pickett, the agent of forty-five red caps working in the Dallas terminal. At the trial the evidence, consisting of an agreed statement of facts, some exhibits, and some uncontradicted testimony, indicated, and the trial judge found, that the red caps were employees of the terminal and were engaged in interstate commerce. He further found that prior to the Fair Labor Standards Act the red caps were paid by the tips of the public, that no other contract was made on or since October 22, 1938, and that the question of tips as wages was still an open one. On the ground that tips of the public were not wages paid by the employer, he gave judgment in favor of the red caps. The circuit court of appeals reversed, 5 Cir., 118 F.2d 328, and certiorari was denied. \n313 \nU.S. 591\n, 61 S.Ct. 1115, 85 .l.Ed. 1546. Because of the importance of the issues presented, on petition for rehearing certiorari was granted. \n314 \nU.S. 704\n, 62 S.Ct. 55, 86 L.Ed. --.\n Since the basic elements of Pickett's case are no longer in dispute, the crucial issue again is whether the minimum wages were paid. It was shown that after the I.C.C. ruling that red caps were employees, the red caps notified the Dallas terminal on October 11, 1938, that the Board of Adjustment of the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks was their authorized representative under the Railway Labor Act, and Pickett, as General Chairman of the Board, asked for a conference in order to negotiate an agreement. On October 22d, the terminal delivered to each red cap a letter, signed by Buckner, the terminal's vice-president and general manager, in the same terms as the notice used at the Jacksonville terminal.\n Two days later on October 24th, the effective date of the wage law, Pickett, on behalf of the red caps and at \n\n[315 \nU.S. 386, 395]\n\u00a0\n their request, protested this proposal in a letter to Buckner,8 concluding:\n'This letter is formal notice to the carrier, made for and on behalf of each employee concerned as a protest against the method proposed by the carrier to meet its \n\n[315 \nU.S. 386, 396]\n\u00a0\n obligation under the said law, and since it appears that the carrier has acted in the premise without authority of law or upon order of the Administrator, we are accordingly filing this notice of protest, for the reasons set forth herein.'\n\n No action was ever taken to recall or revoke the letter of protest and the individual red caps never told the company that they accepted the terms of its letter of October 24th.\n On December 26th, 1938, Pickett submitted to Buckner a proposed general agreement covering the hours of service and working conditions of the red caps, but not their wages. After protracted consideration of the matter by both the terminal and the union, Buckner wrote Pickett on December 6, 1939, as follows:\n'As I told you and as you know, this case as to whether or not the railroads will be allowed credit for tips received up to $2.40 per day, is in the Court and as soon as same is decided we will be glad to negotiate an agreement with the Clerks Union, of which you are the General Chairman for this Company.'\n\n On January 1, 1940, although the wage dispute was not yet settled, a working agreement of the limited type Pickett had proposed was signed. On March 6, 1940, the accounting and guarantee system was abandoned by the terminal, presumably for the ten cent per parcel charge, and the following day this action was commenced. Throughout the entire preceding period the red caps had performed their usual duties, had filed slips showing the hours worked and, except for a brief period, the tips received, had kept the tips, and had accepted the money paid by the terminal pursuant to its guarantee. Never, however, was the demand for additional pay abandoned, and no red caps were discharged for refusing to expressly consent to the terminal's action. \n\n[315 \nU.S. 386, 397]\n\u00a0\n Effect of Terminals' Notice. The terminal companies instituted the accounting and guarantee system by the written notice, quoted above, to each red cap as the Act became effective. It is accepted here by all parties that, both prior and subsequent to the notice, the red caps were employees of the railroads9 engaged in a service 'so closely related to physical transportation' in interstate commerce as to come under section 6( 1) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  6(1). Stopher v. Cincinnati Union Terminal, 246 I.C.C. 41, 45. As such employees, before the notice they were permitted by agreement to come upon the terminal property, render supervised service to the companies' customers and receive pay for performing this portion of the terminals' transportation business by retaining all tips received. This employment of the red caps was at will and subject to the employers' conclusions as to the desirability of continuing their employment. In businesses where tipping is customary, the tips, in the absence of an explicit contrary understanding, belong to the recipient. Polites v. Barlin, 149 Ky. 376, 149 S.W. 828, 41 L.R.A.,N.S., 1217; Zappas v. Roumeliote, 156 Iowa 709, 137 N.W. 935; Manubens v. Leon, (1919) 1 K.B. 208. Where, however, an arrangement is made by which the employee agrees to turn over the tips to the employer, in the absence of statutory interference, no reason is perceived for its invalidity. \n10\n The employer furnishes the facilities, supervises the work and \n\n[315 \nU.S. 386, 398]\n\u00a0\n may take the compensation paid by travelers for the service, whether paid as a fixed charge or as a tip. A tip to a red cap is compensation for service. It is customarily given and always expected when such service is rendered.\n With the effective date of the Act the employers became bound to pay a minimum wage to their employees, the red caps. Accordingly the latter were notified that future earnings from tips must be accounted for and considered as wages. Although continuously protesting the authority of the railroads to take over the tips, the red caps remained at work subject to the requirement. Such protests were unavailing against the employers. Although the new plan was not satisfactory to the red caps, the notice transferred to the railroads' credit so much of the tips as it affected. By continuing to work, a new contract was created. This result follows because the employer, after notice, may keep all earnings arising from the business. Labatt, Master & Servant, (2d ed.) Vol. 5,  2037; Restatement, Agency,  388. If the red cap did not accept the terms offered he would be a volunteer and not an employee. As a volunteer he could probably keep his tips, but would not be entitled to a contractual wage. Restatement, Contracts,  55. No such gift of services to the terminals is here claimed.\n Railway Labor Act. Petitioners assert that whatever may be the authority to issue orders for the accounting and guarantee plan these railroads could not validly exercise the power because of the Railway Labor Act. 48 Stat. 1185. The applicable provisions are quoted in the note below. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n[315 \nU.S. 386, 399]\n\u00a0\n The object of the Act is to avoid interruption to commerce through the promotion of free association among employees for the purpose of settling disputes between them and the carriers. Sec. 2. To assure continued operations, changes by the carriers in agreements reached through collective bargaining, pending negotiations, are prohibited. Independent individual contracts are not affected by the Act. It is to be noted that section 2, First to Sixth, inclusive, relied upon by petitioners is largely concerned with the organization of employees, freedom from carrier interference in such organization, the choice of representatives for collective bargaining and the manner \n\n[315 \nU.S. 386, 400]\n\u00a0\n of entering into and carrying on such negotiations. Section 2, Seventh, note 11, supra, forbids changes of pay or working conditions of employees 'as a class as embodied in agreements' except as provided in section 6, note 11 supra. The crucial section 6 is phrased so as to leave no doubt that only agreements, reached after collective bargaining were covered. Section 2, Seventh, first appeared in the 1934 amendments to the Railway Labor Act and section 6 was likewise then amended by adding 'in agreements' to that section's former requirement of notice of 'an intended change affecting rates of pay, rules, or working conditions.' Compare Sec. 6, 44 Stat. 582, with Sec. 6, 48 Stat. 1197. These additions point squarely to limiting the bargaining provisions of the Railway Labor Act to collective action. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n In No. 112, the Jacksonville case, petitioners find such an agreement in the contract of February 1, 1937, the 'Revised Agreement Between the Jacksonville Terminal Company and Employees Herein Named Represented by the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and Station Employees.' The scope of that agreement is limited to the hours of service and working conditions of certain groups of employees in none of which do red caps appear. \n13\n Wages are not covered. When the contract was negotiated, the red caps were not thought of as employees engaged in \n\n[315 \nU.S. 386, 401]\n\u00a0\n transportation service. \n14\n Evidently the red caps only authorized the contracting Brotherhood to represent them after the notice. \n15\n Neither party to the agreement took any steps in regard to the red caps under the 1937 agreement until after the disputed plan was instituted. Thereafter, when the Brotherhood first claimed that the red caps were covered by the 1937 Clerks' contract, the suggestion was promptly repudiated in writing by the terminal company. Finally, after the authorization, the Brotherhood did immediately begin negotiations for the red caps and ultimately secured a collective contract, June 16, 1939, which covered hours of service and working conditions and which embodied much that was in the Clerks' contract. Subsequently a wage agreement of August 9, 1940, became a part of this earlier working agreement. While no finding as to its coverage appears in the record, we are clear from the 1937 contract, its practical application by the parties and the new arrangements ultimately concluded that the red caps were not within its terms.\n A different approach to this particular problem is made by petitioner in No. 1023, the Union Terminal case. The \n\n[315 \nU.S. 386, 402]\n\u00a0\n Dallas red caps do not rest their argument upon any collective agreement. Their contention is that since the Brotherhood of Clerks, their then accredited representative for the purposes of the Railway Labor Act, had asked the terminal on October 11, 1938, for a conference to negotiate an agreement for working conditions and other related subjects, the subsequent act of the terminal in establishing the accounting and guarantee plan violated the Railway Labor Act and was therefore ineffective to change the existing arrangements by which the red caps retained the tips as their own. This, it is urged, would result in a recovery of the minimum wage without credit to the carrier for the tips. Petitioner relies upon the first six paragraphs of section 2 of the Railway Labor Act, 48 Stat. 1186, 1187, and particularly section 2, First, note 11, supra, placing the duty on the carrier to 'make ... agreements ... in order to avoid any interruption ... to the operation of any carrier.'\n The Brotherhood and the terminal did negotiate and finally concluded, effective January 1, 1940, their first collective working agreement covering the red caps. Because the carrier was, by the act, placed under the duty to exert every effort to make collective agreements, it does not follow that pending those negotiations, where no collective bargaining agreements are or have been in effect, the carrier cannot exercise its authority to arrange its business relations with its employees in the manner shown in this record. As we have stated in discussing the Jacksonville case, the Railway Labor Act dealt with collective bargaining agreements only and not with the employment of individuals. This conclusion is pertinent in considering the effect of the Dallas request for collective bargaining.\n The institution of negotiations for collective bargaining does not change the authority of the carrier. The prohibi- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 386, 403]\n\u00a0\n tions of section 6 against change of wages or conditions pending bargaining and those of section 2, Seventh, are aimed at preventing changes in conditions previously fixed by collective bargaining agreements. Arrangements made after collective bargaining obviously are entitled to a higher degree of permanency and continuity than those made by the carrier for its own convenience and purpose.\n Minimum Wages. We stated in the discussion of the notice given by the terminals to their employees that its effect was to transfer the tips covered by the notice to the credit of the terminals. But this terminal credit in the hands of the red caps, assert petitioners in both cases, cannot be utilized as cash paid to the employee by the employer. \n16\n It is urged that the terminals have worked out a scheme to largely relieve themselves of wage payments to red caps and to let travelers pay 'amounts which the law requires should be paid by the employer itself' and that the accounting difficulties make the plan not only undesirable but contrary to the policy of the statute as likely to foster false reports of tips by red caps in order to reach the minimum and save the terminals from any guarantee payments.\n Section 6, 29 U.S.C.A.  206, prescribed that 'Every employer shall pay to each of his employees ... wages at the following rates ....' Wages are defined only by the direction to include \n\n[315 \nU.S. 386, 404]\n\u00a0\n in that word the 'reasonable cost ... to the employer of furnishing such employee with board, lodging, or other facilities ....' What the word 'wages' connotes in addition to the items specified, we must deduce from other provisions of the act in the light of its legislative purpose. Obviously 'pay-wages' ordinarily means for the employer to hand over money or orders convertible into money at face. The absence of the word 'tip' from the statutory extension of the ordinary meaning of wages makes it quite clear that not every gratuity given a worker by his employer's customer is a part of his wages. If Congress had had it in mind to include in wages all tips, the words were readily available for expressing the thought. Such a conclusion, however, does not foreclose a decision that in certain specific situations the so-called tips may be in reality the employee's compensation for his services and therefore wages.\n The diverse interests of employers and employees have variously influenced legislators to include, exclude, or ignore tips in the specification of wage items in enactments where the wage base was important. For example, the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act,17 which also applies to employment in the District of Columbia,18 specifically includes tips for computation of compensation. Workmen's compensation acts are usually construed as including tips in wages or remuneration, with a tendency to make the inclusion of tips as wages turn upon the contemplation of the parties, express or implied, in wage contracts. \n19\n State minimum wage acts are gen- \n\n[315 \nU.S. 386, 405]\n\u00a0\n erally silent as to tips. \n20\n Under the N.R.A. the inclusion of tips in wages on a plan similar to the accounting and \n\n[315 \nU.S. 386, 406]\n\u00a0\n guarantee plan, here involved, was proposed. 21 In the approved codes tips were not expressly credited toward wages, but the relatively lower minimums for those customarily receiving tips may indicate that tips were given weight although not expressly mentioned. \n22\n The federal social security laws define wages for old age benefits23 and social security taxes24 as 'all remuneration for employment, including the cash value of all remuneration paid in any medium other than cash.' The regulations of the Social Security Board state, 'The following are excluded from the computation of 'wages': ... Tips or gratuities paid directly to an employee by a customer of an employer, and not in any way accounted for by the employee to the employer.' \n25\n The Railroad Retirement Act,  1(h),26 \n\n[315 \nU.S. 386, 407]\n\u00a0\n and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act,  1(i)27 exclude tips from 'compensation' within the meaning of their provisions. The Railroad Retirement Board has determined that all earnings of the red caps, accounted for to the carriers under the plan here in question, are 'money remuneration' and therefore 'compensation' under the acts and not forbidden 'tips'.28 We can therefore examine the Fair Labor Standards Act with the safe assumption that the word 'wages' has no fixed meaning either including or excluding gratuities.\n To interpret 'pay-wages' as limited to money passing from the terminal to the red cap would let construction of an important statute turn on a narrow technicality. It, of course, can make no practical difference whether the red caps first turn in their tips and then receive their minimum wage or are charged with the tips received up to the minimum wage per hour. \n29\n\u00a0\n\n[315 \nU.S. 386, 408]\n\u00a0\n Congress approached the problem of improving labor conditions by the establishment of a minimum wage in certain industries. It required that workers in these industries receive a compensation at least as great as that fixed by the Act. Except for that requirement the employer was left free, in so far as the Act was concerned, to work out the compensation problem in his own way. Other courts are in accord with our view. Harrison v. Kansas City Terminal Ry. Co., D.C., 36 F.Supp. 434; Harrison v. Terminal R.R. Ass'n of St. Louis, 8 Cir., 126 F.2d 421; Ryan v. Denver Union Terminal Co., 10 Cir., 126 F.2d 782.\n The other arguments of petitioner have been considered but we find only two that require mention.\n First. It is said that if the carriers take credit for the tips as compensation for red cap service, it would be in effect a charge by the terminals for a transportation service, and therefore, since the terminals have filed no covering tariff, a violation of  6(7) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 34 Stat. 587, 49 U.S.C.  6(7), 49 U.S.C.A.  6(7).30 Furthermore, petitioners assert section 2 of the same act, prohibiting special rates, is violated because by the carrier's regulations the indigent receive the red cap service without charge. Neither contention, if true, would avail petitioners. Sections 8, 9 and 10 of the Interstate Commerce \n\n[315 \nU.S. 386, 409]\n\u00a0\n Act 49 U.S.C.A.  8-10, provide for damages to persons injured by unlawful acts and punishment of the carrier or its agents. There is nothing in the sections to indicate that petitioners would have a right of action. \n31\n\u00a0\n\n Second. It is urged in the Dallas case that the terminal from March 1, 1939, to October 15, 1939, voluntarily abandoned the accounting and guarantee system in favor of the old system of non-accountability for tips. We find nothing in the modified accounting practice during that period to support such a conclusion. Rather the terminal seems only to have simplified its bookkeeping and partially relieved the red caps of clerical duties. Prior to March 1, 1939, and after October 15th, the red caps had to make a daily report of both hours worked and tips received, regardless of amount, on a printed time slip furnished by the terminal for the purpose. Between March 1st and October 15th, the time slips furnished by the company contained no provision for reporting tips, but only for reporting hours. \n32\n But the red caps were instructed \n\n[315 \nU.S. 386, 410]\n\u00a0\n that should any of them during any work period receive in tips less than 25 cents per hour, the statutory minimum hourly wage, he should report it to the terminal and the terminal would pay the difference between the tips received and the minimum wage. Thus the only effect of the change was to eliminate the superfluous reporting of tips equalling or exceeding the minimum wage-a step toward more efficient administration, not elimination, of the accounting and guarantee system.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MURPHY concur.\n I think the judgments should be reversed. It appears to me that the question in these cases is: Upon whom does the statute impose the duty of paying a minimum wage, the employer or someone else? There is no ambiguity in the congressional mandate that 'Every employer shall pay to each of his employees ... wages ... not less than 30 cents an hour.' I am unable to agree that tips given to red caps by travellers are 'wages' paid to the red caps by the railroad.\n The employers here could have openly charged a fee for the services performed by red caps. It appears that they have now adopted such a system. It is said that there is no practical difference between a system under which the railroads openly impose a charge on the public and one under which the red caps accept from travellers so-called tips, treated by the railroad as a part of the red caps' wages. Generally, the traveller who pays a railroad charge knows he is paying it to the railroad. One who gives a red cap a tip does not necessarily know that he is thereby helping the railroad to discharge its statutory duty \n\n[315 \nU.S. 386, 411]\n\u00a0\n of paying a minimum wage to its employees. The tip paying public is entitled to know whom it tips, the red cap or the railroad. A plan like that before us, which covertly diverts tips from employees for whom the giver intended them to employers for whom the giver did not intend them and to whom any kind of tip doubtless would not have been voluntarily given, seems to me to contain an element of deception. And I think that an interpretation of the F.L.S.A. which permits employers to benefit from such a plan does not accord with the meaning of the language used by Congress. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Anderson, Tips and Legal Minimum Wages, XXXI American Labor Legislation Review 11; Gilson, Tips and Social Insurance, id. 67; Needleman Tipping as a Factor in Wages, Monthly Labor Review, December 1937, p. 1303. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] For example, the terminals forbade the collection of charges for red cap services, issued instructions for the meeting of sick or disabled passengers, provided equipment for that purpose, and required that rep caps be uniformed and suitably dispersed about the terminal at such hours and in such places as their services would be needed. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] '(b) Any employer who violates the provisions of section 6 (206) or section 7 (207) of this Act (title) shall be liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of their unpaid minimum wages, or their unpaid overtime compensation, as the case may be, and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.

Probably this is due to the fact that in most states the statute does not fix the minimum, but merely authorizes some board or official to do so by orders, occupation by occupation. Such orders as relate to trades in which tipping is common seem to take tips into consideration in setting the minimum wage for that trade, and quite naturally, therefore, are apt expressly to forbid crediting of tips against the minimum.\n E.g., New York State Dept. of Labor, Minimum Wage Standards, Directory Order No. 5, Restaurant Industry, effective June 3, 1940, provides: 'Service Employees Basic Rate. The basic minimum wage for service employees in New York City shall be at the rate of 20 cents per hour. ... Non-Service Employees Basic Rate.

In no event shall gratuities from patrons or others be counted as part of the minimum wage. Service Employee.

Strickland, of Lenoir, N.C., for petitioners.\n Mr. Hughes J. Rhodes, of Burlington, N.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners were tried and convicted of bigamous cohabitation under  4342 of the North Carolina Code,1 1939, and each was sentenced for a term of years to a state prison. The judgment of conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of North Carolina. 220 N.C. 445, 17 S.E.2d 769. The case is here on certiorari. \n315 \nU.S. 795\n, 62 S.Ct. 918\n\n\n Petitioner Williams was married to Carrie Wyke in 1916 in North Carolina and lived with her there until May, 1940. Petitioner Hendrix was married to Thomas Hendrix in 1920 in North Carolina and lived with him there until May, 1940. At that time petitioners went to Las Vegas, Nevada and on June 26, 1940, each filed a divorce action in the Nevada court. The defendants in those divorce actions entered no appearance nor were they served with process in Nevada. In the case of defendant Thomas Hendrix service by publication was had by publication of the summons in a Law Vegas newspaper and by mailing a copy of the summons and complaint to his last post office address. \n2\n In the case of defendant Carrie Wil- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 290]\n\u00a0\n liams a North Carolina sheriff delivered to her in North Carolina a copy of the summons and complaint. A decree of divorce was granted petitioner Williams by the Nevada court on August 26, 1940, on the grounds of extreme cruelty, the court finding that 'the plaintiff has been and now is a bona fide and continuous resident of the County of Clark, State of Nevada, and had been such resident for more than six weeks immediately preceding the commencement of this action in the manner prescribed by law'.3 The Nevada court granted petitioner Hendrix a divorce on October 4, 1940, on the grounds of wilful neglect and extreme cruelty and made the same finding as to this petitioner's bona fide residence in Nevada as it made in the case of Williams. Petitioners were married to each other in Nevada on October 4, 1940. Thereafter they returned to North Carolina where they lived together until the indictment was returned. Petitioners pleaded not guilty and offered in evidence exemplified copies of the Nevada proceedings, contending that the divorce drcrees and the Nevada marriage were valid in North Carolina as well as in Nevada. The State contended that since neither of the defendants in the Nevada actions was served in Nevada nor entered an appearance there, the Nevada decrees would not be recognized as valid in North Carolina. On this issue the court charged the jury in substance that \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 291]\n\u00a0\n a Nevada divorce decree based on substituted service where the defendant made no appearance would not be recognized in North Carolina under the rule of Pridgen v. Pridgen, 203 N.C. 533, 166 S.E. 591. The State further contended that petitioners went to Nevada not to establish a bona fide residence but solely for the purpose of taking advantage of the laws of that State to obtain a divorce through fraud upon that court. On that issue the court charged the jury that under the rule of State v. Herron, 175 N.C. 754, 94 S.E. 698, the defendants had the burden of satisfying the jury, but not beyond a reasonable doubt, of the bona fides of their residence in Nevada for the required time. Petitioners excepted to these charges. The Supreme Court of North Carolina in affirming the judgment held that North Carolina was not required to recognize the Nevada decrees under the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution (Art. IV,  1) by reason of Haddock v. Haddock, \n201 \nU.S. 562\n, 26 S.Ct. 525, 5 Ann.Cas. 1. The intimation in the majority opinion (220 N.C. pages 460- 464, 17 S.E.2d 769) that the Nevada divorces were collusive suggests that the second theory on which the state tried the case may have been an alternative ground for the decision below, adequate to sustain the judgment under the rule of Bell v. Bell, \n181 \nU.S. 175\n, 21 S.Ct. 551-a case in which this Court held that a decree of divorce was not entitled to full faith and credit when it had been granted on constructive service by the courts of a state in which neither spouse was domiciled. But there are two reasons why we do not reach that issue in this case. In the first place, North Carolina does not seek to sustain the judgment below on that ground. Moreover it admits that there probably is enough evidence in the record to require that petitioners be considered 'to have been actually domiciled in Nevada.' In the second place, the verdict against petitioners was a general one. Hence even though the doctrine of Bell v. Bell, supra, were to be deemed applicable here, we cannot determine on this rec- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 292]\n\u00a0\n ord that petitioners were not convicted on the other theory on which the case was tried and submitted, viz. the invalidity of the Nevada decrees because of Nevada's lack of jurisdiction over the defendants in the divorce suits. That is to say, the verdict of the jury for all we know may have been rendered on that ground alone, since it did not specify the basis on which it rested. It therefore follows here as in Stromberg v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 359, 368\n, 51 S.Ct. 532, 535, 73 A.L.R. 1484, that if one of the grounds for conviction is invalid under the Federal Constitution, the judgment cannot be sustained. No reason has been suggested why the rule of the Stromberg case is inapplicable here. Nor has any reason been advanced why the rule of the Stromberg case is not both appropriate and necessary for the protection of rights of the accused. To say that a general verdict of guilty should be upheld though we cannot know that it did not rest on the invalid constitutional ground on which the case was submitted to the jury, would be to countenance a procedure which would cause a serious impairment of constitutional rights. Accordingly, we cannot avoid meeting the Haddock v. Haddock issue in this case by saying that the petitioners acquired no bona fide domicil in Nevada. , if the case had been tried and submitted on that issue only, we would have quite a different problem, as Bell v. Bell indicates. We have no occasion to meet that issue now and we intimate no opinion on it. However it might be resolved in another proceeding, we cannot evade the constitutional issue in this case on the easy assumption that petitioners' domicil in Nevada was a sham and a fraud. Rather we must treat the present case for the purpose of the limited issue before us precisely the same as if petitioners had resided in Nevada for a term of years and had long ago acquired a permanent abode there. In other words, we would reach the question whether North Carolina could refuse to recognize the Nevada decrees because in its view and contrary to \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 293]\n\u00a0\n the findings of the Nevada court petitioners had no actual, bona fide domicil in Nevada, if and only if we concluded that Haddock v. Haddock was correctly decided. But we do not think it was.\n The Haddock case involved a suit for separation and alimony brought in New York by the wife on personal service of the husband. The husband pleaded in defense a divorce drcree obtained by him in Connecticut where he had established a separate domicil. This Court held that New York, the matrimonial domicil where the wife still resided, need not give full faith and credit to the Connecticut decree, since it was obtained by the husband who wrongfully left his wife in the matrimonial domicil, service on her having been obtained by publication and she not having entered an appearance in the action. But we do not agree with the theory of the Haddock case that, so far as the marital status of the parties is concerned,4 a decree of divorce granted under such circumstances by one state need not be given full faith and credit in another.\n Article IV,  1 of the Constitution not only directs that 'Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and Judicial Proceedings of every other State' but also provides that 'Congress may be general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.' Congress has exercised that power. By the Act of May 26, 1790, c. 11, 28 U.S.C.  687, 28 U.S.C.A.  687, Congress has provided that judgments 'shall have such faith and credit given to them in every court within the United States as they have by law or usage in the courts of the State from which they are taken.' Chief Justice Marshall stated in Hampton v. M'Connel, 3 Wheat. 234, 235, that 'the judgment of a state court should have the same credit, \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 294]\n\u00a0\n validity, and effect, in every other court in the United States, which it had in the state where it was pronounced, and that whatever pleas would be good to a suit thereon in such state, and none others, could be pleaded in any other court in the United States.' That view has survived substantially intact. Fauntleroy v. Lum, \n210 \nU.S. 230\n, 28 S.Ct. 641. This Court only recently stated that Art. IV,  1 and the Act of May 26, 1790 require that 'not some but full' faith and credit be given judgments of a state court. Davis v. Davis, \n305 \nU.S. 32, 40\n, 59 S.Ct. 3, 6, 118 A.L.R. 1518. Thus even though the cause of action could not be entertained in the state of the forum either because it had been barred by the local statute of limitations or contravened local policy, the judgment thereon obtained in a sister state is entitled to full faith and credit. See Christmas v. Russell, 5 Wall. 290; Fauntleroy v. Lum, supra; Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, \n252 \nU.S. 411\n, 40 S.Ct. 371, 10 A.L.R. 716; Titus v. Wallick, \n306 \nU.S. 282, 291\n, 59 S.Ct. 557, 562. Some exceptions have been engrafted on the rule laid down by Chief Justice Marshall. But as stated by Mr. Justice Brandeis in Broderick v. Rosner, \n294 \nU.S. 629, 642\n, 55 S.Ct. 589, 592, 100 A.L.R. 1133, 'the room left for the play of conflicting policies is a narrow one.' So far as judgments are concerned the decisions, 5 as distinguished from dicta,6 show that the \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 295]\n\u00a0\n actual exceptions have been few and far between, apart from Haddock v. Haddock. For this Court has been reluctant to admit exceptions in case of judgments rendered by the courts of a sister state, since the 'very purpose' of Art. IV,  1 was 'to alter the status of the several states as independent foreign sovereignties, each free to ignore obligations created under the laws or by the judicial proceedings of the others, and to make them integral parts of a single nation.' Milwaukee County v. M. E. White Co., supra, 296 U.S. at pages 276, 277, 56 S.Ct. at page 234.\n This Court, to be sure, has recognized that in case of statutes, 'the extrastate effect of which Congress has not prescribed', some 'accommodation of the conflicting interests of the two states' is necessary. Alaska Packers Ass'n v. Industrial Accident Comm., \n294 \nU.S. 532, 547\n, 55 S.Ct. 518, 523. But that principle would come into play only in case the Nevada decrees were assailed on the ground that Nevada must give full faith and credit in its divorce proceedings to the divorce statutes of North Carolina. Even then, it would be of no avail here. For as stated in the Alaska Packers case, 'Prima facie every state is entitled to enforce in its own courts its own statutes, lawfully enacted. One who challenges that right, because of the force given to a conflicting statute of another state by the full faith and credit clause, assumes the burden of showing, upon some rational basis, that of the conflicting interests involved those of the foreign state are superior to those of the \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 296]\n\u00a0\n forum.' Id., 294 U.S. at pages 547, 548, 55 S.Ct. at page 524. It is difficult to perceive how North Carolina could be said to have an interest in Nevada's domiciliaries superior to the interest of Nevada. Nor is there any authority which lends support to the view that the full faith and credit clause compels the courts of one state to subordinate the local policy of that state, as respects its domiciliaries, to the statutes of any other state. Certainly Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper, \n286 \nU.S. 145\n, 52 S.Ct. 571, 82 A.L.R. 696, did not so hold. Indeed, the recent case of Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm., \n306 \nU.S. 493, 502\n, 59 S.Ct. 629, 633, held that in the case of statutes 'the full faith and credit clause does not require one state to substitute for its own statute, applicable to persons and events within it, the conflicting statute of another state, even though that statute is of controlling force in the courts of the state of its enactment with respect to the same persons and events.'\n Moreover Haddock v. Haddock is not based on the contrary theory. Nor did it hold that a decree of divorce granted by the courts of one state need not be given full faith and credit in another if the grounds for the divorce would not be recognized by the courts of the forum. It does not purport to challenge or disturb the rule, earlier established by Christmas v. Russell, supra, and subsequently fortified by Fauntleroy v. Lum, supra, that even though the cause of action could not have been entertained in the state of the forum, a judgment obtained thereon in a sister state is entitled to full faith and credit. For the majority opinion in the Haddock case accepted both Cheever v. Wilson, 9 Wall. 108, and Atherton v. Atherton, \n181 \nU.S. 155\n, 21 S.Ct. 544. Cheever v. Wilson held that a decree of divorce granted by a state in which one spouse was domiciled and which had personal jurisdiction over the other was as conclusive in other states as it was in the state where it was obtained. Atherton v. Atherton held that full faith and credit must be given a decree of divorce granted by \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 297]\n\u00a0\n the state of the matrimonial domicil on constructive service against the other spouse who was a non-resident of that state. The decisive difference between those cases and Haddock v. Haddock was said to be that in the latter the state granting the divorce had no jurisdiction over the absent spouse, since it was not the state of the matrimonial domicil, but the place where the husband had acquired a separate domicil after having wrongfully left his wife. This Court accordingly classified Haddock v. Haddock with that group of cases which hold that when the courts of one state do not have jurisdiction either of the subject matter or of the person of the defendant, the courts of another state are not required by virtue of the full faith and credit clause to enforce the judgment. \n7\n But such differences in result between Haddock v. Haddock and the cases which preceded it rest on distinctions which in our view are immaterial, so far as the full faith and credit clause and the supporting legislaion are concerned.\n The historical view that a proceeding for a divorce was a proceeding in rem (2 Bishop, Marriage & Divorce, 4th Ed.,  164) was rejected by the Haddock case. We likewise agree that it does not aid in the solution of the problem presented by this case to label these proceedings as proceedings in rem. Such a suit, however, is not a mere in personam action. Domicil of the plaintiff, immaterial to jurisdiction in a personal action, is recognized in the Haddock case and elsewhere (Beale, Conflict of Laws,  110.1) as essential in order to give the court jurisdiction which will entitle the divorce decree to extraterritorial effect, at least when the defendant has neither been personally served nor entered an appearance. The findings \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 298]\n\u00a0\n made in the divorce decrees in the instant case must be treated on the issue before us as meeting those requirements. For it seems clear that the provision of the Nevada statute that a plaintiff in this type of case must 'reside' in the State for the required period8 requires him to have a domicil9 as distinguished from a mere residence in the state. Latterner v. Latterner, 51 Nev. 285, 274 P. 194; Lamb v. Lamb, 57 Nev. 421, 65 P.2d 872. Hence the decrees in this case like other divorce decrees are more than in personam judgments. They involve the marital status of the parties. Domicil creates a relationship to the state which is adequate for numerous exercises of state power. See Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 276, 279\n, 52 S.Ct. 556, 87 A.L.R. 374, People of State of New York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves, \n300 \nU.S. 308, 313\n, 57 S.Ct. 466, 467, 108 A.L.R. 721; Milliken v. Meyer, \n311 \nU.S. 457, 463\n, 464 S., 61 S. Ct. 339, 342, 343, 132 A.L.R. 1357; Skiriotes v. Florida, \n313 \nU.S. 69\n, 61 S.Ct. 924. Each state as a sovereign has a rightful and legitimate concern in the marital status of persons domiciled within its borders. The marriage relation creates problems of large social importance. Protection of offspring, property interests, and the enforcement of marital responsibilities are but a few of commanding problems in the field of domestic relations with which the state must deal. Thus it is plain that each state by virtue of its command over its domiciliaries and its large interest in the institution of marriage can alter within its \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 299]\n\u00a0\n own borders the marriage status of the spouse domiciled there, even though the other spouse is absent. There is no constitutional barrier if the form and nature of the substituted service (see Milliken v. Meyer, supra, 311 U. S. at page 463, 61 S.Ct. at page 342, 132 A.L.R. 1357) meet the requirements of due process. Atherton v. Atherton, supra, 181 U.S. at page 172, 21 S.Ct. at page 550. Accordingly it was admitted in the Haddock case that the divorce decree though not recognized in New York was binding on both spouses in Connecticut where granted. \n201 \nU.S. 569, 572\n, 575 S., 579, 26 S.Ct. 527, 528, 529, 531, 5 Ann.Cas. 1. And this Court in Maynard v. Hill, \n125 \nU.S. 190\n, 8 S.Ct. 723, upheld the validity within the Territory of Oregon of a divorce decree granted by the legislature to a husband domiciled there, even though the wife resided in Ohio where the husband had deserted her. It therefore follows that, if the Nevada decrees are taken at their full face value (as they must be on the phase of the case with which we are presently concerned), they were wholly effective to change in that state the marital status of the petitioners and each of the other spouses by the North Carolina marriages. Apart from the requirements of procedural due process (Atherton v. Atherton, supra, 181 U.S. at page 172, 21 S.Ct. at page 550) not challenged here by North Carolina, no reason based on the Federal Constitution has been advanced for the contrary conclusion. But the concession that the decrees were effective in Nevada makes more compelling the reasons for rejection of the theory and result of the Haddock case.\n This Court stated in Atherton v. Atherton, supra, 181 U.S. at page 162, 21 S.Ct. at page 547, that 'A husband without a wife, or a wife without a husband, is unknown to the law.' But if one is lawfully divorced and remarried in Nevada and still married to the first spouse in North Carolina, an even more complicated and serious condition would be realized. We would then have what the Supreme Court of Illinois declared to be the 'most perplexing and distressing complication in the domestic relations of many citizens in the different states.' Dunham v. Dunham, 162 Ill. 589, 607, 44 N.E. 841, 847, 35 L.R.A. 70. Under the cir- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 300]\n\u00a0\n cumstances of this case, a man would have two wives, a wife two husbands. The reality of a sentence to prison proves that that is no mere play on words. Each would be a bigamist for living in one state with the only one with whom the other state would permit him lawfully to live. Children of the second marriage would be bastards in one state but legitimate in the other. And all that would flow from the legalistic notion that where one spouse is wrongfully deserted he retains power over the matrimonial domicil so that the domicil of the other spouse follows him wherever he may go, while if he is to blame, he retains no such power. But such considerations are inapposite. As stated by Mr. Justice Holmes in his dissent in the Haddock case, 201 U.S. at page 630, 26 S.Ct. at page 552, 5 Ann.Cas. 1, they constitute a 'pure fiction, and fiction always is a poor ground for changing substantial rights.' Furthermore, the fault or wrong of one spouse in leaving the other becomes under that view a jurisdictional fact on which this Court would ultimately have to pass. Whatever may be said as to the practical effect which such a rule would have in clouding divorce decrees, the question as to where the fault lies has no relevancy to the existence of state power in such circumstances. See Bingham, In the Matter of Haddock v. Haddock, 21 Corn.L.Q. 393, 426. The existence of the power of a state to alter the marital status of its domiciliaries, as distinguished from the wisdom of its exercise, is not dependent on the underlying causes of the domestic rift. As we have said, it is dependent on the relationship which domicil creates and the pervasive control which a state has over marriage and divorce within its own borders. Atherton v. Atherton which preceded Haddock v. Haddock and Thompson v. Thompson, \n226 \nU.S. 551\n, 33 S.Ct. 129, which followed it, recognized that the power of the state of the matrimonial domicil to grant a divorce from the absent spouse did not depend on whether his departure from the state was or was not \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 301]\n\u00a0\n justified. As stated above, we see no reason, and none has here been advanced, for making the existence of state power depend on an inquiry as to where the fault in each domestic dispute lies. And it is difficult to prick out any such line of distinction in the generality of the words of the full faith and credit clause. Moreover, so far as state power is concerned no distinction between a matrimonial domicil and a domicil later acquired has been suggested or is apparent. See Mr. Justice Holmes dissenting, Haddock v. Haddock, supra, 201 U.S. at page 631, 26 S.Ct. at page 552, 5 Ann.Cas. 1; Goodrich, Matrimonial Domicile, 27 Yale L.Journ. 49. It is one thing to say as a matter of state law that jurisdiction to grant a divorce from an absent spouse should depend on whether by consent or by conduct the latter has subjected his interest in the marriage status to the law of the separate domicil acquired by the other spouse. Beale, Conflict of Laws,  113.11; Restatement, Conflict of Laws,  113. But where a state adopts, as it has the power to do, a less strict rule, it is quite another thing to say that its decrees affecting the marital status of its domiciliaries are not entitled to full faith and credit in sister states. Certainly if decrees of a state altering the marital status of its domiciliaries are not valid throughout the Union even though the requirements of procedural due process are wholly met, a rule would be fostered which could not help but bring 'considerable disaster to innocent persons' and 'bastardize children hitherto supposed to be the offspring of lawful marriage,' (Mr. Justice Holmes dissenting in Haddock v. Haddock, supra, 201 U.S. at page 628, 26 S.Ct. at page 551, 5 Ann.Cas. 1), or else encourage collusive divorces. Beale, Constitutional Protection of Decrees for Divorce, 19 Harv.L.Rev. 586, 596. These intensely practical considerations emphasize for us the essential function of the full faith and credit clause in substituting a command for the former principles of comity (Broderick v. Rosner, supra, 294 U.S. at page 643, 55 S.Ct. at page 592, 100 A.L.R. 1133) and in altering the 'status of the several states as independent foreign \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 302]\n\u00a0\n sovereignties' by making them 'integral parts of a single nation.' Milwaukee County v. M. E. White Co., supra, 296 U.S. at page 277, 56 S.Ct. at page 234.\n It is objected, however, that if such divorce decrees must be given full faith and credit, a substantial dilution of the sovereignty of other states will be effected. For it is pointed out that under such a rule one state's policy of strict control over the institution of marriage could be thwarted by the decree of a more lax state. But such an objection goes to the application of the full faith and credit clause to many situations. It is an objection in varying degrees of intensity to the enforcement of a judgment of a sister state based on a cause of action which could not be enforced in the state of the forum. Mississippi's policy against gambling transactions was overriden in Fauntleroy v. Lum, supra, when a Missouri judgment based on such a Mississippi contract was enforced by this Court. Such is part of the price of our federal system.\n This Court, of course, is the final arbiter when the question is raised as to what is a permissible limitation on the full faith and credit clause. Alaska Packers Ass'n v. Industrial Accident Comm., supra, 294 U.S. at page 547, 55 S.Ct. at page 523; Milwaukee County v. M. E. White Co., supra, 296 U.S. at page 274, 56 S.Ct. at page 232. But the question for us is a limited one. In the first place, we repeat that in this case we must assume that petitioners had a bona fide domicil in Nevada, not that the Nevada domicil was a sham. We thus have no question on the present record whether a divorce decree granted by the courts of one state to a resident as distinguished from a domiciliary is entitled to full faith and credit in another state. Nor do we reach here the question as to the power of North Carolina to refuse full faith and credit to Nevada divorce decrees because, contrary to the findings of the Nevada court, North Carolina finds that no bona fide domicil was acquired in Nevada. In the second place, the question as to what is a permissible limiation on the full faith and \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 303]\n\u00a0\n credit clause does not involve a decision on our part as to which state policy on divorce is the more desirable one. It does not involve selection of a rule which will encourage on the one hand or discourage on the other the practice of divorce. That choice in the realm of morals and religion rests with the legislatures of the states. Our own views as to the marriage institution and the avenues of escape which some states have created are immaterial. It is a Constitution which we are expounding-a Constitution which in no small measure brings separate sovereign states into an integrated whole through the medium of the full faith and credit clause. Within the limits of her political power North Carolina may, of course, enforce her own policy regarding the marriage relation-an institution more basic in our civilization than any other. But society also has an interest in the avoidance of polygamous marriages (Loughran v. Loughran, \n292 \nU.S. 216, 223\n, 54 S.Ct. 684, 686) and in the protection of innocent offspring of marriages deemed legitimate in other jurisdictions. And other states have an equally legitimate concern in the status of persons domiciled there as respects the institution of marriage. So when a court of one state acting in accord with the requirements of procedural due process alters the marital status of one domiciled in that state by granting him a divorce from his absent spouse, we cannot say its decree should be excepted from the full faith and credit clause merely because its enforcement or recognition in another state would conflict with the policy of the latter. Whether Congress has the power to create exceptions (see Yarborough v. Yarborough, \n290 \nU.S. 202, 215\n, 54 S.Ct. 181, 186, 90 A.L.R. 924, note 2, dissenting opinion) is a question on which we express no view. It is sufficient here to note that Congress in its sweeping requirement that judgments of the courts of one state be given full faith and credit in the courts of another has not done so. And the considerable interests involved and the substantial and far- reaching effects which the \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 304]\n\u00a0\n allowance of an exception would have on innocent persons indicate that the purpose of the full faith and credit clause and of the supporting legislation would be thwarted to a substantial degree if the rule of Haddock v. Haddock were perpetuated.\n Haddock v. Haddock is overruled. The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Supreme Court of North Carolina for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded with directions.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, concurring.\n I join in the opinion of the Court but think it appropriate to add a few words.\n Article 91 of the British North America Act (1867) gives the Parliament of Canada exclusive legislative authority to deal with marriage and divorce. Similarly, Article 51 of the Australia Constitution Act (1900) empowers the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws with respect to marriage and divorce. The Constitution of the United States, however, reserves authority over marriage and divorce to each of the forty-eight states. That is our starting-point. In a country like ours where each state has the constitutional power to translate into law its own notions of policy concerning the family institution, and where citizens pass freely from one state to another, tangled marital situations, like the one immediately before us, inevitably arise. They arose before and after the decision in the Haddock case, \n201 \nU.S. 562\n, 26 S.Ct. 525, 5 Ann.Cas. 1, and will, I daresay, continue to arise no matter what we do today. For these complications cannot be removed by any decisions this Court can make- neither the crudest nor the subtlest juggling of legal concepts could enable us to bring forth a uniform national law of marriage and divorce.\n We are not authorized nor are we qualified to formulate a national code of domestic relations. We cannot, by \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 305]\n\u00a0\n making 'jurisdiction' depend upon a determination of who is the deserter and who the deserted or upon the shifting notions of policy concealed by the cloudy abstraction of 'matrimonial domicile, turn this into a divorce and probate court for the United States. There may be some who think our modern social life is such that there is today a need, as there was not when the Constitution was framed, for vesting national authority over marriage and divorce in Congress, just as the national legislatures of Canada and Australia have been vested with such powers. Beginning in 1884, 1 numerous proposals to amend the Constitution to confer such authority have been introduced in Congress. But those whose business it is to amend the Constitution have not seen fit to amend it in this way. The need for securing national uniformity in dealing with divorce, either through constitutional amendment or by some other means, has long been the concern of the Conference of Governors and of special bodies convened to consider this problem. See, e.g., Proceedings of Governors' Conference (1910) 185- 98; Proceedings of National Congress on Uniform Divorce Laws (1906). This Court should abstain from trying to reach the same end by indirection. We should not feel challenged by a task that is not ours, even though it is difficult. Judicial attempts to solve problems that are intrinsically legislative-because their elements do not lend themselves to judicial judgment or because the necessary remedies are of a sort which judges cannot prescribe-are apt to be as futile in their achievement as they are presumptuous in their undertaking. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 306]\n\u00a0\n There is but one respect in which this Court can, within its traditional authority and professional competence, contribute uniformity to the law of marrige and divorce, and that is to enforce respect for the judgment of a state by its sister states when the judgment was rendered in accordance with settled procedural standards. As the Court's opinion shows, it is clearly settled that if a judgment is binding in the state where it was rendered, it is equally binding in every other state. This rule of law was not created by the federal courts. It comes from the Constitution and the Act of May 26, 1790, c. 11, 1 Stat. 122. Congress has not exercised its power under the Full Faith and Credit Clause to meet the special problems raised by divorce decrees. There will be time enough to consider the scope of its power in this regard when Congress chooses to exercise it.\n The duty of a state to respect the judgments of a sister state arises only where such judgments meet the tests of justice and fair dealing that are embodied in the historic phrase, 'due process of law'. But in this case all talk about due process is beside the mark. If the actions of the Nevada court had been taken 'without due process of law', the divorces which it purported to decree would have been without legal sanction in every state including Nevada. There would be no occasion to consider the applicability of the Full Faith and Credit Clause. It is precisely because the Nevada decrees do satisfy the requirements of the Due Process Clause and are binding in Nevada upon the absent spouses that we are called upon to decide whether these judgments, unassailable in the state which rendered them, are, despite the commands of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, null and void elsewhere.\n North Carolina did not base its disregard of the Nevada decrees on the claim that they were a fraud and a sham, and no claim was made here on behalf of North Carolina \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 307]\n\u00a0\n that the decrees were not valid in Nevada. It is indisputable that the Nevada decrees here, like the Connecticut decree in the Haddock case, were valid and binding in the state where they were rendered. Haddock v. Haddock, \n201 \nU.S. 562, 569\n, 570 S., 26 S.Ct. 525, 527, 5 Ann. Cas. 1; Maynard v. Hill, \n125 \nU.S. 190\n, 8 S.Ct. 723; Atherton v. Atherton, \n181 \nU.S. 155\n, 21 S.Ct. 544. In denying constitutional sanction to such a valid judgment outside the state which rendered it, the Haddock decision made an arbitrary break with the past and created distinctions incompatible with the role of this Court in enforcing the Full Faith and Credit Clause. Freed from the hopeless refinements introduced by that case, the question before us is simply whether the Nevada decrees were rendered under circumstances that would make them binding against the absent spouses in the state where they were rendered. North Carolina did not challenge the power of Nevada to declare the marital status of persons found to be Nevada residents. North Carolina chose instead to disrespect the consequences of Nevada's exertion of such power. It is therefore no more rhetorical to say that Nevada is seeking to impose its policy upon North Carolina than it is to say that North Carolina is seeking to impose its policy upon Nevada.\n For all but a very small fraction of the community the niceties of resolving such conflicts among the laws of the states are, in all likelihood, matters of complete indifference. Our occasional pronouncements upon the requirements of the Full Faith and Credit Clause doubtless have little effect upon divorces. Be this as it may, a court is likely to lose its way if it strays outside the modest bounds of its own special competence and turns the duty of adjudicating only the legal phases of a broad social problem into an opportunity for formulating judgments of social policy quite beyond its competence as well as its authority. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 308]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY, dissenting.\n I dissent because the Court today introduces an undesirable rigidity in the application of the Full Faith and Credit Clause to a problem which is of acute interest to all the states of the Union and on which they hold varying and sharply divergent views, the problem of how they shall treat the marriage relation.\n This case cannot be considered as one involving the Constitution alone; rather the case involves the interaction of public policy upon the Constitution. This is not to say that our function is to become censors of public morals and decide this case in accordance with what we may think is the wisest rule for society with respect to divorce. But the question of public policy enters to this degree-marriage and the family have generally been regarded as basic components of our national life, and the solution of the problems engenderd by the marital relation, the formulation of standards of public morality in connection therewith, and the supervision of domestic (in the sense of family) affairs, have been left to the individual states. Each state has the deepest concern for its citizens in those matters, and concomitantly with that concern, it exercises the widest control over marriage, determining how it is to be solemnized, the attendant obligations, and how it may be dissolved. When a conflict arises between the divergent policies of two states in this area of legitimate governmental concern, as here, this Court should give appropriate consideration to the interests of each state.\n In recognition of the paramount interest of the state of domicile over the marital status of its citizens, this Court has held that actual good faith domicile of at least one party is essential to confer authority and jurisdiction on the courts of a state to render a decree of divorce that will be entitled to extraterritorial effect under the \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 309]\n\u00a0\n Full Faith and Credit Clause, Bell v. Bell, \n181 \nU.S. 175\n, 21 S.Ct. 551, even though both parties personally appear, Andrews v. Andrews, \n188 \nU.S. 14\n, 23 S.Ct. 237. When the doctrine of those cases is applied to the facts of this one, the question becomes a simple one: Did petitioners acquire a bona fide domicil in Nevada? I agree with my brother Jackson that the only proper answer on the record is, no. North Carolina is the state in which petitioners have their roots, the state to which they immediately returned after a brief absence just sufficient to achieve their purpose under Nevada's requirements. It follows that the Nevada decrees are entitled to no extraterritorial effect when challenged in another state. Bell v. Bell, supra; Andrews v. Andrews, supra.\n This is not to say that the Nevada decrees are without any legal effect in the State of Nevada. That question is not before us. It may be that for the purposes of that state the petitioners have been released from their marital vows, consistently with the procedural requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, on the basis of compliance with its residential requirements and constructive service of process on the non-resident spouses. But conceding the validity in Nevada of its decrees dissolving the marriages, it does not mechanically follow that the Full Faith and Credit Clause compels North Carolina to accept them.\n We have recognized an area of flexibility in the application of the Clause to preserve and protect state policies in matters of vital public concern. We have said that conflicts between such state policies should be resolved, 'not by giving automatic effect to the full faith and credit clause, ... but by appraising the governmental interests of each jurisdiction, and turning the scale of decision according to their weight'. Alaska Packers Ass'n v. Industrial Accident Comm., \n294 \nU.S. 532, 547\n, 55 S. Ct. 518, 524. See also Milwaukee County v. M. E. White Co., \n296 \nU.S. 268, 273\n, 274 S., 56 S.Ct. 229, 232, and compare the dissenting opinion in Yarborough v. Yarborough, 290 U.S. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 310]\n\u00a0\n 202, 213-227, 54 S.Ct. 181, 185-191, 90 A.L.R. 924. That Clause should no more be read 'with literal exactness like a mathematical formula' than are other great and general clauses of the Constitution placing limitations upon the States to weld us into a Nation. Cf. Home Bldg. & Loan Ass'n v. Blaisdell, \n290 \nU.S. 398, 428\n, 54 S.Ct. 231, 236, 88 A.L.R. 1481. Rather it should be construed to harmonize its direction 'with the necessary residuum of state power'. Id., 290 U.S. at page 435, 54 S.Ct. at page 239, 88 A.L.R. 1481.\n Prominent in the residuum of state power, as pointed out above, is the right of a state to deal with the marriage relations of its citizens and to pursue its chosen domestic policy of public morality in that connection. Both Nevada and North Carolina have rights in this regard which are entitled to recognition. The conflict between those rights here should not be resolved by extending into North Carolina the effects of Nevada's action through a perfunctory application of the literal language of the Full Faith and Credit Clause with the result that measures which North Carolina has adopted to safeguard the welfare of her citizens in this area of legitimate governmental concern are undermined. When the interests are considered, those of North Carolina are of sufficient validity that they should as clearly free her of the compulsions of the Full Faith and Credit Clause as did the interest of the state in the devolution of property within its boundaries in Fall v. Eastin, \n215 \nU.S. 1\n, 30 S.Ct. 3, 23 L.R.A.,N.S., 924, 17 Ann.Cas. 853, Olmsted v. Olmsted, \n216 \nU.S. 386\n, 30 S.Ct. 292, 25 L.R.A.,N.S., 1292, and Hood v. McGehee, \n237 \nU.S. 611\n, 35 S.Ct. 718, or the interest of a state in the application of its own workmen's compensation statute in Alaska Packers Ass'n v. Industrial Accident Comm., supra, or its interest in declining to enforce the penal laws of another jurisdiction, cf. Huntington v. Attrill, \n146 \nU.S. 657, 666\n, 13 S.Ct. 224, 227, all of which seem to be matters of far less concern to a state than the untrammeled enforcement within its borders of those standards of public morality with regard to the marriage relation which it considers to be in the best interests of its citizens. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 311]\n\u00a0\n There is an element of tragic incongruity in the fact that an individual may be validly divorced in one state but not in another. But our dual system of government and the fact that we have no uniform laws on many subjects give rise to other incongruities as well-for example the common law took the logical position that an individual could have but one domicile at a time but this Court has nevertheless said that the Full Faith and Credit Clause does not prevent conflicting state decisions on the question of an individual's domicile. Cf. Worcester County Trust Co. v. Riley, \n302 \nU.S. 292, 299\n, 58 S.Ct. 185, 187. In the absence of a uniform law on the subject of divorce this Court is not so limited in its application of the Full Faith and Credit Clause that it must force Nevada's policy upon North Carolina, any more than it must compel Nevada to accept North Carolina's requirements. The fair result is to leave each free to regulate within its own area the rights of its own citizens.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON, dissenting.\n I cannot join in exerting the judicial power of the Federal Government to compel the State of North Carolina to subordinate its own law to the Nevada divorce decrees. The Court's decision to do so reaches far beyond the immediate case. It subjects matrimonial laws of each state to important limitations and exceptions that it must recognize within its own borders and as to its own permanent population. It nullifies the power of each state to protect its own citizens against dissolution of their marriages by the courts of other states which have an easier system of divorce. It subjects every marriage to a new infirmity in that one dissatisfied spouse may choose a state of easy divorce, in which neither party has ever lived, and there commence proceedings without personal service of process. The spouse remaining within the state of domicile need never know of the proceedings. Or, if it \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 312]\n\u00a0\n comes to one's knowledge, the choice is between equally useless alternatives: one is to ignore the foreign proceedings, in which case the marriage is quite certain to be dissolved; the other is to follow the complaining spouse to the state of his choice and there defend under the laws which grant the dissolution on relatively trivial grounds. To declare that a state is powerless to protect either its own policy or the family rights of its people against such consequences has serious constitutional implications. It is not an exaggeration to say that this decision repeals the divorce laws of all the states and substitutes the law of Nevada as to all marriages one of the parties to which can afford a short trip there. The significance of this decision is best appraised by orienting its facts with reference to the States involved, for the Court approves this concrete case as a pattern which anybody in any state may henceforth follow under the protection of the federal courts.\n From the viewpoint of North Carolina, this is the situation: The Williamses, North Carolina people, were married in North Carolina, lived there twenty-five years, and have four children. The Hendrixes were also married in North Carolina and resided there some twenty years. In May of 1940, Mr. Williams and Mrs. Hendrix left their homes and respective spouses, departed the state, but after an absence of a few weeks reappeared and set up housekeeping as husband and wife. North Carolina then had on its hands three marriages among four people in the form of two broken families, and one going concern. What problems were thereby created as to property or support and maintenance, we do not know. North Carolina, for good or ill, has a strict policy as to divorce. The situation is contrary to its laws, and it has attempted to vindicate its own law by convicting the parties of bigamy.\n The petitioners assert that North Carolina is made powerless in the matter, however, because of proceedings \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 313]\n\u00a0\n carried on in Nevada during their brief absence from North Carolina. We turn to Nevada for that part of the episode.\n Williams and Mrs. Hendrix appear in the State of Nevada on May 15, 1940. For barely six weeks they made their residences at the Alamo Auto Court on the Las Vegas-Los Angeles Road. On June 26, 1940, both filed bills of complaint for divorce through the same lawyer, and alleging almost identical grounds. No personal service was made on the home-staying spouse in either case; and service was had only by publication and substituted service. Both obtained divorce decrees. The Nevada policy of divorce is reflected in Mrs. Hendrix's case. Her grounds were 'extreme mental cruelty.' She sustained them by testifying that her husband was 'moody'; did not talk or speak to her 'often'; when she spoke to him he answered most of the time by a nod or shake of the head and 'there was nothing cheerful about him at all.' The latter of the two divorces was granted on October 4, 1940, and on that day in Nevada they had benefit of clergy and emerged as man and wife. Nevada having served its purpose in their affairs, they at once returned to North Carolina to live.\n The question is whether this Court will now prohibit North Carolina from enforcing its own policy within that State against these North Carolinians on the ground that the law of Nevada under which they lived a few weeks is in some way projected into North Carolina to give them immunity.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n Our Function in the Matter.\n There is confided to the Court only the power to resolve constitutional questions raised by these divorce procedures and not moral, religious, or social questions as to divorce itself. I do not know with any certainty whether \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 314]\n\u00a0\n in the long run strict or easy divorce is best for society or whether either has much effect on moral conduct. It is enough for judicial purposes that to each state is reserved constitutional power to determine its own divorce policy. It follows that a federal court should uphold impartially the right of Nevada to adopt easy divorce laws and the right of North Carolina to enact severe ones. No difficulties arise so long as each state applies its laws to its own permanent inhabitants. The complications begin when one state opens its courts and extends the privileges of its laws to persons who never were domiciled there and attempts to visit disadvantages therefrom upon persons who have never lived there, have never submitted to the jurisdiction of its courts, and have never been lawfully summoned by personal service of process. This strikes at the orderly functioning of our federal constitutional system, and raises questions for us.\n The prevailing opinion rests upon a line of cases of which Christmas v. Russell, 5 Wall. 290, is typical. There it was said that 'If a judgment is conclusive in the State where it was pronounced, it is equally conclusive everywhere.' Id. 5 Wall. at page 302. This rule was uttered long ago in very different circumstances. The judgment there in question was on a promissory note, and the Court also said that: 'Nothing can be plainer than the proposition is, that the judgment ... was a valid judgment in the State where it was rendered. Jurisdiction of the case was undeniable, and the defendant being found in that jurisdiction, was duly served with process, and appeared and made full defence.' Id. 5 Wall. at page 301. But the same defendant tried to relitigate his lost cause when it was sought to give that judgment effect in his home state. This Court properly held that it was not competent for the courts of any other state to reopen the merits of the cause. This very wise rule against collateral impeachment of an ordinary judgment based upon personal jurisdiction is now \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 315]\n\u00a0\n made to support the theory that we must enforce these very different Nevada judgments without more than formal inquiry into the jurisdiction of the court that rendered them.\n The effect of the Court's decision today-that we must give extraterritorial effect to any judgment that a state honors for its own purposes-is to deprive this Court of control over the operation of the full faith and credit and the due process clauses of the Federal Constitution in cases of contested jurisdiction and to vest it in the first state to pass on the facts necessary to jurisdiction. It is for this Court, I think, not for state courts, to implement these great but general clauses by defining those judgments which are to be forced upon other states.\n Conflict between policies, laws, and judgments of constituent states of our federal system is an old, persistent, and increasingly complex problem. The right of each state to experiment with rules of its own choice for governing matrimonial and social life is greatly impaired if its own authority is overlapped and its own policy is overridden by judgments of other states forced on it by the power of this Federal Court. If we are to extend protection to the orderly exercise of the right of each state to make its own policy, we must find some way of confining each state's authority to matters and persons that are by some standard its own.\n The framers of the Constitution did not lay down rules to guide us in selecting which of two conflicting state judgments or public acts would receive federal aid in its extraterritorial enforcement. Nor was it necessary. There was, and is, an adequate body of law, if we do not reject it, by which to test jurisdiction or power to render the judgments in question so far as faith and credit by federal command is concerned. By the application of well established rules these judgments fail to merit enforcement for two reasons. \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 316]\n\u00a0\n II.\n Lack of Due Process of Law.\n Thirty-seven years ago this Court decided that a state court, even of the plaintiff's domicile, could not render a judgment of divorce that would be entitled to federal enforcement in other states against a nonresident who did not appear, and was not personally served with process. Haddock v. Haddock, 1905 Term, \n201 \nU.S. 562\n, 26 S.Ct. 525, 5 Ann.Cas. 1. The opinion was much criticized, particularly in academic circles. \n1\n Until today, however, it has been regarded as law, to be accepted and applied, for good or ill, depending on one's view of the matter. The theoretical reasons for the change are not convincing.\n The opinion concedes that Nevada's judgment could not be forced upon North Carolina in absence of personal service if a divorce proceeding were an action in personam. In other words, settled family relationships may be destroyed by a procedure that we would not recognize if the suit were one to collect a grocery bill. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n We have been told that this is because divorce is a proceeding in rem. The marriage relation is to be reified and treated as a res. Then it seems that this res follows a fugitive from matrimony into a state of easy divorce, although the other party to it remains at home where the res was contracted and where years of cohabitation would seem to give it local situs. Would it be less logical to hold that the continued presence of one party to a marriage \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 317]\n\u00a0\n gives North Carolina power to protect the res, the marriage relation, than to hold that the transitory presence of one gives Nevada power to destroy it? Counsel at the bar met this dilemma by suggesting that the res exists in duplicate-one for each party to the marriage. But this seems fatal to the decree, for if that is true the dissolution of the res in transit would hardly operate to dissolve the res that stayed in North Carolina. Of course this discussion is only to reveal the artificial and fictional character of the whole doctrine of a res as applied to a divorce action.\n I doubt that it promotes clarity of thinking to deal with marriage in terms of a res, like a piece of land or a chattel. It might be more helpful to think of marriage as just marriage-a relationship out of which spring duties to both spouse and society and from which are derived rights,- such as the right to soceity and services and to conjugal love and affection-rights which generally prove to be either priceless or worthless, but which none the less the law sometimes attempts to evaluate in terms of money when one is deprived of them by the negligence or design of a third party.\n It does not seem consistent with our legal system that one who has these continuing rights should be deprived of them without a hearing. Neither does it seem that he or she should be summoned by mail, publication, or otherwise to a remote jurisdiction chosen by the other party and there be obliged to submit marital rights to adjudication under a state policy at odds with that of the state under which the marriage was contracted and the matrimonial domicile was established.\n Marriage is often dealt with as a contract. Of course a personal judgment could not be rendered against an absent party on a cause of action arising out of an ordinary commercial contract, without personal service of process. I see no reason why the marriage contract, if such it be \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 318]\n\u00a0\n considered, should be discriminated against, nor why a party to a marriage contract should be more vulnerable to a foreign judgment without process than a party to any other contract. I agree that the marriage contract is different, but I should think the difference would be in its favor.\n The Court thinks the difference is the other way: we are told that divorce is not a 'mere in personam action' since Haddock v. Haddock, supra, held that domicile is necessary to jurisdiction for divorce. But to hold that a state cannot have divorce jurisdiction unless it is the domicile is not to hold that it must have such jurisdiction if it is the domicile, as Haddock v. Haddock itself demonstrates. Further support for this view seems to be seen in Maynard v. Hill, \n125 \nU.S. 190\n, 8 S.Ct. 723, and in the Court's subsequent approval of that case in Haddock v. Haddock, supra, 201 U.S. at pages 569, 572, 574, 575, 579, 26 S.Ct. at pages 527, 528, 529, 531, 5 Ann.Cas. 1. All that Maynard v. Hill decided was that the Territory of Washington had jurisdiction to cut off any interest of an absent spouse in land within its borders. But protection of land in the jurisdiction and protection against bigamy prosecutions out of the jurisdiction are plainly different matters. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Although the Court concedes that its present decision would be insupportable if divorce were a 'mere in personam action' it relies for support on opinions that the state where one is domiciled has the power to enter valid criminal, tax, and simple money judgments against-not for-him. 4 Those opinions are wholly inapposite unless \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 319]\n\u00a0\n they mean that Nevada has jurisdiction to nullify contract rights of a person never in the state or to declare that he is not liable for the commission of crime, and payment of taxes, or the breach of a contract, in another state; and I am sure that nobody has ever supposed they meant that.\n To hold that the Nevada judgments were not binding in North Carolina because they were rendered without jurisdiction over the North Carolina spouses, it is not necessary to hold that they were without any conceivable validity. It may be, and probably is, true that Nevada has sufficient interest in the lives of those who sojourn there to free them and their spouses to take new spouses without incurring criminal penalties under Nevada law. I know of nothing in our Constitution that requires Nevada to adhere to traditional concepts of bigamous unions or the legitimacy of the fruit thereof. And the control of a state over property within its borders is so complete that I suppose that Nevada could effectively deal with it in the name of divorce as completely as in any other. \n5\n But it is quite a different thing to say that Nevada can dissolve the marriages of North Carolinians and dictate the incidence of the bigamy statutes of North Carolina by which North Carolina has sought to protect her own interests as well as theirs. In this case there is no conceivable basis of jurisdiction in the Nevada court over the absent spouses,6 and, a fortiori, over North Carolina herself. I \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 320]\n\u00a0\n cannot but think that in its pre-occupation with the full faith and credit clause the Court has slighted the due process clause.\n\n\n III.\n\n\n Lack of Domicile.\n We should, I think, require that divorce judgments asking our enforcement under the full faith and credit clause, unlike judgments arising out of commercial transactions and the like, must also be supported by good-faith domicile of one of the parties within the judgment state. \n7\n Such is certainly a reasonable requirement. A state can have no legitimate concern with the matrimonial status of two persons, neither of whom lives within its territory.\n The Court would seem, indeed, to pay lip service to this principle. I understand the holding to be that it is domicile in Nevada that gave power to proceed without personal service of process. That being the course of reasoning, I do not see how we avoid the issue concerning the existence of the domicile which the facts on the face of this record put to us. Certainly we cannot, as the Court would, by-pass the matter by saying that 'We must treat the present case for the purpose of the limited issue before us precisely the same as if petitioners had resided in Ne- \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 321]\n\u00a0\n vada for a term of years and had long ago acquired a permanent abode there.' I think we should treat it as if they had done just what they have done.\n The only suggestion of a domicile within Nevada was a stay of about six weeks at the Alamo Auto Court, an address hardly suggestive of permanence. Mrs. Hendrix testified in her case (the evidence in Williams' case is not before us) that her residence in Nevada was 'indefinite permanent' in character. The Nevada court made no finding that the parties had a 'domicile' there. It only found a residence-sometimes, but not necessarily, an equivalent. \n8\n It is this Court that accepts these facts as enough to establish domicile.\n While a state can no doubt set up its own standards of domicile as to its internal concerns, I do not think it can require us to accept and in the name of the Constitution impose them on other states. If Nevada may prescribe six weeks of indefinite permanent abode in a motor court as constituting domicile, she may as readily prescribe six days. Indeed, if the Court's opinion is carried to its logical conclusion, a state could grant a constructive domicile for divorce purposes upon the filing of some sort of declaration of intention. Then it would follow that we would be required to accept it as sufficient and to force all states to recognize mailorder divorces as well as tourist divorces. Indeed, the difference is in the bother and expense-not in the principle of the thing.\n The concept of domicile as a controlling factor in choice of law to govern many relations of the individual was well known to the framers of the Constitution. It was hardly contemplated that a person should be subject at once to two conflicting state policies, such as those of Nevada and North Carolina. It was undoubtedly expected that the Court would in many cases of conflict use one's domicile \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 322]\n\u00a0\n as an appropriate guide in selecting the law to govern his controversies.\n Domicile means a relationship between a person and alocality. It is the place, and the one place, where he has his roots and his real permanent home. The Fourteenth Amendment, in providing that one by residence in a state becomes a citizen hereof, probably used 'residence' as synonymous person and a locality. It is the place, and place where one belongs in our federal system. In some instances the existence of this relationship between the state and an individual may be a federal question, although this Court has been reluctant to accept that view. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n If in testing this judgment to determine whether it qualifies for federal enforcement we should apply the doctrine of domicile to interpretation of the full faith and credit clause, Nevada would be held to a duty to respect the statutes of North Carolina and not to interfere with their application to those whose individual as well as matrimonial domicile is within that state unless and until that domicile has been terminated. And North Carolina would not be required to yield its policy as to persons resident there except upon a showing that Nevada had acquired a domiciliary right to redefine the matrimonial status.\n However, the trend of recent decision has been to break down the rigid concept of domicile as a test of the right of a state to deal with important relations of life. This trend \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 323]\n\u00a0\n has been particularly apparent in cases where the Court has authorized, if not indeed encouraged, the several states to set up their own standards of domicile and to make conflicting findings of domicile for the purpose of taxing the right of succession. Worcester County Trust Co. v. Riley, \n302 \nU.S. 292\n, 58 S.Ct. 185. The Court has completely repudiated domicile as the measure of a state's right to tax intangible property. State Tax Commission v. Aldrich, \n316 \nU.S. 174, 185\n, 62 S.Ct. 1008, 1013, 139 A.L.R. 1436. The present decision extends the trend to the field of matrimonial legislation. This direction is contrary to what I believe to be the purpose of our Constitution to prevent overlapping and conflict of authority between the states.\n In the application of the full faith and credit clause to the variety of circumstances that arise when families break up and separate domiciles are established there are, I grant, many areas of great difficulty. But I cannot believe that we are justified in making a demoralizing decision in order to avoid making difficult ones.\n\n\n IV.\n\n\n Practical Considerations.\n The Court says that its judgment is 'part of the price of our federal system.' It is a price that we did not have to pay yesterday and that we will have to pay tomorrow, only because this Court has willed it to be so today. This Court may follow precedents, irrespective of their merits, as a matter of obedience to the rule of stare decisis. Consistency and stability may be so served. They are ends desirable in themselves, for only thereby can the law be predictable to those who must shape their conduct by it and to lower courts which must apply it. But we can break with established law, overrule precedents, and start a new cluster of leading cases to define what we mean, only as a matter of deliberate policy. We, therefore, search a \n\n[317 \nU.S. 287, 324]\n\u00a0\n judicial pronouncement that ushers in a new order of matrimonial confusion and irresponsibility for some hint of the countervailing public good that is believed to be served by the change. Little justification is offered. And it is difficult to believe that what is offered is intended seriously.\n The Court advances two 'intensely practical considerations' in support of its present decision. One is the 'omplicated and serious condition' if 'one is lawfully divorced and remarried in Nevada and still married to the first spouse in North Carolina.' This of course begs the question, for the divorces were completely ineffectual for any purpose relevant to this case. I agree that it is serious if a Nevada court without jurisdiction for divorce purports to say that the sojourn of two spouses gives four spouses rights to acquire four more, but I think it far more serious to force North Carolina to acquiesce in any such proposition. The other consideration advanced is that if the Court doesn't enforce divorces such as these it will, as it puts it, 'bastardize' children of the divorcees. When thirty-seven years ago Mr. Justice Holmes perpetrated this quip, it had point, for the Court was then holding divorces invalid which many, due to the confused state of the law, had thought to be good. It is difficult to find that it has point now that the shoe is on the other foot. In any event I had supposed that our judicial responsibility is for the regularity of the law, not for the regularity of pedigrees. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 4342 provides in part: 'If any person, being married, shall contract a marriage with any other person outside of this state, which marriage would be punishable as bigamous if contracted within this state, and shall thereafter cohabit with such person in this state, he shall be guilty of a felony and shall be punished as in cases of bigamy. Nothing contained in this section shall extend ... to any person who at the time of such second marriage shall have been lawfully divorced from the bond of the first marriage ....' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Defendant Hendrix had written his wife's Nevada attorney, 'Upon receipt of the original appearance, I will sign the same.' But no appearance was entered and the North Carolina court charged the jury that a promise to make an appearance does not constitute one. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Sec. 9460, Nev.Comp.L.1929, as amended L.1931, p. 161, provides in part: 'Divorce from the bonds of matrimony may be obtained by complaint, under oath, to the district court of any county in which the cause therefor shall have accrued, or in which the defendant shall reside or be found, or in which the plaintiff shall reside, or in which the parties last cohabited, or if plaintiff shall have resided six weeks in the state before suit be brought, for the following causes, or any other causes provided by law. ...' Sec. 9467.02 provides that 'In all civil cases where the jurisdiction of the court depends upon the residence of one of the parties to the action, the court shall require corroboration of the evidence of such residence.' L.1931, p. 277. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Thus we have here no question as to extraterritorial effect of a divorce decree insofar as it affects property in another state. See the cases cited, infra, note. 5. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Fall v. Eastin, \n215 \nU.S. 1\n, 30 S.Ct. 3, 23 L.R.A., N.S ., 924, 17 Ann.Cas. 853; Olmsted v. Olmsted, \n216 \nU.S. 386\n, 30 S.Ct. 292, 25 L.R.A.,N.S., 1292; Hood v. McGehee, \n237 \nU.S. 611\n, 35 S.Ct. 718. These decisions refuse to require courts of one state to allow acts or judgments of another to control the disposition or devolution of realty in the former. They seem to rest on the doctrine that the state where the land is located is 'sole mistress' of its rules of real property. See Hood v. McGehee, supra, 237 U.S. at page 615, 35 S.Ct. at page 719; and the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Holmes in Fall v.

HELVERING(1942)\nNo. 775\nArgued: April 10, 1942Decided: April 27, 1942\n\n\n\n Mr. William S. Potter, of Wilmington, Del., for petitioner.\n Mr. Richard H. Demuth, of Washington, D.C., for respondent. \n\n[316 \nU.S. 164, 165]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The sole question presented by this case is whether certain sales of shares of stock made by the taxpayer, petitioner's decedent, were 'short' sales or sales of 'long' stock. If they were not 'short' sales, then the taxpayer was justified in deducting from dividends credited to the 'long' shares the amount of dividends charged to the shares sold.\n The taxpayer maintained several accounts with a brokerage house- 'regular', 'special', and 'short'. The 'regular' and 'special' accounts were 'long' accounts. During the years 1934 and 1935 the taxpayer's 'long' accounts were credited with dividends on certain shares. During the same years her 'short' account was charged with dividends on shares of the same stock issues. The taxpayer did not include in her income tax returns for 1934 and 1935 the dividends credited to her 'long' accounts on the theory that the amount of stock which she owned was not the number of shares credited to her in the 'long' accounts but only the number of shares by which her 'long' position exceeded her 'short' position in each of the stock issues held in the several accounts. The Commissioner assessed deficiencies on the theory that the sales made through the 'short' account were in fact 'short' sales and that the dividends charged to the 'short' account represented additional cost of the shares and could not be offset against the dividends credited to the 'long' accounts. Accordingly he ruled that the taxpayer was taxable on all of the dividends credited to her 'long' accounts. On a petition for review the Board of Tax Appeals found that the sales made through the 'short' account were sales of shares held in the taxpayer's 'long' accounts. It therefore held that the dividends charged to the 'short' account should be offset against the dividend credits. Ortiz v. Commissioner, \n\n[316 \nU.S. 164, 166]\n\u00a0\n 42 B.T.A. 173. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 3 Cir., 124 F.2d 156. We granted the petition for certiorari, \n315 \nU.S. 789\n, 62 S.Ct. 488, 86 L. Ed. --, limited to the question whether the sales in the 'short' account were in fact 'short' sales, because the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals in setting aside the findings of the Board on that issue was seemingly erroneous under the rule of such cases as Helvering v. F. & R. Lazarus & Co., \n308 \nU.S. 252\n, 60 S.Ct. 209.\n The findings of the Board were substantially as follows: The sales in question were sales of shares of which the taxpayer held an equal or greater number of the same kind in her 'long' accounts. In every such instance the broker, acting under authority from the taxpayer to consider all her accounts as a unit, treated the sales through the 'short' account as sales of the taxpayer's 'long' shares. None of these sales was labeled as a 'short' sale. The broker required no margin and charged no 'short' sale tax. He credited the 'short' account with the proceeds and made an entry therein showing delivery of the shares at the time of the execution of the sales to the purchaser. In no such case did the broker borrow any stock from other brokers or customers. Orders were executed on the stock exchange in the regular way and delivery was made on the next full business day from certificates in street names held by the broker's New York correspondents. Those street certificates included shares held by the broker for the taxpayer, though none of them was specifically designated as belonging to the taxpayer. The taxpayer was allowed interest on the proceeds of sale. Dividends were collected for the taxpayer only on the number of shares by which her 'long' position exceeded her 'short' position. On the other hand, whenever the taxpayer's 'long' accounts contained no shares of the kind sold, the broker executed the sale as a 'short' sale, required the customary margin, charged the 'short' sale tax, and made delivery from borrowed \n\n[316 \nU.S. 164, 167]\n\u00a0\n stock. On the basis of such facts the Board found that 'the sales in question were intended to be and were actually executed as ordinary sales, or sales of shares held' in the taxpayer's 'long accounts'.\n In overturning that finding of fact the Circuit Court of Appeals laid great emphasis on the manner in which the transactions were entered on the taxpayer's books. It also noted that gains or losses were not reported at the moment of the sales but only when the covering transaction was completed and that the certificates used in completing the sales were in no way designated as belonging to the taxpayer. And it also stated that it could not be said that the broker did not use borrowed stock to make deliveries on the 'short' sales. On that aspect of the case respondent lays primary emphasis. The contention is that the taxpayer's 'long' stock was not 'delivered' in consummation of the sales in the 'short' account, since the broker merely made delivery out of certificates in street names held by it or for its account, instead of borrowing from other brokers, and since none of those street certificates was in any way designated as the taxpayer's. It is urged that the facts being undisputed, the question of whether stock was borrowed to complete the sales was a question of law as respects which the Board did not have the final say.\n The true character of the 'short' account is a question of fact to be determined in the light of the outward or manifested intention of the taxpayer and the way in which the account was actually managed. The designation of the accounts, the fact that as a matter of bookkeeping sales made through the 'short' account apparently were not reflected in the 'long' accounts, the method of reporting gains or losses are some evidence to support the conclusion of the court below. But there are numerous other circumstances which look the other way. They are embraced in the several subsidiary findings which the Board \n\n[316 \nU.S. 164, 168]\n\u00a0\n made and which we have enumerated. Those findings are supported by substantial evidence and are abundant justification for the Board's ultimate finding that the sales made through the 'short' account were ordinary sales. It is the function of the Board, not the Circuit Court of Appeals, to weigh the evidence, to draw inferences from the facts, and to choose between conflicting inferences. The court may not substitute its view of the facts for that of the Board. Where the findings of the Board are supported by substantial evidence they are conclusive. Helvering v. F . & R. Lazarus & Co., supra; Helvering v. Kehoe, \n309 \nU.S. 277\n, 60 S.Ct. 549, and cases cited.

LOGAN(1942)\nNo. 229\nArgued: January 9, 1942Decided: February 2, 1942\n\n\n\n Mr. Elmer McClain, of Lima, Ohio, for petitioners.\n Mr. Harold F. Lindley, of Danville, Ill., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioners are Illinois farmers. Pursuant to a state court foreclosure decree, forty acres of their farm land were sold to W. S. Logan, the mortgagee. The state court master executed and delivered to Logan a certificate of sale, but a deed was not given at that time. By Illinois statute, mortgagors are given the right to redeem for \n\n[315 \nU.S. 139, 140]\n\u00a0\n twelve months after the date of foreclosure sale; and if this right is not exercised, creditors are given a similar right for an additional three months thereafter. Ill.Rev.Stat. (1941) c. 77,  18, 20. On May 3, 1934, a day before the expiration of fifteen months from the sale, the petitioners filed in Federal District Court a petition for extension of time in which to pay their debts, under Section 74 of the Bankruptcy Act. 11 U.S.C.  202, 11 U.S.C.A.  202. Prior to that time there had been an oral agreement which the Appellate Court of the Third District of Illinois subsequently (January 15, 1937) held to have the effect of keeping the petitioners' right of redemption alive. 288 Ill.App. 481, 6 N.E.2d 265. The forty acres were included in the petitioners' schedule of assets submitted in the Section 74 proceedings, and Logan was listed as a creditor. The District Court refused to grant the proposed extension, and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 7 Cir., 75 F.2d 687.\n Thereafter, April 5, 1935, the petitioners filed an amendment seeking composition or extension of their indebtedness as authorized by sub- paragraphs a to r of Section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act. 11 U.S.C.  203, 11 U.S.C.A.  203. Finding that the petition was filed in good faith and was in accordance with the requirements of the Act, the judge referred the matter to a conciliation commissioner. Subsequent efforts to effect a composition or extension having failed, on March 2, 1940, the petitioners filed an amendment alleging this failure and asking that the court adjudicate them bankrupt under 75, sub. s, which provides: 'Any farmer failing to obtain the acceptance of a majority in number and amount of all creditors whose claims are affected by a composition and\/or extension proposal ... may amend his petition or answer, asking to be adjudged a bankrupt.'\n Although the petitioners' allegations brought them squarely within the language of 75, sub. s, the District Court ordered that the amended petition be denied; that the proceedings be dismissed; that the mortgagee's successors in \n\n[315 \nU.S. 139, 141]\n\u00a0\n interest1 be permitted to exercise rights as owners under the foreclosure; that the deed issued to the mortgagee by the state master in chancery after the bankruptcy proceedings had begun be given full force and effect; and that possession of the forty acres be surrendered to the respondent. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, 7 Cir., 119 F.2d 354, holding that 75 imposes upon farmer debtors duties corresponding to the privileges conferred; that if a farmer debtor fails to prosecute his composition proceedings to a conclusion within a reasonable time, the court can deny him the privilege of adjudication under 75, sub. s; and that although these farmer debtors had filed under other subsections of 75, they had already enjoyed all the benefits to which they would have been entitled under 75, sub. s, and therefore were not entitled to obtain a repetition of those benefits by what the court thought was a mere formal change in their petition. Because of an asserted conflict with Cohan v. Elder, 9 Cir ., 118 F.2d 850, and because of the importance of the issue in farmer debtor cases, we granted certiorari. \n314 \nU.S. 592\n, 62 S.Ct. 84, 86 L.Ed. --.\n Section 75, sub.  does not by its language condition a farmer's right to adjudication upon the diligence with which he has sought to obtain composition or extension under subsections a to r. It 'applies explicitly to a case of a farmer who has failed to obtain the acceptance of a majority in number and amount of all creditors whose claims are affected by a proposal for a composition or an extension of time to pay his debts.' John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Bartels, \n308 \nU.S. 180, 184\n, 60 S.Ct. 221, 223. That was the situation of the farmers here. And 'the Act must be liberally construed to give the debtor the full measure of the relief afforded by Congress ... lest its benefits be frittered away by narrow formalistic interpretations which disregard the spirit and the letter of the Act.' Wright v. Union \n\n[315 \nU.S. 139, 142]\n\u00a0\n Central Ins. Co., \n311 \nU.S. 273, 279\n, 61 S.Ct. 196, 200. Farmers cannot be deprived of the benefits of the Act because a court may believe that they have received the equivalent of what it prescribes. Cf. Borchard v. California Bank, \n310 \nU.S. 311\n, 60 S.Ct. 957. We think the Bartels, Wright, and Borchard cases control our conclusion here, and that the court below was in error in dismissing the applications for adjudication under 75, sub. s.\n In the memorandum accompanying the District Court's order directing the petitioners to surrender possession of the disputed forty acres, there is no discussion of their right to redeem. We therefore treat the order as based on the holding that the petitioners' lack of diligence deprived them of the benefits of 75, sub. s, and that the equivalent of the benefits of 75, sub. s, had already been conferred anyway. Because we consider such a holding erroneous, we find it unnecessary to pass upon other questions discussed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, concerning survival of the petitioners' right to redeem. It is nevertheless appropriate to point out at this time that whatever right of redemption the petitioners had when they first applied for adjudication under 75 continued to be a part of their assets, subject to administration by the bankruptcy court. For 75, sub. n, subjects all of the farmer debtor's assets, specifically including righs of redemption, to the jurisdiction of the banktruptcy court, and provides that 'the period of redemption shall be extended ... for the period necessary for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this section.' 11 U.S.C.

S.(1942)\nNo. 86\nArgued: Decided: February 2, 1942\n\n\n\n Mr. Charles Fahy, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n Mr. Fred Patterson, of Honolulu, Hawaii, for petitioner.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, a practicing physician, was convicted on eight counts of an indictment charging violation of Section 6 of the Harrison Anti- Narcotic Act as amended. \n1\n That section, so far as here material, provides:\n'That the provisions of this Act shall not be construed to apply to the manufacture, sale, distribution, giving \n\n[315 \nU.S. 257, 258]\n\u00a0\n away, dispensing, or possession of preparations and remedies which do not contain more than two grains of opium ... in one fluid ounce ...: Provided, That such remedies and preparations are manufactured, sold, distributed, given away, dispensed, or possessed as medicines and not for the purpose of evading the intentions and provisions of this Act: Provided further, that any manufacturer, producer, compounder, or vendor (including dispensing physicians) of the preparations and remedies mentioned in this section lawfully entitled to manufacture, produce, compound, or vend such preparations and remedies, shall keep a record of all sales, exchanges, or gifts of such preparations and remedies ....'\n\n The evidence is undisputed that petitioner gave the preparations in the quantities charged in the indictment to patients whom he personally attended. He kept no records. His defense, that the second proviso of Section 6 is not an independent and affirmative requirement but merely a condition precedent to the exemption created by that section, was rejected by the court below which took the position that the second proviso is an unconditional requirement that all vendors of exempt preparations keep records. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The Government confessed error and we brought the case here. \n314 \nU.S. 595\n, 62 S.Ct. 59, 86 L.Ed. --.\n The public trust reposed in the law enforcement officers of the Government requires that they be quick to confess error when, in their opinion, a miscarriage of justice may result from their remaining silent. But such a confession does not relieve this Court of the performance of the judicial function. The considered judgment of the law enforcement officers that reversible error has been committed is entitled to great weight, but our judicial obligations compel us to examine independently the errors \n\n[315 \nU.S. 257, 259]\n\u00a0\n confessed. See Parlton v. United States, 64 App.D.C. 169, 75 F.2d 772. The public interest that a result be reached which promotes a well-ordered society is foremost in every criminal proceeding. That interest is entrusted to our consideration and protection as well as that of the enforcing officers. Furthermore, but judgments are precedents, and the proper administration of the criminal law cannot be left merely to the stipulation of parties. Cf. Rex v. Wilkes, 4 Burr, 2527, 2551, 98 Eng.Rep. 327; State v. Green, 167 Wash. 266, 9 P.2d 62.\n The Government's confession of error was originally two-fold: first, that while the second proviso of Section 6 was subject to two possible constructions, the administrative construction had been that it was not an independent penal provision, and therefore the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of petitioner; and, secondly, that the second proviso, even if it be regarded as an independent penal provision, does not apply to a physician who administers exempt preparations solely to patients whom he personally attends. Upon reconsideration the Government has withdrawn its first ground of confession of error. We put to one side that question since we are of opinion that there must be a reversal on the second ground.\n Assuming, without deciding, that the second proviso of Section 6 is an independent penal provision, it requires that records be kept only by 'any manufacturer, producer, compounder, or vendor (including dispensing physicians)'. We think that Congress, by the use of the words 'dispensing physicians', meant to exclude physicians administering to patients whom they personally attend.\n That not all physicians are required to keep records is manifest from the use of the qualifying adjective 'dispensing'. And, the physician must be one who manufactures, produces, compounds, or vends, or possibly only one who vends if the parenthetical phrase applies only to 'vendor', the drugs. These are not appropriate words to \n\n[315 \nU.S. 257, 260]\n\u00a0\n describe the function of a physician who administers exempt preparations to patients whom he personally attends.\n This construction is borne out by a consideration of the Act as a whole. The word 'administer' more appropriately describes the activities of a doctor in personal attendance than does the word 'dispense'. Admittedly the words 'dispense' and 'dispensing' are used in several senses in the Act, but Congress evidently was aware of the differentiation between 'administer' and 'dispense', for, when it wished to include all possible functions of physicians with respect to drug distribution, it used both terms in conjunction. Section 1 of the Act, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Code  3220(d), 2553(a), (b)(2), in defining those required to pay a special tax speaks of 'physicians ... lawfully entitled to distribute, dispense, give away, or administer,' and makes it unlawful for any person 'to purchase, sell, dispense, or distribute' any drugs otherwise than in and from the original stamped package, excepting the 'dispensing, or administration, or giving away of any of the aforesaid drugs to a patient' by a practitioner where 'dispensed or administered to the patient for legitimate medical purposes.'\n Section 4, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  3224(b), exempts from the prohibition of interstate shipments and deliveries of drugs by persons who have not registered and paid a special tax deliveries by 'any person who shall deliver any such drug which has been prescribed or dispensed by a physician'. The omission of the word 'administer' indicates that Congress recognized that shipments and deliveries would ordinarily not be involved where the physician was administering while in personal attendance.\n In Section 2(a), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  2554(c)(1), dealing with true narcotics, Congress unequivocally exempted physicians from record keeping where in personal attendance upon patients. It is difficult to perceive why a different requirement should obtain when a physician, under similar circumstances, administers \n\n[315 \nU.S. 257, 261]\n\u00a0\n preparations containing only a limited amount of narcotics, such as the paregoric, cough syrup, etc., involved in this case. The word 'dispense' is evidently used in Section 2(a) in a sense broad enough to include personal administration of drugs by an attending doctor, but the express exception of the personal attendance cases removes any ambiguity as to the scope of 'dispense' in this context.\n The construction of the parenthetical phrase '(including dispensing physicians)' as encompassing only doctors who would be covered by the word 'vendor' does not imply that Congress was tautologic, but rather that it acted cautiously to preclude any contention that physicians selling drugs were not 'vendors' because of their professional status.\n The legislative history of the second proviso of Section 6 supports the view that the words 'dispensing physicians' were intended to apply only to physicians acting as dealers in the sale of drugs. The phrase 'vendor (including dispensing physicians)' was substituted for 'the dealer who knowingly sells' exempt preparations. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Upon the evidence in this case petitioner was not a 'dispensing physician' within the meaning of the recond proviso of Section 6. The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded to the United States District Court for the Territory of Hawaii for such further proceedings as may be required in the light of this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS and Mr. Justice JACKSON took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 40 Stat. 1132, 26 U.S.C.Supp. V,  2551(a) and (b), 26 U.S.C.A.
