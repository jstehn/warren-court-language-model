States Supreme Court\nABRAMS v. U S(1919)\nNo. 316\nArgued: Decided: November 10, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. Harry Weinberger, of New York City, for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Robert P. Stewart, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On a single indictment, containing four counts, the five plaintiffs in error, hereinafter designated the defendants, were convicted of conspiring to violate provisions of the \n\n[250 U.S. 616, 617]\n\u00a0\n Espionage Act of Congress (section 3, title I, of Act June 15, 1917, c. 30, 40 Stat. 219, as amended by Act May 16, 1918, c. 75, 40 Stat. 553 [Comp. St. 1918,  10212c]).\n Each of the first three counts charged the defendants with conspiring, when the United States was at war with the Imperial Government of Germany, to unlawfully utter, print, write and publish: In the first count, 'disloyal, scurrilous and abusive language about the form of government of the United States;' in the second count, language 'intended to bring the form of government of the United States into contempt, scorn, contumely, and disrepute;' and in the third count, language 'intended to incite, provoke and encourage resistance to the United States in said war.' The charge in the fourth count was that the defendants conspired 'when the United States was at war with the Imperial German Government, ... unlawfully and willfully, by utterance, writing, printing and publication to urge, incite and advocate curtailment of production of things and products, to wit, ordnance and ammunition, necessary and essential to the prosecution of the war.' The offenses were charged in the language of the act of Congress.\n It was charged in each count of the indictment that it was a part of the conspiracy that the defendants would attempt to accomplish their unlawful purpose by printing, writing and distributing in the city of New York many copies of a leaflet or circular, printed in the English language, and of another printed in the Yiddish language, copies of which, properly identified, were attached to the indictment.\n All of the five defendants were born in Russia. They were intelligent, had considerable schooling, and at the time they were arrested they had lived in the United States terms varying from five to ten years, but none of them had applied for naturalization. Four of them testified as witnesses in their own behalf, and of these three frankly avowed that they were 'rebels,' 'revolutionists,' \n\n[250 U.S. 616, 618]\n\u00a0\n 'anarchists,' that they did not believe in government in any form, and they declared that they had no interest whatever in the government of the United States. The fourth defendant testified that he was a 'Socialist' and believed in ' a proper kind of government, not capitalistic,' but in his classification the government of the United States was 'capitalistic.'\n It was admitted on the trial that the defendants had united to print and distribute the described circulars and that 5,000 of them had been printed and distributed about the 22d day of August, 1918. The group had a meeting place in New York City, in rooms rented by defendant Abrams, under an assumed name, and there the subject of printing the circulars was discussed about two weeks before the defendants were arrested. The defendant Abrams, although not a printer, on July 27, 1918, purchased the printing outfit with which the circulars were printed, and installed it in a basement room where the work was done at night. The circulars were distributed, some by throwing them from a window of a building where one of the defendants was employed and others secretly, in New York City.\n The defendants pleaded 'not guilty,' and the case of the government consisted in showing the facts we have stated, and in introducing in evidence copies of the two printed circulars attached to the indictment, a sheet entitled 'Revolutionists Unite for Action,' written by the defendant Lipman, and found on him when he was arrested, and another paper, found at the headquarters of the group, and for which Abrams assumed responsibility.\n Thus the conspiracy and the doing of the overt acts charged were largely admitted and were fully established.\n On the record thus described it is argued, somewhat faintly, that the acts charged against the defendants were not unlawful because within the protection of that freedom \n\n[250 U.S. 616, 619]\n\u00a0\n of speech and of the press which is guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and that the entire Espionage Act is unconstitutional because in conflict with that amendment.\n This contention is sufficiently discussed and is definitely negatived in Schenck v. United States and Baer v. United States, \n249 U.S. 47\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 247, and in Frohwerk v. United States, \n249 U.S. 204\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 249.\n The claim chiefly elaborated upon by the defendants in the oral argument and in their brief is that there is no substantial evidence in the record to support the judgment upon the verdict of guilty and that the motion of the defendants for an instructed verdict in their favor was erroneously denied. A question of law is thus presented, which calls for an examination of the record, not for the purpose of weighing conflicting testimony, but only to determine whether there was some evidence, competent and substantial, before the jury, fairly tending to sustain the verdict. Troxell, Administrator, v. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R. R. Co., \n227 \nU.S. 434, 442\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 274; Lancaster v. Collins, \n115 \nU.S. 222, 225\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 33; Chicago & North Western Ry. Co. v. Ohle, \n117 \nU.S. 123, 129\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 632. We shall not need to consider the sufficiency, under the rule just stated, of the evidence introduced as to all of the counts of the indictment, for, since the sentence imposed did not exceed that which might lawfully have been imposed under any single count, the judgment upon the verdict of the jury must be affirmed if the evidence is sufficient to sustain any one of the counts. Evans v. United States, \n153 U.S. 608\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 939; Claassen v. United States, \n142 U.S. 140\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 169; Debs v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 211, 216\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 252.\n The first of the two articles attached to the indictment is conspicuously headed, 'The Hypocrisy of the United States and her Allies.' After denouncing President Wilson as a hypocrite and a coward because troops were sent into Russia, it proceeds to assail our government in general, saying:- \n\n[250 U.S. 616, 620]\n\u00a0\n 'His [the President's] shameful, cowardly silence about the intervention in Russia reveals the hypocrisy of the plutocratic gang in Washington and vicinity.'\n It continues:\n'He [the President] is too much of a coward to come out openly and say: 'We capitalistic nations cannot afford to have a proletarian republic in Russia.\"\n\n Among the capitalistic nations Abrams testified the United States was included.\n Growing more inflammatory as it proceeds, the circular culminates in:\n'The Russian Revolution cries: Workers of the World! Awake! Rise! Put down your enemy and mine!'\n\n'Yes friends, there is only one enemy of the workers of the world and that is CAPITALISM.'\n\n This is clearly an appeal to the 'workers' of this country to arise and put down by force the government of the United States which they characterize as their 'hypocritical,' 'cowardly' and 'capitalistic' enemy.\n It concludes:\n'Awake! Awake, you Workers of the World!\n\n REVOLUTIONISTS.'\n The second of the articles was printed in the Yiddish language and in the translation is headed, 'Workers-Wake Up.' After referring to 'his Majesty, Mr. Wilson, and the rest of the gang, dogs of all colors!' it continues:\n'Workers, Russian emigrants, you who had the least belief in the honesty of our government,'\n\n - which defendants admitted referred to the United States government--\n'must now throw away all confidence, must spit in the face the false, hypocritic, military propaganda which has fooled you so relentlessly, calling forth your sympathy, your help, to the prosecution of the war.'\n\n The purpose of this obviously was to persuade the persons to whom it was addressed to turn a deaf ear to patriotic \n\n[250 U.S. 616, 621]\n\u00a0\n appeals in behalf of the government of the United States, and to cease to render it assistance in the prosecution of the war.\n It goes on:\n'With the money which you have loaned, or are going to loan them, they will make bullets not only for the Germans, but also for the Workers Soviets of Russia. Workers in the ammunition factories, you are producing bullets, bayonets, cannon, to murder not only the Germans, but also your dearest, best, who are in Russia and are fighting for freedom.'\n\n It will not do to say, as is now argued, that the only intent of these defendants was to prevent injury to the Russian cause. Men must be held to have intended, and to be accountable for, the effects which their acts were likely to produce. Even if their primary purpose and intent was to aid the cause of the Russian Revolution, the plan of action which they adopted necessarily involved, before it could be realized, defeat of the war program of the United States, for the obvious effect of this appeal, if it should become effective, as they hoped it might, would be to persuade persons of character such as those whom they regarded themselves as addressing, not to aid government loans and not to work in ammunition factories, where their work would produce 'bullets, bayonets, cannon' and other munitions of war, the use of which would cause the 'murder' of Germans and Russians.\n Again, the spirit becomes more bitter as it proceeds to declare that--\n'America and her Allies have betrayed [the Workers]. Their robberish aims are clear to all men. The destruction of the Russian Revolution, that is the politics of the march to Russia.\n\n'Workers, our reply to the barbaric intervention has to be a general strike! An open challenge only will let the government know that not only the Russian Worker fights for \n\n[250 U.S. 616, 622]\n\u00a0\n freedom, but also here in America lives the spirit of Revolution.'\n\n This is not an attempt to bring about a change of administration by candid discussion, for no matter what may have incited the outbreak on the part of the defendant anarchists, the manifest purpose of such a publication was to create an attempt to defeat the war plans of the government of the United States, by bringing upon the country the paralysis of a general strike, thereby arresting the production of all munitions and other things essential to the conduct of the war.\n This purpose is emphasized in the next paragraph, which reads:\n'Do not let the government scare you with their wild punishment in prisons, hanging and shooting. We must not and will not betray the splendid fighters of Russia. Workers, up to fight.'\n\n After more of the same kind, the circular concludes:\n'Woe unto those who will be in the way of progress. Let solidarity live!'\n\n It is signed, 'The Rebels.'\n That the interpretation we have put upon these articles, circulated in the greatest port of our land, from which great numbers of soldiers were at the time taking ship daily, and in which great quantities of war supplies of every kind were at the time being manufactured for transportation overseas, is not only the fair interpretation of them, but that it is the meaning which their authors consciously intended should be conveyed by them to others is further shown by the additional writings found in the meeting place of the defendant group and on the person of one of them. One of these circulars is headed: 'Revolutionists! Unite for Action!'\n After denouncing the President as 'Our Kaiser' and the hypocrisy of the United States and her Allies, this article concludes:- \n\n[250 U.S. 616, 623]\n\u00a0\n 'Socialists, Anarchists, Industrial Workers of the World, Socialists, Labor party men and other revolutionary organizations Unite for Action and let us save the Workers' Republic of Russia!\n'Know you lovers of freedom that in order to save the Russian revolution, we must keep the armies of the allied countries busy at home.'\n\n Thus was again avowed the purpose to throw the country into a state of revolution, if possible, and to thereby frustrate the military program of the government.\n The remaining article, after denouncing the President for what is characterized as hostility to the Russian revolution, continues:\n'We, the toilers of America, who believe in real liberty, shall pledge ourselves, in case the United States will participate in that bloody conspiracy against Russia, to create so great a disturbance that the autocrats of America shall be compelled to keep their armies at home, and not be able to spare any for Russia.'\n\n It concludes with this definite threat of armed rebellion:\n'If they will use arms against the Russian people to enforce their standard of order, so will we use arms, and they shall never see the ruin of the Russian Revolution.'\n\n These excerpts sufficiently show, that while the immediate occasion for this particular outbreak of lawlessness, on the part of the defendant alien anarchists, may have been resentment caused by our government sending troops into Russia as a strategic operation against the Germans on the eastern battle front, yet the plain purpose of their propaganda was to excite, at the supreme crisis of the war, disaffection, sedition, riots, and, as they hoped, revolution, in this country for the purpose of embarrassing and if possible defeating the military plans of the government in Europe. A technical distinction may perhaps be taken between disloyal and abusive language applied to the form of our government or language intended to bring the form \n\n[250 U.S. 616, 624]\n\u00a0\n of our government into contempt and disrepute, and language of like character and intended to produce like results directed against the President and Congress, the agencies through which that form of government must function in time of war. But it is not necessary to a decision of this case to consider whether such distinction is vital or merely formal, for the language of these circulars was obviously intended to provoke and to encourage resistance to the United States in the war, as the third count runs, and, the defendants, in terms, plainly urged and advocated a resort to a general strike of workers in ammunition factories for the purpose of curtailing the production of ordnance and munitions necessary and essential to the prosecution of the war as is charged in the fourth count. Thus it is clear not only that some evidence but that much persuasive evidence was before the jury tending to prove that the defendants were guilty as charged in both the third and fourth counts of the indictment and under the long established rule of law hereinbefore stated the judgment of the District Court must be\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES, dissenting.\n This indictment is founded wholly upon the publication of two leaflets which I shall describe in a moment. The first count charges a conspiracy pending the war with Germany to publish abusive language about the form of government of the United States, laying the preparation and publishing of the first leaflet as overt acts. The second count charges a conspiracy pending the war to publish language intended to bring the form of government into contempt, laying the preparation and publishing of the two leaflets as overt acts. The third count alleges a conspiracy to encourage resistance to the United States in the same war and to attempt to effectuate the purpose by publishing the same leaflets. The fourth count lays a conspiracy \n\n[250 U.S. 616, 625]\n\u00a0\n to incite curtailment of production of things necessary to the prosecution of the war and to attempt to accomplish it by publishing the second leaflet to which I have referred.\n The first of these leaflets says that the President's cowardly silence about the intervention in Russia reveals the hypocrisy of the plutocratic gang in Washington. It intimates that 'German militarism combined with allied capitalism to crush the Russian revolution'-goes on that the tyrants of the world fight each other until they see a common enemy-working class enlightenment, when they combine to crush it; and that now militarism and capitalism combined, though not openly, to crush the Russian revolution. It says that there is only one enemy of the workers of the world and that is capitalism; that it is a crime for workers of America, etc., to fight the workers' republic of Russia, and ends 'Awake! Awake, you workers of the world! Revolutionists.' A note adds 'It is absurd to call us pro-German. We hate and despise German militarism more than do you hypocritical tyrants. We have more reason for denouncing German militarism than has the coward of the White House.'\n The other leaflet, headed 'Workers-Wake Up,' with abusive language says that America together with the Allies will march for Russia to help the Czecko-Slovaks in their struggle against the Bolsheviki, and that his time the hypocrites shall not fool the Russian emigrants and friends of Russia in America. It tells the Russian emigrants that they now must spit in the face of the false military propaganda by which their sympathy and help to the prosecution of the war have been called forth and says that with the money they have lent or are going to lend 'they will make bullets not only for the Germans but also for the Workers Soviets of Russia,' and further, 'Workers in the ammunition factories, you are producing bullets, bayonets, cannon to murder not only the Germans, \n\n[250 U.S. 616, 626]\n\u00a0\n but also your dearest, best, who are in Russia fighting for freedom.' It then appeals to the same Russian emigrants at some length not to consent to the 'inquisitionary expedition in Russia,' and says that the destruction of the Russian revolution is 'the politics of the march on Russia.' The leaflet winds up by saying 'Workers, our reply to this barbaric intervention has to be a general strike!' and after a few words on the spirit of revolution, exhortations not to be afraid, and some usual tall talk ends 'Woe unto those who will be in the way of progress. Let solidarity live! The Rebels.'\n No argument seems to be necessary to show that these pronunciamentos in no way attack the form of government of the United States, or that they do not support either of the first two counts. What little I have to say about the third count may be postponed until I have considered the fourth. With regard to that it seems too plain to be denied that the suggestion to workers in the ammunition factories that they are producing bullets to murder their dearest, and the further advocacy of a general strike, both in the second leaflet, do urge curtailment of production of things necessary to the prosecution of the war within the meaning of the Act of May 16, 1918, c. 75, 40 Stat. 553, amending section 3 of the earlier Act of 1917 (Comp. St.  10212c). But to make the conduct criminal that statute requires that it should be 'with intent by such curtailment to cripple or hinder the United States in the prosecution of the war.' It seems to me that no such intent is proved.\n I am aware of course that the word 'intent' as vaguely used in ordinary legal discussion means no more than knowledge at the time of the act that the consequences said to be intended will ensue. Even less than that will satisfy the general principle of civil and criminal liability. A man may have to pay damages, may be sent to prison, at common law might be hanged, if at the time of his act \n\n[250 U.S. 616, 627]\n\u00a0\n he knew facts from which common experience showed that the consequences would follow, whether he individually could foresee them or not. But, when words are used exactly, a deed is not done with intent to produce a consequence unless that consequence is the aim of the deed. It may be obvious, and obvious to the actor, that the consequence will follow, and he may be liable for it even if he regrets it, but he does not do the act with intent to produce it unless the aim to produce it is the proximate motive of the specific act, although there may be some deeper motive behind.\n It seems to me that this statute must be taken to use its words in a strict and accurate sense. They would be absurd in any other. A patriot might think that we were wasting money on aeroplanes, or making more cannon of a certain kind than we needed, and might advocate curtailment with success, yet even if it turned out that the curtailment hindered and was thought by other minds to have been obviously likely to hinder the United States in the prosecution of the war, no one would hold such conduct a crime. I admit that my illustration does not answer all that might be said but it is enough to show what I think and to let me pass to a more important aspect of the case. I refer to the First Amendment to the Constitution that Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.\n I never have seen any reason to doubt that the questions of law that alone were before this Court in the Cases of Schenck (\n249 U.S. 47\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 247) Frohwerk (\n249 U.S. 204\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 249), and Debs (\n249 U.S. 211\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 252), were rightly decided. I do not doubt for a moment that by the same reasoning that would justify punishing persuasion to murder, the United States constitutionally may punish speech that produces or is intended to produce a clear and imminent danger that it will bring about forthwith certain substantive evils that the United States constitutionally may seek to prevent. The power undoubtedly is \n\n[250 U.S. 616, 628]\n\u00a0\n greater in time of war than in time of peace because war opens dangers that do not exist at other times.\n But as against dangers peculiar to war, as against others, the principle of the right to free speech is always the same. It is only the present danger of immediate evil or an intent to bring it about that warrants Congress in setting a limit to the expression of opinion where private rights are not concerned. Congress certainly cannot forbid all effort to change the mind of the country. Now nobody can suppose that the surreptitious publishing of a silly leaflet by an unknown man, without more, would present any immediate danger that its opinions would hinder the success of the government arms or have any appreciable tendency to do so. Publishing those opinions for the very purpose of obstructing, however, might indicate a greater danger and at any rate would have the quality of an attempt. So I assume that the second leaflet if published for the purposes alleged in the fourth count might be punishable. But it seems pretty clear to me that nothing less than that would bring these papers within the scope of this law. An actual intent in the sense that I have explained is necessary to constitute an attempt, where a further act of the same individual is required to complete the substantive crime, for reasons given in Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 396\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 276. It is necessary where the success of the attempt depends upon others because if that intent is not present the actor's aim may be accomplished without bringing about the evils sought to be checked. An intent to prevent interference with the revolution in Russia might have been satisfied without any hindrance to carrying on the war in which we were engaged.\n I do not see how anyone can find the intent required by the statute in any of the defendant's words. The second leaflet is the only one that affords even a foundation for the charge, and there, without invoking the hatred of German militarism expressed in the former one, it is evident \n\n[250 U.S. 616, 629]\n\u00a0\n from the beginning to the end that the only object of the paper is to help Russia and stop American intervention there against the popular government- not to impede the United States in the war that it was carrying on. To say that two phrases taken literally might import a suggestion of conduct that would have interference with the war as an indirect and probably undesired effect seems to me by no means enough to show an attempt to produce that effect.\n I return for a moment to the third count. That charges an intent to provoke resistance to the United States in its war with Germany. Taking the clause in the statute that deals with that in connection with the other elaborate provisions of the Act, I think that resistance to the United States means some forcible act of opposition to some proceeding of the United States in pursuance of the war. I think the intent must be the specific intent that I have described and for the reasons that I have given I think that no such intent was proved or existed in fact. I also think that there is no hint at resistance to the United States as I construe the phrase.\n In this case sentences of twenty years imprisonment have been imposed for the publishing of two leaflets that I believe the defendants had as much right to publish as the Government has to publish the Constitution of the United States now vainly invoked by them. Even if I am technically wrong and enough can be squeezed from these poor and puny anonymities to turn the color of legal litmus paper; I will add, even if what I think the necessary intent were shown; the most nominal punishment seems to me all that possible could be inflicted, unless the defendants are to be made to suffer not for what the indictment alleges but for the creed that they avow-a creed that I believe to be the creed of ignorance and immaturity when honestly held, as I see no reason to doubt that it was held here but which, although made the subject of examination at the \n\n[250 U.S. 616, 630]\n\u00a0\n trial, no one has a right even to consider in dealing with the charges before the Court.\n Persecution for the expression of opinions seems to me perfectly logical. If you have no doubt of your premises or your power and want a certain result with all your heart you naturally express your wishes in law and sweep away all opposition. To allow opposition by speech seems to indicate that you think the speech impotent, as when a man says that he has squared the circle, or that you do not care whole heartedly for the result, or that you doubt either your power or your premises. But when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas-that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out. That at any rate is the theory of our Constitution. It is an experiment, as all life is an experiment. Every year if not every day we have to wager our salvation upon some prophecy based upon imperfect knowledge. While that experiment is part of our system I think that we should be eternally vigilant against attempts to check the expression of opinions that we loathe and believe to be fraught with death, unless they so imminently threaten immediate interference with the lawful and pressing purposes of the law that an immediate check is required to save the country. I wholly disagree with the argument of the Government that the First Amendment left the common law as to seditious libel in force. History seems to me against the notion. I had conceived that the United States through many years had shown its repentance for the Sedition Act of 1798 (Act July 14, 1798, c. 73, 1 Stat. 596), by repaying fines that it imposed. Only the emergency that makes it immediately dangerous to leave the correction of evil counsels to time warrants \n\n[250 U.S. 616, 631]\n\u00a0\n making any exception to the sweeping command, 'Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.' Of course I am speaking only of expressions of opinion and exhortations, which were all that were uttered here, but I regret that I cannot put into more impressive words my belief that in their conviction upon this indictment the defendants were deprived of their rights under the Constitution of the United States.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concurs with the foregoing opinion. \n\n\n\n","1":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nALASKA PACIFIC FISHERIES v. TERRITORY OF ALASKA(1919)\nNo. 117\nArgued: Decided: March 3, 1919\n\n\n\n Messrs. J. A. Hellenthal, of Juneau, Alaska, and Harvey M. Friend, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.[ Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. Territory of Alaska \n249 U.S. 53\n (1919) ]\n\n\n[249 U.S. 53, 55]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George B. Grigsby, of Juneau, Alaska, for the Territory.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases were argued and submitted together, and may be disposed of in a single opinion.\n In case No. 117 the action was brought in the District Court for Alaska to recover moneys alleged to be due under a statute imposing a tax upon prosecuting the business of fishing by means of fish traps in the waters of Alaska. The defendant, the Alaska Pacific Fisheries, filed an \n\n[249 U.S. 53, 56]\n\u00a0\n answer in which it set up that the act of the Alaska Legislature, under which the suit was brought, was void under the act of Congress creating the Legislature of Alaska, and under the Constitution of the United States, and set up other defenses not involving the Constitution.\n In case No. 118 the Territory brought an action to recover taxes claimed to be due under an act of the Legislature of the Territory of Alaska for prosecuting the business of fishing for and canning salmon in Alaska. With other defenses the constitutionality of the law was contested by the defendant.\n Judgment in each case was rendered in the District Court in sums in excess of $500 against the Alaska Pacific Fisheries. Upon error to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit the judgments of the District Court were affirmed. 236 Fed. 52, 149 C. C. A. 262; 236 Fed. 70, 149 C. C. A. 280.\n Motions to dismiss the writs of error were filed by the Attorney General of the Territory upon the ground that the judgments of the Circuit Court of Appeals are final. Consideration of the motions was passed to the hearing upon the merits. A determination of the motions involves a construction of sections of the Judicial Code regulating appeals and writs of error in the District Court for Alaska and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Section 134 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1134 [Comp. St.  1125]) provides:\n'In all cases other than those in which a writ of error or appeal will lie direct to the Supreme Court of the United States as provided in section 247, in which the amount involved or the value of the subject-matter in controversy shall exceed five hundred dollars, and in all criminal cases, writs of error and appeals shall lie from the District Court for Alaska or from any division thereof, to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and the judgments, orders, and decrees of said court shall be final in all such cases. But whenever such Circuit Court \n\n[249 U.S. 53, 57]\n\u00a0\n of Appeals may desire the instruction of the Supreme Court of the United States upon any question or proposition of law which shall have arisen in any such case, the court may certify such question or proposition to the Supreme Court, and thereupon the Supreme Court shall give its instruction upon the question or proposition certified to it, and its instructions shall be binding upon the Circuit Court of Appeals.'\n\n Section 247 (36 Stat. 1158 [Comp. St.  1224]) of the Code provides:\n'Appeals and writs of error may be taken and prosecuted from the final judgments and decrees of the District Court for the district of Alaska or for any division thereof direct to the Supreme Court of the United States, in the following cases: In prize cases; and in all cases which involve the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States, or in which the constitutionality of any law of the United States or the validity or construction of any treaty made under its authority is drawn in question, or in which the Constitution or law of a state is claimed to be in contravention of the Constitution of the United States. Such writs of error and appeals shall be taken within the same time, in the same manner, and under the same regulations as writs of error and appeals are taken from the District Courts to the Supreme Court.'\n\n Section 241 (36 Stat. 1157 [Comp. St.  1218]) of the same Code provides:\n'In any case in which the judgment or decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is not made final by the provisions of this title, there shall be of right an appeal or writ of error to the Supreme Court of the United States where the matter in controversy shall exceed one thousand dollars, besides costs.'\n\n It is the contention of the plaintiff in error that under section 241 the judgments of the Circuit Court of Appeals are not final and there is a right to a writ of error from this court, the matter in controversy exceeding $1,000, besides costs. \n\n[249 U.S. 53, 58]\n\u00a0\n The District Court of Alaska is a court with the jurisdiction of United States District Courts and general jurisdiction in civil, criminal, equity, and admiralty causes. 4 U. S. Comp. St.  3564. In that court these suits were brought to recover the taxes in question. As already indicated, the answer in each of the cases raised an issue as to the constitutionality of the statute under which the taxes were levied, and the question which we are now to consider is: Are the judgments of the Circuit Court of Appeals final? In interpreting the sections of the statutes controlling this matter resort must be had to the language of the laws, to the history of the legislation, and the decisions of this court interpreting the Circuit Court of Appeals Act, now substantially carried into the Judicial Code, in so far as the same are applicable.\n The sections of the Judicial Code pertaining to Alaska had their origin in prior federal legislation concerning the territory. The committee on revision of the laws in its report to Congress said of section 134:\n'This section is drawn from section 202 of the Criminal Code for Alaska (Act March 3, 1899, c. 429, 30 Stat. 1307), and from sections 504 and 505 of the Civil Code (Act June 6, 1900, c. 786, 31 Stat. 414, 415), and states what was the existing law on the subject. Those portions of the sections which authorize the taking of writs of error and appeals direct to the Supreme Court are revised in section 247. Formerly capital cases went direct to the Supreme Court. Section 247 was so modified as to take from the Supreme Court its jurisdiction of capital cases, the effect being to vest the right to review on a writ of error in the Circuit Court of Appeals. This is accomplished, so far as this section is concerned, by the omission of the words 'other than capital' after the words 'and in all criminal cases.\" Note by Committee on Revision, 5 Fed. Stat. Ann. p. 644, note to section 134.\n\n Sections 504 and 505 of the Alaska Civil Code, as they \n\n[249 U.S. 53, 59]\n\u00a0\n stood before the enactment of the Judicial Code, are found in 31 Statutes at Large, pp. 414, 415. These sections are as follows:\n'Sec. 504. Appeals and writs of error may be taken and prosecuted from the final judgments of the District Court for the district of Alaska or any division thereof direct to the Supreme Court of the United States in the following cases, namely: In prize causes and in all cases which involve the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States, or in which the constitutionality of any law of the United States, or the validity or construction of any treaty made under its authority is drawn in question, or in which the Constitution or law of a state is claimed to be in contravention of the Constitution of the United States; and that in all other cases where the amount involved or the value of the subject-matter exceeds five hundred dollars the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit shall have jurisdiction to review by writ of error or appeal the final judgments, orders, of the District Court.\n\n'Sec. 505. The judgments of the Circuit Court of Appeals shall be final in all cases coming to it from the District Court, but whenever the judges of the Circuit Court of Appeals may desire the instruction of the Supreme Court of the United States upon any question or proposition of law which shall have arisen in any case pending before the Circuit Court of Appeals on writ of error to or appeal from the District Court, judges may certify such question or proposition to the Supreme Court, and thereupon the Supreme Court shall give its instruction upon the questions and propositions certified to it, and its instruction shall be binding upon the Circuit Court of Appeals.'\n\n A reading of these sections shows that two classes of cases were provided for: (1) Prize cases, and cases involving the Constitution and treaties; (2) other cases wherein the amount involved exceeds $500. In the first \n\n[249 U.S. 53, 60]\n\u00a0\n class of cases appeal or writ of error was to this court direct. In the second class of cases the writ of error or appeal was to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Under section 505 the judgments of the Circuit Court of Appeals were made final in all cases coming to it from the District Court, with the provision that the Circult Court of Appeals might certify propositions of law to this court in any cases pending before it upon writs of error or appeals. The like provision as to the finality in the Circuit Court of Appeals was, we think, carried into the Judicial Code in section 134 thereof, and a writ of error or appeal to this court was allowed where the federal Constitution was involved, under the provisions of section 247. In section 134, as in the Alaska Code from which we have quoted, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals was made final 'in all such cases'; that is, in cases in which the section permitted appeals or writs of error to the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n It is true that section 134 begins by reference to cases other than those which may come to this court, and might be construed to allow appeals to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit only in cases which could not be brought directly to this court. But, bearing in mind the sources of the legislation which was enacted into the Judicial Code and the interpretation which this court has placed upon the Circuit Court of Appeals Act of 1891, we are led to the conclusion that it was not the intention of Congress to give practically two appeals in the class of cases which we are now considering. Under section 5 of the Circuit Court of Appeals Act of 1891 (26 Stat. 826, c. 517), direct appeals might be taken from the District Courts of Circuit Courts to this court in cases which involved the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States, and where such was the only matter involved an appeal could not be taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals. Carolina Glass Co. v. South Carolina, \n240 \nU.S. 305, 318\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 293. But in cases wherein issues involved affecting the \n\n[249 U.S. 53, 61]\n\u00a0\n construction and application of the Constitution, as well as others upon which the case might go to the Circuit Court of Appeals under the Circuit Court of Appeals Act, two appeals were not allowed, and the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals was final if the case was taken there, and the jurisdiction originally invoked rested solely upon grounds which by section 6 of the Circuit Court of Appeals Act (section 128, Judicial Code [ Comp. St.  1120]) made its judgment final. Macfadden v. United States, \n213 U.S. 288\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 490; Robinson v. Caldwell, \n165 U.S. 359\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 343; Loeb v. Columbia Township Trustees, \n179 U.S. 472\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 174; American Sugar Co. v. New Orleans, \n181 U.S. 277\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 646; Boise Water Co. v. Boise City (No. 2), \n230 U.S. 98\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 1003\n\n\n Under the original Alaska Act, cases involving the application of the Constitution were directly reviewable in this court, and those reviewable by the Circuit, Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, were by the terms of the act made final in that court. The Judicial Code, which is primarily a codification of former statutes, carried the provisions of these sections into that Code with the change which made all criminal cases, capital as well as others, final in the Circuit Court of Appeals. Itow v. United States, \n233 U.S. 581\n, 34 Sup.

Mount, all of New York City, for Allanwilde Corporation.\n Mr. John C. Prizer, of New York City, for Vacuum Oil Co. and Pidwell.\n\n\n[248 U.S. 377, 381]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The questions in the cases arise upon libels filed against the Allanwilde to recover prepaid freight for the transportation \n\n[248 U.S. 377, 382]\n\u00a0\n of certain goods and merchandise to designated ports in Europe.\n The solution of the questions turns upon (1) the asserted prevention of the adventure by a storm at sea which the vessel encountered, requiring her return to port for repairs, and (2) afterwards by the restraining power of the government.\n On November 1, 1917, the Allanwilde, owned by the Allanwilde Transport Corporation, was seized upon libels filed by the Vacuum Oil Company and A. W. Pidwell, respectively, each of which had shipped certain goods to be carried from New York to Rochefort, France.\n In May, 1917, the Oil Company chartered the vessel to carry a cargo of oil in barrels at the rate of $16.50 a barrel (changed afterwards to $ 15.25).\n The charter party contained inter alia the following provisions:\n'... Freight to be prepaid net on signing bills of lading in United States gold or equivalent, free of discount, commission, or insurance. Freight earned, retained and irrevocable, vessel lost or not lost.'\n\n On August 25, the oil having been loaded, the vessel issued a bill of lading containing inter alia the following provision:\n'All conditions and exceptions of charter party are to be considered as embodied in this bill of lading.'\n\n Pidwell was permitted to ship certain kegs of nails on the vessel, and on August 15 a bill of lading was issued to him. Inter alia it provided that the carrier should not be liable for loss, damage, delay or default 'by causes beyond the carrier's reasonable control; ... by arrest or restraint of governments, princes, rulers, or peoples; ... by prolongation of the voyage. ...'\n It is provided in paragraph 5 of the bill of lading that:\n'Full freight to destination, whether intended to be pre \n\n[248 U.S. 377, 383]\n\u00a0\n paid or collected at destination, and all advance charges ... are due and payable to (the Allanwilde Transport Corporation) upon the receipt of the goods by the latter ... and any payment made ... in respect of the goods ... shall be deemed fully earned and due and payable to the carrier at any stage before or after loading of the service hereunder without deduction (if unpaid), or refund in whole or in part (if paid), goods or vessel lost or not lost, or if the voyage be broken up. ...'\n\n In pursuance of the contracts thus attested the oil and the nails were shipped on the Allanwilde and the freight was paid in advance-$49,745. 50 for the oil and $3,128.00 for the nails.\n The vessel was seaworthy and properly manned and equipped, and set sail September 11. After she had been out about 14 days and was about 500 miles from New York she encountered a storm so severe that her boats were carried away and she sprang a leak so threatening that the water in her hold was three or four feet deep and was gaining on the pumps. Thereupon the master properly decided that he must seek a port of refuge for safety and repair. Halifax was about 500 miles away, but in that direction the wind was against him, while it was favorable for New York, and on this account as well as for other good reasons he headed for New York, where he arrived on October 5, having been out 24 days. Repairs were undertaken at once, the cargo remaining on board meanwhile.\n'On September 28, while the vessel was at sea, the government decided to refuse clearance thereafter to any sailing vessel bound for the war zone. The master did not know of this condition until the vessel returned to New York; he received no information from the shore after September 11. The repairs being finished, the vessel attempted to resume her voyage, but clearance \n\n[248 U.S. 377, 384]\n\u00a0\n was refused, and none could be obtained in spite of her efforts to induce the government to modify its stand. Toward the end of October the shippers were notified by the carrier to unload their goods, and this they did, but under protest and reserving their rights. Afterwards the oil was forwarded by steamship, but at a higher rate of freight and under other charges. What became of the nails after they were unloaded does not appear.\n\n'The vessel declined to refund the freight to either shipper, and the libels were filed to recover not only the prepaid freight but also damages for failure to carry. On each libel the District Court entered a decree for the prepaid freight alone, refusing recovery for the other damages.'\n\n Upon these facts the Circuit Court of Appeals have certified four questions, two in each libel, as follows:\n'1. Was the adventure frustrated, and was the contract evidenced by the charter party and by the bill of lading issued to the Oil Company dissolved, so as to relieve the carrier from further obligation to carry the oil?\n\n'2. Whatever answer may be given to the first question, did the contract thus evidenced justify the carrier under the facts stated in refusing to refund the prepaid freight?\n\n'3. Was the adventure frustrated, and was the contract evidenced by the bill of lading issued to Pidwell dissolved, so as to relieve the carrier from further obligation to carry the nails?\n\n'4. Whatever answer may be given to the third question, did the contract thus evidenced justify the carrier under the facts stated in refusing to refund the prepaid freight?'\n\n A copy of the charter party and copies of the bills of lading are attached to the certificate and also the official bulletin refusing clearance to 'sailing vessels destined to proceed through the war zone.'\n The argument of counsel upon the elements of the questions \n\n[248 U.S. 377, 385]\n\u00a0\n is quite extensive, ranging through all of the ways in which contracts can be dissolved or their performance excused by the agreement of the parties or prevented by some supervening cause independent of the parties and dominating their convention. We do not think it is necessary to follow the argument through that range. It may be brought to the narrower compass of the charter party and the bills of lading.\n The physical events and what they determined are certified. First, there was the storm, compelling the return of the ship to New York to avert greater disaster; then the action of the government precluding a second departure. Does the contract of the parties provide for such situation and take care of it, and assign its consequences? The charter party provides, as we have seen, that 'Freight to be prepaid net on signing bills of lading. ... Freight earned, retained and irrevocable, vessel lost or not lost.' And it is provided that this provision is, with other provisions, 'to be embodied' in the bill of lading. They seem necessarily, therefore, deliberately adopted to be the measure of the rights and obligations of shipper and carrier. Let us repeat: the explicit declaration is-'Freight to be prepaid net on signing bills of lading. ... Freight earned, retained and irrevocable, vessel lost or not lost.' The provision was not idle or accidental. It is easy to make a charge of injustice against it if we consider only the defeat of the voyage and the noncarriage of the cargo. But there are opposing considerations. There were expected hazards and contingencies in the adventure, and we must presume that the contract was framed in foresight of both and in provision for both. We cannot step in with another and different accommodation. It is urged, however, that there is no provision in the contract (charter party and bill of lading) of the Oil Company excepting 'restraints of princes, rulers and peoples' and that, therefore, the carrier was \n\n[248 U.S. 377, 386]\n\u00a0\n not relieved from its obligation by the refusal of clearance to sailing vessels. And it is further urged that such embargo was at most but a temporary impediment and the cargo should have been retained until the impediment was removed or transported in a vessel not subject to it. We cannot concur in either contention. The duration was of indefinite extent. Necessarily, the embargo would be continued as long as the cause of its imposition-that is, the submarine menace-and that, as far as then could be inferred, would be the duration of the war, of which there could be no estimate or reliable speculation. The condition was, therefore, so far permanent as naturally and justifiably to determine business judgment and action depending upon it. The Kronprinzessin Cecilie, \n244 U.S. 12\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 490.\n There is no imputation of bad faith. The carrier demonstrated an appreciation of its obligations and undertook their discharge. It was stopped, first by storm, and then prevented by the interdiction of the government. In neither situation was it inactive. It quickly repaired the effects of the former and protested against the latter, joining with the shipper in an earnest effort for its relaxation. It gave up only when the impediment was found to be insurmountable.\n The answer to the other contention is that the contract regarded the Allanwilde, a sailing ship, not some other kind of ship or means. The Tornado, \n108 U.S. 342\n, 2 Sup. Ct. 746; The Kronprinzessin Cecilie, supra.\n The bill of lading in No. 450 is even more circumstantial. It provided that--\n'Full freight to destination, whether intended to be prepaid or collect at destination ... shall be deemed fully earned and due and payable to the carrier at any stage before or after loading of the service hereunder, without deduction (if unpaid) or refund in whole or in part (if paid), goods or vessel lost or not lost, or if the voyage be broken up.'\n\n And there is exemption \n\n[248 U.S. 377, 387]\n\u00a0\n from liability 'for any loss, damage, delay or default ... by arrest or restraint of government, princes, rulers, or peoples. ...'\n The questions certified are therefore answered in the affirmative.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","4":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAMERICAN FIRE INS CO. v. KING LUMBER & MANUFACTURING CO.(1919)\nNo. 308\nArgued: April 22, 1919Decided: May 19, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 2, 3]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Gustavus Remak, Jr., of Philadelphia, Pa., and James F. Glen, of Tampa, Fla., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[250 U.S. 2, 5]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Benjamin Micou, of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Action on two fire insurance policies issued by plaintiff in error, to which we shall refer as the insurance company, to defendant in error, to which we shall refer as the lumber company. Each policy was for the sum of $2,500. There was total insurance on the property described in the policies of $45,750, and it was provided that the insurance company should only be liable for its pro rata share of any loss caused by fire under the provisions of the policies. The loss to the lumber company was $21,028.17 and the insurance company's pro rata share was on each policy $1,149.08.\n There is not much dispute about the facts. There \n\n[250 U.S. 2, 6]\n\u00a0\n is considerable dispute about the inferences from them, and facts and inferences were presented in a maze of pleadings which terminated in a demurrer to a rejoinder by the insurance company to replications of the lumber company to the pleas of the insurance company to the declaration in the case.\n The court, in passing upon the demurrer, being of the view that section 2765 of the General Statutes of Florida (infra) was applicable, rendered judgment accordingly for the lumber company on the policies for the sum of $2,298.16, with interest at 8 per cent. from February 16, 1913, and the sum of $300 as a reasonable attorney's fee. The Supreme Court of the state affirmed the judgment.\n The controversy is not especially complicated of itself, but it is made somewhat so by the manner of its presentation. The form and issue of the policies and the fact of fire and loss by it are not in dispute. The controversy centers in the relation of a particular firm of insurance brokers, residing at Tampa, Florida, to the insurance company and the lumber company, whether they were the agents of the former or of the latter under section 2765 of the Statutes of Florida and whether they could dispense with the requirement of a clause in the policies called the warranty clause. That clause, therefore, and section 2765 (and, we may say, also section 2777, the Supreme Court of the state taking it into account), become essential elements of decision, and we exhibit them immediately.\n Section 2765 is as follows:\n'Any person or firm in this state, who receives or receipts for any money on account of or for any contract of insurance made by him or them, or for such insurance company, association, firm or individual, aforesaid, or who receives or receipts for money from other persons to be transmitted to any such company, association, firm or individual, aforesaid, for a policy of insurance, or any renewal thereof, although such policy of insurance is not \n\n[250 U.S. 2, 7]\n\u00a0\n signed by him or them, as agent or representative of such company, association, firm or individual, or who in any wise directly or indirectly makes or causes to be made, any contract of insurance for or on account of such insurance company, association, firm or individual, shall be deemed to all intents and purposes an agent or representative of such company, association, firm or individual.'\n\n Section 2777 is as follows:\n'Any person who solicits insurance and procures applications therefor shall be held to be agent of the party issuing a policy upon such application, anything in the application or policy to the contrary notwithstanding.'\n\n The warranty clause reads:\n'Warranted same gross rate terms and conditions as and to follow the American Central Ins. Co. of St. Louis, Mo., and that said company has, throughout the whole time of this policy, at least $5,000 on the identical subject matter and risk and in identically the same proportion on each separate part thereof; otherwise, this policy shall be null and void.'\n\n The clause was not complied with. The lumber company carried concurrent insurance, but not in the Missouri company. The omission and substitution, it is alleged, were at the suggestion of Lowry & Prince of Tampa, Florida, who were the agents of the insurance company and who, as such agents, caused and procured the lumber company to renew its policies from time to time, and finally the company, at the suggestion of Lowry & Prince, substituted other policies for policies in the Missouri company, with the knowledge of the insurance company, such other companies being equal in credit and responsibility to the Missouri company.\n To these assertions the insurance company opposed contentions of law and fact, not, however, by any one pleading. The following are the facts it alleged, stated \n\n[250 U.S. 2, 8]\n\u00a0\n narratively: The insurance company is a Pennsylvania corporation authorized to write and issue policies on property outside of Pennsylvania. Lowry & Prince, as brokers of the lumber company, applied for it (the lumber company) to the insurance company for insurance upon the lumber company's property. Policies were issued, and upon subsequent application policies were continued to be issued, including those in suit. They were executed in Philadelphia and delivered to Lowry & Prince by mail. They each contained a warranty such as has been set out as to the existence of concurrent insurance with an approved and designated company doing business in Florida, the names of the companies being changed from time to time at Lowry & Prince's request, and finally the name of the American Central Insurance Company of St. Louis, Missouri, being inserted, the ground of the request being that they were the agents of that company and would know of any cancellations by it. Lowry & Prince were not agents of the insurance company nor authorized 'to represent it in any manner, shape or form,' but as agents of the lumber company transmitted to the insurance company at its main office in Philadelphia the original and subsequent applications for policies, and as such agents received by mail the policies and transmitted the amount of premiums to the company less the usual brokers' commissions.\n Besides statement of the above facts the rejoinder contained the following denials: That by issuing the policies to the lumber company it, the insurance company, was engaged in the transaction of business in the state of Florida; that the lumber company paid Lowry & Prince, for it, the insurance company, any premiums on the policies; that Lowry & Prince were its agents; that prior to the furnishing of the proofs of loss by the lumber company it, the insurance company, had any notice or \n\n[250 U.S. 2, 9]\n\u00a0\n knowledge that the Missouri company had canceled its policies on the property insured and did not carry $5,000 on the identical subject-matter and risk; or that it advised or consulted with Lowry & Prince as to the advisability of the risk or otherwise, except to the extent that it did request information from them as to the subject-matter insured and as to the companies carrying insurance thereon.\n It will be observed that the rejoinder raised no question under the Constitution of the United States. That was done by a demurrer to the replications of the lumber company and was expressed, in effect, as follows:\n'The legal predicate for the conclusion that Lowry & Prince were the agents of the defendant [the insurance company] rests upon section 2765 of the General Statutes of Florida.'\n\n And, further, if the section be so construed it violates (a) the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution of the United States in that the state of Florida would thereby deny full faith and credit to the laws of the state of Pennsylvania, and, so construed, it violates (b) the privilege and immunities clause, the due process clause and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Some other matters were set forth in the demurrer which we think are not material to mention. They only express what is expressed in other places, that Lowry & Prince were not the agents of the insurance company, but were and must be considered as agents of the lumber company, and alleged that the policies were Pennsylvania contracts, complied with the Pennsylvania law, and that to construe them as the lumber company contends they should be construed would be to deny that law full faith and credit.\n The ultimate question, then, is the relation in which the insurance brokers stood to the respective companies. The case would seem, therefore, not to be of broad compass, nor to justify the elaborateness of argument that \n\n[250 U.S. 2, 10]\n\u00a0\n has been addressed to it. We certainly do not consider a review of the many cases cited by the insurance company necessary to be made.\n The Florida law first demands attention. It is explicit in its declaration. It was in existence when the policies were executed, and when the policies of which they are the successors were executed. There was, therefore, a course of conduct and transactions through a succession of years-not a single instance or an isolated one, as the insurance company contends, but a number of instances and all in relation. Nor does the case present an attempt of the Florida law to intrude itself into the state of Pennsylvania and control transactions there; it presents simply a Pennsylvania corporation having the permission of that state to underwrite policies on property outside of the state and the exercise of the right in Florida. And necessarily it had to be exercised in accordance with the laws of Florida. There was no law of Pennsylvania to the contrary-no law of Pennsylvania, would have power to the contrary. There is no foundation, therefore, for the contention that full faith was not given to a law of Pennsylvania, nor of a denial of a right to a citizen1 of Pennsylvania, nor of a denial of due process or the equal protection of the law.\n The law of Florida, it is true, puts an element into the transactions of the parties to insurance and makes the person who solicits insurance and procures applications the agent of the party issuing the policy, and this against any provision in the policy to the contrary; and, even farther, the law makes the person who receives or receipts for money from the insured to be transmitted to the insurer the agent of the latter. \n\n[250 U.S. 2, 11]\n\u00a0\n There is nothing unreasonable in the conditions; they regulate the transactions, do not prevent them, or even embarrass them by ambiguity. A company is informed what it may incur by underwriting insurance in the state, and it cannot assert surprise or ignorance-certainly the insurance company in the present case cannot do so. It had knowledge or must be charged with knowledge of the law. It dealt through Lowry & Prince during a succession of years, permitted them to receive and receipt for premiums and transmit them to it, and consulted with them about the subject-matter and with what companies the risk was divided. It accepted the benefit of their action while premiums were being received and new policies were being issued. It is rather late to reject the consequence. Indeed, the attempt at rejection suggests the possibility of the occurrence of examples of like kind and may indicate the reason for the enactment of the law-suggests that its purpose was to preclude confusion and dispute as to the relation of the broker to the parties respectively, and to preclude an underwriter, after using the agency, from denying responsibility.\n These deductions are not contravened by the cases cited by the insurance company. Its basic proposition is that a state has no jurisdiction of persons or property beyond its borders or of contracts executed beyond its borders, and it invokes the proposition by the assertion that the policies were Pennsylvania contracts and being such were immune from regulation by Florida, and New York Ins. Co. v. Head, \n234 U.S. 149\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 879, is adduced as typical. In that case the principle was expressed that the laws of a state could not be extended beyond its confines, and it was concretely applied in the case to deny to the state of Missouri the right to extend its authority into the state of New York and there forbid a citizen of New Mexico and a citizen of New York from \n\n[250 U.S. 2, 12]\n\u00a0\n making a loan agreement in New York simply because it modified a contract originally made in Missouri. The difference between that case and this is manifest, and the other cases relied on are not nearer in point. The Florida statute does not attempt to invade Pennsylvania and exercise control there. It stays strictly at home in this record and regulates the insurance company when it comes to the state to do business with the citizens of the state and their property.\n It is true the insurance company contends that its thansactions were all isolated ones, not such as to constitute doing business in the state, and, besides, that it had no permission to be in the state and could not be presumed to be there against its laws; and, besides, again, its policies declared that they were to be effective in Pennsylvania. Cases are cited which are assumed to support these contentions. A review of them is unnecessary. The contentions confuse a simple situation and would withdraw from the jurisdiction of Florida transactions there and give them another theater and another control. In other words, would displace the law by the very things it precludes from such operation.\n The challenging response of the insurance company is that to give the law that effect is to bring it under the condemnation of Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Hilton-Green, \n241 U.S. 613\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 676. That case considered the Florida law, but did not deny its legality nor decide that the state could not make the local broker, if the designated conditions existed, the agent of an underwriter. It only decided that the knowledge of the agent of misrepresentation and fraud by the insured could not be imputed to the underwriter. It was naturally held that such imputation was a perversion of the rule which imputes an agent's knowledge to his principal and its underlying reason 'that an innocent third party may properly presume the agent will perform his duty and report all facts which affect \n\n[250 U.S. 2, 13]\n\u00a0\n the principal's interest.' To so extend the law would be a perversion of it, not a use to it-make it not a regulation but an oppression. The present case is not open to that condemnation. The lumber company was an 'innocent third party' and could properly presume that Lowry & Prince would and did perform their duty and report to the insurance company their knowledge of the concurrent insurance that was carried on the property, and that the provision requiring it was equivalently complied with. And there was no dereliction in the agents; the substituted security was not insufficient. If the power that was exercised had no binding effect on the insurance company it would be difficult to imagine what would have under the Florida statute. Nor can we yield to the contention that to so construe it is 'to raise special agents with limited authority into general agents.'\n The insurance company, however, insists that the policies constituted the contracts between it and the lumber company and that they were not subject to subsequent variation, and Lumber Underwriters v. Rife, \n237 U.S. 605\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 717, is cited. The case is not apposite. There was an attempt, in that case, to vary the written words of a contract by a concurrent parol agreement; in other words, and to quote those of the case, to establish 'by parol proof that at the very moment the policy was delivered' one of its provisions was waived. It was not decided that there could not be a subsequent waiver of a provision of a policy nor that the convention of the parties could not be made subject to a law of the state.\n Finally the insurance company contends that the Florida law as aided by the decision of the Supreme Court of the state, gives 'the agent of the insured unlimited authority to bind the insurer, and forbids inquiry into the facts, in violation of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.' Phases of the contention are covered by what we have said, and its main foundation that inquiry into the facts is forbidden \n\n[250 U.S. 2, 14]\n\u00a0\n is not tenable. The facts were exhibited in the pleadings and they showed that the conditions for the application of the law existed. They showed insurance effected through the brokers, Lowry & Prince, their communication with the insurance company, their transmission of money to it, the payment of their commission by the company, and the consultation of the company with them as to the 'subject-matter insured, and the companies carrying insurance thereon,' to use the language of the rejoinder.\n A motion to dismiss is made on the ground that the federal questions raised were not passed upon by the courts of the state, but that the courts rested their decision on the fact that the contracts were made in Florida rather than in Pennsylvania. That, however, was a disputed proposition and the motion so far involved the merits of the case that we have considered, under such circumstances, justice would be better served by going into the merits.

W. 297), the Supreme Court of the state held that this tax did not apply to sales made of goods shipped from plaintiff's factory in the state of New York directly to purchasers in Texas, but only to sales from its St. Louis factory.\n Int he present case, which was a suit brought in a state court by plaintiff in error against the city to recover so much of a disputed tax as is measured by sales of goods manufactured by plaintiff in the city, afterwards removed to storage warehouses outside of the state, and later sold from these warehouses to purchasers in states other than Missouri, the trial court at first gave judgment in favor of plaintiff on this item, and this having been reversed by the Supreme Court of the state (270 Mo. 40, 192 S. W. 402), a new trial resulting in favor of the city, and the second judgment having been affirmed (Mo., 198 S. W. 1183), the case comes here on writ of error.\n In construing the statute and ordinance and defining the nature and effect of the tax, the Supreme Court expressed itself as follows (270 Mo. p. 45, 192 S. W. 403):\n'It is not disputed that under the broad provision of its charter the city of St. Louis has the power to license and tax manufacturers within its limits; nor that the power includes the right to impose a tax upon the transaction of their business. Adopting substantially the definition we have quoted from the statute, it has, by ordinance, forbidden them to pursue their business within the city \n\n[250 U.S. 459, 462]\n\u00a0\n without procuring a license, and has prescribed the additional tax they shall pay for that purpose, which is graduated to accord with the amount of business they shall carry to the point of realizing the profit or liquidating the loss by the sale of the product of their work. They may only buy and sell in pursuance of their business as manufacturers. That his right to pursue this business is the one thing he receives as compensation for this tax is evident; and that the method of fixing its amount by the amount that he realizes from the licensed activity is a just and equitable one is not disputed; nor is the inherent justness and fairness of postponing the payment until the realization of the result of the work. The tax is none the less a tax upon the business of manufacture pursued in the city of St. Louis under the protection of the laws of this state and the ordinances of the city. ... We hold that the tax in question is a tax upon the privilege of pursuing the business of manufacturing these goods in the city of St. Louis; that when the goods were manufactured the obligation accrued to pay the amount of the tax represented by their production when it should be liquidated by their sale by the manufacturer; that their removal from the city of St. Louis and storage elsewhere, whether within or without the state, worked no change in this obligation; that their sale by the respondent wherever they may have been stored at the time, whether it was done through its home office in New York or the office of its factory in St. Louis, should have been reported in its return to the license collector of the city of St. Louis and the amount included in fixing the amount payable on account of its license tax.'\n\n As a matter of construction, this, upon familiar principles, is conclusive upon us. But, as has been held very often, the question whether a state law or a tax imposed thereunder deprives a party of rights secured by the federal Constitution depends not upon the form of the act, nor \n\n[250 U.S. 459, 463]\n\u00a0\n upon how it is construed or characterized by the state court, but upon its practical operation and effect. St. Louis S. W. Ry. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 362\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 99; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 \nU.S. 219, 237\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642; Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n245 \nU.S. 292, 294\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 126.\n The admitted facts show that the operation and effect of the taxing scheme now under consideration are correctly described in what we have quoted from the opinion of the state court. No tax has been, or is to be imposed upon any sales of goods by plaintiff in error except goods manufactured by it in St. Louis under a license conditioned for the payment of a tax upon the amount of the sales when theg oods should come to be sold. The tax is computed according to the amount of the sales of such manufactured goods, irrespective of whether they be sold within or without the state, in one kind of commerce or another; and payment of the tax is not made a condition of selling goods in interstate or in other commerce, but only of continuing the manufacture of goods in the city of St. Louis.\n There is no doubt of the power of the state, or of the city acting under its authority, to impose a license tax in the nature of an excise upon the conduct of a manufacturing business in the city. Unless some particular interference with federal right be shown, the states are free to lay privilege and occupation taxes. Clark v. Titusville, \n184 U.S. 329\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 382; St. Louis v. United Railways Co., \n210 \nU.S. 266, 276\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 630\n\n\n The city might have measured such tax by a percentage upon the value of all goods manufactured, whether they ever should come to be sold or not, and have required payment as soon as, or even before, the goods left the factory. In order to mitigate the burden, and also perhaps, to bring merchants and manufacturers upon an equal footing in this regard, it has postponed ascertainment and payment of the tax until the manufacturer can bring \n\n[250 U.S. 459, 464]\n\u00a0\n the goods into market. A somewhat similar method of postponing payment has been pursued for many years by the federal government with respect to the internal revenue tax upon distilled spirits. Rev. Stat.  3251, 3253 ( Comp. St.  5985, 5988); Act August 27, 1894, c. 349,  48, 28 Stat. 509, 563 (Comp. St.  5986).\n To the suggestion that the tax burdens the mercantile rather than the manufacturing business, because it would be possible for one to manufacture goods to an unlimited extent and pay no tax unless they were sold, or to sell goods and be required to pay the tax although they were not manufactured by the seller, it is sufficient to say-answering the second point first-(a) that, according to the state law as laid down by the court of last resort in this case, a manufacturer has no right to sell goods except those of his own manufacture; and (b) it is not to be supposed that, for the purpose of evading a tax payable only upon the sale of his goods, a manufacturer would pursue the ruinous policy of making goods and locking them up permanently in warehouses. In the outcome the tax is the same in amount as if it were measured by the sale value of the goods but imposed upon the completion of their manufacture. The difference is that, for reasons of practical benefit to the taxpayer, the city has postponed payment until convenient means have been furnished through the marketing of the goods.\n In our opinion, the operation and effect of the taxing ordinance are to impose a legitimate burden upon the business of carrying on the manufacture of goods in the city; it produces no direct burden on commerce in the goods manufactured, whether domestic or interstate, and only the same kind of incidental and indirect effect as that which results from the payment of property taxes or any other and general contribution to the cost of government. Therefore it does not amount to a regulation of interstate commerce. And, for like reasons, it has not the effect of imposing a tax upon the property or the busi \n\n[250 U.S. 459, 465]\n\u00a0\n ness transactions of plaintiff in error outside of the state of Missouri, and hence does not deprive plaintiff in error of its property without due process of law.\n Our recent decisions cited in opposition to this view, Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n245 \nU.S. 292, 297\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 126, and Looney v. Crane Co., \n245 \nU.S. 178, 188\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 85, and other cases of the same kind referred to therein, are so obviously distinguishable that particular\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Petition for rehearing pending. \n\n\n\n\n","6":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nANDREWS v. VIRGINIAN R. CO.(1919)\nNo. 82\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1919\n\n\n\n\n\n[248 U.S. 272, 273]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. A. P. Staples and A. B.

Wingfield, both of Roanoke, Va., for defendant in error\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE, after making the foregoing statement of the case, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n At the threshold, there arises a question of our jurisdiction which we may not overlook and which we must therefore decide. The question is, has this court power by writ of error to review the judgment below; or, in other words, is the authority of the court to review that judgment confined by the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726 (Comp. St.  1214), to the right to do so by certiorari in the mode and time provided by that act? Considering the subject only from the character of the controversy, it is indisputable that the case comes within the generic class as to which the power to review by writ of error was taken away by the act of 1916 and the authority to certiorari substituted. It results that, unless the judgment in question comes under some limitation or exception provided by the statute to the general rule which it establishes, we have no jurisdiction.\n There is no room for such exception unless it results from the provision in the statute taking out of the reach of its terms judgments rendered before it became operative. The act was approved on September 6, 1916, and was made operative 30 days thereafter. In form, the judgment to which the writ of error was addressed was rendered on June 16, 1916, before the operation of the statute, and was therefore outside of its provisions. But the question remains, Was the judgment a final judgment at the date named, or did it become so only by the exercise by the Court of Appeals of its power as manifested by its declining to take jurisdiction on November 13, 1916, \n\n[248 U.S. 272, 275]\n\u00a0\n after the passage of the act? Undoubtedly, before the action of the Court of Appeals, the judgment was not final and was susceptible of being reviewed and reversed by that court. Undoubtedly, also, until the Court of Appeals acted, the trial court was not the court of last resort of the state whose action could be here reviewed. The contention, therefore, that the judgment of the trial court was a final judgment susceptible of being here reviewed by writ of error must rest upon the impossible assumption that the finality of that judgment existed before the happening of the cause by which alone finality could be attributed to it.\n It is true that under the law of Virginia, in a case like this the power of the Court of Appeals to review the judgment of the trial court was gracious or discretionary, and not imperative or obligatory; but the existence of the power, and not the considerations moving to its exercise, is the criterion by which to determine whether the judgment of the trial court was final at the time of its apparent date, or became so only from the date of the happening of the condition-the action of the Court of Appeals-which gave to that judgment its only possible character of finality for the purpose of review in this court. Nor is the result thus stated a technical one, since it rests upon the broadest considerations inhering in the very nature of our constitutional system of government, and material, therefore, to the exercise by this court of its rightful authority. That this is true, would seem to be demonstrated by considering that if it were not so a judgment of a state court susceptible of being reviewed by this court would, notwithstanding that duty, be open at the same time to the power of a state court to review and reverse, thus, in substance, depriving each court of its power and begetting the possibility of conflict and confusion.\n From this it follows that the judgment to which the writ of error was addressed was in substance a judgment \n\n[248 U.S. 272, 276]\n\u00a0\n rendered after the going into effect of the act of 1916, and was only reviewable by certiorari, as provided in that act. The writ of error, therefore, must be and it is\n Dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","7":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nARIZONA COPPER CO. v.

C., for defendant in error. \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 417]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In each of these cases, a workman in a hazardous industry in the state of Arizona, having received in the course of his employment a personal injury through an accident due to a condition or conditions of the occupation, not caused by his own negligence or so far as appears by that of his employer or others, brought action under the Employers' Liability Law of Arizona, and recovered compensatory damages against the employer ascertained upon a consideration of the nature, extent, and disabling effects of the injury in each particular case. And the question is raised whether the statute referred to, as applied to the facts of these cases, is repugnant to that provision of the Fourteenth Amendment which declares that no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n Article 18 of the Constitution of the state of Arizona is entitled 'Labor,' and contains, among others, the following sections:\n'Section 4. The common-law doctrine of fellow servant, so far as it affects the liability of a master for injuries to his servant resulting from the acts or omissions of any other servant or servants of the common master is forever abrogated.\n\n'Section 5. The defense of contributory negligence or of assumption of risk shall, in all cases whatsoever, be a question of fact and shall, at all times, be left to the jury.\n\n'Section 6. The right of action to recover damages for injuries shall never be abrogated, and the amount recovered shall not be subject to any statutory limitation.\n\n'Section 7. To protect the safety of employes in all hazardous occupations, in mining, smelting, manufacturing, railroad or street railway transportation, or any other industry the Legislature shall enact an employers' lia \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 418]\n\u00a0\n bility law, by the terms of which any employer, whether individual, association, or corporation shall be liable for the death or injury, caused by any accident due to a condition or conditions of such occupation, of any employe in the service of such employer in such hazardous occupation, in all cases in which such death or injury of such employe shall not have been caused by the negligence of the employe killed or injured.\n\n'Section 8. The Legislature shall enact a workmen's compulsory compensation law applicable to workmen engaged in manual or mechanical labor in such employments as the Legislature may determine to be especially dangerous, by which compulsory compensation shall be required to be paid to any such workman by his employer, if in the course of such employment personal injury to any such workmen from any accident arising out of, and in the course of, such employment is caused in whole, or in part, or is contributed to, by a necessary risk or danger of such employment, or a necessary risk or danger inherent in the nature thereof, or by failure of such employer, or any of his or its officers, agents, or employe, or employes, to exercise due care, or to comply with any [law?] affecting such employment: Provided, that it shall be optional with said employe to settle for such compensation, or retain the right to sue said employer as provided by this Constitution.'\n\n Pursuant to section 7 the Employers' Liability Law was enacted ( chapter 89, Laws 1912, Reg. Sess.; ArizonaR ev. Stat. 1913, pars. 3153- 3162); pursuant to section 8 a Workmen's Compulsory Compensation Law was enacted (chapter 14, Laws 1912, 1st Spec. Sess.; Arizona Rev. Stat. 1913, pars. 3163 et seq.).\n In two of the present cases the former law was sustained by the Supreme Court of Arizona against attacks based upon the Fourteenth Amendment. Inspiration Consol. Copper Co. v. Mendez, 19 Ariz. 151, 166 Pac. 278, 1183; Superior & \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 419]\n\u00a0\n Pittsburg Copper Co. v. Tomich, 19 Ariz. 182, 165 Pac. 1101, 1185. In the other three cases it was sustained by the United States District Court for that district. And the resulting judgments in favor of the injured workmen are brought under our review by writs of error.\n Some of the arguments submitted to us assail the wisdom and policy of the act because of its novelty, because of its one-sided effect in depriving the employer of defenses while giving him (as is said) nothing in return, leaving the damages unlimited, and giving to the employe the option of several remedies, as tending not to obviate but to promote litigation, and as pregnant with danger to the industries of the state. With such considerations this court cannot concern itself. Novelty is not a constitutional objection, since under constitutional forms of government each state may have a legislative body endowed with authority to change the law. In what respects it shall be changed, and to what extent, is in the main confided to the several states; and it is to be presumed that their Legislatures, being chosen by the people, understand and correctly appreciate their needs. The states are left with a wide range of legislative discretion, notwithstanding the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment; and their conclusions respecting the wisdom of their legislative acts are not reviewable by the courts.\n We have been called upon recently to deal with various forms of workmen's compensation and employers' liability statutes. Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 U.S. 1\n, 47-53, 32 Sup. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44; New York Central R. R. Co. v. White, \n243 U.S. 188\n, 196, et seq., 37 Sup. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629; Hawkins v. Bleakly, \n243 U.S. 210\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 255, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 637; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 U.S. 219\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642; Middleton v. Texas Power & Light Co., \n249 U.S. 152\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 227. These decisions have established the propositions that the rules of law concerning the employer's responsibility for personal injury or death of an employe arising in the course of the employment are not beyond alteration by legislation in \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 420]\n\u00a0\n the public interest; that no person has a vested right entitling him to have these any more than other rules of law remain unchanged for his benefit; and that, if we exclude arbitrary and unreasonable changes, liability may be imposed upon the employer without fault, and the rules respecting his responsibility to one employe for the negligence of another and respecting contributory negligence and assumption of risk are subject to legislative change.\n The principal contention is that the Arizona Employers' Liability Law deprives the employer of property without due process of law, and denies to him the equal protection of the laws, because it imposes a liability without fault, and, as is said, without equivalent protection. The statute, in respect of certain specified employments designated as inherently hazardous and dangerous to workmen-and reasonably so described-imposes upon the employer, without regard to the question of his fault or that of any person for whose conduct he is responsible, a liability in compensatory damages, excluding all such as are speculative or punitive ( Arizona Copper Co. v. Burciaga, 177 Pac. 29), for accidental personal injury or death of an employe arising out of and in the course of the employment and due to a condition or conditions of the occupato n, in cases where such injury or death of the employe shall not have been caused by his own negligence. This is the substance of paragraphs 3154 and 3158, and they are to be read in connection with paragraph 3156, which declares what occupations are hazardous within the meaning of the law. By paragraph 3160, contracts and regulations exempting the employer from liability are declared to be void.\n In effect, the statute requires the employer, instead of the employe, to assume the pecuniary risk of injury or death of the employe attributable to hazards inherent in the employment and due to its conditions and not to the negligence of the employe killed or injured. In deter \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 421]\n\u00a0\n mining whether this departure from the previous rule is so arbitrary or inconsistent with the fundamental rights of the employer as to render the law repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment, it is to be borne in mind that the matter of the assumption of the risks of employment and the consequences to flow therefrom has been regulated time out of mind by the common law, with occasional statutory modifications. The rule existing in the absence of statute, as usually enunciated, is that all consequences of risks inherent in the occupation and normally incident to it are assumed by the employe and afford no ground of action by him or those claiming under him, in the absence of negligence by the employer; and even risks arising from or increased by the failure of the employer to take the care that he ought to take for the employe's safety are assumed by the latter if he is aware of them or if they are so obvious that any ordinarily prudent person under the circumstances could not fail to observe and appreciate them; but if the employe, having become aware of a risk arising out of a defect attributable to the employer's negligence, makes complaint or objection and obtains a promise or reparation, the common law brings into play a new set of regulations requiring the employer to assume the risk under certain circumstances, the employe under others. Seaboard Air Line v. Horton, \n233 \nU.S. 492, 504\n, 505 S., 34 Sup. Ct. 635, L. R. A. 1915C, 1, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 475; s. c., \n239 \nU.S. 595, 598\n, 599 S., 36 Sup. Ct. 180, and cases cited.\n But these are no more than rules of law, deduced by the courts as reasonable and just, under the conditions of our civilization, in view of the relations existing between employer and employe in the absence of legislation. They are not placed, by the Fourteenth Amendment, beyond the reach of the state's power to alter them, as rules of future conduct and tests of responsibility, through legislation designed to promote the general welfare, so long as it does not interfere arbitrarily and unreasonably, and in \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 422]\n\u00a0\n defiance of natural justice, with the right of employers and employes to agree between themselves respecting the terms and conditions of employment.\n We are unable to say that the Employers' Liability Law of Arizona, in requiring the employer in hazardous industries to assume-so far as pecuniary consequences go-the entire risk of injury to the employe attributable to accidents arising in the course of the employment and due to its inherent conditions, exceeds the bounds of permissible legislation or interferes with the constitutional rights of the employer. The answer that the common law makes to the hardship of requiring the employe to assume all consequences, both personal and pecuniary, of injuries arising out of the ordinary dangers of the occupation, is that the parties enter into the contract of employment with these risks in view, and that the consequences ought to be, and presumably are, taken into consideration in fixing the rate of wages. Chicago, Milwaukee R. R. v. Ross, \n112 \nU.S. 377, 383\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 184; Northern Pacific R. R. Co. v. Herbert, \n116 \nU.S. 642, 647\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 590; New York Central R. R. Co. v. White, \n243 \nU.S. 188, 199\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 247, 61 L. d . 667, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629; Farwell v. Boston & Worcester R. R. Corp., 4 Metc. (Mass.) 49, 57, 38 Am. Dec. 339. In like manner the employer, if required-as he is by this statute in some occupations-to assume the pecuniary loss arising from such injury to the employe, may take this into consideration in fixing the rate of wages; besides which he has an opportunity, which the employe has not, to charge the loss as a part of the cost of the product of the industry.\n There is no question here of punishing one who is without fault. That, we may concede, would be contrary to natural justice. But, as we have seen, the statute limits the recovery strictly to compensatory damages. And there is no discrimination between employer and employe except such as necessarily arises from their different relation to the common undertaking. Both are essential \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 423]\n\u00a0\n to it, the one to furnish capital, organization, and guidance, the other to perform the manual work; both foresee that the occupation is of such a nature, and its conditions such, that sooner or later some of the workmen will be physically injured or maimed, occasionally one killed, without particular fault on anybody's part. See \n243 U.S. 203\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629. The statute requires that compensation shall be paid to the injured workman or his dependents, because it is upon them that the first brunt of the loss falls; and that it shall be paid by the employer, because he takes the gross receipts of the common enterprise, and by reason of his position of control can make such adjustments as ought to be and practically can be made, in the way of reducing wages and increasing the selling price of the product, in order to allow for the statutory liability. There could be no more rational basis for a discrimination; and it is clear that in this there is no denial of the 'equal protection of the laws.'\n Under the 'due process' clause, the ultimate contention is that men have an indefeasible right to employ their fellow men to work under conditions where, as all parties know, from time to time some of the workmen inevitably will be killed or injured, but where nobody knows or can know in advance which particular men or how many will be the victims, or how serious will be the injuries, and hence no adequate compensation can be included in the wages; and to employ them thus with the legitimate object of making a profit above their wages if all goes well, but with immunity from particular loss if things go badly with the workmen through no fault of their own, and they suffer physical injury or death in the course of their employment. In view of the subject-matter, and of the public interest involved, we cannot assent to the proposition that the rights of life, liberty, and property guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment prevent the states from modifying that rule of the common law \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 424]\n\u00a0\n which requires or permits the workingman to take the chances in such a lottery.\n The act-assuming, as we must, that it be justly administered-adds no new burden of cost to industry, although it does bring to light a burden that previously existed, but perhaps was unrecognized, by requiring that its cost be taken into the reckoning. The burden is due to the hazardous nature of the industry, and is inevitable if the work of the world is to go forward. What the act does is merely to require that it shall be assumed, to the extent of a pecuniary equivalent of the actual and proximate damage sustained by the workman or those near to him, by the employer-by him who organizes the enterprise, hires the workmen, fixes the wages, sets a price upon the product, pays the costs, and takes for his reward the net profits, if any.\n The interest of the state is obvious. We declared in the White Case, \n243 U.S. 207\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 254, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629:\n'It cannot be doubted that the state may prohibit and punish self- maiming and attempts at suicide; it may proi bit a man from bartering away his life or his personal security; indeed, the right to these is often declared, in bills of rights, to be 'natural and inalienable'; and the authority to prohibit contracts made in derogation of a lawfully established policy of the state respecting compensation for accidental death of disabling personal injury is equally clear. ... This statute does not concern itself with measures of prevention, which presumably are embraced in other laws. But the interest of the public is not confined to these. One of the grounds of its concern with the continued life and earning power of the individual is its interest in the prevention of pauperism, with its concomitants of vice and crime. And, in our opinion, laws regulating the responsibility of employers for the injury or death of employes arising out of the employment bear so close a relation to the protection of the lives and safety of those \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 425]\n\u00a0\n concerned that they properly may be regarded as coming within the category of police regulations' (citing cases).\n\n And in Mountain Timber Co. v.

Cas. 1917D, 642) it was said:\n'Certainly, the operation of industrial establishments that in the ordinary course of things frequently and inevitably produce disabling or mortal injuries to the human beings employed is not a matter of wholly private concern.'\n\n Having this interest, the state of Arizona reasonably might say:\n'The rule of the common law requiring the employe to assume all consequences of personal injuries arising out of the ordinary dangers and normal conditions of a hazardous occupation, and to secure his indemnity in advance in the form of increased wages, is incompatible with the public interest because-assuming that workmen are on an equality with employers in a negotiation about the rate of wages-the probability of injury occurring to a particular employe, and the nature and extent of such injury, are so contingent and speculative that it is impracticable for either employer or employe approximately to estimate in advance how much allowance should be made for them in the wages; and even were a proper allowance made, experience demonstrates that under our conditions of life it is not to be expected that the average workingman will set aside out of his wages a proper insurance against the time when he may be injured or killed. Hence, recognizing that injuries to workmen constitute a part of the unavoidable cost of hazardous industries, we will require that it be assumed by the one in control of the industry as employer, just as he pays other items of cost; so that he shall not take a profit from the labor of his employes while leaving the injured ones, and the dependents of those whose lives are lost, through accidents due to the conditions of the occupation, to be a burden upon the public.'\n\n Whether this or similar reasoning was employed, we \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 426]\n\u00a0\n have no means of knowing; whether, if employed, it ought to have been accepted as convincing, is not for us to decide. It being incumbent upon the opponents of the law to demonstrate that it is clearly unreasonable and arbitrary, it is sufficient for us to declare, as we do, that such reasoning would be pertinent to the subject and not so unfounded or irrational as to permit us to say that the state, if it accepted it as a basis for changing the law in a matter so closely related to the public welfare, exceeded the restrictions placed upon its action by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n It is objected that the responsibility of the employer under this statute is unlimited; but this is not true except as it is true of every action for compensatory damages where the amount awarded varies in accordance with the nature and extent of the damages for which compensation is made. It is said that in actions by employes against employers juries are prone to render extravagant verdicts. The same thing has been said, and with equal reason, concerning actin  brought by individuals against railroad companies, traction companies, and other corporations. In this, as in other cases, there is a corrective in the authority of the court to set aside an exorbitant verdict. And it amounts to a contradiction of terms to say that in submitting a controversy between litigants to the established courts, there to be tried according to long-established modes and with a constitutional jury to determine the issues of fact and assess compensatory damages, there is a denial of 'due process of law.'\n Much stress is laid upon that part of our opinion in the White Case, where, after citing numerous previous decisions upholding the authority of the states to establish by legislation departures from the fellow servant rule and other common-law rules affecting the employer's liability for personal injuries to the employe, we said (\n243 U.S. 201\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 252, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629):\n'It is true that in the case of the statutes thus \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 427]\n\u00a0\n sustained there were reasons rendering the particular departures appropriate. Nor is it necessary, for the purposes of the present case, to say that a state might, without violence to the constitutional guaranty of 'due process of law,' suddenly set aside all common-law rules respecting liability as between employer and employe, without providing a reasonably just substitute. ... No such question is here presented, and we intimate no opinion upon it. The statute under consideration sets aside one body of rules only to establish another system in its place,' etc.\n\n In spite of our declaration that no opinion was intimated, this is treated as an intimation that a statute such as the one now under consideration, creating a new and additional right of action and allowing no defense (if the conditions of liability be shown) unless the accident was caused by the negligence of the injured employe, would be regarded as in conflict with the due process clause. We cannot, however regard this statute as anything else than a substitute for the law as it previously stood; whether it be a proper substitute was for the people of the state of Arizona to determine; but we find no ground for declaring that they have acted so arbitrarily, unreasonably, and unjustly as to render their action void. They have resolved that the consequences of a personal injury to an employe attributable to the inherent dangers of the occupation shall be assumed, not wholly by the particular employe upon whom the personal injury happens to fall, but, to the extent of a compensation in money awarded in a judicial tribunal according to the ordinary processes of law, shall be assumed by the employer; leaving the latter to charge it up, so far as he can, as a part of the cost of his product, just as he would charge a loss by fire, by theft, by bad debts, or any other usual loss of the business; and to make allowance for it, so far as he can, in a reduced scale of wages. And they have come to this resolution, we repeat, not in a matter of in \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 428]\n\u00a0\n difference, or upon a question of mere economics, but in the course of regulating the conduct of those hazardous industries in which human beings- their own people-in the pursuit of a livelihood must expose themselves to death or to physical injuries more or less disabling, with consequent impoverishment, partial or total, of the workman or those dependent upon him. The statute says to the employer, in effect:\n'You shall not employ your fellow men in a hazardous occupation for gain, you being in a position to reap a reward in money through selling the product of their toil, unless you come under an obligation to make appropriate compensation in money in case of their death or injury due to the conditions of the occupation.'\n\n The rule being based upon reasonable grounds affecting the public interest, being established in advance and applicable to all alike under similar circumstances, there is, in our opinion, no infringement of the fundamental i ghts protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Some expressions contained in our opinion in the White Case, \n243 \nU.S. 203, 204\n, 205 S., 37 Sup. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629, are treated in argument as if they were equivalent to saying that if a state, in making a legislative adjustment of employers' liability, departs from the common-law system of basing responsibility upon fault, it must confine itself to a limited compensation, measured and ascertained according to the methods adopted in the compensation acts of the present day. Of course nothing of the kind was intended. In a previous part of the opinion (\n243 U.S. 196\n-200, 37 Sup. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629) it had been shown that the employer had no constitutional right to continued immunity from liability in the absence of negligence, nor to have the fellow servant rule and the rules respecting contributory negligence and assumption of risk remain unchanged. The statutory plan of compensation for injured workmen and the dependents of those fatally injured-an additional feature at variance with the common law-was then upheld; but, of course, without \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 429]\n\u00a0\n saying that no other would be constitutional. For if, as we held in that case, the novel statutory scheme of awarding compensation according to a prearranged scale is sustainable, it follows, perhaps a fortiori, that the Arizona method of ascertaining the compensation according to the facts of each particular case-substantially the common-law method-is free from objection on constitutional grounds. Indeed, if a state recognizes or establishes a right of action for compensation to injured workmen upon grounds not arbitrary or fundamentally unjust, the question whether the award shall be measured as compensatory damages are measured at common law, or according to some prescribed scale reasonably adapted to produce a fair result, is for the state itself to determine. Whether the compensation should be paid in a single sum after judgment recovered as is required by the Arizona Employers' Liability Law just as under the common-law system in the case of a judgment based upon negligence, or whether it would be more prudent to distribute the award by installment payments covering the period of disability or of need, likewise is for the state to determine, and upon this the plaintiffs in error can raise no constitutional question.\n To the suggestion that the act now or hereafter may be extended by construction to nonhazardous occupations, it may be replied: First, that the occupations in which these actions arose were indisputably hazardous, hence plaintiffs in error have no standing to raise the question (Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 531, 544\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 359; Jeffrey Mfg. Co. v. Blagg, \n235 \nU.S. 571, 576\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 167; Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610, 621\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 140; Middleton v. Texas Power & Light Co., \n249 \nU.S. 152, 157\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 227): and, secondly, it hardly is necessary to add that employers in nonhazardous industries are in little danger from the act, since it imposes liability only for accidental injuries attributable to the inherent dangers of the occupation. \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 430]\n\u00a0\n To the objection that the benefits of the act may be extended, in the case of death claims, to those not nearly related to or dependent upon the workman, or even may go by escheat to the state, it is sufficient to say that no such question is involved in these records; in Arizona Copper Co. v. Burciaga, 177 Pac. 29, a case of personal injuries not fatal, the Supreme Court of Arizona interpreted the act as limiting the recovery to compensatory damages; it reasonably may be so construed in its application to death claims; and it would be improper for this court to assume in advance that the state court will place such a construction upon the statute as to render it obnoxious to the federal Constitution. Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n232 U.S. 531\n, 4 6, 34 Sup. Ct. 359; St. Louis S. W. Ry. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 369\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 99.\n It is insisted that the Arizona system deprives employers of property without due process of law and denies them equal protection because it confers upon the employe a free choice among several remedies. In Consolidated Arizona S. Co. v. Ujack, 15 Ariz. 382, 384, 139 Pac. 465, 466, the Supreme Court of the state said:\n'Under the laws of Arizona, an employe who is injured in the course of his employment has open to him three avenues of redress, any one of which he may pursue according to the facts of his case. They are: ( 1) The common-law liability relieved of the fellow servant defense and in which the defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of risk are questions to be left to the jury. Const.  4, 5, art. 18 . (2) Employers' Liability Law, which applies to hazardous occupations where the injury or death is not caused by his own negligence. Const.  7, art. 18. (3) The Compulsory Compensation Law, applicable to especially dangerous occupations, by which he may recover compensation without fault upon the part of the employer. Const.  art. 18.'\n\n It is said by counsel that the Compensation Act, because it limits the recovery, \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 431]\n\u00a0\n never is resorted to in practice unless the employe has been negligent, and hence is debarred of a remedy under the Liability Act. But it is thoroughly settled by our previous decisions that a state may abolish contributory negligence as a defense, and election of remedies is an option very frequently given by the law to a person entitled to an action; an option normally exercised to his own advantage, as a matter of course.\n Other points are suggested, but none requiring particular discussion.\n Judgments affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES concurring. \n The plaintiff (the defendant in error) was employed in the defendant's mine, was hurt in the eye in consequence of opening a compressed air valve and brought the present suit. The injury was found to have been due to risks inherent to the business and so was within the Employers' Liability Law of Arizona, Rev. Stats. 1913, Title 14, Ch. 6. By that law as construed the employer is liable to damages for injuries due to such risks in specified hazardous employments when guilty of no negligence. Par. 3158. There was a verdict for the plaintiff, judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State, 19 Ariz. 151, 166 Pac. 278, 1183; and the case comes here on the single question whether, consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment, such liability can be imposed. It is taken to exclude 'speculative, exemplary and punitive damages,' but to include all loss to the employe caused by the accident, not merely in the way of earning capacity, but of disfigurement and bodily or mental pain. See Arizona Copper Co. v. Burciaga, 177 Pac. 29, 33.\n The is some argument made for the general proposition\n This concurrence is in case No. 332, Inspiration Consol. Copper Co. v. Mendez. \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 432]\n\u00a0\n that immunity from liability when not in fault is a right inherent in free government and the obiter dicta of Mr. Justice Miller in [Citizen's Savings &] Loan Association v. Topeka, 20 Wall. 655, are referred to. But if it is thought to be public policy to put certain voluntary conduct at the peril of those pursuing it, whether in the interest of safety or upon economic or other grounds, I know of nothing to hinder. A man employs a servant at the peril of what that servant may do in the course of his employment and there is nothing in the Constitution to limit the principle to that instance. St. Louis & San Francisco Ry. Co. v. Mathews, \n165 \nU.S. 1, 22\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 243; Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Zernecke, \n183 \nU.S. 582, 586\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 229; St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Ry. Co. v. Taylor, \n210 \nU.S. 281, 295\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 616. See Guy v. Donald, \n203 \nU.S. 399, 406\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 6. There are cases in which even the criminal law requires a man to know facts at his peril. Indeed the criterion which is thought to be free from constitutional objection, the criterion of fault, is the application of an external standard, the conduct of a prudent man in the known circumstances, that is, in doubtful cases, the opinion of the jury, which the defendant has to satisfy at his peril and which he may miss after giving the matter his best thought. The Germanic, \n196 \nU.S. 589, 596\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 317; Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373, 377\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 780; Eastern States Retail Lumber Dealers' Association v. McBride, \n234 \nU.S. 600, 610\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 951, L. R. A. 1915A, 788; Miller v. Strahl, \n239 \nU.S. 426, 434\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 147. Without further amplification so much may be taken to be established by the decisions. New York Central R. R. Co. v. White, \n243 \nU.S. 188, 198\n, 204 S., 37 Sup. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 \nU.S. 219, 336\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642.\n I do not perceive how the validity of the law is affected by the fact that the employe is a party to the venture. There is no more certain way of securing attention to the safety of the men, an unquestionably constitutional object of legislation, than by holding the employer liable \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 433]\n\u00a0\n for accidents. Like the crimes to which I have referred they probably will happen a good deal less often when the employer knows that he must answer for them if they do. I pass, therefore, to the other objection urged and most strongly pressed. It is that the damages are governed by the rules governing in action of tort-that is, as we have said, that they may include disfigurement and bodily or mental pain. Natural observations are made on the tendency of juries when such elements are allowed. But if it is proper to allow them of course no objection can be founded on the supposed foibles of the tribunal that the Constitution of the United States and the States have established. Why, then, is it not proper to allow them? It is said that the pain cannot be shifted to another. Nither can the loss of a leg. But one can be paid for as well as the other. It is said that these elements do not constitute an economic loss, in the sense of diminished power to produce. They may. Ball v. William Hunt & Sons, Ld ., \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 1912]\n\u00a0\n A. C. 496. But whether they do or not they are as much part of the workman's loss as the loss of a limb. The legislature may have reasoned thus. If a business is unsuccessful it means that the public does not care enough for it to make it pay. If it is successful the public pays its expenses and something more. It is reasonable that the public should pay the whole cost of producing what it wants and a part of that cost is the pain and mutilation incident to production. By throwing that loss upon the employer in the first instance we throw it upon the public in the long run and that is just. If a legislature should reason in this way and act accordingly it seems to me that it is within Constitutional bounds. Matter of Erickson v. Preuss, 223 N. Y. 365, 119 N. E. 555. It is said that the liability is unlimited, but this is not true. It is limited to a conscientious valuation of the loss suffered. Apart from the control exercised by the judge it is to be hoped that juries would realize that unreasonable verdicts would tend to \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 434]\n\u00a0\n make the business impossible and thus to injure those whom they might wish to help. But whatever they may do we must accept the tribunal, as I have said, and are bound to assume that they will act rightly and confine themselves to the proper scope of the law.\n It is not urged that the provision allowing twelve per cent. interest on the amount of the judgment from the date of filing the suit, in case of an unsuccessful appeal, is void. Fidelity Mutual Life Association v. Mettler, \n185 U.S. 308\n, 325-327, 22 Sup Ct. 662; Consaul v. Cummings, \n222 \nU.S. 262, 272\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 83.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice CLARKE concur in this statement of additional reasons that lead me to agree with the opinion just delivered by my Brother PITNEY.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA dissenting.\n I find myself unable to concur, yet reluctant to dissent. The case is of the kind that, once pronounced, will be a rule in like or cognate cases forever-indeed, may even be extended. It is said to rest on the cases sustaining the Workmen's Compensation Law of New York, \n243 U.S. 203\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629, and its associated cases in the same volume upholding like laws of other states. The present case certainly comes after those cases and has that symptom of being their sequence. They cannot be said to have been easy of judgment against the contentions and conservatism which opposed them, and there was, at least to me, no prophecy of their extent, and therefore to me the present case is a step beyond them. I hope it is something more than timidity, dread of the new, that makes me fear that it is a step from the deck to the sea-the metaphor suggests a peril in the consequences.\n But let me in a more concrete way make application of this comment. I may assume that the purpose and principle and general extent of Workmen's Compensation Laws \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 435]\n\u00a0\n are known. I must rest on that assumption, for even an epitome of them or the reasons for them would unduly extend this dissent. The Arizona law has no resemblance to them. It is a direct charge of liability upon the employer for death or injury incurred in his employment, he being without fault. Its remedies are the ordinary legal remedies; its measure of relief, however, has in it something more than the ordinary measures of relief, certainly not those of the Compensation Laws, nor is it as considerate and guarded as they. If its validity, therefore, can be deduced from the cases explanatory of those laws, it can only be done by bringing its instances and theirs under the same generalization; that is, that it is competent for government to charge liability and exempt from responsibility according as one is employer or employe, there being no other circumstance than that relation. Of this there can be no disguise. It may be confused by argument and attempt at historical analogies and deductions, but to that comprehensive principle the case must come at last. All else is adventitious, and puts out of view the relation of the factors of production. It puts out of view that employers are as necessary to production as employes and subjects to peril the voluntary conduct of the former and leaves out of account as an element the voluntary conduct of the latter. In other words, there is a clear discrimination, a class distinction with its legal circumstances and, I may say, invidious circumstances, in view of some of the reasons adduced in its justification. And these effects cannot be concealed under any camouflage nor given the plausible and attractive gloss of public policy, justified by the different conditions of employer and employe. Unquestionably there is a difference-it constitutes the life of the relation. But the question is: Who shall compensate the injury that may result from the relation, voluntarily assumed by both, urged by their respective interests and a calculation of advantage? \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 436]\n\u00a0\n But I pass this discrimination and return to the law as a violation of the employer's rights considered absolutely and abstractly. It seems to me to be of the very foundation of right-of the essence of liberty as it is of morals-to be free from liability if one is free from fault. It has heretofore been the sense of the law and the sense of the world, pervading the regulations of both, that there can be no punishment where there is no blame; and yet the court now by its decision erects the denial of these postulates of conduct into a principle of law and governmental pl icy. In other words, it is said to be a benefit to government to put the exact discharge of duty under the menace of penalty and invert the conceptions of makind of the relation of right and wrong action. If the legislation does not punish without fault what does it do? The question is pertinent. Consider what the employer does: He invests his money in productive enterprise-mining, smelting, manufacturing, railroading-he engaged employes at their request and pays them the wages they demand; he takes all of the risks of the adventure. Now there is put upon him an immeasurable element that may make disaster inevitable. I find it difficult to answer the argument advanced to support or palliate this effect, or independently of it to justify the interference with rights. It is a certain impeachment of some rights to assume that they need justification, and a betrayal of them to make them a matter of controversy. There are precepts of constitutional law, as there are precepts of moral law, that reach the conviction of aphorisms and are immediately accepted by all who understand them, and comment is considered as confusing as unnecessary. I say this, not in dogmatism, but in expression of my vision of things, and I say it with deference to the contrary judgment of my Brethren of the majority.\n Of course, reasons may to found for the violation of rights, advantage to somebody or something in that violation. \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 437]\n\u00a0\n Tyranny even may find pretexts, and seldom boldly bids its will avouch its acts, and certainly there can be no accusation of barefaced power in the Arizona law. Its motives and purposes are worthy, and it requires some resolution of duty to resist them. It must be seen, and is seen, however, that the difference between the position of employer and employe, simply considering the latter as economically weaker, is not a justification for the violation of the rights of the former, and that individual rights cannot be made to yield to philanthropy, and therefore the welfare of the government is brought forward and displayed. The law saves the government, is the comment, from the burden of paupers, its administration and peace from the disturbance of criminals. The answer, I think, is immediate. Government, certainly constitutional government, cannot afford to infringe, indeed, betrays its purpose if it infringes, a right of anybody upon money considerations or for ease in the exercise of its faculties.\n But, granting there is something in the argument, what shall be the limits of its application? Will it extend the principle of the present case to nonhazardous employments? If not, why not? The Arizona law stops with certain occupations which it calls 'hazardous'; but it includes in the description 'manufacturing,' without qualifying words. In the New York Compensation Law passed on in New York Central Railroad v. White, \n243 U.S. 203\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629, there were 42 groups of hazardous occupations. In \n243 U.S. 219\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642, the court had quite a struggle with the provisions of the Washington Compensation Law, which was so far different from those of the other cases as to incur the dissent of members of the court. It is now, I think, of pertinent inquiry whether the quality of being hazardous is an inherent and necessary element of legality or a matter of legislative definition and policy. Besides, if there can be \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 438]\n\u00a0\n liability without fault in one occupation, and that can be a principle of legislation, why not in any other? Who is to determine the application, court or Legislature? If the latter, a court may not even express apprehension of its exercise, and yet it cannot put out of view the drift of events and in blind fatalism await their incidence when called upon to consider the legality of such exercise. We know things are in change-have changed-and a mark of it is that the drift of public opinion, and of legislation following opinion, is to alter the relation between empo yer and employe, and to give to the latter a particular distinction, relieve him from a responsibility which would seem to be, and which until lately it has been the sense of the world to be, as much upon him as upon his employer, not in dependence, not as a mark of subservience, but as an obligation of his freedom, and therefore, as a consequence, that where he has liberty of action he has responsibility for action. In a word, the drift of opinion and legislation now is to set labor apart and to withdraw it from its conditions, and from the action of economic forces and their consequences, give it immunity from the pitilessness of life. And there are appealing considerations for this drift of opinion and inevitable sympathy with it, as with many other conditions, but which the law cannot relieve by a sacrifice of constitutional rights. In what legislation the drift (it is persuasion in some) may culminate cannot now be predicted, but it is very certain that, whatever it be, the judgment now delivered will be cited to justify it. Will it not be said that, if one right of an employer can be made to give way, why not another?-made a condition 'upon economic or other grounds' of his enterprise. Indeed, may not the question be made more general, and if in supposed benefit to a particular class, and through benefit to them to the public, there may be constraint upon or the imposition of burden upon one right of a citizen, why not upon another? There is, therefore, I \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 439]\n\u00a0\n think, menace in the present judgment to all rights, subjecting them unreservedly to conceptions of public policy. If, however, this general apprehension be not justified, there is threat enough in the judgment of the court to the interest of employers generally as a result of the difference in conditions.\n A rather curious argument is used to support the Arizona law. It is said, in justification of its discrimination between employer and employe, that the employer may, in relief from it and rescue from its burdens, pass them to the consumers of his products, as he does or may do in the case of other expenses of his venture, and in the long run their incidence is, as it is said it should be, on the public, and that the Legislature in so considering was reasoning within constitutional bounds. There is attractive speciousness in the argument. The individual employer seems to be devested of grievance, and the problem the law presents to be one of economics and governmental policy-is a kind of taxation, an expense of government, the burden of which is properly laid upon the public, and over which a court can have but limited power.\n If it is intended by the argument to express no more than a tendency, while it has no relevancy, I think, upon the validity of the law, there may be no danger in it. If it is intended to be erected into a principle, there is danger in it. It is certainly facile and comprehensive. What burden can be put upon industry or the activities of men that may not be justified by it?\n Of course, there will be no production unless all of its costs be reimbursed by the price of the articles produced. And by costs, I mean as well the burdens of government as profit to the employer-his inducement to enterprise, and the wages of employes-their inducement to labor. Without such reimbursement there will be no production, and cannot be beyond a certain extent and for a certain time; and there is no way to effect it but through the consuming \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 440]\n\u00a0\n PUBLIC. BUT RECOURSE TO SUCH CONSUMPTION as a rescuE from the law is not a justification for the law, and it is very doubtful if it had any conscious influence in the enactment of the law.\n Indeed, in the present case what could have been its influence, and to what extent can it have an ameliorating effect? An employer in the indicated industries can have no relief except in the home market. If his products (where there are products) go beyond-go to other states-they will meet the competition of unburdened products. But this is obviou and needs no comment.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concur in this dissent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissenting.\n While I earnestly join in the dissent written by Mr. Justice McKENNA, it seems not inappropriate to state my own views somewhat more fully. The important and underlying question is common to the five cases. No. 232 is typical and to detail certain facts and circumstances disclosed by the record therein may aid the discussion.\n Basing his claim upon the Arizona Employers' Liability Law, Dan Veazey sued plaintiff in error in the United States District Court to recover damages for personal injuries received by him February 10, 1916, while engaged as millwright and carpenter in constructing a 'flotation system' at the company's mill or reduction works in Gila county, Ariz., 'wherein steam, electricity, or other mechanical power was then and there used to operate machinery.' He alleged that while exercising due care he 'suffered severe personal and bodily injuries by an accident arising out of and in course of such labor, service, and employment, and due to a condition or conditions of such occupation or employment,' which injuries were \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 441]\n\u00a0\n not caused by his negligence, but were sustained in the manner following:\n'Plaintiff in the due course of his said labor, service, and employment was standing upon a certain timber or joist incorporated in said 'flotation system,' engaged in bolting and fastening together the timbers thereof. That the said timber or joist upon which plaintiff was then and there standing was then and there elevated above the ground or floor of said mill or reduction works a distance of approximately 10 feet. That while so engaged as aforesaid, plaintiff slipped from said timber or joist and fell to the ground ... with great force and violence, ...' was permanently injured, and will forever remain sick, sore, lame, and crippled.\n\n No charge of negligence or failure to perform any duty was made against the company. It unsuccessfully set up and relied upon invalidity of the Employers' Liability Law because in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment; judgment went against it; and the cause is here by writ of error to the trial court. Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231)  237, 36 Stat. 1156 (Comp. St.  1214).\n Article 18 of the Arizona Constitution provides:\n'Section 4. The common-law doctrine of fellow servant, so far as it affects the liability of a master for injuries to his servant resulting from the acts or omissions of any other servant or servants of the common master, is forever abrogated.\n\n'Section 5. The defense of contributory negligence or of assumption of risk shall, in all cases whatsoever, be a question of fact and shall, at all times, be left to the jury.\n\n'Section 6. The right of action to recover damages for injuries shall never be abrogated, and the amount recovered shall not be subject to any statutory limitation.\n\n'Section 7. To protect the safety of employes in all hazardous occupations, in mining, smelting, manufacturing, railroad or street railway transportation, or any other industry the Legislature shall enact an Employers' Liability Law, by the terms of which any employer \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 442]\n\u00a0\n whether individual, association, or corporation shall be liable for the death or injury, caused by any accident due to a condition or conditions of such occupation, of any employe in the service of such employer in such hazardous occupation in all cases in which such death or injury of such employe shall not have been caused by the negligence of the employe killed or injured.\n\n'Section 8. The Legislature shall enact a Workmen's Compulsory Compensation Law applicable to workmen engaged in manual or mechanical labor in such employments as the Legislature may determine to be especially dangerous, by which compulsory compensation shall be required to be paid to any such workman by his employer, if in the course of such employment personal injury to any suchw orkman from any accident arising out of, and in the course of such employment is caused in whole, or in part, or is contributed to, by a necessary risk or danger of such employment, or a necessary risk or danger inherent in the nature thereof, or by failure of such employer, or any of his or its officers, agents, or employe, or employes, to exercise due care, or to comply with any law affecting such employment: Provided, that it shall be optional with said employe to settle for such compensation, or retain the right to sue said employer as provided by this Constitution.'\n\n Obeying the constitutional mandate, the Legislature enacted the 'Employers' Liability Law,' approved May 24, 1912 (chapter 89, Laws of Ariz. 1912, p. 491; Rev. Stat. Ariz. 1913,  3153-3162), which provides:\n That to protect the safety of workmen at manual or mechanical labor in many occupations declared hazardous and enumerated in section 4-among them all work in or about mines and in mills, shops, plants and factories where steam or electricity is used to operate machinery-every employer, whether individual, association, or corporation, 'shall be liable for the death or injury, caused by any \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 443]\n\u00a0\n accident due to a condition or conditions of such occupation, of any employe in the service of such employer in such hazardous occupation, in all cases in which such death or injury of such employe shall not have been caused by the negligence of the employe killed or injured.'\n'Sec. 6. When in the course of work in any of the employments or occupations enumerated in section 4 of this act, personal injury or death by any accident arising out of and in the course of such labor, service and employment, and due to a condition or conditions of such occupation or employment, is caused to or suffered by any workman engaged therein, in all cases in which such injury or death of such employe shall not have been caused by the negligence of the employe killed or injured, then the employer of such employe shall be liable in damages to the employe injured, or, in case death ensues, to the personal representative of the deceased for the benefit of the surviving widow or husband and children of such employe, and, if none, then to such employe's parents; and, if none, then to the next of kin dependent upon such employe, and if none, then to his personal representative, for the benefit of the estate of the deceased.'\n\n Section 7 requires that questions of contributory negligence and assumption of risk shall be left to the jury. (The full text of the act is in the margin.1) \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 444]\n\u00a0\n Likewise, the Legislature enacted a Compulsory Compensation Law, approved June 8, 1912, applicable to work \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 445]\n\u00a0\n men in the same occupations as those declared hazardous by the Employers' Liability Law (Chapter 14, Laws of Ariz. \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 446]\n\u00a0\n Spec. Sess. 1912, p. 23). Material portions of it are in the margin. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[250 U.S. 400, 447]\n\u00a0\n In Consolidated Arizona S. Co. v. Ujack (1914) 15 Ariz. 382, 384, 139 Pac. 465, 466, the Supreme Court declared:\n'Under the laws of Arizona, an employe who is injured in the course of his employment has open to him three avenues of redress, any one of which he may pursue according to the facts of his case. They are: ( 1) The common-law liability relieved of the fellow servant defense and in which the defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of risk are questions to be left to the jury. Const.  4, 5, art. 18 . (2) Employers' Liability Law, which applies to hazardous occupations where the injury or death is not caused by his own negligence. Const.  7, art. 18. (3) The Compulsory Compensation Law, applicable to especially dangerous occupations, by which he may recover compensation without fault upon the part of the employer. Const.  8, art. 18.'\n\n In Inspiration Consolidated Copper Co. v. Mendez (July 2, 1917) 19 Ariz. 151, 157, 166 Pac. 278, 279, 281, 283, the Supreme Court specifically held that the Employers' Liability Law does not conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment, and among other things said:\n'That the liability statute must \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 448]\n\u00a0\n be construed as one creating a liability for accidents resulting in injuries to the workmen engaged in hazardous occupations due to the risks and hazards inherent in such occupations, without regard to the negligence of the employer, as such negligence is understood in the common law of liability; in other words, such statute creates a liability for accident arising from the risks and hazards inherent in the occupation without regard to the negligence or fault of the employer. ... In other words, this statute creates a liability of the master to damages suffered from any accident befalling his servant while engaged in the performance of duties in dangerous occupations without requiring the negligence of the master to be shown as an element of the right to recover; and it likewise takes away from the master his common-law right of defense of assumption of ordinary risk by the servant, and leaves to the master the right to defend upon the grounds that the servant assumed the ordinary risks, other than risks inherent in the occupation.'\n\n (This opinion was reaffirmed in Superior & Pittsburg Copper Co. v. Tomich [July 2, 1917] 19 Ariz. 182, 165 Pac. 1101, 1185.)\n In Arizona Copper Co. v. Burciaga (1918) 177 Pac. 29, 31, 32, 33, the Supreme Court said:\n'As clearly intimated by this court in Inspiration Consolidated Copper Co. v. Mendez, 19 Ariz. 151, 166 Pac. 278, 1183, the Employers' Liability Law is designed to give a right of action to the employe injured by accident occurring from risks and hazards inherent in the occupation and without regard to the negligence on the part of the employer. Such is the clear import of the said Employers' Liability Law. ...\n\n'The liability incurred by the employer from a personal injury sustained by his employe from an accident arising out of and in the course of labor, service, and employment in hazardous occupations specified in the statute, and due to a condition or conditions of such occupation \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 449]\n\u00a0\n or employment, if such shall not have been caused from the negligence of such employe, is such an amount as will compensate such employee for the injuries sustained by him directly attributable to such accident. ... 'Liable in damages,' as used in paragraph 3158, c. 6, of title 14, Employers' Liability Law, Rev. Stat. of Ariz. 1913, has reference to and means that the employer becomes obligated to pay to the employe injured in an accident while engaged in an occupation declared hazardous, occurring without fault of the employer, all loss to the employe which is actually caused by the accident and the amount of which is susceptible of ascertainment. ... Of course, mental and physical suffering experienced by the employe injured, proi mately resulting from the accident, the reasonable value of working time lost by the employe, necessary expenditures for the treatment of injuries and compensation for the employe's diminished earning power directly resulting from the injury, and perhaps other results causing direct loss, are matters of actual loss and as such recoverable.'\n\n From the foregoing it appears that we have for consideration a statute which undertakes, in the absence of fault, to impose upon all employers (individual and corporate) engaged in enterprises essential to the public welfare, not subject to prohibition by the state and often not attended by any extraordinary hazard, an unlimited liability to employees for damages resulting from accidental injuries-including physical and mental pain-which may be recovered by the injured party or his administrator for benefit of widow, children, parents, next of dependent kin or the estate. The individual who hires only one man and works by his side is put on the same footing as a corporation which employs thousands; no attention is given to probable ability to pay the award; length of service is unimportant-a minute seems enough; wages contracted for bear no necessary relationship to what may be recovered; \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 450]\n\u00a0\n and a single accident which he was powerless to prevent or provide against may pauperize the employer. And by reason of existing constitutional and statutory provisions an injured workman may claim under this act or under the Compensation Law or according to the common law materially modified in his favor by exclusion of the fellow-servant rule and otherwise. On the other hand, while the employer is declared subject to new, uncertain and greatly enlarged liability, notwithstanding the utmost care, nothing has been granted him in return.\n In such circumstances, would enforcement of the challenged statute deprive employers of rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment? Plainly, I think, nothing short of an affirmative answer is compatible with welldefined constitutional guaranties.\n Of course, the Fourteenth Amendment was never intended to render immutable any particular rule of law, nor did it by fixation immortalize prevailing doctrines concerning legal rights and liabilities. Orderly and rational progress was not forestalled. Holden v. Hardy, \n169 \nU.S. 366, 387\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 383. But it did strip the states of all power to deprive any person of life, liberty or property by arbitrary or oppressive action-such action is never due process of law.\n In the last analysis it is for us to determine what is arbitrary or oppressive upon consideration of the natural and inherent principles of practical justice which lie at the base of our traditional jurisprudence and inspirit our Constitution. A legislative declaration of reasonableness is not conclusive; no more so is popular approval-otherwise constitutional inhibitions would be futile. And plainly, I think, the individual's fundamental rights are not proper subjects for experimentation; they ought not to be sacrificed to questionable theorization.\n Unitil now I had supposed that a man's liberty and property-with their essential incidents-were under the \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 451]\n\u00a0\n protection of our charter and not subordinate to whims or caprices or fanciful ideas of those who happen for the day to constitute the legislative majority. The contrary doctrine is revolutionary and leads straight towards destruction of our well-tried and successful system of government. Perhaps another system may be better-I do not happen to think so-but it is the duty of the courts to uphold the old one unless and until superseded through orderly methods.\n After great consideration in Adair v. United States, \n208 U.S. 161\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 277, 13 Ann. Cas. 764, and Coppage v. Kansas, \n236 U.S. 1\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 240 L. R. A. 1915C, 960, this court declared that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees to both employer and employe the liberty of entering into contracts for servie subject only to reasonable restrictions. 'The principle is fundamental and vital.'\n In the first case an act of Congress prohibiting interstate carriers from requiring one seeking employment, as a condition of such employment, to enter into an agreement not to become or remain a member of a labor organization, was declared in conflict with the Fifth Amendment. In Coppage v. Kansas a state statute which declared it unlawful to require one to agree not to be a member of a labor association as a condition of securing employment was held invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment, and we said:\n'An interference with this liberty so serious as that now under consideration, and so disturbing of equality of right, must be deemed to be arbitrary, unless it be supportable as a reasonable exercise of the police power of the state.'\n\n In Truax v. Raich, \n239 \nU.S. 33, 41\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 7, 10 (60 L. Ed. 131, L. R. A. 1916D, 545, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 283) an Arizona statute prohibiting employment of aliens except under certain conditions was struck down. We there said:\n'It requires no argument to show that the right to work for a living in the common occupations of the community is of the very essence of the personal freedom and opportunity that it was the purpose of the [ Fourteenth] Amendment to secure.'\n\n The right to employ and the right to labor are correl- \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 452]\n\u00a0\n ative-neither can be destroyed nor unduly hindered without impairing the other. The restrictions imposed by the act of Congress, struck down in the Adair Case, by the Kansas statute, declared invalid in the Coppage Case, and by the Arizona statute, held inoperative in the Truax Case, viewed as practical matters seem rather trivial in comparison with the burden laid on employers by the statute before us. And the grounds suggested to support it really amount in substance to asserting that the Legislature has power to protect society against the consequences of accidental injuries, and therefore it may impose the loss resulting therefrom upon those wholly without fault who have afforded others welcomed opportunities to earn an honest living under unobjectionable conditions. As a measure to stifle enterprise, produce discontent, strife, idleness, and pauperism, the outlook for the enactment seems much too good.\n In New York Central R. R. Co. v. White, \n243 U.S. 188\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629, and Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 U.S. 219\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642, as I had supposed for reasons definitely pointed out, we held the challenged statutes not in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment although they imposed liability without fault and introduced a plan for compensating workmen, unknown to the common law. The elements of those statutes regarded as adequate to save their validity we specified; if such characteristics had not been found, the result, necessarily, would have been otherwise, unless we were merely indulging in harmful chatter.\n Here, without fault, the statute in question imposes liability in some aspects more onerous than either the New York or Washington law prescribed; and the grounds upon which we sustained those statutes are wholly lacking. The employer is not exempted from any liability formerly imposed; he is given no quid pro quo for his new burdens; the common-law rules have been set aside without a reasonably just substitute; the employe is relieved from \n\n[250 U.S. 400, 453]\n\u00a0\n consequences of ordinary risks of the occupation and these are imposed upon the employer without defined limit to possible recovery which may ultimately go to nondependents, distant relatives, or, by escheat, to the state; 'the act bears no fair indication of a just settlement of a difficult problem affecting one of the most important of social relations'- on the contrary, it will probably intensify the difficulties.\n The liability is not restricted to the pecuniary loss of a disabled employe or those entitled to look to him for support, but includes compensation for h ysical and mental pain and suffering; a recovery resulting in bankruptcy to an employer may benefit only a distant relative, financially independent; the prescribed responsibility is not 'to contribute reasonable amounts according to a reasonable and definite scale by way of compensation for the loss of earning power arising from accidental injuries,' but is unlimited, unavoidable by any care, incapable of fairly definite estimation in advance, and enforceable by litigation probably acrimonious, long drawn out, and expensive. While the statute is inattentive to the employe's fault, it permits recovery in excess of the employe's pecuniary misfortune, and provides for compensation, not general, but sporadic, uncertain, conjectural, delayed, indefinite as to amount, and not distributed over such long period as to afford actual protection against loss or lessened earning capacity with insurance to society against pauperism, etc.\n I am unable to see any rational basis for saying that the act is a proper exercise of the state's police power. It is unreasonable and oppressive upon both employer and employe; to permit its enforcement will impair fundamental rights solemnly guaranteed by our Constitution, and heretofore, as I think, respected and enforced.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice McKENNA and Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Laws of Arizona 1912, c. 89, p. 491; Rev.

McConnell, both of Little Rock, Ark ., for appellees 92 and 93 and appellants in 94 and 95.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These four cases were consolidated for the purposes of the hearing in the District Court, and have been treated as consolidated for the purposes of the hearing on appeal. They are so closely related that they may be dealt with in a single opinion. \n\n[249 U.S. 134, 137]\n\u00a0\n On July 18, 1908, the two railway companies concerned-the St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern, which for brevity may be called the Iron Mountain, and the St. Louis Southwestern, which may be called the Southwestern-brought separate suits in equity in the Circuit Court (now the District Court) of the United States for the Eastern District of Arkansas against the members of the state Railroad Commission in their official capacity, and against two citizens of that state named as frequent shippers of freight upon the railroad lines, for injunctions to restrain the enforcement of certain intrastate freight and passenger rates; setting up that the commission was duly organized under an act of the Legislature, and was thereby authorized to fix rates to be charged by the railroads in the state of Arkansas for the transportation of freight and passengers in that state; that the commission had officially adopted a tariff of freight rates applying to all classes and commodities of freight on all railroads operated in the state, and had ordered it to take effect on June 15, 1908; that the rates were unreasonable, unjust, discriminatory, confiscatory, and void; that they did not yield and adequate return for the services rendered; and that the operation of said tariff would deprive complainants of their property without due process of law and deny to them the equal protection of the laws, in violation of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. It was further alleged that the rates for the transportation of passengers in the state fixed by an act of the Legislature passed February 9, 1907, and promulgated by order of the railroad commissioners, were confiscatory and void in their effect upon the complainant railways and, therefore, violative of the Fourteenth Amendment; but the passenger rates are not involved in the present appeals, and need not be further mentioned.\n The jurisdiction of the federal court depended solely \n\n[249 U.S. 134, 138]\n\u00a0\n upon the ground that the cases arose under the Constitution of the United States, and that the matter in controversy in each case exceeded the jurisdictional amount.\n Temporary injunctions were issued in September, 1908, and continued in force during the pendency of the suits. The Circuit Court upon granting them ordered in each case that the complainant should execute a bond in the penal sum of $200,000, conditioned that complainant should keep a correct account respecting its carriage of passengers and freight, showing the difference between the tariff actually charged and that which would have been charged had the rate inhibited been applied, also showing the particulars of the carriage, and the names of the persons affected as far as practicable, the record to be kept subject to the further order of the court, and further conditioned that if it should eventually be decided that so much of the order as inhibited the enforcement of the rates ought not to have been made, the complainant should within a reasonable time to be fixed by the court refund in every instance to the party entitled the excess in charge over what would have been charged had the inhibited rates been applied, together with lawful interest and damages. Complainants entered into such bonds with sureties. Later an additional injunction bond was required to be and was furnished by each complainant, but without sureties, conditioned substantially as above.\n Full answers having been filed by the Railroad Commission, and testimony having been taken, the cases were brought on to final hearing, and on May 11, 1911, final decrees were made, the same in both cases. They enjoined the commissioners and their successors, the individual shippers named as defendants, and all other patrons of the road in the shipment of freight between stations in the state of Arkansas, from enforcing or attempting to enforce any of the provisions of the freight tariff in question. In addition to this, and after disposing \n\n[249 U.S. 134, 139]\n\u00a0\n of the question of costs, each decree ordered that the bond for injunction be released and the sureties thereon discharged from liability, and concluded as follows:\n'And the court reserves and retains unto itself jurisdiction of the subject-matter of this suit and of all parties hereto, to the end that such other and further orders and decrees may be made herein as may become necessary by reason of any changed conditions as to the facts, equities or rights that may hereafter take place or arise.'\n\n The railroad commissioners appealed to this court (the defendant shippers having been severed), the cases were heard together, and the decrees of the Circuit Court were reversed June 16, 1913, with directions to dismiss the bills without prejudice. Allen v. St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Ry., \n230 U.S. 553\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 1030. The causes were remanded to the District Court, the mandate in each case reciting the reversal and the order remanding the cause with directions to dismiss the bill without prejudice, and concluding as follows:\n'You, therefore, are hereby commanded that such execution and further proceedings be had in said cause, in conformity with the opinion and decree of this court, as according to right and justice, and the laws of the United States, ought to be had, the said appeal notwithstanding.'\n\n Upon the going down of the mandates the District Court on July 18, 1913, entered decrees in obedience thereto dismissing the bills without prejudice and dissolving the injunctions; and at the same time and as a part of the same decrees made a reference under a rule of the court to a special master for the purpose of determining the damages alleged to have been sustained by the railroad commissioners by reason of the granting of the temporary and permanent injunctions, declaring:\n'That in determining these damages, for the recovery of which the said commissioners are not acting for themselves but for the benefit of all persons, shippers, consignees and passengers, who \n\n[249 U.S. 134, 140]\n\u00a0\n have sustained any damages by reason of the granting of said injunctions,' the master was authorized to examine witnesses and to give notice by publication that all persons having claims against the complainants by reason of the granting of the injunctions should present them within a time specified for the purpose.\n\n Under this reference the appellants in cases Nos. 92 and 93 and the appellees in Nos. 94 and 95 intervened and presented claims for a refund of the difference paid by them in freight rates between the rates prescribed by the commission and those put in force by the railway companies. The master reported favorably upon these claims, dividing the amounts allowed into three periods, the first and second of which included the time elapsed between September 3, 1908, when the interlocutory injunctions were issued, and May 11, 1911, the date of the final decrees, and the third period included the time elapsed between the latter date and July 18, 1913, the date of the decrees entered upon the mandates. The railway companies filed exceptions to the master's report, which were sustained by the District Court as to the claims involved in cases Nos. 92 and 93 and overruled as to those involved in Nos. 94 and 95, and a combined decree was made accordingly.\n The parties aggrieved desiring to appeal, and being in doubt whether the appeal lay to this court or to the Circuit Court of Appeals, prayed for and were allowed appeals to both courts. Hence the first question that confronts us is whether the decree is the subject of a direct appeal to this court.\n We are clear this question must be answered in the affirmative. The appeals from the final decrees in the main causes were brought direct to this court, because of the constitutional question, under section 5 of the Circuit Court of Appeals Act of March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. 827, c. 517), which provided for such an appeal in the following \n\n[249 U.S. 134, 141]\n\u00a0\n cases, among others:\n'In any case that involves the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States. ... In any case in which the Constitution or law of a state is claimed to be in contravention of the Constitution of the United States.'\n\n This section, of course, was the predecessor of section 238, Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1157 [Comp. St.  1215]), under which the present appeals were taken. And it is plain that the orders of the Railroad Commission were state laws within the meaning of this provision. Williams v. Bruffy, \n96 U.S. 176\n, 183; Atlantic Coast Line v. Goldsboro, \n232 \nU.S. 548, 555\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 364.\n The provisions of the Judicial Code which regulate the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Appeals originated in section 6 of the act of 1891. They must be construed together with those provisions of law that confer upon the District Court (section 24, Judicial Code [Comp. St.  991]), and formerly conferred upon the Circuit Court, original jurisdiction in suits of a civil nature arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, and in suits between citizens of different states. By section 128 of the Code (Comp. St.  1120), the Circuit Courts of Appeals are to exercise appellate jurisdiction over the final decisions of the District Courts 'in all cases other than those in which appeals and writs of error may be taken direct to the Supreme Court, as provided in section 238, unless otherwise provided by law; and, except as provided in sections 239 and 240, the judgments and decrees of the Circuit Courts of Appeals shall be final in all cases in which the jurisdiction is dependent entirely' upon diversity of citizenship. Section 239 (Comp. St.  1216) provides for the certification of questions by the Circuit Court of Appeals to this court; section 240 (section 1217) permits this court to review by certiorari any case in which the judgment or decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is made final; and, by section 241 (section 1218), in any case in which the judgment or decree of that court is not made final, there may be an appeal or writ of error \n\n[249 U.S. 134, 142]\n\u00a0\n to this court where the matter in controversy exceeds $1,000 besides costs.\n The present appeals relate to a decree made in a subordinate action ancillary to the main causes, in which, as has been stated, the federal jurisdiction was invoked solely upon the ground that the cases arose under the Constitution of the United States. It has been held repeatedly that jurisdiction of subordinate actions is to be attributed to the jurisdiction upon which the main suit rested, and hence that where jurisdiction of the main cause is predicated solely on diversity of citizenship and the decree therein is for this reason made final in the Circuit Court of Appeals, the judgments and decrees in the ancillary litigation also are final. Rouse v. Letcher, \n156 U.S. 47\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 266; Gregory v. Van Ee, \n160 U.S. 643\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 431; Rouse v. Hornsby, \n161 U.S. 588\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 610; Pope v. Louisville, etc., Ry., \n173 \nU.S. 573, 577\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 500.\n The proceeding out of which the decree now in question arose was not merely ancillary, but was in effect a part of the main causes, taken for the purpose of carrying into effect the decrees of this court, reversing the final decrees in the main causes, and, at the same time, for the purpose of giving effect to a reservation of jurisdiction by the court below as contained in those final decrees. The supplementary decree that is now before us, since it simply brings to a conclusion those former suits pursuant to our decrees therein, must be treated as involving the construction and application of the Constitution of the United States and as being made in a case in which a state law was claimed to be in contravention of the federal Constitution, within the meaning of section 238, Judicial Code.\n Therefore the motions to dismiss must be denied.\n Upon the merits, it will be convenient to take up first the case of the Southern Cotton Oil Company, appellee in Nos. 94 and 95, in whose favor claims were allowed by \n\n[249 U.S. 134, 143]\n\u00a0\n the master as against each of the two railways and for each of the periods referred to. The railways excepted upon two grounds: (1) Because the final decrees of May 11, 1911, discharging the injunction bonds, and releasing the makers thereof from liability had the effect to relieve the railways and their sureties from all liability by reason of the granting of the injunctions; and (2) as to such claims for overcharges as accrued subsequent to the date of the final decrees, on the ground that upon the rendition of those decrees the injunction bonds ceased to be operative and created no further liability, and that the railways incurred no liability to the claimants under the final decrees. The District Court overruled the exceptions and sustained the claims of the Oil Company as against the railway companies and the sureties with interest at 6 per cent. per annum from the respective dates that the overcharges were made.\n We deal first with so much of the overcharges as accrued prior to the final decrees. In St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Ry. Co. v. McKnight, \n244 \nU.S. 368, 373\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 611, doubt was expressed whether, in view of the form of the mandate, there was any power in the District Court to determine the liability of the railway companies upon the bonds. But at that time our attention was not called to the fact that the mandates contained a provision authorizing further proceedings-a provision that removes all question of the power of the District Court. In re Louisville, \n231 \nU.S. 639, 645\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 255; Louisville v. Cumberland Tel. Co., \n231 U.S. 652\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 260.\n In support of the contention that the final decrees had the effect of discharging the complainants and their sureties from liability upon the bonds by reason of previous overcharges, it is pointed out that this part of the decrees was not appealed from, nor was error assigned to the court's action in vacating the bonds and releasing the sureties. Whether, under the circumstances, the \n\n[249 U.S. 134, 144]\n\u00a0\n action of this court in reversing the decrees in respect of their main provisions granting permanent injunctions had the effect of reversing also that portion which discharged the liability upon the injunction bonds is a question upon which we need not pass. For, irrespective of this, those clauses of the final decrees by which the District Court retained jurisdiction for the purpose of making such further orders and decrees as might become necessary, coupled with the subsequent mandates of this court permitting further proceedings to be taken in conformity with our opinion and decrees and according to right and justice, empowered the District Court to set aside so much of its final decrees as released the railways and their sureties from liabilities theretofore incurred under the injunction bonds. This is what the District Court in effect did when it ordered the reference and sustained the claims of the Oil Company so far as they accrued prior to the final decrees.\n It is argued that the condition of the bonds-that if it should eventually be decided that the order inhibiting the enforcement of the commission rates should not have been made the complainant should refund, etc.-never was broken because it was not at any time adjudged that the allowance of the temporary injunctions was improper. But this is to construe the bonds according to the letter and not according to the substance. The state statute and the orders of the Railroad Commission entitled shippers to the benefit of the rates thereby established; and they were thus entitled at all times except as it became necessary to stay the operation of the rates by equitable process in order to permit of a judicial investigation into the question of their adequacy. The burden of proof to show them inadequate was upon the railway companies; and when they failed to sustain this burden they at the same time showed that the injunctions ought not to have been allowed.\n\n\n[249 U.S. 134, 145]\n\u00a0\n As to that portion of the claims which accrued after the final decrees, this, as we already have held in the McKnight Case, \n244 \nU.S. 368, 374\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 611, was not recoverable upon the injunction bonds, nor against the sureties therein. On a fair construction of the conditions of those instruments, their obligation expired by limitation when the suits were brought to a final conclusion. Hence, to the extent that the supplemental decree now under review awards a recovery against the sureties for claims accruing after the final decrees, it must be modified.\n But, in our opinion, this portion of the claims is allowable against the railway companies themselves upon the principle, long established and of general application, that a party against whom an erroneous judgment or decree has been carried into effect is entitled, in the event of a reversal, to be restored by his adversary to that which he has lost thereby. This right, so well founded in equity, has been recognized in the practice of the courts of common law from an early period. Where plaintiff had judgment and execution, and defendant afterwards sued out a writ of error, it was regularly a part of a judgment of reversal that the plaintiff in error 'be restored to all things which he hath lost by occasion of the said judgment'; and thereupon, in a plain case, a writ of restitution issued at once, but if a question of fact was in doubt, a writ of scire facias was first issued. Anonymous, Salk. 588, citing Goodyere v. Ince, Cro. Jac. 246; Sympson v. Juxon, Cro. Jac. 699; Vesey v. Harris, Cro. Car. 328. See, also, Lil. Ent. 641, 650; Arch. Append. 195, 200. The doctrine has been mostly fully recognized in the decisions of this court. Bank of the United States v. Bank of Washington, 6 Pet. 8, 17; Erwin v. Lowry, 7 How. 172, 184; Northwestern Fuel Co. v. Brock, \n139 U.S. 216\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 523.\n That a course of action so clearly consistent with the principles of equity is one proper to be adopted in an equitable proceeding goes without saying. It is one of the \n\n[249 U.S. 134, 146]\n\u00a0\n equitable powers, inherent in every court of justice so long as it retains control of the subject-matter and of the parties, to correct that which has been wrongfully done by virtue of its process. Northwestern Fuel Co. v. Brock, \n139 \nU.S. 216, 219\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 523; Johnston v. Bowers, 69 N. J. Law, 544, 547, 55 Atl. 230.\n It is argued that the claimant is not in a position to invoke the principle of restitution in this proceeding because it was not a party to the original proceedings, but came in by intervening before the master. This point is unsubstantial. The Railroad Commission, in defending the rate schedules against the attack of the railway companies, represented all shippers; the permanent injunctions that were awarded by the final decrees restrained all shippers from taking advantage of the commission rates; and during the time that those decrees remained unreversed the railway companies obtained the benefit of the injunction by exacting from this claimant, among others, in addition to the commission rates, those excess charges that form the basis of the present claims. It is a typical case for the application of the principle of restitution; and the District Court properly held the commission to be the representative of the shippers for this purpose.\n The suggestion that the order of reference was made under a rule of court that related only to damages recoverable on injunction bonds, and furnished no foundation for a decree against the railways on the theory of restitution, is without weight. The companies were fully heard upon the merits, and there is no question about the facts.\n In behalf of the railways, it is argued that the reversal of the decrees of May 11, 1911, 'without prejudice,' left the rights of the parties still in doubt, and thus rendered it improper for the District Court to award damages against the railways, either on the basis of a breach of the injunction bonds or on the basis of restitution. \n\n[249 U.S. 134, 147]\n\u00a0\n But it seems to us that the rights of the present shippers were so clear as to make an allowance of damages upon the injunction bonds and restitution upon the reversal of the decrees manifestly their due. That the reversal was 'without prejudice' did not deprive the decrees of conclusiveness as to past transactions, but only prevented them from being a bar to future suits for injunction upon a showing of changed conditions. Missouri v. C., B. & Q. R. R., \n241 U.S. 533\n, 539. 36 Sup. Ct. 715\n\n\n The contention that there was error in allowing interest upon the amount of the overcharges is unsubstantial. The damage was complete when the overcharges were made, and as they were wrongfully made and without consent of the shippers, interest ran from that date on general principles.\n For these reasons, the decree in favor of the Southern Cotton Oil Company, modified so as to relieve the sureties from that part of the claims which accrued after the final decrees of May 11, 1911, will be affirmed.\n The claims of both the Arkadelphia Milling Company (No. 92) and Hasty & Sons (No. 93) were based upon the difference between rates charged on rough lumber from the forest to milling points and the rates provided in the commission tariff on such movements. The tariff contained certain maximum rates on lumber of this character applicable generally, and in addition certain 'rough material rates' much lower than the others, conditioned upon a certain percentage of the manufactured product being shipped over the same line that brought in the rough material. The railway companies excepted to the allowance in favor of each of these appellants upon the ground that the 'rough material rates' were discriminatory against shippers who did not reship the specified percentages of the finished product. As to the Hasty claim, there was an additional exception based upon the \n\n[249 U.S. 134, 148]\n\u00a0\n ground that the movement of rough material to milling points in the state and the subsequent forwarding of the finished product to market points outside of the state constituted interstate commerce, so that the rough material rates prescribed by the state commission were not applicable. The court sustained the exceptions on both grounds.\n To take up first the question of discrimination: The tariff gave the benefit of the rough material rates only where the shipper transported over the line of the carrier a certain percentage of the product manufactured from the rough material. The master found that the condition was complied with by these shippers and sustained the allowances accordingly.\n The District Court sustained the defense of discrimination upon the authority of Lake Shore, etc., Ry. Co. v. Smith, \n173 U.S. 684\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 565, and Cotting v. Kansas City Stockyards Co., \n183 U.S. 79\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 30.\n We assume, without deciding, that, notwithstanding the general result adverse to the railway companies in the main suits, they were still at liberty to dispute the validity of the rate schedule as it related to particular shippers. See Chicago, etc., Co. v. Minnesota, \n134 \nU.S. 418, 460\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 462, 702, concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Miller; St. Louis & San Francisco Ry. v. Gill, \n156 \nU.S. 649, 659\n, 666 S., 15 Sup. Ct. 484; Ex parte Young, \n209 U.S. 123\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 441, 13 L. R. A. (N. S.) 932, 14 Ann. Cas. 764; Missouri v. C., B. & Q. R. R., \n241 \nU.S. 533, 538\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 715.\n In our opinion, however, the District Court erred in its ruling. The rough material rates were but parts of a general schedule that covered a wide field. This schedule was established in the exercise of the legislative authority of the state, and could not be set aside by the court on the ground of discrimination unless it amounted to a denial of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\n[249 U.S. 134, 149]\n\u00a0\n But there is nothing to show that the rough material rates wrought any discrimination against the railway companies. They were applicable upon all railways alike. If there was-not in the least intimating that there was-undue discrimination as against small shippers or those who had no occasion to obtain transportation for the manufactured product over the line of the same carrier, this was not a matter of which the railways could complain. It is most thoroughly established that before one may be heard to strike down state legislation upon the ground of its repugnancy to the federal Constitution he must bring himself within the class affected by the unconstitutional feature. Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 531, 544\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 359; Jeffrey Mfg. Co. v. Blagg, \n235 \nU.S. 571, 576\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 167; Mallinckrodt Works v. State of Missouri ex rel. Jones, \n238 \nU.S. 41, 54\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 671; Cusack Co. v. City of Chicago, \n242 \nU.S. 526, 530\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 190, L. R. A. 1918A, 136, Ann. Cas. 1917C, 594.\n Lake Shore, etc., Ry. Co. v. Smith, \n173 U.S. 684\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 565, did not set aside this established principle. The discrimination in favor of certain patrons, there referred to, was laid hold of rather as showing the unreasonable character of the regulation. The authority of that case is not to be extended. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Kentucky, \n183 \nU.S. 503, 511\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 95; Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Towers, \n245 U.S. 6\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 2, L. R. A. 1918C, 475.\n Cotting v. Kansas City Stockyards Co., \n183 U.S. 79\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 30, is not at all in point. While the opinion of Mr. Justice Brewer covers a wide range of discussion, a majority of the court (\n183 U.S. 114\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 30) placed the decision upon the ground that the statute of Kansas applied only to a single company, and not to others engaged in like business in the state, and thereby denied to that company the equal protection of the laws.\n There remains the question whether the shipments by J. F. Hasty & Sons of rough material from the forest to the milling point, followed by the forwarding of the finished product to points outside of the state, constituted inter \n\n[249 U.S. 134, 150]\n\u00a0\n state commerce. If they did, it is obvious that the state tariff was not applicable to them.\n The following statement, taken from the record, shows the admitted facts as to the course of business:\n'When the rough material reached the mills, it was manufactured into finished staves, headings and hoops, and in this condition shipped to whoever purchased them. The purchaser uses them in making barrels, casks, etc. The wastings in the finishing of said articles from the rough material were eigher disposed of for firewood, or destroyed. When the rough material left the woods, a bill of lading was issued from the woods to the mill. When the rough material reached the mill, it was finished into some or all of the articles described, when it was stacked in the yards or placed in kilns to dry. The process of manufacturing and drying occupied several months, or on an average this process would be gone through with, the finished products sold and shipped to the purchaser, in about five months from the date the rough material was received at the mill. The claimants classified the different parts after they came from the mill completely finished, and made sales from such stock. The markets for the manufactured articles were almost altogether in other states than Arkansas, or in foreign countries, and about 95 per cent. of the sale of finished articles, that is, of the total outbound shipments, were made for delivery at points outside the state of Arkansas, the remaining 5 per cent. being sold and delivered, or shipped to points within the state of Arkansas. At the time the rough material was shipped to the mills, the mills did not know to whom they would sell the finished product, or to what points it would be shipped, but did know that there was little market for the finished articles in the state of Arkansas, and expected that they would sell 95 per cent. of said finished articles and ship them to points outside the state of Arkansas. \n\n[249 U.S. 134, 151]\n\u00a0\n\n\n'It was the intention of all the claimants herein, at the time they shipped the rough material into the milling points, to mill said rough material with the object of selling the said finished product and shipping it out as soon as practicable, and all of them knew and intended at the time they brought the rough material into the mill, on account of previous course of dealings in the business, that 95 per cent. of the finished product would be by them shipped to points outside the state of Arkansas.\n\n'The claimants paid the usual property tax to the state of Arkansas on their stock of materials on hand at the milling point, whether said stock was in the rough or finished, the amount of the tax being arrived at according to the methods in use in the state of Arkansas by the use of an average basis.'\n\n Upon the facts as stated, it is our opinion that the District Court erred in treating the movement of the rough lumber from the woods to the milling point as interstate commerce. It is not merely that there was no continuous movement from the forest to the points without the state, but that when the rough material left the woods it was not intended that it should be transported out of the state, or elsewhere beyond the mill, until it had been subjected to a manufacturing process that materially changed its character, utility, and value. The raw material came to rest at the mill, and after the product was manufactured it remained stored there for an indefinite period-manufacture and storage occupying five months on the average-for the purpose of finding a market. Where it would eventually be sold no one knew. And the fact that previous experience indicated that 95 per cent. of it must be marketed outside of the state so that this entered into the purpose of the parties when shipping the rough material to the mill, did not alter the character of the latter movement. The question is too well settled by \n\n[249 U.S. 134, 152]\n\u00a0\n previous decisions to require discussion. Coe v. Errol, \n116 \nU.S. 517, 525\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 475; Bacon v. Illinois, \n227 U.S. 504\n, 515-516, 33 Sup. Ct. 299; McCluskey v. Marysville & Northern Ry. Co., \n243 U.S. 36\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 374.\n The distinction between these cases and those cited to sustain the decision of the District Court (Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 398\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 276; Ohio R. R. Commission v. Worthington, \n225 U.S. 101\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 653; Texas & N. O. R. R. Co. v. Sabine Tram Co., \n227 U.S. 111\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 229; Louisiana R. R. Commission v. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co., \n229 U.S. 336\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 837) is so evident that particular analysis may be dispensed with.\n The exceptions sustained by the District Court to the claims of the Arkadelphia Milling Co. and Hasty & Sons having been found to be untenable, it results that these claims should be allowed as against the railway companies and their sureties, so far as they arose before the final decrees, and as against the railway companies only, so far as they arose after the final decrees.\n Nos. 92 and 93, decree reversed; Nos. 94 and 95, decree modified and affirmed; and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","9":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nARKANSAS v. MISSISSIPPI(1919)\n\nArgued: Decided: May 19, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 39, 40]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Herbert Pope, of Chicago, Ill., Walter P. Armstrong, of Sardis, Miss., and J. M. Moore, of Little Rock, Ark., for complainant.\n Messrs. Garner W. Green, of Jackson, Miss., and Gerald Fitz Gerald, of Clarksdale, Miss., for defendant.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This as a suit brought to determine a portion of the boundary line between the states of Arkansas and Mississippi. It appears that at the place in dispute the Mississippi river formerly had its course from Friar's point in a southwesterly direction, then made a turn to the south, flowing in a southerly direction, then a turn towards the \n\n[250 U.S. 39, 41]\n\u00a0\n west in the shape of a half moon, then a sharp turn to the north and flowing northerly, and thence westerly, making a bend in the river in the shape of a horseshoe, which was known as Horseshoe Bend. It is averred in the bill, that in 1848 the river suddenly left its course and ran westerly across the points of the bend, cutting off a tract of land which has become known as Horseshoe Island. The amended answer avers that this avulsion occurred in 1842; but the exact date is immaterial. That it did occur is clearly established, and it is generally spoken of in the testimony as happening in 1848. We may say preliminarily that we find no substance in the contention of the respondent that the allegations of the answer must be taken as true for want of replication. Under new equity rule 31 (33 Sup. Ct. xxvii) in a case of this character no replication is required in order to make the issues.\n The state of Arkansas contends that the old course of the river before the avulsion was within a body of water now known as Horseshoe Lake or Old river, a body of water of considerable length and depth. The state of Mississippi contends that the Old river ran through a body of water still remaining, but considerably further to the north, and known as Dustin Pond, and that before the avulsion the course of the river on the upper side of the Bend was considerably to the westward of the course claimed by Arkansas, and ran where now there is a slough not far from the middle of Horseshoe Island. These diverse claims are illustrated by an examination of the map, Exhibit A, attached to the bill.\n As we view the case it is practically controlled by the decision of this court in Arkansas v. Tennessee, \n246 U.S. 158\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 301, L. R. A. 1918D, 258. In view of that decision we are relieved of the necessity of a discussion in detail of much that is urged upon our attention now. Arkansas was admitted to the Union June 15, 1836 (5 Stat. 50, 51, c. 100) by an act of Congress which as to its boundaries provided: \n\n[250 U.S. 39, 42]\n\u00a0\n 'Beginning in the middle of the main channel of the Mississippi river, on the parallel of thirty-six degrees north latitude, running from thence west, with the said parallel of latitude to the St. Francis river; thence up the middle of the main channel of said river to the parallel of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes north; from thence west to the southwest corner of the state of Missouri, and from thence to be bounded on the west, to the north bank of Red river, by the lines described in the first article of the treaty between the United States and the Cherokec Nation of Indians west of the Mississippi, made and concluded at the city of Washington on the 26th day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twenty- eight; and to be bounded on the south side of Red river by the Mexican boundary line, to the northwest corner of the state of Louisiana; thence east, with the Louisiana state line, to the middle of the main channel of the Mississippi river; thence up the middle of the main channel of the said river, to the thirty- sixth degree of north latitude, the point of beginning.'\n Mississippi had previously been admitted to the Union by an act of Congress of march 1, 1817 (3 Stat. 348, c. 23), which provided:\n'Beginning on the river Mississippi at the point where the southern boundary line of the state of Tennessee strikes the same, thence east along the said boundary line to the Tennessee river, thence up the same to the mouth of Bear creek; thence by a direct line to the northwest corner of the county of Washington [Alabama]; thence due south to the Gulf of Mexico; thence westwardly, including all the islands within six leagues of the shore, to the most eastern junction of Pearl river with Lake Borgne; thence up said river to the thirty- first degree of north latitude thence west along the said degree of latitude to the Mississippi river; thence up the same to the beginning.' \n\n[250 U.S. 39, 43]\n\u00a0\n It will be observed that the language of the Mississippi act, so far as now important to consider, fixes the boundary upon the Mississippi river as 'up the same to the beginning,' and the language of the Arkansas act is, 'Beginning in the middle of the main channel of the Mississippi river; ... thence east, with the Louisiana state line, to the middle of the main channel of the Mississippi river; thence up the middle of the main channel of the said river, to the 36th degree of north latitude, the point of beginning.'\n\n The state of Arkansas contends that these acts of Congress fix the middle of the channel of navigation as it existed before the avulsion as the boundary line between the states. By the state of Mississippi it is contended that the boundary line is a line equidistant from the well defined banks of the river. Language to the same effect as that contained in the acts of admission now before us was before this court in the case of Arkansas v. Tennessee, supra, and in that case the subject was considered, and the meaning of the Arkansas act, and similar language in the act admitting the state of Tennessee was interpreted. The rule laid down in Iowa v. Illinois, \n147 U.S. 1\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 239, was followed, and it was held that where the states of the Union are separated by boundary lines described as 'a line drawn along the middle of the river,' or as 'the middle of the main channel of the river,' the boundary must be fixed at the middle of the main navigable channel, and not along the line equidistant between the banks. We regard that decision as settling the law, and see no reason to depart from it in this instance.\n It is urgently insisted that the laws and decisions of Arkansas and Mississippi are to the contrary, and our attention is called to Joint Resolution of Congress of 1909, 35 Stat. 1161, No. 5, which provides:\n'That the consent of the Congress of the United States is hereby given to the states of Mississippi and Arkansas \n\n[250 U.S. 39, 44]\n\u00a0\n to enter into such agreement or compact as they may deem desirable or necessary, not in conflict with the Constitution of the United States, or any law thereof, to fix the boundary line between said States, where the Mississippi river now, or formerly, formed the said boundary line, and to cede respectively each to the other such tracts or parcels of the territory of each state as may have become separated from the main body thereof by changes in the course or channel of the Mississippi river and also to adjudge and settle the jurisdiction to be exercised by said states, respectively, over offenses arising out of the violation of the laws of said states upon the waters of the Mississippi river.' Approved January 26, 1909\n\n\n\n No specific agreement appears to have been entered into under this act; but it is insisted that Arkansas and Mississippi by their respective Constitutions have fixed the boundary line, as it is now claimed to be by the state of Mississippi, and that such boundary line has become the true boundary of the states, irrespective of the decision of this court in Iowa v. Illinois, supra, followed in Arkansas v. Tennessee, supra. We have examined the Constitutions and decisions of the respective states, and find nothing in them to change the conclusions reached by this court in determining the question of boundary between states. A similar contention was made in Arkansas v. Tennessee as to the effect of the Arkansas and Tennessee legislation and decisions, and the contention that the local law and decisions controlled in a case where the interstate boundary was required to be fixed, under circumstances very similar to those here presented, was rejected. In that case the Arkansas cases, which are now insisted upon as authority for the respondent's contention, were fully reviewed. The Mississippi cases called to our attention, of which the leading one seems to be Magnolia v. Marshall, 39 Miss. 109, as well as the legislation of the \n\n[250 U.S. 39, 45]\n\u00a0\n state, seem to sustain the claim that local jurisdiction and right of soil to the middle of the river, is fixed by a line equidistant from the banks. But whatever may be the effect of these decisions upon local rights of property or the administration of the criminal laws of the state, when the question becomes one of fixing the boundary between states separated by a navigable stream, it was specifically held in Iowa v. Illinois, supra, followed in later cases, that the controlling consideration is that which preserves to each state equality in the navigation of the river, and that in such instances the boundary line is the middle of the main navigable channel of the river. In Arkansas v. Tennessee, supra, 246 U. S. page 171, 38 Sup. Ct. page 304 (62 L. Ed. 638, L. R. A. 1918D, 258), we said:\n'The rule thus adopted [that declared in Iowa v. Illinois] known as the rule of the 'thalweg,' has been treated as set at rest by that decision. Louisiana v. Mississippi, \n202 U.S. 1\n 49 [26 Sup. Ct. 408]; Washington v. Oregon, \n211 U.S. 127\n, 134 [29 Sup. Ct. 47]; \n214 U.S. 205\n, 215 [29 Sup. Ct. 631]. The argument submitted in behalf of the defendant state in the case at bar, including a reference to the notable recent decision of its Supreme Court in State v. Muncie Pulp Co. (1907) 119 Tennessee, 47 [104 S. W. 437], has failed to convince us that this rule ought now, after the lapse of 25 years, to be departed from.'\n\n We are unable to find occasion to depart from this rule because of long acquiescence in enactments and decisions, and the practices of the inhabitants of the disputed territory in recognition of a boundary, which have been given weight in a number of our cases where the true boundary line was difficult to ascertain. See Arkansas v. Tennessee, supra, and the cases cited at page 172 of 246 U. S. (38 Sup. Ct. 301, L. R. A. 1918D, 258).\n This record presents a clear case of a change in the course of the river by avulsion, and the applicable rule established in this court, and repeatedly enforced, requires the boundary line to be fixed at the middle of the channel of navigation as it existed just previous to the avulsion. The location and determination of such bound \n\n[250 U.S. 39, 46]\n\u00a0\n ary is a matter which we shall leave in the first instance to a commission of three competent persons to be named by the court upon suggestion of counsel, as was done in Arkansas v. Tennessee. See \n247 U.S. 461\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 557. This commission will have before it the record in this case, and such further proofs as it may be authorized to receive by an interlocutory decree to be entered in the case. Counsel may prepare and submit the form of such decree. \n\n\n\n","10":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBALL ENGINEERING CO. v. J G WHITE & CO.(1919)\nNo. 227\nArgued: March 13, 1919Decided: May 19, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 46, 47]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William M. Parke, of New York City, and Messrs. Charles D. Lockwood and Homer S. cummings, both of Stamford, Conn., for petitioner.\n\n\n[250 U.S. 46, 48]\n\u00a0\n Messrs.Harry W. Reynolds, of Hartford, Conn., J. Kemp. Bartlett, of Baltimore, Md., and Lewis Sperry, of Hartford, Conn., for respondent.\n\n\n[250 U.S. 46, 50]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Ball Engineering Company, a Missouri corporation, brought this action against J. G. White & Co., Incorporated, a Connecticut corporation, in the United States District Court for the District of Onnecticut, for damages for \n\n[250 U.S. 46, 51]\n\u00a0\n the alleged conversion of a contractor's plant and equipment, which was prepared for use in prosecuting the work of constructing lock and dam No. 6, on the Trinity river, in the state of Texas, and all of which, including buildings, were located upon the site of the lock and dam at the time of the alleged conversion. The action was tried before a referee, designated under the Connecticut practice a committee. Two trials were had, the first resulting in a judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the value of the converted property. 212 Fed. 1009. That judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (J. G. White & Co. v. Ball Engineering Co., 223 Fed. 618, 139 C. C. A. 286), and a new trial ordered which took place before the same committee, and upon the same evidence and the same findings of fact, in order to conform to the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals, judgment was rendered in favor of the defendant, and this was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals on the authority of its prior decision. 241 Fed. 989, 154 C. C. A. 661. The case is here upon writ of certiorari.\n The United States filed its brief amicus curiae, contending that the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals to the effect that the United States is liable under the Tucker Act (Act March 3, 1887, c. 359, 24 Stat. 505) when property of a third person is taken by one of its agents, under the circumstances disclosed, was erroneous.\n The material facts are:\n On July 10, 1906, the United States entered into a contract with the Hubbard Building & Realty Company to construct lock and dam No. 6 on the Trinity river, Texas.\n A partnership composed of George A. Carden and P. D. C. Ball, known as the Ball-Carden Company, in the year 1908 placed a considerable amount of property, consisting of materials, machinery and tools, on the site of the lock and dam No. 6, and used them in constructing the lock and dam until the month of May, 1909\n\n\n This partnership was dissolved in April or May, 1909, \n\n[250 U.S. 46, 52]\n\u00a0\n and discontinued the work theretofore carried on by it in the construction of the lock and dam. Carden transferred all his interest to Ball, who, under the name of the Ball Engineering Company, continued the work until on or about September 8, 1909.\n It does not appear under what circumstances the Ball-Carden Company or Ball operating as the Ball Engineering Company undertook the performance of the work.\n On September 9, 1909, work upon said lock and dam was abandoned; on October 22, 1909, the government annulled the contract with the Hubbard Company, pursuant to its provisions.\n On April 2, 1910, the Ball Engineering Company was organized under the laws of Missouri, and P. D. C. Ball transferred to it all of the property mentioned in the complaint.\n The United States entered into a contract with the defendant J. G. White & Co. on June 6, 1910, to complete the construction of the lock and dam. Prior to the making of the contract the defendant attempted, without success, to agree with the Ball Company for the purchase or rental of the personal property, etc., specified in the complaint. On June 22, 1910, the government notified the defendant that the Hubbard Company had been directed to move all property at lock and dam No. 6, except certain specified items, and determined the valuation of the same at $11,578, and fixed a monthly rental of $380 therefor from the government to the defendant, and also fixed a valuation upon the material, etc., at the lock site and notified the defendant to take such of it as it deemed proper, at such valuations respectively. The Ball Company refused to assent to either valuation. On July 18, 1910, the defendant receipted to the United States for the articles constituting the construction plant, and for such of the materials as it was willing to and did receive. The property which the government took from the \n\n[250 U.S. 46, 53]\n\u00a0\n Ball Engineering Company was valued by it at $11,578, which amount was credited on account of the Hubbard Company; but the United States neither paid, nor credited the purchase price or rental of the property to the Ball Company.\n The United States professed to act under section 33 of the contract with the Hubbard Company, which reads:\n'Annulment.-In case of the annulment of this contract as conditionally provided for in the form of contract adopted and used by the engineering department of the army, the United States shall have the right to take possession of, wherever they may be, and to retain all materials, tools, buildings, tramways, cars, etc., or any part or parts of same, prepared for use or in use in the prosecution of the work, together with any or all leases, rights of way or quarry privileges, under purchase, at a valuation to be determined by the engineer officer in charge.'\n\n The government would not allow the Ball Company to take possession of any of the property used in the construction of the lock and dam. This property the United States leased to the defendant, who used the same in completing the work, and thereafter returned all of it to the government, except, of course, such material as had been used in construction.\n The government inserted the following stipulation in its contract with the J. G. White & Co., Inc.:\n'If so requested in writing by the contractor, the United States will exercise the right conferred by paragraph 33 of the specifications forming part of the annulled contract with the Hubbard Building & Realty Company, to take possession of and retain all materials, tools, buildings, tramways, cars, etc., or any part or parts of the same prepared for use or in use in the prosecution of the work at a valuation to be determined by the engineer officer in charge, and the contractor for the completion of the work will be permitted to use such plant and material in the \n\n[250 U.S. 46, 54]\n\u00a0\n prosecution of the work, for which he will be charged a fair rental or purchase value, to be determined by the engineer officer in charge. It must, however, be clearly understood that since the ownership of the above-mentioned plant and materials is not free from doubt, the United States does not undertake to transfer title, does not guarantee peaceable possession and uninterrupted use, and will not defend any action or writ that may be instituted against the contractor concerning the same, nor be responsible for nor assume any expenses or cost in connection therewith. Nothing that may result from the exercise of the above-mentioned right shall be made the basis of a claim against the United States or its officers or agents.'\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, under the circumstances here disclosed, rightly held that the government had no authority to take the property of the Ball Engineering Company by virtue of anything contained in its contract with the Hubbard Company. And further held that inasmuch as the government took the property with the knowledge that it was claimed by the Ball Company and used it in the construction of public work, it was obliged to make just compensation to the Ball Company by reason of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. 'It,' says the Court of Appeals, 'made no proprietary claim, and therefore was bound to pay the real owner for the property, whether the taking was tortious or not. It fully recognized this obligation by crediting the Hubbard Company with the value. The fact that it recognized the wrong person as owner and erroneously relied upon the contract with the Hubbard Company, by which the plaintiff was not bound, in no respect changed the material fact that it had taken the property and acquired title thereto.'\n The findings show that the government took possession by virtue of its contract with the Hubbard Company; that it definitely advised White & Co. that it would \n\n[250 U.S. 46, 55]\n\u00a0\n not be responsible for the seizure of the property, and that anything which might result therefrom could not be the basis for any claim against the United States, its officers or agents. Under the circumstances disclosed the Circuit Court of Appeals held the White Company not liable to the Ball Engineering Company -upon the theory that the government had appropriated the property under circumstances giving rise to an implied contract to pay the Ball Engineering Company for it. This ruling was made upon the authority of United States v. Buffalo Pitts Co., 193 Fed. 905, 114 C. C. A. 119, affirmed \n234 U.S. 228\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 840. In that case a suit was brought under the Tucker Act by the Buffalo Pitts Company against the United States to recover for the value of the use of a certain engine for which, it was alleged, the United States was under an implied contract to pay. The findings of fact showed that the Buffalo Pitts Company sold a traction engine to the Taylor-Moore Construction Company, and took a chattel mortgage to secure the payment of the purchase money. The mortgage was duly recorded, and no part of the purchase money was paid. The engine was put into service by the Taylor-Moore Company upon a reclamation project undertaken by the Interior Department, the work being prosecuted under a contract between the United States and the Taylor- Moore Construction Company. The Construction Company defaulted in its work, and assigned all of its interest in the contract to the United States, and it took possession of all material, supplies and equipment belonging to the Construction Company, including the engine in question. The Buffalo Pitts Company made demand upon the district engineer of the reclamation service for the possession of the engine and appurtenances. But the demand was refused, and the engine retained for use in the government work. The Buffalo Pitts Company notified the representative of the United States of the execution and filing of its mortgage, \n\n[250 U.S. 46, 56]\n\u00a0\n and claimed the property. It was expressly found that the government had at all times known of the existence of the mortgage, and did not dispute the validity thereof, but represented to the Buffalo Pitts Company that it was using and would continue to use the engine in its work, that any legal proceedings to recover possession would be resisted, and that if the property were left in the government's possession its attorney would recommend payment therefor. It was further found that the Buffalo Pitts Company relied upon these facts, and consented to the government retaining possession of its property -in the expectation of receiving compensation from it therefor. The claim was made that the United States was not liable for tortious acts. This court reviewed former cases, and said:\n'In the present case, as we have said, there is nothing to show that the government expected to use the engine and appurtenances without compensation. It did not dispute the mortgage, and the findings of fact clearly show that if the government had the right to take the property, notwithstanding the mortgage interest which the plaintiff had in it, it made no claim of right to take and use it without compensation as against the prior outstanding mortgage, which distinctly reserved the right to take and sell the property under the circumstances shown and which after the breach of condition vested the right of possession and the right to convert the property in the mortgagee.'\n\n It was further pointed out that the government had authority under an act of Congress to acquire any property necessary for the purpose stated, and, if need be, to appropriate it. We held that the facts found brought the case within the principles decided in former cases and made the United States liable, not for a tortious act, but upon implied contract.\n The subject was again reviewed by this court in a case decided at this term, Temple v. United States, 248 U. S. \n\n[250 U.S. 46, 57]\n\u00a0\n 121, 39 Sup. Ct. 56, in which a suit was brought to recover the value of submerged lands in the Chicago river appropriated by the government without the owner's consent. Former decisions of this court were reviewed, and we said:\n'If the plaintiff can recover, it must be upon an implied contract. For, under the Tucker Act, the consent of the United States to be sued is (so far as here material) limited to claims founded 'upon any contract, express or implied'; and a remedy for claims sounding in tort is expressly denied. Bigby v. United States, \n188 U.S. 400\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 468. Hijo v. United States, \n194 \nU.S. 315, 323\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 727. As stated in United States v. Lynah, \n188 \nU.S. 445, 462\n, 465 S., 23 Sup. Ct. 349: 'The law will imply a promise to make the required compensation, where property to which the government asserts no title is taken, pursuant to an act of Congress, as private property to be applied for public uses'; or, in other words: 'Whenever in the exercise of its governmental rights it takes property, the ownership of which it concedes to be in an individual, it impliedly promises to pay therefor.' But in the case at bar, both the pleadings and the facts found preclude the implication of a promise to pay. For the property applied to the public use is not and was not conceded to be in the plaintiff.'\n\n In the case under consideration the United States did not concede title in the Ball Engineering Company, but took the property knowing of the claim of that company to its ownership, and credited its value upon the government contract with the Hubbard Company. The government took this action upon request of the White Company, and advised that it would not, under any circumstances, be held liable for the seizure of the property. Under these circumstances, the implication of a contract that the United States would pay, which must be the basis of its liability under the Fifth Amendment, is clearly rebutted. The liability of the government, if any, is in tort, for which it has not consented to be sued. As the findings show that \n\n[250 U.S. 46, 58]\n\u00a0\n the White Company, with knowledge of the facts, procured and used the property of the Ball Company, it ought to have been held liable to that company. It follows that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","11":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBALTIMORE & O R. CO. v. LEACH(1919)\nNo. 132\nArgued: Decided: March 10, 1919\n\n\n\n Messrs. Wm. W. Crawford and Charles H. Gibson, both of Louisville, Ky ., for petitioners.\n Messrs. Frank W. Hackett and John S. Blair, both of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent Leach sued the petitioners for damages sustained en route by cattle delivered at East St. Louis, \n\n[249 U.S. 217, 218]\n\u00a0\n Ill., October 1, 1914, for shipment to Georgetown, Ky. In defense the carriers set up non-compliance with the following provision contained in bill of lading issued as required by act of Congress.\n'That no claim for damages which may accrue to the said shipper under this contract shall be allowed or paid by the said carrier, or sued for in any court by the said shipper, unless a claim for loss or damages shall be made in writing verified by the affidavit of the shipper or his agent, and delivered to the general freight agent of said carrier at his office in Cincinnati, Ohio, within five days from the time said stock is removed from said car or cars, and that if any loss or damage occurs upon the line of connecting carrier, then such carrier shall not be liable unless a claim shall be made in like manner and delivered in like time, to some proper officer or agent of the carrier on whose line the loss or injury occurs.'\n\n This averment was not denied; but the shipper replied that he promptly advised the railroad's agent at Georgetown of all essential facts and maintained that requirement in respect of written notice to general freight agent had been waived.\n The point involved has been discussed in our recent opinions and we can find nothing which takes this case out of the rule requiring compliance with a provision in a bill of lading like the one above quoted. St. L., I. Mt. & So. Ry. Co. v. Starbird, \n243 U.S. 592\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 462; Southern Pacific Co. v. Stewart, \n248 U.S. 446\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 139, decided January 13, 1919\n\n\n The judgment below is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concur in the result.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE dissenting.\n In this case the shipper sued two connecting interstate \n\n[249 U.S. 217, 219]\n\u00a0\n carriers for damages to a carload of cattle, caused by delay in transit. Three died in the car and four more within three or four days of arrival at destination and the defense sustained by the court is failure to notify the carrier of claim for damages within five days of unloading.\n The carrier pleaded that one of the terms of the bill of lading was the five-day limitation, quoted in the opinion of the court. This was immediately preceded, in the same paragraph, by the following:\n'That in the event of any unusual delay or detention of said live stock, caused by the negligence of the said carrier, or its employes, or its connecting carriers, or their employes, or otherwise, the said shipper agrees to accept as full compensation for all loss or damage sustained thereby the amount actually expended by said shipper in the purchase of food and water for said live stock, while so detained.'\n\n In Boston & Maine Railroad v. Piper, \n246 U.S. 439\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 354, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 469, a provision in exactly these terms was held 'illegal and consequently void,' as an attempt by the carrier to exoperate itself from loss negligently caused by it. This is the only provision in the bill of lading, as pleaded, which is applicable to a claim for delay, such as the shipper made in this case, and since it is void there is nothing in the contract for carriage on which the five-day limitation could operate, for it applied in terms only to claims 'for damages which may accrue to said shipper under this contract.'\n The suit of the shipper was based on the common-law liability of the carrier, not at all on the bill of lading; the five-day limitation is in terms applicable only to claims under the bill of lading; the only provision in the bill of lading applicable to claims for delay was void, and therefore it seems very clear that the five-day limitation was not available as a defense.\n Permit me to add that the many cases coming into this \n\n[249 U.S. 217, 220]\n\u00a0\n and other courts show that this five-day limitation is unreasonably short and in my judgment, for this reason, it should be declared void upon its face. Certainly it should not be made a favorite of the law and extended beyond its strict terms, in presence of the Act of Congress approved March 4, 1915 (38 Stat. 1196, c. 176), declaring that where in such suit the damage complained of is due to delay or damage in transit by carelessness or negligence, 'then no notice of claim nor filing of claim shall be required as a condition precedent to recovery.' While the case before us arose prior to the passing of this act, it is an important declaration of public policy by Congress, which should not be overlooked.\n For the reasons thus briefly stated, I cannot concur in the opinion of the court.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA also dissents. \n\n\n\n","12":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBANK OF CALIFORNIA, NAT ASS'N v. RICHARDSON(1919)\nNo. 262\nArgued: Decided: January 27, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[248 U.S. 476, 477]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. S. Pillsbury, Mr. F. D. Madison, Mr. Oscar Sutro, and Mr. Alfred Sutro, all of San Francisco, Cal., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[248 U.S. 476, 478]\n\u00a0\n Mr. U. S. Webb and Mr. Raymond Benjamin, both of San Francisco, Cal., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[248 U.S. 476, 480]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Except as to real estate, which is taxed directly in the name of the owner, all the available resources of banks for the purposes of taxation are reached under the law of California, not by an immediate levy on the banks as the owner, but by annual assessment and tax thereon made by the State Board of Equalization against the stockholders of banks. The state law places the duty upon the banks to pay the tax assessed against their stockholders, with the obligation on the stockholders to repay, sanctioned by a right conferred upon the banks to sell the stock of any stockholder failing to refund.\n The Bank of California, organized under the National Banking Law (Act June 3, 1864, c. 106, 13 Stat. 99) and established in San Francisco, commenced this suit to recover the amount of a tax, levied against its stockholders in 1915 under the law previously \n\n[248 U.S. 476, 481]\n\u00a0\n stated, which it had paid under protest claiming that the tax was not only unlawful under the state law but illegal under the law of the United States governing the right of a state to tax national banks and their stockholders. The case is here to review a judgment denying the right to recover, on the ground that the tax had been lawfully exacted under both the law of the state and that of the United States.\n The decision below, in so far as it rested upon the state law, is binding and we put that subject out of view. To understand the contentions as to the law of the United States requires a brief statement of the tax levied and the particulars in which it is complained of. The capital of the bank was $8,500,000, evidenced by 85,000 shares of the par value of $ 100 each. D. O. Mills & Company was a national bank established at Sacramento and the California Bank was a stockholder in that bank to the extent of 2,501 shares. The California Bank was also the owner of 1,001 shares of stock in the Mission Bank, a banking corporation organized under the state law and doing business in San Francisco. The Board of Equalization in 1915 fixed the value of all the assets of the California Bank at the sum of $15,775,252.67. The Board included in the assets making up this amount the stock standing in the name of the California Bank, both in the D. O. Mills National Bank and in the Mission State Bank; the first, the Mills National Bank stock, being Computed as worth $625,546.30, and the second, the Mission State Bank stock, as worth $121,916.50.\n Upon these valuations, the Board assessed the California Bank as a stockholder in the D. O. Mills National Bank and as a stockholder in the Mission State Bank for the shares of stock which it held in those banks, valuing each at the sum previously stated. Besides, the stockholders of the California National were assessed for the value of the assets of that bank, including in the amount \n\n[248 U.S. 476, 482]\n\u00a0\n the full value of the shares of stock owned by the bank in the Mills National and Mission State Banks.\n The controversy grows out of the asserted illegality of the twofold tax levied on the assessments of the California Bank as a stockholder in the Mills National Bank and in the Mission State Bank. Its solution depends upon the effect of Rev. St. 5219 (Comp. St.  9784), the text of which is in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Without considering some modifications made by the Act of February 10, 1868 (15 Stat. 34, c. 7 [Comp. St.  9784]), which are negligible for the purposes of the questions before us, the section is but the reproduction of a provision of section 41 of the Act of June 3, 1864, dealing with the organization of national banks. 13 Stat. 99, 112. The forms of expression used in the section make it certain that in adopting it the legislative mind had in view the subject of how far the banking associations created were or should be made subject to state taxation, which presumably it was deemed necessary to deal with in view of the controversies growing out of the creation of the Bank of the United States and dealt with by decisions of this court. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 436; Osborn v. Bank, 9 Wheat. 738, 867; Weston v. Charleston, 2 Pet. 449. \n\n[248 U.S. 476, 483]\n\u00a0\n There is also no doubt from the section that it was intended to comprehensively control the subject with which it dealt and thus to furnish the exclusive rule governing state taxation as to the federal agencies created as provided in the section. All possibility of dispute to the contrary is foreclosed by the decisions of this court. People v. Weaver, \n100 U.S. 539\n; Mercantile National Bank v. New York, \n131 \nU.S. 138, 154\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 826; Owensboro National Bank v. Owensboro, \n173 U.S. 664\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 537; Covington v. First National Bank, \n198 U.S. 100\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 562.\n Two provisions in apparent conflict were adopted. First, the absolute exclusion of power in the states to tax the banks, the national agencies created, so as to prevent all interference with their operations, the integrity of their assets, or the administrative governmental control over their affairs. Second, preservation of the taxing power of the several states so as to prevent any impairment thereof from arising from the existence of the national agencise created, to the end that the financial resources engaged in their development might not be withdrawn from the reach of state taxation, but on the contrary that every resource possessed by the banks as national agencies might in substance and effect remain liable to state taxation.\n The first aim was attained by the nonrecognition of any power whatever in the states to tax the federal agencies, the banks, except as to real estate specially provided for, and, therefore, the exclusion of all such powers. The second was reached by a recognition of the fact that, considered from the point of view of ultimate and beneficial interest, every available asset possessed or enjoyed by the banks would be owned by their stockholders and would be, therefore, reached by taxation of the stockholders as such. Full and express power on that subject was given, accompanied with a limitation preventing its exercise in a discriminatory manner, a power which again \n\n[248 U.S. 476, 484]\n\u00a0\n from its very limitation was exclusive of other methods of taxation and left, therefore, no room for taxation of the federal agency or its instrumentalities or essential accessories except as recognized by the provision in question.\n Let us come to consider whether the taxation in question was sanctioned by the Act of Congress as thus understood. We do so, first, from the point of view of the two-fold tax which was based on the ownership by the California Bank of stock in the D. O. Mills National Bank, and, second, as to the taxes which resulted from the ownership by the California Bank of stock in the Mission State Bank.\n In Bank of Redemption v. Boston, \n125 U.S. 60\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 772, it was determined that the stock held by one national bank in another is governed by the power to tax stockholders given by the statute. Hence, the circumstance of the ownership of the stock by the California Bank in the D. O. Mills National Bank in no way deflects the operation of the statute. This being the case, as the taxation of the California Bank as a stockholder in the Mills Bank conformed to the grant of power to tax stockholders of national banks, it results that the assessment for taxation made upon that basis was within the state authority and was rightly decided so to be.\n But the principle upon which this rests inevitably leads to the further conclusion, that the inclusion of the stock ownership of the California Bank in the Mills Bank as an asset of the California Bank for the purpose of taxing the stockholders of the latter bank was a disregard of the provision as to taxing stockholders fixed by the statute.\n Indeed, it is apparent that the use of the power conferred by the statute to tax the California Bank as a stockholder in the Mills National Bank and in addition to avail of such stock ownership for the purpose of taxing \n\n[248 U.S. 476, 485]\n\u00a0\n the shareholders of the California Bank, was but to accept the statute on the one hand, and to exert on the other a power which could have no existence consistently with the statute. To say that the two taxes, the one levied on the bank as a stockholder in the Mills National Bank, and the other levied on the stockholders of the California Bank, were valid because a taxation of different persons, the California Bank on the one hand and the stockholders of the California Bank on the other, serves only to emphasize the plain disregard of the statute which would result from the enforcement of the taxes in question.\n It is undoubted that the statute from the purely legal point of view, with the object of protecting the federal corporate agencies which it created from state burdens and securing the continued existence of such agencies despite the changing incidents of stock ownership, treated the banking corporations and their stockholders as different. But it is also undoubted that the statute for the purpose of preserving the state power of taxation, considering the subject from the point of view of ultimate beneficial interest, treated the stock interest, that is, the stockholder, and the bank as one and subject to one taxation by the methods which it provided.\n Again, when the purposes of the statute are taken into view, the conclusion cannot be escaped that the transmutation of the stock interest of the California in the Mills Bank, into an asset of the California Bank subject to be taxed for the purpose of reaching its stockholders, is to overthrow the very fundamental ground upon which the taxation of stockholders must rest.\n We do not stop to point out the double burden resulting from the taxation of the same value twice which the assessment manifested, as to do so could add no cogency to the violation of the one power to tax by the one prescribed method conferred by the statute and which was the sole measure of the state authority. \n\n[248 U.S. 476, 486]\n\u00a0\n Coming to consider the tax on the California National Bank as a stockholder in the Mission State Bank, different considerations are controlling, since the provisions of the statute and the ruling in the Bank of Redemption Case, supra, both in letter and spirit apply only to stock ownership by a national bank in another national bank. It, therefore, follows that as the California National Bank was subject to state taxation as a federal agency only to the extent authorized by the statute, the taxation of that bank as a stockholder in the Mission State Bank was without the scope of the statute and beyond the power which it conferred.\n But while this is true, it also follows that as the stock in the Mission Bank belonged to the California Bank and was part of its general assets embraced by the comprehensive power conferred to tax such assets in the absence of some provision of the statute to the contrary, which as we have seen, was the case with regard to the stock held in the D. O. Mills National Bank, the assessment of the stock in the Mission Bank as an asset of the California Bank against its stockholders was within the scope of the grant given by the statute and was, therefore, valid.\n From what we have said, it follows that the court below erred in refusing to order the refunding of the sum paid for the taxes levied on the assessment made against the stockholders of the California Bank for the value of the stock held by that bank in the D. O. Mills National Bank, and which had been assessed against the California Bank as a stockholder in the Mills Bank; and further erred in so far as it refused to decree a refund of the amount paid for the tax levied on the California Bank as the result of the assessment on that bank as a stockholder in the Mission State Bank. In these particulars, therefore, its decree must be, and is reversed. Our order, therefore, is\n Reverse and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n[248 U.S. 476, 487]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY, dissenting.\n Pursuant to the constitution and laws of California, the plaintiff in error, a national banking association located in that state, was required to pay the following three taxes for the year 1915:\n\n\n (a)\n A tax upon the valuation of the shares of its own stock, assessed against the bank at its own request instead of being assessed in the names of its individual stockholders. Its shares are 85,000 in number, of the par value of $100 each ($8,500,000 in all), and were valued for taxation at the sum of $15,775,252.67; a valuation which took into account all the assets of plaintiff in error except the assessed value of its real estate ( excluded pursuant to the provisions of the state constitution). Included in the estimate were the sum of $625,546.30, the valuation of 2,501 shares of stock of the Mills National Bank held by plaintiff in error, and the sum of $121,916.52 for the value of 1,001 shares of the Mission Bank (a state bank), likewise held by plaintiff in error. It appears that the Bank of California prior to February 5, 1910, was a state bank, and on that date was converted into a national association; and, being at that time a stockholder of the two other banks, was permitted, under section 5154, Rev. Stat. U. S. (Comp. St.  9694), as it then stood, to continue to be such stockholder after becoming a national bank.\n\n\n (b)\n A tax assessed directly against plaintiff in error as a stockholder of the Mills National, based upon the valuation already mentioned of 2,501 shares.\n\n\n (c)\n A tax assessed directly against plaintiff in error as a stockholder in the Mission (state) Bank, based upon the above mentioned valuation of its 1,001 shares in that bank.\n In an action brought by the California National against Richardson as state treasurer to recover a part of the taxes thus paid, the supreme court of the state, following its previous decision in Bank of California v. Roberts, Treasurer, 173 \n\n[248 U.S. 476, 488]\n\u00a0\n Cal. 398, 160 Pac. 225, denied recovery, and the case is brought here upon the ground that the state constitution and laws, in conformity to which the taxes were assessed, are repugnant to section 5219 of the Revised Statutes of the United States. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n This court now holds that while the California National was taxable as a stockholder in the Mills National Bank (Bank of Redemption v. Boston, \n125 U.S. 60\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 772), the other taxes imposed against plaintiff in error were repugnant to section 5219 in two respects: ( 1) In that the valuation of the Mills National shares ought to have been duducted from the estimate of the valuation of the California National shares in making an assessment against the stockholders of the latter bank; and (2) in that plaintiff in error, as a national bank, was not taxable at all as a stockholder in the state bank, and that the tax last mentioned above was altogether erroneous.\n Upon the last point I understand the case to be controlled by the decision of this court in Owensboro National Bank v. Owensboro, \n173 U.S. 664\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 537, where it was held that section 5219 had the effect of exempting not only the operations and franchises but the property of the national banks from \n\n[248 U.S. 476, 489]\n\u00a0\n state taxation, except as to their real estate. There are weighty considerations to the contrary, which seem not to have been called to the attention of the court in that case-certainly are not adverted to in the opinion-but it would serve no useful purpose to bring them into the present discussion. Therefore I take it to be settled that under section 5219 a national bank may not be taxed by a state with respect to its ownership of shares in another corporation except shares in another national bank.\n The supreme court of California, in the Roberts Case (173 Cal. 398, 405, 160 Pac. 225), held that since it was decided by this court in the case of Bank of Redemption v. Boston that section 5219 permits the taxation of the shares of a national bank in the hands of another national bank, a different rule could not be applied to the taxation of shares in a state bank owned by a national bank without violating that provision of section 5219 which prohibits the taxation of national bank shares at a greater rate than is assessed upon other moneyed capital. But this view seems to me untenable; it mistakes an exemption accorded to a particular holder of other moneyed capital for a restriction upon the rate of taxation that may be assessed upon other moneyed capital as a class of property. As we held in Amoskeag Savings Bank v. Purdy, \n231 \nU.S. 373, 393\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 114, 122 (58 L. Ed. 274) the language of section 5219 'prohibits discrimination against shareholders in national banks and in favor of the shareholders of competing institutions, but it does not require that the scheme of taxation shall be so arranged that the burden shall fall upon each and every shareholder aike, without distinction arising from circumstances personal to the individual.' The nontaxability of state bank shares in the hands of a national bank is attributable to the character of the national bank as a taxpayer, not to the quality of the state bank shares as an object of taxation.\n And of course I agree that the California National was \n\n[248 U.S. 476, 490]\n\u00a0\n taxable as a stockholder in the Mills National; it having been determined in Bank of Redemption v. Boston, \n125 \nU.S. 60, 70\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 772, that section 5219 permits the taxation of a national bank owning shares of the capital stock of another national bank, by reason of that ownership, on the same footing with all other shareholders.\n This brings us to the point of divergence.\n I dissent from the conclusion that the taxation imposed directly upon the California National by reason of its ownership of Mills National shares entitled the stockholders of the former bank to have the estimated value of the Mills shares deducted from the estimate of their California shares.\n I find no suggestion of a right to such deduction in the language of section 5219. It permits the inclusion of 'all the shares ... in the valuation of the personal property of the owner or holder of such shares,' and leaves it to the legislature of each state to determine the manner and place of taxing them, 'subject only to the two restrictions' which are particularly mentioned; and therefore, by necessary implication, free from all other restrictions.\n The opinion seems to adopt the view that to treat the Mills National shares as assets of the California National Bank amounts to imposing a 'twofold tax,' a 'double burden,' or 'two taxes' upon a single property interest. But if there are two taxes it is only because there are two banks, the stock in each of which is valued separately because the ownership is separate and distinct.\n It is said that section 5219 regards the ultimate beneficial interest and treats the interest of the stockholder and that of the bank as one. I cannot accept this view, for several reasons in addition to the implied exclusion of restrictions other than those expressly mentioned in the section.\n In the first place, the stockholder and the bank are entirely different entities, not merely in form but in sub \n\n[248 U.S. 476, 491]\n\u00a0\n stance; and this ought to be sufficient to rebut any inference that would rest upon an assumed identity in order to raise a limitation upon the already moderate scope of the scheme of taxation expressly prescribed.\n In the second place, the property interest of the stockholder is, in a most substantial sense, different from that of the bank. The bank, if taxable with respect to its property, would be taxable upon all of its assets, saving any that might be expressly exempted. But the stockholders are in no proper sense the owners of the entire assets of the bank. Their interest, so far as they have any interest in the assets as such, is only in the residue that remains after payment of all outstanding liabilities. This is capable of enjoyment in possession only in the rare event of a winding-up and liquidation of the bank's affairs. Short of this, and as is true in the particular case of the California Bank, the interest of the stockholders is almost the opposite of a property interest in the assets themselves; it being confined to a right to have those assets employed in the current operations of a going concern of which they are only part proprietors, with the right to participate at proper intervals in the gains derived therefrom. Hence, while 'book value'-that is, the excess of assets over outstanding liabilities-may be laid hold of, as it appears to have been laid hold of in this case, as a convenient mode of estimating the value of the stock interest, not only is it a matter of familiar knowledge that such an estimate is a mere approximation, but it is entirely clear that both in law and in the common experience of mankind the beneficial interest of the stockholder in the concerns of the bank is very substantially different from the beneficial interest of the bank in its assets.\n Thirdly, the distinction has been constantly recognized in the decisions of this court ever since the earliest establishment of the national banks. The court having in \n\n[248 U.S. 476, 492]\n\u00a0\n the year 1862 decided that a state tax, imposed upon a bank according to the valuation of its capital and surplus as upon the property of individual citizens, was invalid in so far as it was based upon an investment in the stocks, bonds, and securities of the United States themselves exempt from taxation by the state (Bank of Commerce v. New York City, 2 Black, 620); and having held two years later that the same rule must be applied to a state tax imposed against a bank under another statute which made banks liable to 'taxation on a valuation equal to the amount of their capital stock paid in or secured to be paid in, and their surplus earnings,' etc. (Bank Tax Case, 2 Wall. 200); the question was raised in the year 1865, in Van Allen v. Assessors, 3 Wall. 573, 584, etc., whether under section 41 of the National Bank Act of June 3, 1864 (13 Stat. 99, 112, c. 106), from which the present section 5219, Rev. Stat., is derived, a state possessed the power to authorize the taxation of shares of national banks in the hands of stockholders where the capital was wholly invested in stock and bonds of the United States. Bank of Commerce v. New York City, 2 Black, 620, and Bank Tax Case, 2 Wall. 200, were referred to as calling for a negative answer; but the court sustained the tax upon the ground of the very distinction between the stockholders and the bank that is now under consideration, the language of the opinion being (3 Wall. 583, 584):\n'The tax on the shares is not a tax on the capital of the bank. The corporation is the legal owner of all the property of the bank, real and personal; and within the powers conferred upon it by the charter, and for the purposes for which it was created, can deal with the corporate property as absolutely as a private individual can deal with his own. This is familiar law, and will be found in every work that may be opened on the subject of corporations. ... The interest of the shareholder entitles him to participate in the net profits earned \n\n[248 U.S. 476, 493]\n\u00a0\n by the bank in the employment of its capital, during the existence of its charter, in proportion to the number of his shares; and, upon its dissolution or termination, to his proportion of the property that may remain of the corporation after the payment of its debts. This is a distinct independent interest or property, held by the shareholder like any other property that may belong to him. Now, it is this interest which the act of Congress had left subject to taxation by the states, under the limitations prescribed.'\n\n In the same case, the court found in the context of the National Bank Act most cogent reasons for holding that Congress intended to permit the states to tax the entire interest of the stockholder, without regard to the character of the investments held by the bank. After referring to certain of the provisions of the act respecting the amount of the capital stock, its division into shares, and the responsibility of the shareholders for the debts of the bank, the opinion proceeds as follows (3 Wall. 587-588):\n'In view of these several provisions in which the term shares, and shareholders, are mentioned, and the clear and obvious meaning of the term in the connection in which it is found, namely, the whole of the interest in the shares and of the shareholders; when the statute provides, that nothing in this act shall be construed to prevent all the shares in any of the said associations, etc., from being included in the valuation of the personal property of any person or corporation in the assessment of taxes imposed by state authority, etc., can there be a doubt but that the term 'shares,' as used in this connection, means the same interest as when used in the other portions of the act? Take, for examples, the use of the term in the certificate of the numbers of shares in the articles of association, in the division of the capital stock into shares of one hundred dollars each; in the personal liability clause, which subjects the shareholder to an amount, and, in \n\n[248 U.S. 476, 494]\n\u00a0\n addition, to the amount invested in such shares; in the election of directors, and in deciding all questions at meetings of the stockholders, each share is entitled to one vote; in regulations of the payments of the shares subscribed; and, finally, in the list of shares kept for the inspection of the state assessors. In all these instances, it is manifest that the term as used means the entire interest of the shareholder; and it would be singular, if in the use of the term in the connection of state taxation, Congress intended a totally different meaning, without any indication of such intent. This is an answer to the argument that the term, as used here, means only the interest of the shareholder as representing the portion of the capital, if any, not invested in the bonds of the government, and that the state assessors must institute an inquiry into the investment of the capital of the bank, and ascertain what portion is invested in these bonds, and make a discrimination in the assessment of the shares. If Congress had intended any such discrimination, it would have been an easy matter to have said so. Certainly, so grave and important a change in the use of this term, if so intended, would not have been left to judicial construction. Upon the whole, after the maturest consideration which we have been able to give to this case, we are satisfied that the states possess the power to tax the whole of the interest of the shareholder in the shares held by him in these associations, within the limit prescribed by the act authorizing their organization.'\n\n This distinction between bank and shareholder has been recognized consistently in the decisions of this court from that time until the present. It will not be necessary to analyze the cases, since the principal ones (New York v. Commissioners, 4 Wall. 244, 258; National Bank v. Kentucky, 9 Wall. 353, 359; Farrington v. Tennessee, \n95 U.S. 679\n, 687; Tennessee v. Whitworth, \n117 U.S. 129\n, \n\n[248 U.S. 476, 495]\n\u00a0\n 136, 6 Sup. Ct. 645; Bank of Commerce v. Tennessee, \n161 \nU.S. 134, 146\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 456; New Orleans v. Citizens' Bank, \n167 \nU.S. 371, 402\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 905) were summarized and quoted from in the opinion of the court in Owensboro National Bank v. Owensboro, \n173 U.S. 664\n, 677-682, 19 Sup. Ct. 537, where the distinction was employed to demonstrate the substantial want of equivalency either in law or in fact between a tax on the franchise or property of the bank, such as had been imposed by the state in that case, and a tax upon the shares of stock in the names of the shareholders, permitted by section 5219, Rev. Stat. U. S.\n The solid basis of the distinction may be further emphasized by considering the practical effect of according to the stockholders of the California Bank, in the estimation of the value of their shares for the purpose of texation, a deduction of the entire value of the stock held by this bank in the Mills National. This value, according to the admitted facts, is $625,546.30, which is about 4 per cent. of $15,775,252.67, the entire estimated value of the 85,000 shares of California National stock ( excluding real estate from the computation). It is incorrect to take the latter sum as the value of all the assets of the California National. There is nothing in the record to show the value of its entire assets; but as the case comes before us as on a demurrer to plaintiff in error's own pleading, and since the $15,775,252.67 represents but the excess of its assets over its outstanding liabilities, it is reasonable to assume that the entire assets are much greater; it being evident that there must be assets to counterbalance all outstanding liabilities, including especially the amounts due to depositors. Let us take, for illustration, the very moderate assumption that plaintiff in error's total assets were four times as much as its capital and surplus or, say $63,000,000.3 Of this amount, \n\n[248 U.S. 476, 496]\n\u00a0\n the valuation of the Mills National stock is less than one per cent. In other words, applying the theory of the prevailing opinion, the fact that one per cent. of its total assets is in the form of shares in another national bank entitles its own stockholders to an abatement amounting to four times that percentage, or about 4 per cent., from the valuation of their stock-holding interest in the plaintiff in error's bank. And it is easy to see that, upon the same theory, if the shares held by one national bank in another were equal in value to the aggregate of its own shares, although constitution but a small fraction of its entire assets, its shareholders would escape taxation altogether, although participating in the profits of two banking institutions.\n As we have seen, the decisions of this court establish that under section 5219 the holder of shares in a national bank is not entitled to have the estimate of their taxable value reduced by reason of the fact that the capital and surplus of the bank are invested in securities that are exempted from state taxation. It also is clear that while the section in terms permits the real property of the bank to be taxed against it, this does not entitle the shareholder to an allowance from the assessed value of his shares by reason of the fact that the bank is thus taxed. It is true that many of the states, when authorizing the taxation of real estate against the bank, make an allowance for this by deducting the value thus taxed when computing the amount at which the shares shall be taxed; but this is not because of any requirement in the federal statute. In Commercial Bank v. Chambers, \n182 \nU.S. 556, 561\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 863, this court expressly so held with respect to a claim for a deduction from the value of national bank shares because of real estate owned by the bank situate outside of the taxing state. In People's Natl. Bank v. Marye ( C. C.) 107 Fed. 570, 579, it was held that section 5219 contemplates that the tax on real estate may be imposed independently \n\n[248 U.S. 476, 497]\n\u00a0\n of the tax upon the shares of the stockholder (affirmed upon another ground, \n191 U.S. 272\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 68). And in Amoskeag Savings Bank v. Purdy, \n231 U.S. 373\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 114, we sustained a tax imposed upon a shareholder under a statute that, while not exempting the real estate of the bank situate in the same state, allowed no deduction of its value in the computation of the taxable value of the shares.\n It seems to me that to allow a deduction from the taxable value of national bank shares because the bank happens to hold stock in another national bank is not only contrary to the clear intent of section 5219, but is inconsistent with all previous decisions of this court bearing upon the point, especially those that have denied a similar deduction because of tax-exempt securities held by the bank, or because of real estate taxed against it.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice CLARKE concur in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Nothing herein shall prevent all the shares in any association from being included in the valuation of the personal property of the owner or holder of such shares, in assessing taxes imposed by authority of the state within which the association is located; but the legislature of each state may determine and direct the manner and place of taxing all the shares of national banking associations located within the state, subject only to the two restrictions, that the taxation shall not be at a greater rate than is assessed upon other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of such state, and that the shares to any national banking association owned by nonresidents of any state shall be taxed in the city or town where the bank is located, and not elsewhere.

LOVE(1919)\n\nArgued: October 10, 1919Decided: November 10, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 603, 604]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Thos. A. Evans, of Memphis, Tenn., Edward Mayes, of Jackson, Miss., and Basil Lamar Mayes, of Oxford, Miss., for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Earle N. Floyd, of Meridian, Miss., and Robert H. Thompson, of Jackson, Miss., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A special act of the Mississippi Legislature approved March, 1872, incorporated the Bank of Oxford and authorized it to 'exercise the privilege appertaining to a general banking, exchange and brokerage business, with all the power of a body corporate.' Section 4 declares:\n'That the business of said bank shall be confided to and controlled by its stockholders under such rules of laws and regulations as said company may see fit to adopt: Provided, the same be not in conflict with the Constitution of the United States or of this state.'\n\n It was immediately organized, and has continued to carry on business under the charter so granted.\n By a comprehensive act containing 69 sections, \n\n[250 U.S. 603, 605]\n\u00a0\n approved March 9, 1914 (Laws 1914, c. 124), the Legislature prescribed general regulations concerning banking. Its scope is fairly indicated by the title, copied below. \n1\n Section 23 provides:\n'Each bank subject to the provisions of this act is hereby assessed for each year one-fortieth of one per cent. of its total assets, and the money accruing from said assessment shall be used for the maintenance of the banking department.'\n\n After paying one assessment under protest plaintiff bank, May 14, 1914, instituted this proceeding in the chancery court for Hinds county. The original bill sets up and relies upon the charter of 1872 as a contract, protected by the federal Constitution, which by confiding control to stockholders excludes legislative authority in respect thereto. It alleges:\n'That the said bank examiners are threatening to interfere with the affairs of this bank and to exercise such powers as are provided for by said statute [of 1914] over this bank, and are threatening t o \n\n[250 U.S. 603, 606]\n\u00a0\n make such examinations and reports upon and about, and to exercise all the other authorities and powers provided for by such statute, over the affairs of your orator, said bank. And your orator pleads hereby, and invokes for such, its contract immunity from such supervision and control, the said contract clause of the Constitution of the United States, and claims its right exclusively to control and manage the affairs of its own bank.'\n\n And further:\n'Your orator protests and shows that it was not subject to the provisions of said banking law, and by its said contract charter, the whole scheme so devised, as applied to your orator bank, was unconstitutional and void; and your orator shows that for such reason it was not subject to assessment devised and contrived only for the purpose of maintaining such bank department; and your orator was protected against the payment of such assessment, also, by the said contract clause of the Constitution of the United States.'\n\n The prayer is for an injunction perpetually restraining defendants and their successors from examining or undertaking to enforce as against the complainant any provision contained in the act of March 9, 1914, and for a decree requiring repayment of the sum assessed and paid under protest.\n No argument is required to show that the charter of 1872 constitutes a contract protected by the federal Constitution. But the construction placed upon section 4 by counsel for plaintiffs in error is not tenable. It really contains nothing which purports to take away commonly recognized power of the state to establish such reasonable and general regulations of banks as may be essential to public safety, and to enforce them through a board supported by moderate assessments upon those engaging in the business.\n While the bill proceeds upon the theory that the bank's affairs are wholly exempt from interference by legislative direction, the only past or immediately probable wrongs \n\n[250 U.S. 603, 607]\n\u00a0\n adequately complained of are enforced contribution to expense of the banking department and threats by defendants to make examinations and reports. And we think it clear that no impairment of the corporate charter has or will result from reasonable examinations and reports by duly authorized officers and the small prescribed payments. It is unnecessary to consider other distinct provisions of the statute, and, of course, we intimate no opinion concerning them.\n The Supreme Court of the state affirmed a decree of the chancery court dismissing the bill upon demurrer, and its action must be\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'An act establishing a banking department for the state of Mississippi, creating a board of bank commissioners, prescribing their qualifications, duties and compensation, providing for the election of state bank examiners, prescribing their qualifications, duties and compensation, defining what shall constitute a bank and banking business in the state of Mississippi fixing the capital required to do a banking business, and providing for the examination, regulation and control of banks and banking business conducted by corporations, other than national banks and postal savings banks and fixing the assessment for the revenues of the department, fixing qualifications and liability of officers, stockholders and directors of banking corporations; fixing the qualifications and liability of persons, firms and corporations in the banking business; providing for the payment of deposits to minors and other persons under disability and on joint account; prohibiting banking except under the provisions of this act; providing for the liquidation of banks and the distribution of the assets thereof; providing for giving publicity to deposits more than five years old; and prescribing penalties for the breach of any of the provisions thereof, and to provide a system for guaranteeing deposits, and for other purposes, without expense to the state.' \n\n\n\n\n","15":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBARBOUR v. STATE OF GA.(1919)\nNo. 191\nArgued: Decided: April 14, 1919\n\n\n\n Messrs. A. A. Lawrence and W. W. Osborne, both of Savannah, Ga., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[249 U.S. 454, 457]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Clifford Walker, of Monroe, Ga., for the State of Georgia.\n\n\n[249 U.S. 454, 458]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Georgia prohibitory liquor law was approved November 18, 1915, but, by its terms, did not become effective \n\n[249 U.S. 454, 459]\n\u00a0\n until May 1, 1916. Under it Barbour was convicted for having in his possession on June 10, 1916, more than one gallon of vinous liquor. Georgia Laws, Extraordinary Session 1915, part 1, title 2, No. 4,  16 and 30, pp. 90, 99, 105. He asserted that the liquor had been acquired by him before May 1st, and contended that the statute, if construed to apply to liquor so acquired, was void under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court of the state overruled this contention and affirmed the sentence. 146 Ga. 667, 92 S. E. 70. The case comes here on writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code.\n That a state which has enacted a prohibitory law may forbid the mere possession of liquor within its borders was decided in Crane v. Campbell, \n245 U.S. 304\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 98; but it did not appear there when the liquor had been acquired. Whether the prohibition of sale may be constitutionally applied to liquor acquired before the enactment of the statute was raised in Bartemeyer v. Iowa, 18 Wall. 129, and Beer Co. v. Massachusetts, \n97 \nU.S. 25, 32\n, 33 S., but was not decided. The question presented here, however, is simpler. For the exact date when Barbour acquired the liquor is not shown; and we must assume, as the Supreme Court of Georgia did, that it was acquired during the period of five months and twelve days between the enactment of the law and the date when it became effective. Does the Fourteenth Amendment, by its guaranty to property, prevent a state from protecting its citizens from liquor so acquired?\n A state, having the power to forbid the manufacture, sale, and possession of liquor within its borders, may, if it concludes to exercise the power, obviously postpone the date when the prohibition shall become effective, in order that those engaged in the business and others may adjust themselves to the new conditions. Whoever acquires, after the enactment of the statute, property thus declared noxious, takes it with full notice of its infirmity and that \n\n[249 U.S. 454, 460]\n\u00a0\n after a day certain its possession will, by mere lapse of time, become a crime. It is well settled that the federal Constitution does not enable one to stay the exercise of a state's police power by entering into a contract under such circumstances. Diamond Glue Co. v. United States Glue Co., \n187 \nU.S. 611, 615\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 206. Compare Calder v. Michigan, \n218 \nU.S. 591, 599\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 122. Nor can he do so by acquiring property.\n The defendant raised, in his amended motion for a new trial, the further objection that the law was unconstitutional as applied to him, because the liquor had been acquired before the statute was enacted; but the trial judge denied the motion and declined to approve any of the grounds on which it was based. In accordance with the state practice its Supreme Court therefore refused to consider the point. Dickens v. State, 137 Ga. 523, 73 S. E. 826; Harris v. State, 120 Ga. 196, 197, 47 S. E. 573. Consequently the question is not before us (Louisville & Nashville Railroad Co. v. Woodford, \n234 \nU.S. 46, 51\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 739), and on it we express no opinion.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","16":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBARRETT v. VIRGINIAN R.

Hall, both of Roanoke, Va., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Claiming under the federal Employers' Liability Act (Act Ar il 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65 [Comp. St.  8657-8665]), petitioner sued the Virginian Railway Company in the United States District Court, Western District of Virginia, for damages on account of personal injuries suffered by him July 27, 1915\n\n\n At conclusion of the testimony the railway company moved for a directed verdict; after consideration the trial judge read to counsel an opinion giving reasons and announced his purpose to grant the motion.\n'And thereupon the plaintiff, by counsel, moved the court to be permitted to take a voluntary nonsuit, which motion was opposed by counsel for defendant. And as the court is of opinion that the motion comes too late, it is overruled, and to this action of the court the plaintiff, by counsel, excepted. And thereupon the court directed the jury to find a verdict for the defendant, and to this action of the court the plaintiff, by counsel, excepted. And thereupon the jury rendered and returned the following verdict: 'We, the jury, by direction of the court, find for the defendant.\"\n\n Judgment thereon was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 244 Fed. 397, 157 C. C. A. 23. Petitioner there urged that the trial court erred (1) in directing a verdict for the defendant, and (2) in denying the plaintiff's request to take a voluntary nonsuit. Both claims were denied and are renewed here. \n\n[250 U.S. 473, 475]\n\u00a0\n We think refusal to permit the requested nonsuit was error and for that reason the judgment below must be reversed. This makes it unnecessary to consider the other point.\n The Act of June 1, 1872-the Conformity Act (R. S.  914, c. 255,  5, 17 Stat. 197 [Comp. St.  1537])-provides:\n'The practice, pleadings, and forms and modes of proceeding in civil causes, other than equity and admiralty causes, in the Circuit and District Courts, shall conform, as near as may be, to the practice, pleadings, and forms and modes of proceedings existing at the time in like causes in the courts of record of the state within which such Circuit or District Courts are held, any rule of court to the contrary notwithstanding.'\n\n Construing the statute in Nudd et al. v. Burrows, Assignee (1875) \n91 \nU.S. 426, 441\n, 442 S. (23 L. Ed. 286), this court said:\n'The purpose of the provision is apparent upon its face. No analysis is necessary to reach it. It was to bring about uniformity in the law of procedure in the federal and state courts of the same locality. It had its origin in the Code enactments of many of the states. While in the federal tribunals the common-law pleadings, forms, and practice were adhered to, in the state courts of the same district the simpler forms of the local Code prevailed. This involved the necessity on the part of the bar of studying two distinct systems of remedial law, and of practicing according to the wholly dissimilar requirements of both. The inconvenience of such a state of things is obvious. The evil was a serious one. It was the aim of the provision in question to remove it. This was done by bringing about the conformity in the courts of the United States which it prescribes. The remedy was complete. The personal administration by the judge of his duties while sitting upon the bench was not complained of. ... The personal conduct and administration of the judge in the discharge of his separate functions is, in our judgment, \n\n[250 U.S. 473, 476]\n\u00a0\n neither practice, pleading, nor a form nor mode of proceeding within the meaning of those terms as found in the context.'\n\n See, also, Indianapolis & St. Louis R. R. Co. v. Horst, \n93 U.S. 291\n, 300.\n'It is now a settled rule in the courts of the United States that whenever, in the trial of a civil case, it is clear that the state of the evidence is such as not to warrant a verdict for a party, and that if such a verdict were rendered the other party would be entitled to a new trial, it is the right and duty of the judge to direct the jury to find according to the views of the court. Such is the constant practice, and it is a convenient one. It saves time and expense. It gives scin tific certainty to the law in its application to the facts and promotes the ends of justice.'

When and how it may be asserted we think are questions relating directly to practice and mode of proceeding within intendment of the Conformity Act.\n Section 3387 Virginia Code (1904) provides:\n'A party shall not be allowed to suffer a nonsuit, unless he do so before the jury retire from the bar.'\n\n Prior to this provision, a plaintiff there had the absolute right to take a \n\n[250 U.S. 473, 477]\n\u00a0\n voluntary nonsuit at any time before verdict. Harrison v. Clemens, 112 Va. 371, 373, 71 S. E. 538. Chapter 27, Va. Acts 1912, directs:\n'That in no action tried before a jury shall the trial judge give to the jury a peremptory instruction directing what verdict the jury shall render.'\n\n And chapter 42, Idem, provides:\n'In all suits or motions hereafter, when the evidence is concluded before the court and jury, the party tendering the demurrer to evidence shall state in writing specifically the grounds of demurrer relied on, and the demurree shall not be forced to join in the said demurrer until the specific grounds upon which the demurrant relies are stated in writing; nor shall any grounds of demurrer not thus specifically stated be considered, except that the court may, in its discretion, allow the demurrant to withdraw the demurrer; may allow the joinder in demurrer to be withdrawn by the demurree, and new evidence admitted, or a nonsuit to be taken until the jury retire from the bar.'\n\n Citing Parks v. Ross, 11 How. 362, 373, and Richardson v. City of Boston, 19 How. 263 (see also Schuchardt v. Allen, 1 Wall. 359, 370), petitioner maintains that in the federal courts the practice of directing verdicts has superseded the demurrer to evidence and should be controlled by the same general principles. Therefore, it is said, the statutory rule which gives the judge discretion to allow or refuse a nonsuit after joinder in such a demurrer applies when there is a motion for directed verdict.\n Obviously the laws of Virginia recognize a marked distinction between demurrer to evidence and direction of a verdict-the former is permitted; the latter is expressly prohibited. And the different nature and effect of the two things has been pointed out in Oscanyan v. Arms Co., supra, \n103 U.S. 264\n; Central Transportation Co. v. Pullman's Palace Car Co., \n139 U.S. 39\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 478; and Slocum v. New York Life Insurance Co., \n228 \nU.S. 364, 388\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 523, Ann. Cas. 1914D, 1029. The conclusion announced in Parks v. Southern Ry. Co., 143 \n\n[250 U.S. 473, 478]\n\u00a0\n Fed. 276, 277, 74 C. C. A. 414, that, because federal courts may in proper cases direct verdicts, therefore, in the exercise of sound discretion, they may deny an application for leave to take a nonsuit and direct verdict for defendant, is not well foundd .\n Under the Virginia statute, in the absence of a demurrer to the evidence and joinder therein, the plaintiff may take a nonsuit at any time before submission of the case to the jury and their retirement. The conformity statute gives the same right in federal courts. This conclusion accords with opinions by the Circuit Courts of Appeals for the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Circuits. Knight v.

Sullivan and Timothy Ansberry, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant and plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Alexander Britton and H. W. Van Dyke, both of Washington, D. C., for appellees and defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit for the specific performance of an alleged contract to sell land. The court of first instance made a \n\n[249 U.S. 554, 555]\n\u00a0\n decree for the plaintiff, but the decree was reversed by the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands and the defendants were absolved from the complaint. There is a motion to dismiss, on the ground that the writ of error and citation were not made returnable in time. But without going into particulars, as the appellant had color of authority from the court and a judge of that court, it appears to us that justice will be better served by dealing with the merits of the case. See Southern Pine Co. v. Ward, \n208 \nU.S. 126, 137\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 239.\n On the merits the only question is whether the alleged contract was made. The first material step was the following offer, dated December 4, 1911:\n'Mr. W. Borck, Real Estate Agent, Manila, P. I.-Sir: In compliance with your request I herewith give you an option for three months to buy the property of Mr. Benito Legarda, known as the Nagtahan hacienda, situated in the district of Sampaloc, Manila, and consisting of about 1, 993,000 square meters of land, for the price of its assessed government valuation. B. Valdes.'\n\n There is no dispute that the assessed government valuation was 307, 000 pesos, that Legarda owned the land and that Valdes had power to make the offer. On January 17, 1912, Borck wrote to Valdes:\n'In reference to our negotiations regarding' the property in question, 'I offer to purchase said property for the sum of three hundred and seven thousand (307,000.00) pesos, Ph. C., cash, net to you, payable the first day of May 1912, or before and with delivery of a torrens title free of all encumbrances as taxes and other debts.'\n\n There was dispute about the admissibility of this letter and its being signed, but we see no occasion to disturb the opinion of the Supreme Court that it was a part of the transaction and was admissible. No answer was received, and on January 19 Borck wrote again, saying that he was ready to purchase the property at the price and that full payment would be made on or before \n\n[249 U.S. 554, 556]\n\u00a0\n March 3, provided all documents in connection with the hacienda were immediately placed at his disposal and found in good order. On January 23, Borck wrote again that he could improve the condition of payment and would pay ten days after the documents had been put at his disposal for inspection, etc., and finally, on February 28, wrote that the price was ready to be paid over and requesting notice when it was convenient to allow inspection of all papers. Before this last letter was written Valdes had indicated that he regarded compliance as an open question by saying in conversation that he wished to communicate with Mr. Legarda. Subsequently conveyance was refused.\n The letter of January 17 plainly departed from the terms of the offer as to the time of payment and was, as it was expressed to be, a counter offer. In the language of a similar English case:\n'The plaintiff made an offer of his own ... and he thereby rejected the offer previously made by the defendant. ... It was not afterwards competent for him to revive the proposal of the defendant, by tendering an acceptance of it.' Hyde v. Wrench, 3 Beavan, 334; Langdell, Cont.  18.\n\n We do not find it necessary to go into the discussion of the later communications, which led the Supreme Court to the conclusion that they also would not have been sufficient. The right to hold the defendant to the proposed terms by a word of assent was gone, and after that all that the plaintiff could do was to make an offer in his turn. It would need a very much stronger case than this to induce us to reverse the decision of the court below. Cardona v. Quinones, \n240 \nU.S. 83, 88\n, 36 S. Sup.

CITY OF NEW YORK(1919)\nNo. 315\nArgued: April 22, 1919Decided: June 2, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 321, 322]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Leon Abbett, of Hoboken, N. J., and Charles K. Allen, of New York City, for appellant.\n Mr. Terence Farley, of New York City, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1874 commissioners theretofore appointed by special act (Laws N. Y. 1871, c. 765) to improve the streets of Long Island City were directed to improve a particular district. Laws N. Y. 1874, c. 326. The act provided that the cost of the improvement should be assessed upon the land benefited and created a lien upon the land for the assessment and interest; but it declared that no sale for failure to pay the assessment could be made before the expiration of ten years after filing of the assessment roll. The improvement was to be paid for by delivering to the contractors interest-bearing certificates of indebtedness equal, at par, to the expense of the work and materials furnished. These certificates did not provide \n\n[250 U.S. 321, 323]\n\u00a0\n for a personal obligation on the part of the city or the district. They were receivable in payment of assessments at par and interest and were payable in cash only out of moneys to be derived from the assessments, which the city treasurer was directed to keep as an improvement fund separate from all other funds. The statute further provided that upon the completion of the sales for nonpayment of assessments 'all the certificates issued by the said commissioners shall be paid off, and if there be any excess to the credit of said improvement fund ... it shall be paid into the city treasury.' By an amendment passed June 11, 1879 ( Laws N. Y. 1879, c. 501), it was provided that, under certain circumstances, it was the duty of the officer making sale of land for nonpayment of assessment to receive in payment of the purchase price, certificates at par and interest.\n Certificates were issued to the amount of $1,847,500. A large portion of the assessments levied were left unpaid by the landowners; and it became necessary to sell the properties. Sales for nonpayment of assessments were made in 1888. The purchase price was paid in certificates at par and interest up to the amount of the assessments, the interest and the excess, if any, being paid in cash. In 1892 and 1893 sales of land were made at much less than the amounts of the assessment. Here also bidders were permitted to pay the purchase price in certificates at par and interest. Likewise the owners of lots sold were permitted to redeem lots upon paying the amount of the bid and accrued charges by certificates at par and interest. After all the land had been disposed of and the improvement fund exhausted there remained and are now outstanding unpaid certificates aggregating about $300,000.\n Prior to June 11, 1879, Benedict acquired certificates to the amount of $8,000 which he has held ever since, and on which the principal and interest are unpaid. In July, \n\n[250 U.S. 321, 324]\n\u00a0\n 1910, suing on behalf of himself and others similarly situated, he brought this suit in the Circuit (now District) Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York to enforce, as upon an express trust, an accounting of the improvement fund and liability for alleged breaches of trust. The contention is that Long Island City became trustee of the lien on the several lots for the benefit of the certificate holders; and the alleged breaches of trust relied upon are in substance that, through its treasurer and in spite of the protest, the city permitted and authorized sales of land for e  than the assessment in violation of the act of 1874; that instead of canceling certificates received in payment of assessments and of the purchase price at sales, it reissued the same; and that even where sales had been made for less than the amount of the assessments it allowed redemption from sales in certificates at par and interest. The City of New York is made defendant on the ground that in 1898 Long Island City was merged into it by the Greater New York Act and that the consolidated corporation assumed the obligations and liabilities of the constituent municipalities. Laws N. Y. 1897, c. 378.\n Protest was made by plaintiff at time of sales against the course pursued by the treasurer, but he justified the action complained of, relying upon act of 1874 and chapter 501 of the Laws of 1879 and chapter 656 of the Laws of 1886. Writs of mandamus had previously been issued compelling him to receive certificates at par and interest even in payment for the redemption of land sold for nonpayment of assessments. People ex rel.

But plaintiff contended that, in view of section 23 of title VI of chapter 461 of the Laws of 1871, if the acts of 1879 and 1886 were construed as authorizing the action of which he complains, they impair, in violation of the \n\n[250 U.S. 321, 325]\n\u00a0\n federal Constitution, the obligation of contracts previously entered into with certificate holders. The case was fully heard in the District Court on evidence, and several distinct defenses were relied upon. The city insisted, among other things, that the statutory lien did not impose a statutory trust upon it; that the persons who acted were not its agents, but independent officers, agents of the state; that the specific provision of the statute relied upon by plaintiff did not constitute terms of the contract but related merely to the remedy; and that the later legislation introduced at most permissible changes of remedy. The court without passing upon these questions, entered a decree dismissing the bill on the ground that the statute of limitations and laches constituted a complete defense. 235 Fed. 258. This decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals on the same grounds. 247 Fed. 758, 159 C. C. A. 616. Benedict is a citizen of Connecticut; but as he invoked the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court not only on the ground of diversity of citizenship, but also because of rights asserted under the federal Constitution, his further appeal to this court was permissible. Vicksburg v. Henson, \n231 \nU.S. 259, 267\n, 268 S., 34 Sup. Ct. 95.\n The whole case is here for review; but we find it unnecessary to decide most of the questions presented, because we are of opinion that the lower courts did not err in holding that the suit was barred by laches. None of the acts relied upon here as constituting breaches of trust occurred later than the years 1892 and 1893. Before the principal action complained of was taken, the city treasurer publicy announced his purpose to pursue the course complained of, which he asserted was in accordance with law. Plaintiff was represented at the sales by an agent who protested there orally and elsewhere in writing against the treasurer's declared purpose and against specific acts now complained of, asserting then \n\n[250 U.S. 321, 326]\n\u00a0\n as now that the course pursued was illegal. We have here a definite repudiation of the alleged trust duties more than 17 years before the institution of this suit. And there are no circumstances which excuse the delay. What occurred in the interval, so far as appears, was this:\n\n\n (a)\n In June, 1893, Benedict commenced in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of New York a bill in equity to restrain the treasurer from receiving certificates from property owners when redeeming their properties from assessment sales, made to the complainant, and from marking upon the books as paid any asses ment upon such property when it was sold for less than the amount of the assessment. It seems that hearing on the motion was adjourned to a later date, and that a restraining order issued which the plaintiff alleges was never observed. It is not shown that any other proceeding was ever taken in the suit.\n\n\n (b)\n On May 9, 1904 (at whose instance does not clearly appear), the Legislature enacted a statute (Laws N. Y. 1904, c. 686) entitled 'An act to authorize the comptroller and corporation counsel of the city of New York on behalf of said city to compromise and settle with property owners interested, certain claims for taxes, assessments and sales for the same, and for or on account of evidences of indebtedness issued on account of local improvements in the territory formerly included within the boundaries of Long Island City.'\n\n\n (c)\n On February 21, 1905, plaintiff filed with the comptroller of the city of New York an offer to sell to the city by way of compromise certificates held.\n\n\n (d)\n On May 26, 1909, plaintiff's present counsel, acting on behalf of the holders of 283 certificates, presented to the comptroller a memorial and statement of facts, in which he requested 'that provision should be made in some way for the payment of the amount due' on the certificates. \n\n[250 U.S. 321, 327]\n\u00a0\n (e) Under date of March 19, 1910, plaintiff presented to the comptroller a similar memorial which he requested should be submitted for determination to the board of estimate and apportionment, in view of the fact that chapter 601 of the Laws of New York of 1907 provided that the comptroller may do so where he believes that, for any reason, a claim against the city is not valid legally, but in equity, justice, and fairness the same should be paid, the city having been benefited by the acts performed and the claim not being barred by the statute of limitations.\n\n\n (f)\n On April 26, 1910, a formal request was made upon the deputy comptroller.\n Under the law of New York the alleged cause of action would have been subject, if not to the six-year statute of limitations (New York Code of Civil Procedure,  382), then to the ten-year statute of limitations (New York Code of Civil Procedure,  388), governing bills for relief in case of the existence of a trust not cognizable by the courts of common law. Clarke v. Boorman's Executors, 18 Wall. 493. If the act of 1874 created an express trust, the statute of limitations would not begin to run until there had been a repudiation of the trust. New Orleans v. Warner, \n175 \nU.S. 120, 130\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 44. Here there was an open repudiation of the trust duties which the plaintiff now seeks to enforce. And 17 years were allowed to elapse after that repudiation before this suit was begun and more than ten years before any attempt was made to secure some settlement by negotiation; and there clearly was no waiver of the statute. While it is true that federal courts sitting in equity are not bound by state statutes of limiations (Kirby v. Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Railroad, \n120 U.S. 130\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 430), they are under ordinary circumstances, guided by them in determining their action on stale claims (Godden v. Kimmell, \n99 U.S. 201\n, 210; Philippi v. Philippe, \n115 U.S. 151\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 1181; Pearsall v. Smith, 149 \n\n[250 U.S. 321, 328]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 231, 13 Sup. Ct. 833; Alsop v. Riker, \n155 U.S. 448\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 162). Compare Sullivan v. Portland & Kennebec Railroad Co., \n94 U.S. 806\n, 811. Between 1892 and 1905 plaintiff did nothing to enforce his alleged rights except to commence in 1893 a suit which he did not prosecute. His lack of diligence is wholly unexcused; and both the nature of the claim and the situation of the parties was such as to call for diligence. The lower courts did not err in sustaining the defense of laches.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Reported in full in the New York Supplement; reported as a memorandum decision without opinion in 55 Hun, 61. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Reported in full in the New York Supplement; reported as a memorandum decision without opinion in 58 Hun, 609, 59 Hun, 618. \n\n\n\n\n","19":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBERKMAN v.

S. Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  1383), which specifies the compensation to be taxed and allowed to clerks of District Courts, among other things provides:\n'For receiving, keeping, and paying out money, in pursuance \n\n[250 U.S. 114, 117]\n\u00a0\n of any statute or order of court, one per centum on the amount so received, kept, and paid.'\n\n In each of the criminal causes entitled The United States v. Emma Goldman and the United States v. Alexander Berkman, some days subsequent to defendants' arrest (June, 1917), evidently upon applications in their behalf consented to by the District Attorney, the court below directed:\n'That the sum of $25,000 cash, be deposited in the registry of this court in lieu and place of bail for the appearance of the above-named defendant before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, in accordance with the provisions of the recognizance to be given by said defendant.'\n\n Defendants were afterwards convicted and sentenced to imprisonment.\n Upon motions duly presented the clerk was afterwards directed to pay to defendants' counsel funds deposited under the above orders, less costs. He retained 1 per centum as compensation, and the court refused to declare this sum unlawfully withheld and direct its return. The matter is here by writ of error to the District Court.\n It is now maintained that section 828 does not apply to criminal cases. Further, that if construed to be applicable where cash is deposited in lieu of bail for appearance of one charged with crime, it conflicts with the federal Constitution, Fifth Amendment, 'No person shall ... be deprived of ... liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation;' also with article 4,  2, cl. 1, 'The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states;' and with the Eighth Amendment, 'Excessive bail shall not be required.'\n Our jurisdiction depends upon whether the case really and substantially involves the constitutionality of the section in question as construed and applied. Judicial \n\n[250 U.S. 114, 118]\n\u00a0\n Code,  238 (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1157 [Comp. St.  1215]); Rakes v. United States, \n212 \nU.S. 55, 58\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 244; Lamar v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 60, 65\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 255. And we deem it too clear for serious discussion that, as enforced below, the statute deprived plaintiffs in error of no right guaranteed by any of the constitutional provisions relied upon. With full knowledge they voluntarily asked to deposit money with the clerk, and later requested that he be required to pay it out. Having thus obtained his services, they now deny his claim for compensation. Obviously, nothing was taken from them without due process of law; their property was not taken for public use; they were not deprived of any privilege or immunity enjoyed by citizens of other states; and the record reveals no relation between the contested charge and any excessive bail. We think the suggested constitutional questions are wholly wanting in merit and too insubstantial to support our jurisdiction. Brolan v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 216, 218\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 285.

U S(1919)\nNo. 763\nArgued: January 28, 1919Decided: June 2, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 273, 274]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Martin W.

The writs bring up final orders adjudging plaintiffs in error guilty of contempt of court because of their refusal to obey an order directing them to answer certain questions asked of them before a federal grand jury, and committing them to the custody of the United States marshal until they should comply. the appeals bring under review final orders discharging writs of habeas corpus sued out by appellants to review their detention under the original orders of commitment and remanding them to the custody of the marshal. Blair, Templeton, and Phillips are plaintiffs in error, as well as appellants.\n It appears that in October, 1918, the federal grand jury of the Southern district of New York was making inquiry concerning supposed violations of section 125 of the Criminal Code (Act March 4, 1909, c. 321, 35 Stat. 1111 [Comp. St.  10295]) (relating to perjury) and of the so- called Corrupt Practices Act of June 25, 1910, ch. 392, 36 Stat. 822, as amended (Comp. St.  188-198), in connection with the verification and filing in that district of reports to the Secretary of the Senate of the Unite States made by a candidate for nomination as Senator at a primary election held in the state of Michigan on August 27, 1918. Phillips was served with a subpoena requiring him to appear and testify before this grand jury. Blair and Templeton \n\n[250 U.S. 273, 277]\n\u00a0\n were subpoenaed to appear and testify and also to produce certain records, correspondence, and other documentary evidence. All were served in the state of Michigan. They appeared before the grand jury in response to the subpoenas, were severally sworn, and were examined by counsel for the United States. Each witness, after answering preliminary questions, asked that he be informed of the object and purpose of the inquiry and against whom it was directed, whereupon he was informed by counsel for the United States that the inquiry was not directed against him (the witness). After this each witness read to and left with the grand jury a typewritten statement to the effect that upon advice of counsel he refused to answer any questions pertaining to the matter under inquiry, for the reason that the grand jury and the court were without jurisdiction to inquire into the conduct of a campaign in Michigan for the primary election of a United States Senator; that the federal Corrupt Practices Act as amended was unconstitutional; and that no federal court or grand jury in any state had constitutional authority to conduct an inquiry regarding a primary election for United States Senator. Thereupon each witness was asked by counsel for the United States whether he refused to testify for the reason that to do so would incriminate him, to which he made no other answer than to refer to the reasons for his refusal as set forth in his statement.\n The grand jury made a written presentment of these facts to the district court, with a prayer that the parties named might be dealt with as contumacious witnesses.\n Upon the coming in of the presentment the witnesses appeared in person and by counsel in opposition to the petition of the grand jury and contended that the Corrupt Practices Act as amended was unconstitutional and void, referring to the opinion of this court in United States v. Gradwell, \n243 \nU.S. 476, 487\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 407. A hearing was had which \n\n[250 U.S. 273, 278]\n\u00a0\n went to the merits; the minutes of the grand jury were read and made a part of the presentment; and the matter was fully argued.A t the conclusion of the hearing the court directed the witnesses to answer the questions propounded to them before the grand jury. They were again called, were asked the same questions, and again refused to answer for the same reasons before assigned. The grand jury immediately made a further presentment, whereupon the court, after hearing the parties, adjudged appellants guilty of contempt because of their refusal to comply with the order of the court, and remanded them to the custody of the marshal until they should comply.\n Being in his custody, each of them presented to the District Court a petition for a writ of habeas corpus; the writ was allowed, returnable forthwith; and the United States district attorney, in behalf of the marshal, made a motion to dismiss the writ, in effect a demurrer to the petition for insufficiency. After hearing, the court discharged the writ and remanded each of the petitioners to the custody of the marshal (253 Fed. 800); and the present writs of error and appeals were allowed.\n The principal contention is that the Act of June 25, 1910, chapter 392, 36 Stat. 822, and its amendments (Act of August 19, 1911, c. 33, 37 Stat. 25; Act of Aug. 23, 1912, c. 349, 37 Stat. 360) are unconstitutional in so far as they attempt to regulate and control the selection by political parties at primary elections of candidates for United States Senator to be voted for at the general elections: it being insisted that the authority of Congress under section 4 of article 1 of the Constitution extends only to the definitive general election, and not to pre-election arrangements or devices such as nominating conventions and primaries.\n It is maintained further that, because of the invalidity of these statutes, neither the United States District Court \n\n[250 U.S. 273, 279]\n\u00a0\n nor the federal grand jury has jurisdiction to inquire into primary elections or to indict or try any person for an offense based upon the statutes, and therefore the order committing appellants is null and void.\n The same constitutional question was stirred in United States v. Gradwell, \n243 \nU.S. 476, 487\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 407, but its determination was unnecessary for the decision of the case, and for this reason it was left undetermined, as the opinion states. Considerations of propriety, as well as long-established practice, demand that we refrain from passing upon the constitutionality of an act of Congress unless obliged to do so in the proper performance of our judicial function, when the question is raised by a party whose interests entitle him to raise it.\n We do not think the present parties are so entitled, since a brief consideration of the relation of a witness to the proceeding in which he is called will suffice to show that he is not interested to challenge the jurisdiction of court or grand jury over the subject-matter that is under inquiry.\n Long before the separation of the American Colonies from the mother country, compulsion of witnesses to appear and testify had become established in England. By Act of 5 Eliz. c. 9,  12 (1562), provision was made for the service of process out of any court of record, requiring the person served to testify concerning any cause or matter pending in the court, under a penalty of 10, besides damages to be recovered by the party aggrieved. See Havithbury v. Harvey, Cro. Eliz. 131; 1 Leon. 122; Goodwin (or Goodman) v. West, Cro. Car. 522, 540, March 18. When it was that grand juries first resorted to compulsory process for witnesses is not clear. But as early as 1612, in the Countess of Shrewsbury's Case, Lord Bacon is reported to have declared that--\n'All subjects, without distinction of degrees, owe to the King tribute and service, not only of their deed \n\n[250 U.S. 273, 280]\n\u00a0\n and hand, but of their knowledge and discovery.' 2 How. St. Tr. 769, 778.\n\n And by Act of 7 & 8 Wm. III, c. 3,  7 (1695), parties indicted for treason or misprision of treason were given the like process to compel their witnesses to appear as was usually granted o compel witnesses to appear against them, clearly evincing that process for crown witnesses was already in familiar use.\n At the foundation of our federal government the inquisitorial function of the grand jury and the compulsion of witnesses were recognized as incidents of the judicial power of the United States. By the Fifth Amendment a presentment or indictment by grand jury was made essential to hold one to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime, and it was declared that no person should be compelled in a criminal case to be a witness against himself; while, by the Sixth Amendment, in all criminal prosecutions the accused was given the right to a speedy and public trial, with compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor. By the first Judiciary Act (September 24, 1789, c. 20,  30, 1 Stat. 73, 88), the mode of proof by examination of witnesses in the courts of the United States was regulated, and their duty to appear and testify was recognized. These provisions, as modified by subsequent legislation, are found in sections 861-865, Rev. Stat. (Comp. St.  1468, 1470, 1472-1474). By Act of March 2, 1793, c. 22,  6, 1 Stat. 333, 335 (Comp. St.  1487), it was enacted that subpoenas for witnesses required to attend a court of the United States in any district might run into any other district, with a proviso limiting the effect of this in civil causes so that witnesses living outside of the district in which the court was held need not attend beyond a limited distance from the place of their residence. See section 876, Rev. Stat. (Comp. St.  1487). By section 877 (section 1488), originating in Act of Feb. 26, 1853 (chapter 80,  3, 10 Stat. 161, 169), witnesses required to attend any term of the district court on the part of the United States may be subpoenaed poenaed to attend to testify \n\n[250 U.S. 273, 281]\n\u00a0\n generally; and under such process they shall appear before the grand or petit jury, or both, as required by the court or the district attorney. By the same Act of 1853 (10 Stat. 167, 168), fees for the attendance and mileage of witnesses were regulated; and it was provided that where the United States was a party the marshal on the order of the court should pay such fees. Rev. Stat.  848, 855 (Comp. St.  1452, 1461). And sections 879 and 881, Rev. Stat. (Comp. St.  1490, 1492), contain provisions for requiring witnesses in criminal proceedings to give recognizance for their appearance to testify, and for detaining them in prison in default of such recognizance.\n In all of these provisions, as in the general law upon the subject, it is clearly recognized that the giving of testimony and the attendance upon court or grand jury in order to testify are public duties which every person within the jurisdiction of the government is bound to perform upon being properly summoned, and for performance of which he is entitled to no further compensation than that which the statutes provide. The personal sacrifice involved is a part of the necessary contribution of the individual to the welfare of the public. The duty, so onerous at times, yet so necessary to the administration of justice according to the forms and modes established in our system of government (Wilson v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 361, 372\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 538, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 558, quoting Lord Ellenborough), is subject to mitigation in exceptional circumstances; there is a constitutional exemption from being compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against oneself, entitling the witness to be excused from answering anything that will tend to incriminate him ( see Brown v. Walker, \n161 U.S. 591\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 644); some confidential matters are shielded from considerations of policy, and perhaps in other cases for special reasons a witness may be excused from telling all that he knows.\n But, aside from exceptions and qualifications-and \n\n[250 U.S. 273, 282]\n\u00a0\n none such is asserted in the present case-the witness is bound not only to attend but to tell what he knows in answert o questions framed for the purpose of bringing out the truth of the matter under inquiry.\n He is not entitled to urge objections of incompetency or irrelevancy, such as a party might raise, for this is no concern of his. Nelson v. United States, \n201 \nU.S. 92, 115\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 358.\n On familiar principles, he is not entitled to challenge the authority of the court or of the grand jury, provided they have a de facto existence and organization.\n He is not entitled to set limits to the investigation that the grand jury may conduct. The Fifth Amendment and the statutes relative to the organization of grand juries recognize such a jury as being possessed of the same powers that pertained to its British prototype, and in our system examination of witnesses by a grand jury need not be preceded by a formal charge against a particular individual. Hale v. Henkel, \n201 \nU.S. 43, 65\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 370. It is a grand inquest, a body with powers of investigation and inquisition, the scope of whose inquiries is not to be limited narrowly by questions of propriety or forecasts of the probable result of the investigation, or by doubts whether any particular individual will be found properly subject to an accusation of crime. As has been said before, the identity of the offender, and the precise nature of the offense, if there be one, normally are developed at the conclusion of the grand jury's labors, not at the beginning. Hendricks v. United States, \n223 \nU.S. 178, 184\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 313.\n And, for the same reasons, witnesses are not entitled to take exception to the jurisdiction of the grand jury or the court over the particular subject-matter that is under investigation. In truth it is in the ordinary case no concern of one summoned as a witness whether the offense is within the jurisdiction of the court or not. At \n\n[250 U.S. 273, 283]\n\u00a0\n least, the court and grand jury have authority and jurisdiction to investigate the facts in order to determine the question whether the facts show a case within their jurisdiction.\n The present cases are not exceptional, and for the reasons that have been outlined we are of opinion that appellants were not entitled to raise any question about the constitutionality of the statutes under which the grand jury's investigation was conducted.\n Final orders affirmed. \n\n\n\n","21":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOARD OF PUBLIC UTILITY COM'RS v.

Rep. 136. The board brought the judgment here for review, and the carrier now suggests that through a change in the local statute the question on which the judgment turned has become merely a moot one.\n After the case was brought here the Legislature, by Act 2694, so amended section 16 (e) as to cause the section itself to prescribe in detail what such reports should contain and thereby abrogated the provision on which the order was based and which the court held invalid. That provision therefore is no longer in force, and it is to the new provision that the board and carrier must give effect. Even if the original provision was valid, the order made under it became inoperative when the new provision was substituted in its place. Whether the order was based on a valid or an invalid statute consequently has become merely a moot question.\n In this situation we are not called upon to consider the propriety of the judgment below, the proper course being, \n\n[249 U.S. 425, 427]\n\u00a0\n as is shown by many precedents, to reverse the judgment and remand the cause with a direction that it be dismissed without costs to either party.

The railroad, challenging the validity of the order, refused to obey it and availing of the remedy provided by the local law invoked the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. In that court it disputed not only the correctness of the interpretation which had been given the ordinance by the Utility Commissioners, but charged that if such interpretation were enforced a violation would result of the rights of the company in particulars stated guaranteed to it by the Bill of Rights provided by Congress for the Philippine Islands. The court, passing as unnecessary to be considered all the contentions made by the railroad but the single one concerning the duty of the company under the franchise ordinance to furnish the free transportation ordered, decided that under the text of that ordinance the duty to furnish such transportion did not exist, and therefore set aside the order of the Commissioners. That body, both by error and appeal, brought the subject here for consideration.\n As the action of the court complained of was taken \n\n[249 U.S. 262, 264]\n\u00a0\n before the Act of September 6, 1916 (39 Stat. 726, c. 448), and the appellate jurisdiction of this court was invoked before that act went into effect, our power to review is governed by section 248 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1158). By that section the authority to review under the situation here disclosed can depend only upon one or both of two considerations: (a) Whether the Constitution or any statute, treaty, title or privilege of the United States is involved, or (b) whether the value in controversy exceeds $25,000. Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas v. Alhambra Cigar & Cigarette Manufacturing Co., \n249 U.S. 72\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 224, decided March 3, 1919\n\n\n We are of opinion that the mere construction by the court of the franchise ordinance, and its consequent ruling that the duty did not rest on the railroad company to give the free transportation which the orders of the Commissioners had directed to be given affords no ground for bringing the case within the first consideration, and indeed, that the contention that it does is too unsubstantial, not to say frivolous, to afford any basis for jurisdiction; and that the same conclusion is inevitably required as to the second consideration as the record discloses no ground whatever for concluding that the Utility Commissioners had any such pecuniary interest as to bring the case within the statute.\n Dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","23":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBONE v. COMMISSIONERS OF MARION COUNTY(1919)\nNo. 63\nArgued: November 11, 1919Decided: December 15, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[251 U.S. 134, 135]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Clarence E. Mehlhope, of Chicago, Ill., and Arthur H. Ewald, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Mr. V. H. Lockwood, of Indianapolis, Ind., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Suit brought in the District Court of the United States for the District of Indiana to restrain the infringement of a patent for a retaining wall, which, to quote petitioner, is \"a wall to prevent the material of an embankment or cut from sliding.\"\n After issue joined and proofs submitted, the District Court (Anderson, J.,) entered a decree dismissing the bill for want of equity. The decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, to review which action this writ of certiorari was granted.\n The bill in the case is in the conventional form and alleges invention, the issue of a patent numbered 705,732, and infringement by respondent. The prayer is for treble damages, an injunction, and accounting.\n The answer of respondent is a serial denial of the allegations of the bill and avers anticipation of petitioner's device by prior patents and publications, in this and other countries.\n This summary of the issues is enough for our purpose and we need only add preliminarily to their discussion that Bone's device has the sanction of a patent and a decision sustaining it by the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the \n\n[251 U.S. 134, 136]\n\u00a0\n Sixth Circuit. The difference of decision in that circuit and the Seventh circuit is an important consideration and must be accounted for, which is best done by a display of the patent and the case.\n First, as to the patent: It describes the invention as being one that--\n'relates to improvements in retaining walls for abutments to bridges , ... and such places as it is desired to retain earth or other matter permanently in place with its face at an angle nearer vertical than it would naturally repose when exposed to the action of the elements or gravity,' and 'consists principally of introducing into masonry of concrete, stone or brick a framework of steel or iron in such way that the whole wall is so much strengthened thereby that the volume of the masonry may be greatly reduced, and yet the height, base, and strength against overturning, bulging, or settling will still be ample.'\n\n The following figure represents a cross-sectional view of the device- A representing the masonry, B the material retained, and B1 the earth on which the wall rests. The metal parts within A are indicated by the smaller letters.\n \n\u00a0\n The patent does not insist upon that form of the masonry in all particulars. The base of the wall may be, it is said, 'varied to suit the circumstances'; it (the base) may extend to the rear rather than the front 'with proper proportions of metal ... the form shown in the drawings being what might be called an inverted T, while those suggested would be in the form of an L or reversed L.'\n The utility of the wall of these shapes is represented to be that it is 'not so liable to be overturned from the pressure of material behind it as would be a wall of the same height and area of section but having a rectangular, trapezoidal or triangular shaped section,' the latter shapes requiring more masonry. And it is said that the patented wall, 'having more base and less weight' than such other shapes, 'will rest more securely on a soft or yielding foundation, the weight of the material resting on the heel' causing the latter 'to press on the earth below, and thus cause friction to prevent the whole wall from sliding outward.' This is the especial effect of the patent, achieved by the wall of the shape described, and distinguishes it, is the contention, from the retaining walls of the prior art.\n The patentee admits, however, that retaining walls had been 'constructed of concrete and steel, but none' to his 'knowledge' 'had been supported on their own base as' his, nor had 'any of them entirely inclosed the steel within the concrete,' nor had 'any of them used the weight of the material retained as a force to retain itself.'\n Such, then, is the wall and the utility attributed to it. The combinations which may be made with it are set forth in 17 claims, of which 1, 3, 5, 16, and 17 are involved in the present action. Counsel for petitioner considers, however, that 1 and 17 are so far illustrative that the others need not be given. They are as follows:\n'1. The combination with a retaining wall having a \n\n[251 U.S. 134, 138]\n\u00a0\n heel, of a metal structure embedded vertically in said wall and obliquely in said heel, so that the weight of the retained material upon the heel of the metal structure will operate to retain the wall in vertical position.'\n\n'17. The combination with a retaining wall having an inclined heel and a toe at opposite sides thereof, of a metal structure embedded within said wall and heel, said structure consisting of upright bents at the back part of the vertical wall and continuing down along the upper part of the heel of said wall to the back part thereof, whereby by reason of the toe and the heel the weight of the retained material upon the heel of the metal structure will operate to maintain the wall in a vertical position.'\n\n So much for the device of the patent. How far was it new or how far was it anticipated?\n Bone's idea was conceived in 1898, and his patent issued in 1902, upon an application made in 1899, but according to his counsel the value of the invention was not recognized 'until after the lapse of several years,' when he, Bone, brought a suit against the city of Akron, Ohio, in the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, in vindication of the patent and in reparation for its infringement. He was given a decree which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 221 Fed. 944, 137 C. C. A. 514.\n The District Court (Judge Day) gave a clear exposition of the patent, the relation of its metal parts1 to the masonry \n\n[251 U.S. 134, 139]\n\u00a0\n parts and their co-operating functions, and adjudged the patent valid and the wall of the city of Akron an infringement of it.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree. The court said that the record disclosed nothing which anticipated 'the substantial thought of the patent.' If it had done so, or, to quote the exact language of the court:\n'If the prior art had shown a structure intended for a retaining wall, and having a heel such that the weight of the earth thereon would tend to keep the wall erect, it might be difficult to find invention in merely adding the form of reinforcement most suitable to create the desired tensile strength; but we find no such earlier structures.' 2 \n\n[251 U.S. 134, 140]\n\u00a0\n On application for rehearing the court refused to direct the District Court to open the case to permit the defendant to put in proof regarding a German publication of 1894\n\n\n\n Those decisions confronted the District Court in the present suit and fortified the pretensions of the patent. They were attacked, however, as having been pronounced upon a different record and this conclusion was accepted by the District Court. The latter court found from the new evidence the existence of a structure upon the nonexistence of which the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit based its conclusion. The District Court said that Bone was not the first to do the things he asserted he was the first to do, and that whatever the record in the Sixth Circuit might have shown, so far as the record before the court 'was concerned, the absolute converse of that proposition' had 'been demonstrated.'\n The court, therefore, as we have said, dismissed the bill for want of equity.\n The decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals; indeed, the reasoning of the District Court was approved after painstaking consideration of the patent and an estimate of the anticipatory defenses; none of which the court said was introduced in the Akron Case, 'otherwise a different conclusion would have been reached,' adducing the opinion of the court. 249 Fed. 214, 161 C. C. A. 247. This being so, and there is no doubt it is so, the present case is relieved of the authority or persuasion of the Akron Case and it becomes necessary to consider the prior art and decide the extent and effect of its anticipation.\n We have given a cross section of the device of the \n\n[251 U.S. 134, 141]\n\u00a0\n patent, showing its shape and strengthening 'metallic members,' and the patent informs of their co-operative function. We reproduce the device and set by its side the Marion county wall for comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n If we may assign novelty to the Bone wall and consider it a broad advance upon the prior art [the extent of its advance, if any, we shall consider later], we may assign infringement of it by the Marion county wall. To an examination of the prior art we are therefore brought.\n It would be difficult to add anything to the consideration and comment of the Court of Appeals. The court cited in support of its judgment a patent issued to Francois Coignet in 1869, and one issued to Stowell & Cunningham in 1899 upon an application made in 1897, and to articles written by P. Planat which appeared in 1894 and 1896 in a scientific magazine called 'La Construction Moderne,' published in Paris; also a publication which appeared in Germany in 1894 concerning a wall which is given the name of Bauzeitung wall. The article recites that a 'utility model patent' had been granted, consisting 'of a vertical and a horizontal member.'\n The Coignet patent is somewhat indefinite. It relates, according to its declaration, to 'monolithic structures, or articles made of artificial stone paste' into which irregular shaped irons are introduced to be 'arranged in such a \n\n[251 U.S. 134, 142]\n\u00a0\n manner as to interlace each other, so that by the combination of this metallic skeleton and of agglomerated artificial stone paste the thickness of the walls or size of the articles may be considerably reduced and yet great strength be attained.'\n It will be observed that there is nothing explicit of how 'stone paste' and the 'irregular shaped irons' operate or co-operate, aside from their cohesion or interlacing. Their arrangement is not definite as the 'metallic members' in the Bone patent are, so that there might be as in that patent, reinforcing metal in the heel of the wall acting with its upright portion serving the function, to quote Judge Day, 'of a cantilever beam whereby the weight of the material pressing upon the heel is transferred to the upright of the wall and operates to retain the wall in a vertical position.'\n If there was any prophecy (to borrow counsel's word) in it the world was slow to discern it, and we are not disposed to give much anticipating effect to it, a view in which we have confirmation in the disclaimer of Bone-he conceding he was not the first to discover the art of reinforcing concrete.\n The Planat publications are more explicit. We there see a relation between the metallic and masonry parts of a wall and their cooperation to produce strength in the wall and resistance to the pressure of and bulging from the stress of earth behind it. Both articles the Court of Appeals said, 'deal with retaining walls of reinforced concrete of the cantilever type' and quoted from the article of 1896 as follows:\n'These computations suppose that one has effectively realized the fixing of the vertical wall to the horizontal slab at their junction. This fixing requires special precautions. The bars at the point of junction exert a pulling force which tends to pull them out of the concrete. ... But here we have only a half beam on a cantilever span. It is necessary that the extremities of the bars in the \n\n[251 U.S. 134, 143]\n\u00a0\n region of fixation should be held in a sufficient mass of concrete or maintained by some other means.\n\n'One is able to reduce these projections in a very large measure, if one takes care to bind together the vertical bars and the horizontal bars at their point of intersection. In this way the pull of the bar is carried, not only on its prolongation, arranged for anchorage, but also on the bar which is perpendicular to it, and whose great length permits it to offer a large resistance to the force tending to pull it out transversely.'\n\n The court did not enlarge upon other examples of the prior art nor do we think that it is necessary to do so. The court, however, referred to a publication in Bauzeitung and the patent to Stowell & Cunningham. The former is too technical to quote and the latter has not the simplicity of the Bone device; but both publication and patent represent structures that resist a tendency to tilting or bulging from the pressure of the earth in their rears. The Bauzeitung article did this by a wall which consisted of a 'vertical and a horizontal member' which were 'rigidly connected with each other' and--\n'the ratios so chosen that the resultant of the earth thrust passes through the horizontal part or through the foundation respectively, so that there exists no longer any tendency to tilting so long as the two parts continue to be firmly connected with each other.'\n\n It is further said:\n'To increase the stability, the horizontal part is furthermore connected at its rear end by means of anchors with the underground.'\n\n It will be observed, therefore, that there are no metallic reinforcing members. It is the shape of the wall-one having a base extending to the rear in the form of an L, the exact antecedent of one of the shapes described by Bone as having advantage over other shapes. And there was also the suggestion of the value of a firm connection between the 'vertical and horizontal member.' In other words, the publication showed a retaining \n\n[251 U.S. 134, 144]\n\u00a0\n wall having a heel such that the weight of the earth thereon would tend to keep the wall erect, an effect and operation that Bone declares in his patent no wall had attained prior to his invention. And that effect and operation the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit considered the essence of the Bone patent, and the court said that-\n'It might be difficult to find invention in merely adding the form of reinforcement most suitable to create the desired tensile strength.'\n\n The Stowell & Cunningham structure is, as we have said, somewhat complex in its mechanical parts. But these are but details; the physical laws that they are to avail of are explained so that 'the volume of masonry' of retaining walls may be reduced yet retain their strength by the use of metallic reinforcements.\n Counsel attacks the sufficiency of the asserted anticipations, especially the publications, and in effect says that whatever conceptions lurked in them conveyed no suggestion of a 'concrete entity,' to use counsel's words, to execute them and laments that Bone should be robbed of the credit and reward of adding to the world's useful instrumentalities which, but for him, would have remained in theories and the 'dust from which respondent recovered them.'\n To execute theories by adequate instrumentalities may indeed be invention, but an answer to petitioner's contention we have given by our comment on the Bauzeitung and Planat publications and the fullness of their expositions. Bone may have been ignorant of them and his device may not have been their suggestion. They seem to have been unknown to American engineers, not even the interest of the controversy in the Sixth Circuit having developed their existence. From this local ignorance nothing can be deduced favorable to the patent. Its device having been described in printed publications, although in foreign countries, patentable novelty or originality cannot be asserted for it. Section 4886, R. S.; 29 Stat. 692, c. 391 (Comp. St.  9430). \n\n[251 U.S. 134, 145]\n\u00a0\n Such is the provision of the law and we cannot relax it in indulgence to what may seem the individual's merit.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, to show the progress of the prior art, made use of the illustrations of the patents and publications\n that preceded Bone's, and we also avail ourselves of the same to show that Bone's patent was a step, not a leap, in that progress, and that the only originality that can be accorded it is in its special form and there can be no infringement except by a copy of that form or a colorable imitation of it. We do not think the Marion county wall is subject to either accusation and the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice DAY took no part in the consideration or decision.\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The following is an extract from Judge Day's opinion:\n'The reinforcing members [metallic members] are placed near the back face of the wall and heel and near the lower face of the toe. The oblique reinforcing bars in the heel acting in conjunction with the uprights serve the function of a cantilever beam whereby the weight of the material pressing upon the heel is transferred to the upright portion of the wall and operates to retain the wall in a vertical position. ...\n\n'Considering the claims of the patent, and the testimony, I am of the opinion that Bone, the patentee, was the first to reinforce the retaining wall, or similar wall of concrete or masonry in such a manner that the weight of the retained material would be utilized to impart through the reinforcing members tensile resistance to the stern or vertical part of the wall, thereby fortifying this part of the wall against breaking strains.\n\n'This was an advancement in the art and possessed novelty and the structure of the defendant city infringed this patent.\n\n'While many of the features of concrete structures were old, yet this combination as outlined and described in this Bone application for a patent, was new. It is also in evidence that there has been a large sale and general acquiescence in the Bone patent.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The following is an extract from the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals:\n'The record discloses nothing anticipating the substantial thought of the patent. Masonry or concrete retaining walls were deep and heavy, and maintained by gravity in their resistance against a horizontal stress. There was no occasion for reinforcement. Sustaining walls had been built of concrete with vertical reinforcement; but they were maintained against side strain by cross-ties or beams, without which they might tip over. If the prior art had shown a structure intended for a retaining wall, and having a heel such that the weight of the earth thereon would tend to keep the wall erect, it might be difficult to find invention in merely adding the form of reinforcement most suitable to create the desired tensile strength; but we find no such earlier structures. Those which have that shape are sustaining walls only, and were so obviously unfit for use as retaining walls that no one seems to have seen the utility for that purpose, of which the form, when properly adapted and strengthened, was capable. There is also a prior wall, wholly of metal, fairly disclosing a unitary heel adapted to hold the wall erect; but to see that this could become merely a skeleton imbedded in concrete may well have required, in 1898, more than ordinary vision. Upon the whole, we think invention was involved, and the claims are valid.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","24":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOWERMAN v. HAMNER(1919)\nNo. 289\nArgued: Decided: June 9, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 504, 505]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Oliver O. Haga and James H. Richards, both of Boise, Indaho, for appellant.\n Mr. James M. Stevens, of Pocatello, Idaho, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit, commenced in the United States District Court for the District of Idaho, Eastern Division, by the receiver of the First National Bank of Salmon, against the former executive officers and directors of the bank, to obtain an accounting and decree for money lost by the alleged unlawful and negligent a nagement of the affairs of the bank. \n\n[250 U.S. 504, 506]\n\u00a0\n The sole appellant, Bowerman, was a director, but not an executive officer of the bank, from its organization in January, 1906, until its failure in August, 1911, and, as owner of $10,000 of the capital stock, he was the largest stockholder but one.\n The bank was located in a small town in Idaho. It had a capital stock of only $25,000, which was increased in February, 1910, to $50,000, and it had a book surplus of $15,000-$5,000 of which was improperly carried to the surplus account in July, 1910, when the capital was certainly impaired.\n When the plaintiff rested, the appellant moved that the bill be dismissed as to him, announcing that he would not introduce any evidence in his own behalf, and at the conclusion of the trial the District Court granted his motion. On appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this judgment, found Bowerman liable, and in the decree, which we are reviewing, remanded the case to the District Court, with direction to enter a decree in conformity with the views expressed in its opinion.\n The amended bill, on which the case was tried, is framed in fact, though not in form, in the alternative, averring, first, that the executive officers made, and that the directors negligently permitted them to make, three designated loans, each in excess of one-tenth part of the paid-in and unimpaired capital stock and surplus of the bank, in violation of section 5200 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (Comp. St.  9761). It then proceeds to allege: That, beginning with January, 1910, the affairs of the bank were grossly mismanaged by the excutive officers, with the negligent permission of appellant and other directors; that of the three designated loans, on which large losses were sustained, the first was made to the Salmon Lumber Company, a corporation without financial resources to justify such a loan without security, and with its capital stock owned principally by members of the family of the president of the \n\n[250 U.S. 504, 507]\n\u00a0\n bank; that the two other designated loans were negligently made to persons without financial standing and without security sufficient to justify the making of them; that overdrafts aggregating large amounts were permitted to be made by many persons, in violation of the by-laws of the association, and that a dividend on the capital stock was declared and paid in July, 1910, when the capital stock and surplus of the bank had been much impaired and its assets greatly depreciated. This gross mismanagement, it is averred, caused the failure of the bank and the loss for which recovery is prayed.\n With respect to appellant, Bowerman, it is specifically alleged that, in disregard of his oath as a director to diligently and honestly administer the affairs of the bank, he negligently and willfully failed to attend a single meeting of the board of directors, to at any time examine, or cause to be examined, the books and papers of the bank, to ascertain its condition, or to in any manner inform himself as to the loans and overdrafts that were being made during the long period of mismanagement by the executive officers. It is alleged that the exercise by him as a director of a proper supervision of the affairs of the bank would have prevented the mismanagement complained of, and the loss which resulted from it.\n Appellant's answer to the bill is substantially a general denial.\n The evidence applicable to the allegations against Bowerman may be summarized as follows:\n He was a director during the entire 5 1\/2 years of the existence of the bank, but never attended a single directors' meeting, regular or special. The only justification or excuse he offers for such conduct is that he lived about 200 miles from the town in which the bank was located, and that communication between the two places was difficult.\n In a letter, which is in evidence, written by him to the \n\n[250 U.S. 504, 508]\n\u00a0\n president of the bank in 1911, after the failure, he refers to himself as 'a nominal die ctor,' and says that, prompted by a published statement of the bank, which he had seen in 1910, he began writing to the president, warning him of the consequences if the 'very hazardous manner of conducting the bank' was not changed, 'various matters corrected, more of the notes collected, and the reserve kept up.' In this letter he says that he had never been 'consulted as to the management of the bank, its business transactions, or its policy,' and that he had never received a statement of its condition, either the usual published statement or one for his personal use, without making request for it, and that in some cases he had been obliged to write several times before one was sent to him. The record, however, does not show that any communication of the kind described in this letter was ever written by him prior to the failure.\n The only certified copies in evidence of the oath taken by Bowerman as a director are for the years beginning in January, 1909, and in January, 1910. They are in the form prescribed by statute, that the affiant will 'diligently and honestly administer the affairs of the association, and that he will not knowingly violate or willingly permit to be violated any of the provisions' of the statutes of the United States under which the association was organized.\n The by-laws of the bank are in evidence, and they require 'that regular meetings of the directors shall be held on the first Tuesday of each month'; that a 'loans committee,' to be composed of the president, cashier, and one director, shall make a report to each meeting of the board of directors of all bills, notes, and other evidences of debt discounted and purchased since its last previous report; that no officer or clerk shall pay any check drawn upon the bank, unless the drawer at the time of its presentation had sufficient funds on deposit to meet it; that a committee of three directors shall examine the affairs of the bank \n\n[250 U.S. 504, 509]\n\u00a0\n every month, to see whether it is in sound and solvent condition, and to recommend charges which may seem desirable in the manner of doing business.\n In addition to these, there was a special by-law adopted on January 18, 1910, upon the suggestion of the Comptroller of the Treasury, requiring that--\n'The board of directors of the bank, shall, at each monthly meeting, or oftener, examine and approve all loans and discounts, and such approval shall be recorded in a book to be kept for that purpose.'\n\n Some of these by-laws were flagrantly disobeyed for years before the failure, and the others were observed in a manner so perfunctory as to amount to a disobedience of them. The three large loans complained of were never reported to the board of directors, except fragmentarily from time to time, when indistinguishably incorporated with other overdrafts, although they were gradually accruing during many months.\n When the bank failed its liabilities were $273,719.14 and its assets, nominally $325,624.12, from which, assuming that the stockholders' liability was not included in them (as to which the record is not clear), there was realized about $220,000, thus showing a shrinkage of approximately $100,000 in the resources of a bank with a capital and surplus of $60,000.\n The District Court, with the full record before it, found the aggregate of the three excessive loans at the time the bank failed to be $ 35,700. Each of these loans was made up by allowing unsecured overdrafts to accumulate over a considerable period of time and then permitting them to be converted into unsecured notes.\n Without going more into the details, there can be no doubt that the business of the bank was surrendered wholly to the president and cashier, and was grossly mismanaged after January, 1910, in utter disregard of the national banking laws and of the by-laws of the association, and that this mismanagement was of such a character \n\n[250 U.S. 504, 510]\n\u00a0\n that even slight care in the discharge of his duties as a director must have led Bowerman, an experienced banker, to discover thet rend of the management and to have prevented the greater part, if not all, of the losses which resulted in the failure.\n The appellant relies chiefly upon the assignment of error that there is no evidence in the record to show that he knowingly consented to the making of the three loans in excess of the limit imposed by R. S.  5200 ( Comp. St.  9761), and therefore he argues that under the rule prescribed in Yates v. Jones National Bank, \n206 U.S. 158\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 638; and Jones National Bank v. Yates, \n240 U.S. 542\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 429; the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals holding him liable is erroneous and should be reversed.\n While the cited cases hold that, in a suit for damages against national bank directors, based solely upon a violation of duty imposed by the National Bank Act, it is not enough to show a negligent violation of the act, but that something more, in effect an intentional violation, must be shown to justify a recovery, and that this is the exclusive rule for measuring the responsibility of directors as to such violations, yet, it is expressly pointed out in the opinion of the court, that the act does not relieve such directors from the common-law duty to be honest and diligent, as is shown by the oath which they are required to take 'to diligently and honestly administer the affairs of the association' as well as not 'to knowingly violate or willingly permit the violation of any of the provisions of this title'-the National Bank Act (Act June 3, 1864, c. 106, 13 Stat. 99).\n The rule thus announced would perhaps be applicable if the bill were limited to the charge of liability based solely upon the statutory prohibition of excessive loans, for it is reasonably clear that Bowerman did not have actual knowledge of the making of the loans, or of anything else connected with the conduct of the bank. He deliberately avoided acquiring knowledge of its affairs and \n\n[250 U.S. 504, 511]\n\u00a0\n wholly abdicated the duty of supervision and control which rested upon him as a director.\n The National Bank Act imposes various specific duties on directors, other than those imposed by the common law, and it is obviously possible that a director may neglect one or more of the former, and not any of the latter, or vice versa. For example, in this case we have the gross negligence of the appellant, in failing to discharge his common-law duty to diligently administer the affairs of the bank, made basis for the contention that he did not 'knowingly' violate his statutory duty by permitting the excessive loans to be made. While the statute furnishes the exclusive rule for determining whether its provisions have been violated or not, this does not prevent the application of the common-law rule for measuring violations of common-law duties. And there is no sound reason why a bill may not be so framed that, if the evidence fails to establish statutory negligence, but establishes common-law negligence, a decree may be entered accordingly, and thus the necessity for a resort to a second suit avoided.\n The bill in this case is given, as we have seen, this broader scope, and contains the charge of statutory as well as common-law negligence on appellant's part, resulting in the loss complained of. Such pleading was accepted as proper practice in Briggs v. Spaulding, \n141 \nU.S. 132, 142\n, 165 S., 11 Sup. Ct. 924, 927 (35 L. Ed. 662) in which a bill thus 'framed upon the theory of a breach by the defendants as directors of their common- law duties as trustees of a financial corporation and of breaches of special restrictions and obligations of the national banking act' was under consideration by this court, and, upon a full review of the decisions, the rule for determining the common-law liability of directors of such banks was twice stated, once on page 152 of 141 U. S., on page 931 of 11 Sup. Ct. (35 L. Ed. 662):\n'In any view the degree of care to which these defendants were bound is that which ordinarily prudent and \n\n[250 U.S. 504, 512]\n\u00a0\n diligent men would exercise ud er similar circumstances, and in determining that the restrictions of the statute and the usages of business should be taken into account. What may be negligence in one case may not be want of ordinary care in another, and the question of negligence is, therefore, ultimately a question of fact, to be determined under all the circumstances.'\n\n And again, in the final summing up, on page 165 of 141 U. S., on page 935 of 11 Sup. Ct. (35 L. Ed. 662):\n'Without reviewing the various decisions on the subject, we hold that the directors must exercise ordinary care and prudence in the administration of the affairs of a bank, and that this includes something more than officiating as figureheads. They are entitled under the law to commit the banking business as defined, to their duly authorized officers, but this does not absolve them from the duty of reasonable supervision, nor ought they to be permitted to be shielded from liability because of want of knowledge of wrongdoing, if that ignorance is the result of gross inattention.'\n\n In an earlier case, martin v. Webb, \n110 \nU.S. 7, 15\n, 3 S. Sup. Ct. 428, 433 (28 L. Ed. 49) it was said:\n'Directors cannot, in justice to those who deal with the bank, shut their eyes to what is going on around them. It is their duty to use ordinary diligence in ascertaining the condition of its business and to exercise reasonable control and supervision of its officers. They have something more to do than from time to time, to elect officers of the bank, and to make declaration of dividends. That which they ought, by proper diligence, to have known as to the general course of business in the bank, they may be presumed to have known in any contest between the corporation and those who are justified by the circumstances in dealing with its officers upon the basis of that course of business.'\n\n This latter statement of the rule is made in a case dealing only with borrowers from the bank, but there is no \n\n[250 U.S. 504, 513]\n\u00a0\n good reason why it should not be applied for the protection of depositors and stockholders.\n While the rule as thus formulated in Briggs v. Spaulding, supra, has been thought by some state courts of last resort to be an understatement of the law of the duty of bank directors, it is amply broad, without restatement, for the disposition of the case before us.\n That ordinarily prudent and diligent men, accepting election to membership in a bank directorate, would not willfully absent themselves from directors' meetings for years together, as Bowerman did, cannot be doubted; that a director who never makes, or causes to be made, any examination whatever of the books or papers of the bank to determine its condition, and the way in which it is being conducted, does not exercise ordinary care and prudence in the management of the affairs of the bank, is equally clear; and that Bowerman, when guilty of neglect in both of these respects, did not exercise the diligence which prudent men would usually exercise in ascertaining the condition of the business of the bank, or a reasonable control and supervision over its affairs and officers, is likewise beyond discussion. He cannot be shielded from liability because of want of knowledge of wrongdoing on his part, since that ignorance was the result of gross inattention in the discharge of his voluntarily assumed and sworn duty.\n Bowerman was a banker, and the letter, from which we have quoted, written to the president of the bank which failed, shows he so understood the business of banking, and what was necessary for the safe conduct of it, that even slight care on his part in the discharge of his duty as a director must have discovered and arrested what he himself characterized as a hazardous manner of conducting its affairs. He was a man of such importance and reputation that the use of his name must have contributed to securing the confidence of the community and of \n\n[250 U.S. 504, 514]\n\u00a0\n depositors for the bank, and it would be a reproach to the law to permit his residence at a distance from the location of the bank, a condition h ich existed from the time he first assumed the office of director, to serve as an excuse for his utter abdication of his common-law responsibility for the conduct of its affairs and for the flagrant violation of his oath of office when it resulted in loss to others.\n It is argued that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial for the reason that the trial in the District Court was on the theory that only the charge of statutory liability was involved and to be met by the appellant, and that he should have an opportunity to produce evidence, if he desires, on the issue of common-law liability.\n At his peril the appellant put the construction on the pleadings which, for the reasons stated in this opinion, was erroneous. The suit was in equity, and he was charged with notice that the decision of the trial court was subject to review on both the law and the facts, and, although he was present in court during the trial, he neither took the stand to testify in his own behalf nor offered any evidence upon the question of his liability. The interests represented by the receiver are entitled to consideration, as well as those of the appellant, and the contention cannot be allowed.\n It is also urged that the appellant resigned his office as director some time before the bank failed, and that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals renders him liable for transactions after his resignation.\n The only showing on this subject in the record is the averment in appellant's answer that he was not a director of the bank after about the 1st day of July, 1910, and that he refused to qualify when notified of his re-election in January, 1911. These allegations must be deemed denied under the thirty-first equity rule (198 Fed. xxvii, 115 C. C. A. xxvii). The only evidence in \n\n[250 U.S. 504, 515]\n\u00a0\n the record on the subject is the oath of office taken by appellant in January, 1910, and the testimony of the receiver that the letter from the appellant to the president of the bank, from which we have quoted, was the only letter from him which he found, among the papers which came into his possession as receiver, bearing on the mismanagement of the bank, and that letter was written after the failure. Section 5145 of the Revised Statutes ( Comp. St.  9683) provides that directors shall hold office for one year and until their successors are elected and have qualified. In the absence of evidence that the appellant resigned or refused to qualify when re- elected in January, 1911, we must agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals in the conclusion reached, with the full record before it, that he continued to be a director 'from the organization of the bank until the receiver took charge.'\n Other claims of error, chiefly technical, have been pressed upon our attention, and have all been considered and found to be without substantial merit. Conduct such as this appellant was so palpably guilty of is not to be weighed in the scales of an apothecary. The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissent. \n\n\n\n","25":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBRAGG v. WEAVER(1919)\nNo. 22\nArgued: October 13, 1919Decided: December 8, 1919\n\n\n\n Messrs. George E. Allen, of Victoriz, Va., and John Garland Pollard, of Richmond, Va., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. J. D. Hank, Jr., of Richmond, Va., for defendants in error. \n\n[251 U.S. 57, 58]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By this suit the owner of land adjoining a public road in Virginia seeks an injunction against the taking of earth from his land to be used in repairing the road. The taking is from the most convenient and nearest place, where it will be attended by the least expense, and has the express sanction of a statute of the state (Pollard's Code, 1904,  944a, clauses 21 and 22.)1 Whether the statute denies to the owner the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment is the federal question in the case. It was duly presented in the state court and, while no opinion was delivered, the record makes it plain that by the judgment rendered the court resolved the question in favor of the validity of the statute.\n It is conceded that the taking is under the direction of public officers and is for a public use; also that adequate provision is made for the payment of such compensation as may be awarded. Hence no discussion of these matters is required. The lbjection urged against the statute is that it makes no provision for affording the owner an opportunity to be heard respecting the necessity or expediency of the taking or the compensation to be paid.\n Where the intended sue is public, the necessity and expediency of the taking may be determined by such agency and in such mode as the state may designate. They are legislative questions, no matter who may be charged with their decision, and a hearing thereon is not essential to due process in the sense of the Fourteenth Amendment. Boom Co. v. Patterson, \n98 U.S. 403\n, 406; \n\n[251 U.S. 57, 59]\n\u00a0\n Backus v. Fort Street Union Depot Co., \n169 \nU.S. 557, 568\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 445; Adirondack Ry. Co. v. New York, \n176 \nU.S. 335, 349\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 460; Sears v. City of Akron, \n246 \nU.S. 242, 251\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 245.\n But it is essential to due process that the mode of determining the compensation be such as to afford the owner an opportunity to be heard. Among several admissible modes is that of causing the amount to be assessed by viewers, subject to an appeal to a court carrying with it a right to have the matter determined upon a full trial. United States v. Jones, \n109 \nU.S. 513, 519\n, 3 S. Sup. Ct. 346; Backus v. Fort Street Union Depot Co., supra, 169 U. S. p. 569, 18 Sup. Ct. 445. And where this mode is adopted due process does not require that a hearing before the viewers be afforded, but is satisfied by the full hearing that may be obtained by exercising the right to appeal. Lent v. Tillson, \n140 U.S. 316\n, 326, et seq. 11 Sup. Ct. 825; Winona & St. Peter Land Co. v. Minnesota, \n159 \nU.S. 526, 537\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 83; Wells Fargo & Co. v. Nevada, \n248 \nU.S. 165, 168\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 62. And see Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, \n174 U.S. 1\n, 18-30, 45, 19 Sup. Ct. 580.\n With these principles in mind we turn to the statute in question. By clause 21 it authorizes certain officers engaged in repairing public roads to take earth for that purpose from adjacent lands, and by clause 22 it declares:\n'If the owner or tenant of any such land shall think himself injured thereby, and the superintendent of roads, or his deputy, can agree with such owner as to the amount of damage, they shall report the same to the board of supervisors, or, if they cannot agree, a justice, upon application to him, shall issue a warrant to three freeholders, requiring them to view the said land, and ascertain what is a just compensation to such owner or tenant for the damage to him by reason of anything done under the preceding section. The said freeholders, after being sworn according to the provisions of section three of this act,2 \n\n[251 U.S. 57, 60]\n\u00a0\n shall accordingly ascertain such compensation and report the same to the board of supervisors. Said board may allow the full amount so agreed upon, or reported by said freeholders, or so much thereof as upon investigation they may deem reasonable, subject to such owner or tenant's right of appeal to the circuit court as in other cases.'\n\n The same statute, in clause 5, deals with the compensation to be paid for lands taken for roadways, and in that connection provides that the proprietor or tenant, if dissatisfied with the amount allowed by the supervisors, 'may of right appeal to the circuit court of said county, and the said court shall hear the matter de novo' and determine and certify the amount to be paid. And a general statute (section 838), which regulates the time and mode of taking appeals from decisions of the supervisors disallowing claims in whole or in part, provides that the claimant, if present when the decision is made, may appeal to the circuit court within thirty days thereafter, and, if not present, shall be notified in writing by the clerk and may appeal within thirty days after service of the notice.\n Apart from what is implied by the decision under review, no construction of these statutory provisions by the state court of last resort has been brought to our attention; so for the purposes of this case we must construe them. The task is not difficult. The words employed are direct and free from ambiguity, and the several provisions are in entire harmony. They show that, in the absence of an agreement, the compensation is to be assessed primarily by viewers, that their award is to be examined by the supervisors and approved or changed as to the latter may appear reasonable, and that from the decision of the supervisors an appeal lies as of right to the circuit court where the matter may be heard de novo. Thus, by exercising the right to appeal the owner may obtain a full hearing in a court of justice-one concededly possessing and exercising a general jurisdiction. An opportunity to have such a \n\n[251 U.S. 57, 61]\n\u00a0\n hearing, before the compensation is finally determined, and when the right thereto can be effectively asserted and protected, satisfies the demand of due process.\n Under the statute the proceedings looking to an assessment may be initiated by the owner as well as by the road officers. Either may apply to a justice for the appointment of viewers. Thus the owner is free to act promptly and upon his own motion, if he chooses.\n But it is contended that where the road officers take the initiative- as they do in many instances-the proceedings may be carried from inception to conclusion without any notice to the owner, and therefore without out his having an opportunity to take an appeal. We think the contention is not tenable. It takes into account some of the statutory provisions and rejects others equally important. It is true there is no express provision for notice at the inception or during the early stages of the proceedings; and for present purposes it may be assumed that such a requirement is not even implied, although a different view might be admissible. See Paulsen v. Portland, \n149 U.S. 30\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 750. But the provisions relating to the later stage-the decision by the supervisors-are not silent in respect of notice, but speak in terms easily understood. Clauses 5 and 22 taken together provide that the owner, if dissatisfied with the decision, shall have the right to appeal as in other cases. This presupposes that he will have some knowledge of the decision, and yet neither clause states how the knowledge is to be obtained, or when or how the right of appeal is to be exercised. All this is explained, however, when section 838 is examined. It deals with these questions in a comprehensive way and evidently is intended to be of general application. Of course, newly created rights of appeal of the same class fall within its operation unless the Legislature provides otherwise. Here the Legislature has not provided otherwise, and so has indicated that it is content to have the general statute applied. As before stated, that \n\n[251 U.S. 57, 62]\n\u00a0\n statute provides that the claimant, if not present when the supervisors' decision is made, shall be notified thereof in writing and shall have thirty days after such notice within which to appeal. If he be present when the decision is made, he is regarded as receiving notice at that time, and the thirty days for taking an appeal begins to run at once. It is apparent therefore that special care is taken to afford him ample opportunity to appeal and thereby to obtain a full hearing in the circuit court.\n The claim is made that this opportunity comes after the taking, and therefore is too late. But it is settled by the decisions of this court that where adequate provision is made for the certain payment of the compensation without unreasonable delay the taking does not contravene due process of law in the sense of the Fourteenth Amendment merely because it precedes the ascertainment of what compensation is just.

BRICE(1919)\nNo. 431\nArgued: Decided: June 2, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 229, 230]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. D. Worcester, of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Bronson Winthrop, of New York City, for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Quarry Company brought an action at law in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York to recover $20,000 and interest from Wilson B. Brice as executor of Henry Van Schaick, deceased, and the American Surety Company. Answers were filed and the case was at issue, and came on for trial, when, upon motion of the defendants, the action was dismissed for want of jurisdiction. The only question here concerns the correctness of this ruling of the District Court. The ground of the dismissal is thus stated in the record:\n'In this cause I hereby certify that this writ of error is allowed solely, and that the order herein dismissing the complaint was based solely, on the ground that no jurisdiction of the District Court existed; that this question has been determined by me on the following grounds:\n\n'This action is brought on a surety bond made by one Henry Van Schaick (since deceased) as principal, and the defendant the American Surety Company of New York, as surety, for the purpose of securing the due payment, at Henry Van Schaick's death, of the remainder interests in a certain fund of money held by Henry Van Schaick as life tenant; that one Eugene Van Schaick (since deceased) was at the time of the assignment below mentioned the owner of one of the remainder interests secured by said bond; that Eugene Van Schaick, during the continuance of the life estate, assigned to the plaintiff a portion of his said remainder interest, and thereafter survived the said \n\n[250 U.S. 229, 231]\n\u00a0\n Henry Van Schaick, and this action is bases on such assignment; that Eugene Van Schaick was in his lifetime a citizen and resident of the state of New York, and both of the defendants are citizens and residents of the state of New York; that this suit could not have been prosecuted in this court upon said remainder interest and said bond if no such assignment had been made.'\n\n Section 24 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1091 [Comp. St.  991]), among other things, provides:\n'No district court shall have cognizance of any suit (except upon foreign bills of exchange) to recover upon any promissory note or other chose in action in favor of any assignee, or of any subsequent holder if such instrument be payable to bearer and be not made by any corporation, unless such suit might have been prosecuted in such court to recover upon said note or other chose in action if no assignment had been made.'\n\n To determine the character of the action for the purposes of jurisdiction recourse must be had to the allegations of the complaint. They are quite voluminous, but for our purposes may be summed up as stating: The plaintiff is a corporation of the state of Connecticut. The defendant the American Surety Company is a corporation of the state of New York. The defendant Wilson B. Brice is a resident and citizen of the state of New York. (It was conceded for the purposes of the motion that Eugene Van Schaick was a citizen of New York.) Jane C. Van Schaick died May 20, 1893, seized of certain real estate in the state of New York. By her last will and testament she gave one-half of her real estate to Henry Van Schaick, of New York, during his life, with remainder to his descendants who should be living at the time of his decease and living also at the time of the testatrix's decease, if she should survive him. The will was duly probated on June 28, 1893. Henry Van Schaick survived the testatrix, and had living children, one of whom was Eugene \n\n[250 U.S. 229, 232]\n\u00a0\n Van Schaick. The complaint then recites certain conveyances, and the prosecution of a partition suit, the decree in which was, by order of the court, considered upon the motion to dismiss. In that suit it was adjudged that Henry Van Schaick had an estate as tenant for life in one-half of the said real estate; that among others Sarah Van Schaick, wife of Eugene Van Schaick, had an estate in remainder in the land to commence in possession upon the death of Henry Van Schaick. It being found that the land could not be divided, it was ordered sold. The sale for $134,369.74 is recited. One-half of the proceeds, $67,184.87, was found to belong to Henry Van Schaick for life, at his death to vest in the descendants of Henry Van Schaick as should be then living, or in such persons as should then be the legal owners of said shares. The decree provided that the fund might be paid to Henry Van Schaick upon his giving security to the remaindermen, and provision was made for giving the bond now sued upon. Henry Van Schaick as principal and the American Surety Company then executed the bond in the sum of $75,000. The obligees of the bond were the descendants of Henry Van Schaick living at the time of his death, the amount to be paid to them, their executors, administrators, or assigns. The condition of the bond was that Henry Van Schaick during his lifetime should safely keep and preserve said principal sum, and the same should be paid over to his descendants as provided in the decree. Eugene Van Schaick acquired the interest which had been assigned to his wife. On May 9, 1901, Eugene Van Schaick assigned to the Quarry Company the sum of $20,000, to be paid out of his remainder interest. Henry Van Schaick died on November 15, 1914, leaving Eugene Van Schaick and others surviving him. Eugene Van Schaick died on January 27, 1916. Henry Van Schaick did not keep and preserve the principal of said $67,148.67, the same was not paid as provided in the decree, but was lost by said Henry \n\n[250 U.S. 229, 233]\n\u00a0\n Van Schaick. The complaint avers demand of the $20,000 and interest, and prays judgment against the defendants.\n The action thus appears to have been brought upon the assignment of Eugene Van Schaick, a citizen of New York, to the plaintiff, a corporation of Connecticut, against defendants, who were residents and citizens of New York. Eugene Van Schaick could not have maintained the suit in the federal court, being himself a citizen and resident of New York. This suit was an action at law upon the bond. It was against both the executor and the surety company. The surety company was liable at law only upon the bond. The complaint, fairly considered, shows that such was the real nature of the suit. It contained but a single cause of action, and prayed for joint judgment against the executor of Henry Van Schaick and the surety company. Henry Van Schaick was liable to Eugence Van Schaick upon the bond. Eugene Van Schaick assigned that obligation to the plaintiff to the extent of $20, 000. That assignment carried with it the obligation of the surety company given to secure the faithful performance of the duty required of Henry Van Schaick. George v. Tate, \n102 U.S. 564\n, 571.\n The defenses, if any, of the surety company against the claim in the hands of Eugene Van Schaick could have been urged against the plaintiff. We think the plaintiff was an assignee within the meaning of section 24, without formal assignment of the bond. Shoecraft v. Bloxham, \n124 U.S. 730\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 686; Plant Investment Co. v. Jacksonville, etc., Ry. Co., \n152 U.S. 71\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 483.\n Brown v. Fletcher, \n235 U.S. 589\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 154, is an entirely different suit from the one now under consideration. In that action there was an assignment of an interest in a trust estate by the beneficiary, who was a resident and citizen of New York, to the complainants, who were residents and citizens of Pennsylvania and suit was brought in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of \n\n[250 U.S. 229, 234]\n\u00a0\n New York, the defendants being residents and citizens of New York. It was held that the suit to recover this interest in a trust estate was not a suit by an assignee within the meaning of section 24 of the Judicial Code. That suit, this court held, was not a suit upon a chose in action, but was one to recover upon the conveyance of an alienable interest acquired from the owner in a trust estate. Such interests might be sued for in the federal courts when the requisite amount and diversity of citizenship exist. \n235 \nU.S. 598, 599\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 154. But here the case is different; the suit was upon the bond, the right to recover arising from the assignment of the interest of Eugene Van Schaick in the fund in the hands of Henry Van Schaick. It was not a suit to recover the interest of Eugene Van Schaick in the estate because of the wrongful conversion thereof by Henry Van Schaick. To such a suit the surety company would not be a proper party. It was, as we have stated, an action upon a single cause of action against the executor of the principal and the surety upon the contract evidenced by the bond. The right to such action was derived by assignment from Eugene Van Schaick, a citizen and resident of New York, and as he could not have sued in the federal court, his assignee, the plaintiff, could not, by reason of section 24 of the Judicial Code.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","27":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBRANSON v.

Special & Private Acts of Arkansas 1911, p. 642.\n To pay the cost of the road improvement contemplated the act provided that it should be made a charge upon all of the real property, railroads and tramroads in the district. Bonds were sold and the road completed before this suit was commenced to enjoin the collection of taxes charged against the property of the railway company, of which the appellee, hereinafter designated the company, was receiver. The tax objected to was imposed upon the assessed value of the main track, side tracks, rolling stock, buildings and material of the company apportioned to the road district under a state law for the valuation of railroad property, and in the bill it is alleged to be invalid because the assessment conflicts with many provisions of the Constitutions of the United States and of Arkansas. The rate was the same for all real property in the district.\n The District Court permanently enjoined the tax to the extent that it was imposed on personal property-the rolling stock and materials of the company. From this part of the decree no appeal was taken and thereafter all question as to the invalidity of the assessment because including rolling stock and materials disappeared from the case. But, for want of equity, the bill was dismissed so \n\n[251 U.S. 182, 184]\n\u00a0\n far as applicable to the real estate 'designated in the bill as main track, side track and buildings.' On appeal by the company from this part of the decree, the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decree of the District Court and enjoined the collection of the tax on the real estate on two grounds:\n\n\n (1)\n Because the including of the franchise and other intangible property of the company in the assessment results in 'a higher rate of taxation' on the property of the railway company than on the other property in the district, and\n\n\n (2)\n Because the evidence fails to show that the company would derive any benefit from the improvement of the road.\n In this court the plaintiffs in error, hereinafter referred to as the road district, assign as errors these two holdings of the Circuit Court of Appeals, and we shall consider them in the order stated.\n All property of the railway company in the state was assessed by a state tax commission under an act, the validity of which is not assailed, providing:\n'The franchises (other than the right to be a corporation) of all railroads ... are declared to be property for the purpose of taxation and the value of such franchises shall be considered by the assessing officers when assessing the property of such corporations.' Acts of Arkansas 1911, p. 233,  2.\n\n The act also required the commission to 'determine the total value of the entire property of the corporation, tangible and intangible'; that the buildings and side tracks should be assessed as real estate in the town or district where located, but that the main track, also to be assessed as real estate, should be apportioned among the several towns and districts through which the road ran according to the 'actual mileage in each town or district.' \n\n[251 U.S. 182, 185]\n\u00a0\n The Circuit Court of Appeals did not hold either the railroad valuation or the district road improvement law unconstitutional, both being types of laws often upheld by this court (State Railroad Tax Cases, \n92 U.S. 575\n, Cleveland, etc., R. R. Co. v. Backus, \n154 U.S. 439\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 1122, and Houck v. Little River Drainage District, \n239 U.S. 254\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 58), but the first ground of its decision was, only, that the assessment of the main track under the former law, as applied to the case of taxation by benefits provided for by the latter, resulted in unequal taxation to an extent amounting to a denial of the equal protection of the laws.\n The court was carried to its conclusion by process: The act creating the road district, and the general law applicable to local assessments in proportion to benefits, both required that only real estate should be assessed to pay for the improvement here involved; only the real estate of the other property owners of the district was assessed, and therefore when the franchises, personalty, of the railroad company were 'considered' in making the assessment complained of, the company was taxed a 'higher rate,' a greater amount, than other property owners and by such discrimination was denied the equal protection of the laws.\n It is argued by the road district that this conclusion is erroneous, for the reasons following:\n The assessment law, which we have quoted, provides that the franchises of railroad companies ('other than the right to be a corporation') 'shall be considered' by officials when assessing their property.\n It is to be noted that this law does not provide for the assessment of the franchises of railroad companies separately as personal, or intangible property, as the laws of some states require, but only declares that they are 'property' which 'shall be considered by assessing officers when assessing the property of such corporations' and they are not valued separately in the \n\n[251 U.S. 182, 186]\n\u00a0\n assessment complained of, as it is itemized in the bill of complaint.\n It is not easy to define just what is meant by the 'franchise' of a railroad company 'other than the right to be a corporation' and the record does not attempt a definition. Morgan v. Louisiana, \n93 U.S. 217\n, 223. The record is also silent as to what, if any, value was placed upon the franchises of the company here involved by the state tax commission, and as to what extent, if at all, they were 'considered' in arriving at the assessment objected to, and therefore, it is contended, that the conclusion of the Circuit Court of Appeals that personal property value was included in the assessment of the real estate of the district has no foundation on which to rest, other than the assumption that the tax commission conformed to the law and 'considered' the franchises when assessing the real estate and that this necessarily resulted, in fact, if not in form, in such inclusion-an unusually meager basis surely for invalidating a tax of the familiar character of this before us.\n If, however, the distinction sometimes taken between the 'essential properties of corporate existence' and the franchises of a corporation ( Memphis, etc., R. R. Co. v. Commissioner, \n112 \nU.S. 609, 619\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 299) be considered substantial enough to be of practical value, and if it be assumed that the distinction was applied by the state commission in making the assessment here involved, this would result, not in adding personal property value to the value of the real estate of the company in the district, but simply in determining what the value of the real property was-its right of way, tracks and buildings-having regard to the use which it made of it as an instrumentality for earning money in the conduct of railroad operations. This at most is no more than giving to the real property a value greater as a part of a railroad unit and a going concern \n\n[251 U.S. 182, 187]\n\u00a0\n than it would have if considered only as a quantity of land, buildings and tracks.\n This is the method of assessing railroad property often approved by this court, specifically in Cleveland, etc., R. R. Co. v. Backus, \n154 \nU.S. 439, 445\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 1122, 1124 (38 L. Ed. 1041), saying:\n'The rule of property taxation is that the value of the property is the basis of taxation. It does not mean a tax upon the earnings which the property makes, nor for the privilege of using the property, but rests solely upon the value. But the value of property results from the use to which it is put and varies with the profitableness of that use, present and prospective, actual and anticipated. There is no pecuniary value outside of that which results from such use. The amount and profitable character of such use determines the value, and if property is taxed at its actual cash value it is taxed upom something which is created by the uses to which it is put. In the nature of things it is practically impossible-at least in respect to railroad property-to divide its value, and determine how much is caused by one use to which it is put and how much by another.'\n\n And long experience has confirmed the statement by Mr. Justice Miller in Railroad Tax Cases, \n92 U.S. 575\n, 608 (23 L. Ed. 663), that:\n'It may well be doubted whether any better mode of determining the value of that portion of the track within any one county has been devised than to ascertain the value of the whole road, and apportion the value within the county by its relative length to the whole.'\n\n And see Kentucky Railroad Cases, \n115 U.S. 321\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 57, in which, also, the contention is disposed of that the railroad track should be valued by the same officials and on the same basis of acreage as farm lands adjacent to it.\n Thus, the assessment complained of was made under valid laws and in a manner approved and customary in arriving at the value of that part of railroad tracks \n\n[251 U.S. 182, 188]\n\u00a0\n situate in a state, county or district. So far as this record shows, the assessment, modified by the decree of the District Court not appealed from, is not a composite of real and personal property values, but is the ascertained value of the real estate-the tracks and buildings-of the company within the taxing district, enhanced, no doubt, by the special use made of it, but still its value as a part of the railroad unit, resulting from the inherent nature of the business in which it is employed, a value which will not be resolved into its constituent elements for the purpose of defeating contribution to a public improvement. No attempt was made to prove fraudulent, or capricious or arbitrary action on the part of any officials in making the assessment, the only evidence upon the subject being the opinions of four employes of the company that the improvement of the road would not benefit the railroad property, and if inequality has resulted from the application of the state law in a customary manner to a situation frequently arising in our country, it is an incidental inequality resulting from a valid classification of railroad property for taxation purposes which does not fall within the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment, which 'was not intended to compel the states to adopt an iron rule of equal taxation.' Bell's Gap Railroad Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 533, 535 (33 L. Ed. 892). And see French v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co., \n181 U.S. 324\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 625; Cass Farm Co. v. Detroit, \n181 \nU.S. 396, 398\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 644; Detroit v. Parker, \n181 U.S. 399\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 624.\n Thus, the basis for assuming that the franchises of the railroad company were added as a separate personal property value to the assessment of the real property of the company becomes, upon this record, much too unsubstantial to justify invalidating the tax involved if it be otherwise valid, and the first assignment of error must therefore be sustained.\n But the holding of the Circuit Court of Appeals that \n\n[251 U.S. 182, 189]\n\u00a0\n 'the evidence fails to show that the railroad company derives any benefit from the road' is also assigned as error.\n In the act of the General Assembly creating this road district it is provided:\n'Sec. 5. It is ascertained and hereby declared that all real property within said district, including railroads and tramroads, will be benefited by the building of the said highway more than the cost thereof as appropriated in the county assessment of each piece of property within the district, for this and the succeeding years, and the cost thereof is made a charge upon such real property superior to all other mortgages and liens except the liens for the ordinary taxes, and for improvement districts heretofore organized. ...' Special and Private Acts of Arkansas 1911, pp. 642, 645.\n\n Where, in laws creating districts for local improvements and taxation, there is such a legislative declaration as this, as to what lands within the district will be benefited by the improvement, the law with respect to the extent to which such determination may be reviewed by the courts is so well settled, and has so lately been re-examined and restated by this court, that extended discussion of the subject is not justified.\n In Spencer v. Merchant, \n125 U.S. 345\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 921- a decision often cited and approved-it is decided that if the proposed improvement is one which the state had authority to make and pay for by assessments on property benefited, the Legislature, in the exercise of the taxing power, has authority to determine, by the statute imposing the tax, what lands, which might be benefited by the improvement, are in fact benefited by it; and if it does so, its determination is conclusive upon the owners and the courts, and the owners have no right to be heard on the question whether their lands have been benefited or not.\n The subject was carefully re-examined and the law \n\n[251 U.S. 182, 190]\n\u00a0\n restated in cases so recent as Wagner v. Baltimore, \n239 U.S. 207\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 66, and Houck v. Little River Drainage District, \n239 U.S. 254\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 58, with the result that the rule as we have stated it was approved, with the qualification, which was before implied, that the legislative determination can be assailed under the Fourteenth Amendment only where the legislative action is 'arbitrary, wholly unwarranted,' 'a flagrant abuse, and by reason of its arbitrary character a confiscation of particular property.' And see Withnell v. Ruecking Construction Co., \n249 \nU.S. 63, 69\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 200; Hancock et al. v. Muskogee, \n250 \nU.S. 454, 457\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 528; Embree v. Kansas City, etc., Road District, \n240 \nU.S. 242, 250\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 317.\n The decisions relied upon by the company (Norwood v. Baker, \n172 U.S. 269\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 187; Myles Salt Co. v. Iberia Drainage District, \n239 U.S. 478\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 204, L. R. A. 1918E, 190; Gast Realty & I. Co. v. Schneider Granite Co., \n240 U.S. 55\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 254) are not in conflict with the rule but plainly fall within, and are illustrations of, the qualification of it.\n An application of this rule to the case before us renders not difficult the decision of the second assignment of error.\n The road to be improved was 'a little less than 3 1\/2 miles in length' and extended from Alma, a considerable village, on the north, southerly to an east and west road which had its western terminus at the city of Van Buren, 8 miles west of the junction of the two roads. It was the principal road to and from Alma, the travel on it being greater than on all the other roads which served that village combined. In wet seasons the road was practically impassable for wagons, sometimes for three or four months together. People living south of the east and west road, who made Van Buren their trading point in wet weather, after the road was improved traded exclusively at Alma, it being 4 1\/2 miles nearer for many of them. The railway of the appellee was the only \n\n[251 U.S. 182, 191]\n\u00a0\n one at Alma, but at Van Buren there was a competing road, with a line 250 miles shorter than that of the appellee to St. Louis, the chief market for the staples of the region.\n On the question of benefits which would come to the railroad property from the construction of the road, the appellee receiver called four witnesses, three of them engineers and one a superintendent of the company. Two of these were familiar with the location of the road and the other two testified that they knew of its location in a general way. All four testified in general terms that the road was not and never would be of any benefit to the railroad. It is significant that no traffic man was called and that no evidence was introduced showing the extent of business done at Alma before and after the improvement of the road.\n For the district, three witnesses were called, one a doctor, one a merchant and one a long-time resident of the village of Alma. Each of these testified that, in his opinion, the road, by making the village of Alma more accessible, particularly in the wet seasons of the year, and by developing the adjacent country, would increase the business of the railway company and would divert business from Van Buren, where there was a competing railroad, to Alma, where appellee had the only line. It was in evidence also that after the act was passed, but before the road was completed, a large gas-producing district was discovered not far south of the southern terminus of the improved road which was tributary to it.\n To this must be added the obvious fact that anything that develops the territory which a railroad serves must necessarily be of benefit to it, and that no agency for such development equals that of good roads.\n This discussion of the record makes it clear that it is impossible to characterize as arbitrary, capricious, or confiscatory the action of the General Assembly, in declaring \n\n[251 U.S. 182, 192]\n\u00a0\n that the property of the railroad company within the district would be benefited by the construction of the contemplated road improvement, but, on the contrary, it makes it apparent that the case is one so fully within the general rule that the holding of the Circuit Court of Appeals that the railroad would not be benefited by the improvement cannot be sustained.\n It results that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed and that of the District Court affirmed.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissents. \n\n\n\n","28":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBROTHERS v. U S(1919)\nNo. 309\nArgued: Decided: May 19, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 88, 89]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William F. Brothers, pro se.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant brought this action in the Court of Claims under the Act of June 25, 1910 (chapter 423, 36 Stat. 851 [Comp. St.  9465]), to recover compensation for the unlicensed use by the United States in the Panama Canal work of his patented invention for 'improvements in cable cranes with gravity anchors.' That court made findings of fact upon which it concluded as matter of law that there was no infringement of claimant's patent, and thereupon dismissed his petition. 52 Ct. Cl. 462.\n From the findings it appears that claimant filed application for his patent July 18, 1895, and, upon such application, letters patent No. 551, 614 were granted and issued, under date December 17, 1895, to his assigness, Sarah E. Brothers and Maria A. Brown, to whom he had made assignment pending the application. Subsequently the letters patent were assigned to claimant, under date October 2, 1912, 2 1\/2 months prior to their expiration by limitation on December 17, 1912. His claim to compensation is necessarily limited to this brief period, since there could be no assignment to him of any unliquidated claim against the government arising prior to the time he became the owner of the patent. Rev. St.  3477 (Comp. St.  6383).\n No question is made but that plaintiff's invention was broadly new, a pioneer in its line, and the patent entitled to a broad construction and the claims to a liberal application of the doctrine of equivalents. See Brothers v. Lidgerwood Mfg. Co., 223 Fed. 359, 138 C. C. A. 460. It relates to the method of erecting and operating a suspension \n\n[250 U.S. 88, 90]\n\u00a0\n cable adapted to carrying a traveling crane or the like. Roughly speaking, the prior art consisted in supporting such cables upon rigid and unyielding towers at each end, so as to prevent an undue sagging of the cable under the strain of its load. Claimant's invention consisted in employing a rigid support or abutment at one end of the cable and what is called a 'gravity anchor' at the opposite end, consisting of outwardly inclined shears with the cable attached thereto and a weight hung permanently from the shears on the opposite side, which weight, together with the weight of the shears, puts a tension upon the cable varying according to the weight of the structure and counterweight, combined with the degree of inclination of the structure; the operation of the tension device being automatically to take up the slack of the suspended cable when the load approaches the supports, with the result of permitting the load to be moved closer to the supports, with a given exertion of power, than before. There are other advantages not necessary to be specified. The essential feature of the patent is a nonyielding support or anchor at one end of the cable, and a yielding, tilting, or rocking support at the opposite end, consisting of outwardly inclined shears or some equivalent structure held movably at the base, and a counterweight on the outer side. It is to be observed that rigidity of the head tower is a sine qua non, necessary to produce tension of the cable; yielding supports at both ends would be a contradiction of terms, since with such an arrangement there would be no support, and the entire structure would collapse under its own weight. The importance of this will appear.\n In the construction of the Panama Canal the government installed in the year 1909, and maintained and used continuously thereafter until the expiration of the Brothers patent, one single cableway and six duplex or double cableways which are complained of in this case \n\n[250 U.S. 88, 91]\n\u00a0\n as infringements. As to the mode of construction, maintenance, and operation of these cableways, the findings of the Court of Claims are as follows:\n'The single and the duplex cableways were similar in general design and construction except that the towers of the former supported a single cable, while those of the latter supported two cables, parallel to each other, at a distance of 18 feet apart, and each operated independently of the other, the length of the towers longitudinally of the canal cut being of proportionate dimension for the accommodation of the two cables. The towers were of structural steel construction; and taking the duplex cableways for illustration, each tower in vertical cross section from front to rear was in the shape of a right-angle triangle, with a base of approximately 50 feet, a perpendicular or vertical height of about 85 feet, and a hypothenuse of about 98 feet, with a length of about 38 feet longitudinally of the canal. The two towers of the cableway stood facing each other, on opposite banks of the canal cut, with their hypothenuse faces toward the cut. The cable span across the cut between the tops of the towers was approximately 800 feet. The cables used were 2 1\/4-inch steel wire cables having a rated breaking stress of 200 tons. The cables were supported by headblocks or saddles at the tops of the towers, and their ends were carried down and firmly anchored to the counterweighted bases of the towers.\n\n'Rigidity of the towers was desired; and in order to secure this and hold the towers rigid against any tendency to tip, tilt, or yield under the stress of the suspended cables and their loads, the platform base at the rear side of each tower-that is, the side farthest from the canal cut-was counterweighted by a block of cement concrete of over 150 tons weight, cast about the structural steel members of the base of the tower and extending along practically the entire length of the base. The entire \n\n[250 U.S. 88, 92]\n\u00a0\n weight of each tower, including the tower proper, the trucks upon which it was mounted, and the concrete counterweight, was upward of 500 tons.\n\n'To facilitate the shifting or moving of the cableways along the canal cut as the work progressed each tower was mounted upon sets of trucks, similar to the trucks of railway cars, on the front and rear sides of the base of the tower, and the whole structure was mounted upon two standard-gauge railway tracks located on the bank of the canal cut at the proper distance from each other and from the similar tower tracks on the opposite bank of the cut.\n\n'The cableways were operated by electrical power from the machinery stations in the head tower of each cableway.\n\n'Subsequent to the construction and installation of said cableways they were maintained and operated without change in structural form or method of operation other than that as the height of the walls and other work of the canal increased, beginning about August, 1910, it became necessary, in order to admit of the loads being carried to pass clear of the works and men engaged thereon as the height of the work increased, to take up the slack or decrease the deflection of the cable. The cables were accordingly drawn up for said purpose. This tightening up of the cables or reduction of their deflection increased the effect of the load and weight of the cables upon the towers as regards their tendency to yield or tilt.\n\n'It was the intent and purpose of the engineer officers of the Canal Commission, by and under whom said cableways were designed, constructed, and operated, that the towers thereof should be rigid and nonyielding to the full extent that rigidity in cable towers was possible; and there was no tilting or yielding of said towers other than such as resulted from a yielding of the roadbed of the tracks supporting them, portions of which roadbed con \n\n[250 U.S. 88, 93]\n\u00a0\n sisted of 'fills' of excavated materials upon swampy ground. There is no satisfactory evidence that the towers either yielded or tilted at any time during the period of claimant's ownership of said letters patent.'\n\n Upon the argument here, appellant quoted somewhat amply from the evidence taken before the Court of Claims. For the purposes of our review the findings of that court are to be treated like the verdict of a jury, and we are not at liberty to refer to the evidence, any more than to the opinion, for the purpose of eking out, controlling, or modifying their scope. United States v. Smith, \n94 U.S. 214\n, 218; Stone v. United States, \n164 \nU.S. 380, 382\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 71; District of Columbia v. Barnes, \n197 \nU.S. 146, 150\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 401; Crocker v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 74, 78\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 245; and cases cited.\n We concur in the opinion of the Court of Claims that no infringement of claimant's patent is shown. In the Act of June 25, 1910, under which this suit is brought and under which alone it could be brought, it is expressly provided that there shall be no such suit 'based on the use by the United States of any article heretofore owned, leased, used by, or in the possession of the United States.' In view of this and of the fact that the cableways complained of were theretofore in the possession of and used by the United States, claimant insists that after the passage of the act the government materially altered the cableways in such a manner as to make them infringe his patent. The contention is that the cables were tightened up in order to decrease their deflection, and that this tightening, in view of the loads carried by the cables, caused the supporting towers to yield or tilt, and thus to become in essence movable towers like the gravity anchors covered by the claimant's patent. But, as pointed out by the Court of Claims, it is beyond question that, as constructed and used generally, and as intended to be used, the government cableways did not infringe claimant's device. The subsequent tightening of the cables was done \n\n[250 U.S. 88, 94]\n\u00a0\n in the orderly conduct of the work for the purpose of carrying the loads over and free from the work that was being constructed. So far as this caused a yielding of the tower under the stress of the load, it was an incidental result, affecting or tending to affect the towers on both sides, and not upon one side to the exclusion of the other. It did not amount to a mechanical equivalent of the claimant's structure; there is no semblance of an outward inclination of a yielding tower or yielding support, but rather a tendency on the part of rigid towers to break down or collapse inwardly under an undue stress. And, as we have shown, the rigidity of one support is as essential to claimant's structure as is the movability of the other.\n Inasmuch as the findings fully support the judgment of the court below, its judgment must be and it is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","29":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBROUGHAM v. BLANTON MFG CO.(1919)\nNo. 247\nArgued: March 19, 1919Decided: April 21, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for appellants.\n Mr. Shepard Barclay, of St. Louis, Mo., for appellee. \n\n[249 U.S. 495, 496]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellants are officers of the Department of Agriculture charged with the administration of the meat inspection acts. The appellee, Blanton Manufacturing Company, is a manufacturer of oleomargarine and brought this suit against appellants to enjoin and restrain them from interfering with it in the use of the word 'Creamo' as a trademark in the manufacture and sale of its product and the use of that mark upon packages of its product shipped from St. Louis in interstate commerce.\n The District Court granted the injunction and its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 243 Fed. 503, 156 C. C. A. 201.\n As a ground of suit and recovery the company relies upon the following facts and they express, in a general way, its contentions. To what extent they should be modified will be apparent as we proceed.\n The company is a manufacturer of oleomargarine, having a factory at St. Louis, Mo., which comprises a group of buildings specially arranged and equipped for the purpose of such manufacture and where the company has made an investment of many thousands of dollars. Its product has been sold in packages of various sizes, marked with a trade label or stencil adopted for that purpose, which trade-mark is the word 'Creamo,' used since 1904. Its trade has become extensive and valuable, its product has acquired a high reputation and become a source of profit, increasing yearly, and an interruption in the use of its trade-mark and label would cause serious injury in a sum exceeding $5,000.\n January 6, 1908, the company applied to the United \n\n[249 U.S. 495, 497]\n\u00a0\n States Patent Office for the registration of 'Creamo' as a trade-mark, it was duly registered June 9, 1908, and the company has since enjoyed the use of it and made contracts with dealers under it, and the company's oleomargarine is known to its customers far and wide by that label, trade name and mark.\n In 1906, after the enactment of the act of June 30, 1906 (34 Stat. 669, c. 3913 [Comp. St.  8682]), concerning the inspection of 'meat and meat food products,' the company was informed by the Bureau of Animal Industry that its [the company's] plant would be subject to inspection under the act of Congress. The company objected but yielded to avoid controversy and hazard to its interest, and an inspector was installed. The company, however, contends that its manufacture of oleomargarine is not subject to the power and authority of the bureau.\n The Secretary of Agriculture, in 1907, approved the company's trade- mark of 'Creamo,' and upon the faith of the approval the company has used the same and by expenditure of large sums of money has extended its popularity and publicity; but, notwithstanding, Dr. Brougham [one of the appellants] threatened the company that from and after March 1, 1914, its use would not be allowed and that the inspector in the extablishment of the company would enforce the threat and attempt to prevent the use of the trade-mark and label.\n The trade-mark is duly registered in the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Missouri.\n Some of the contentions of the company are somewhat difficult to handle-indeed, to get at in separation. One of these is that the Bureau of Animal Industry has no authority or power over the company's product, its manufacture or market. The basis of the contention is that the food products indicated by 'the meat inspection act do not include a food product bearing the trade-name 'oleomargarine,' prescribed by a special revenue law to \n\n[249 U.S. 495, 498]\n\u00a0\n be used in the sale thereof, and that statutory name is not 'false or deceptive' when so used.' And for the contention the company relies on Homer v. Collector, 1 Wall. 486, and Chew Hing Lung v. Wise, \n176 U.S. 156\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 320. The further contention is that section 6 of the Oleomargarine Act (Act Aug. 2, 1886, c. 840, 24 Stat. 210 [Comp. St.  6218]) requires the article to be packed in a particular way which is not the same as that prescribed by the meat inspection act and was in force before the latter was enacted, and therefore excluded 'an article like this oleomargarine having a 'trade-name by law.\" And yet again that the Food and Drugs Act (Act June 30, 1906, c. 3915, 34 Stat. 768 [Comp. St.  8717-8728]), which is 'in pari materia, enacts that articles of food containing no poisonous or deleterious ingredients shall not be deemed misbranded' which shall thereafter be known as articles of food under their own distinctive names and not offered for sale under the distinctive name of another article if the name be accompanied on the same label or brand by the name of the place where manufactured or produced. And it is said that the company's oleomargarine bears that statutory trade- name and hence should not be considered misbranded. United States v. Coca Cola Co., \n241 U.S. 265\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 573, Ann. Cas. 1917C, 487, is adduced to support the contention. We do not consider it necessary to follow the company's argument in detail. It is rather involved. We disagree with it. In other words, we are of opinion that the meat inspection act is applicable. This was the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals. The company's oleomargarine is a meat product, compounded, among other things, of oleo oil and neutral lard. \n1\n Besides, it is not sold under the name of oleomargarine alone; there is the qualifying addition of the word 'Creamo,' and used, as we shall hereafter see, to qualify and distinguish it from other combinations which might bear the designation oleomargarine. \n\n[249 U.S. 495, 499]\n\u00a0\n We pass to the consideration of the meat inspection acts of June 30, 1906, and March 4, 1907 (34 Stat. 669, c. 3913 [Comp. St.  8682]; 34 Stat. 1260 [Comp. St.  8681]). They require an inspection of all meat and meat food products prepared for interstate and foreign commerce and provide that no persons or firm or corporation shall offer for transportation, and no carrier shall transport in interstate or foreign commerce, any such products unless marked 'Inspected and Passed,' and that 'no such meat or meat food products shall be sold or offered for sale by any person, firm, or corporation in interstate or foreign commerce under any false or deceptive name; but established tradename or names which are usual to such products and which are not false and deceptive and which shall be approved by the Secretary of Agriculture are permitted.'\n It is the contention of the government that the use of the word 'Creamo' is deceptive and induces the belief that cream is a substantial ingredient of the oleomargarine. The company earnestly contends to the contrary and that, besides, the designation 'Creamo' has received the approval of the Department of Agriculture and has been sanctioned as an appropriate trade-mark by the Interior Department (Patent Office). The latter contention may be immediately put to one side. The test of the product is the meat inspection laws, not the trade-mark laws and therefore we are concerned with the action of the Department of Agriculture and not with that of the Interior Department. And so intimately is the case concerned with the action of the Department of Agriculture that the basic and dominant contention of the government is that to the department is committed the power of determining the fact of the influence of the name and label of the company. In other words, the power of determining whether a trade-name is 'false or deceptive' given by the law to the Secretary of Agriculture is, when exercised, conclusive of the falsity or deception of the name \n\n[249 U.S. 495, 500]\n\u00a0\n (Bates & Guild Co. v. Payne, \n194 U.S. 106\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 595, and cases cited; Fertilizing Co. v. Hyde Park, \n97 U.S. 659\n), and the power necessarily is a continuing one. The contention and the cited cases have been approved very lately in Houston v. St. Louis Independent Packing Co., \n249 U.S. 479\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 332, in which it is declared that the decision of the department, unless arbitrary, is conclusive. A sketch of the evidence, therefore, becomes necessary.\n As early as 1904 there was, if not controversy, discussion between the company and the department. It was not of serious extent. The company was indulged in the representation that its product was composed of 'Butter, Oleo Oil, Neutral, Cream and Salt,' and that these were 'churned in an abundance of richest cream, resulting in a perfect substitute for butter.' But there was objection to a statement that the oils were 'doubly inspected' by the United States inspectors, 'insuring absolute purity and cleanliness.' Such was the condition of things, we may deduce from the testimony, until 1908\n\n\n We may say, in passing, that in the beginning 30 per cent. of cream was used and the word 'Creamo' was selected to suggest such ingredient to repel the criticisms of the butter makers who represented that oleomargarine was produced from 'sewerage and dead horses.' But it appears from the testimony that the use of cream was discontinued, skimmed milk being used instead, it having been discovered by the government chemists that it was not the butter fat in the milk which produced the flavor, but it, the flavor, came from skimmed milk.\n October 2, 1912, an objection came from the department to the use of the company's label and discussion ensued, extending over a period of 12 or 15 months. The department then announced that the use of the word 'Creamo' was 'considered deceptive and misleading and its future use could not be permitted.' It was, however, suggested that 'Creamo Brand Oleomargarine' \n\n[249 U.S. 495, 501]\n\u00a0\n be used, the words to be displayed alike in prominent type, and that cream should be used in the product, its use having been discontinued. Upon this ruling of the department and the resistance of the company to it the contest was waged for a time. The company contended that the word 'Creamo' was arbitrary and not descriptive; the department asserted the contrary and that it 'conveyed a false inference to the consuming public,' and, notwithstanding an offer by the company to use 10 per cent. of cream, insisted upon the use of the word 'brand' and required also some modifications of the label. It further declared that if the requirements of the bureau should not be complied with on and after March 1, 1914, the inspector in charge at St. Louis would be instructed to prohibit 'the use of all labels, wrappers, cartons, etc., which do not bear the bureau stamp of approval and number.'\n Such is the testimony in outline, and it is manifest that the action of the department was not arbitrary, but given upon a consideration of the circumstances and the fact of the trade-name 'Creamo' having a deceptive implication to the consuming public.\n But against the decision of the department the company opposes the previous approval of 'Creamo' as a trade-name and alleges that upon the faith of the approval the company has used the same and by the expenditure of large sums of money-testified to be about $10,000 a year-has made its product public and popular under that name. The answer to the contention is that the meat inspection acts contemplate and confer a continuing inspection and power, a power necessarily not exhausted by one exercise. Besides, the approval was given at a time when the company used 30 per cent. of cream in its product and declared that it and other ingredients were 'churned in an abundance of richest cream, resulting in a perfect substitute for butter.' The indulgence of the department had justification. \n\n[249 U.S. 495, 502]\n\u00a0\n When the practice of the company changed, when it commenced to vary the percentages of cream and finally used none at all, naturally the department changed its ruling. The company can, therefore, claim no right from the prior ruling. There may be value in the use of the trade-name 'Creamo,' as the company asserts, and detriment, it may be, in any change or qualification of it; but its value may be in its deception-its suggestion of cream appealing to the popular preference for that article over skimmed milk, though the scientific judgment may be in favor of the latter, a judgment possibly not known or if known not appreciated or accepted. And the deception would not be taken away and the purpose of the law satisfied by the addition of 10 per cent. of cream which the company offered to make. At least such was the judgment of the department, and we cannot pronounce it arbitrary.\n It will be observed from the quoted provisions of the meat inspection act that two conditions are presented: If 'Creamo Oleomargarine' is to be regarded as the name of the product, it is false and deceptive, whatever it may have been formerly; if it be asserted to be an established trade- name, it has not received the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture, and hence its use is without legal permission.\n Decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case remanded to the District Court, with direction to dismiss the bill.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the decision of the case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Defined in the testimony to be 'a lard produced from the leaf of a pig, neutralized so as to take the taste and smell out of it.' \n\n\n\n\n","30":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBURLESON v.

It was commenced in the United States District Court for the District of Montana by a bill filed therein by the appellees Clark-Montana Realty Company and Elm Orlu Mining Company against appellant Butte & Superior Copper Company, Limited, under a statute of Montana authorizing an action to be brought by any person against another who claims an estate or interest in real property adverse to him, for the purpose of determining such adverse claim.\n The appellees (plaintiffs in the suit) obtained a decree in the District Court quieting their title and decreeing an accounting. Clark- Montana Realty Co. v. Butte & Superior Copper Co., 233 Fed. 547. The decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 248 Fed. 609, 160 C. C. A. 509. To review the latter action this appeal is prosecuted.\n We are confronted with a motion to dismiss on the ground that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals was final, the jurisdiction of the District Court having been, in legal effect, rested, it is asserted, upon diversity of citizenship. To judge of the motion requires a consideration of appellees' statement of their grounds of suit. An outline of them is only necessary.\n At the outset we may say there is a diversity of citizenship, the parties being respectively corporations of Washington and Arizona, and it was so averred.\n The predecessors of appellees (so run the allegations) on April 18, 1875, discovered a vein or lode of mineral-bearing \n\n[249 U.S. 12, 21]\n\u00a0\n rock in the ground described as the Elm Orlu. Discovery was followed by location of the claim and other acts of its appropriation prescribed by the mining laws, proof of which was duly made; and such steps were taken that on December 30, 1882, application for patent was made and patent issued for the claim January 31, 1884. The locators and their successors in interest held, worked, possessed and actually occupied the claim continuously from the date of discovery for more than five years thereafter and during all that time were in the open, notorious, exclusive and uninterrupted possession of it.\n The Clark-Montana Realty Company became the owner of the claim and entitled to its possession and of all veins, lodes or ledges having their tops or apices therein throughout their entire depth between the end lines of said claim extended northerly in their own direction. That company leased the claim to appellee, Elm Orlu Mining Company, which is occupying it by virtue of the lease.\n The appellant is the owner of the Black Rock, Jersey Blue, Admiral Deway and Silver Lode Mining Claims which adjoin the Elm Orlu claim on its north side. Their locations progressed to patent.\n In the Elm Orlu claim there is a vein or lode known as the Rainbow lode, which crosses the west end line of the Elm Orlu claim and proceeds in an easterly direction through it. It was upon this lode that the discovery of the claim was made. Its downward course through the side line of the claim drawn vertically is northerly and it extends downward and passes below the surface of appellant's claims.\n Appellant claims an estate or interest adverse to appellees' in the Rainbow lode, the exact nature of which claim is unknown to appellees, but it is false and groundless.\n The value of the Elm Orlu claim is given, and it is averred that appellant has by means of secret underground works in its possession willfully penetrated the \n\n[249 U.S. 12, 22]\n\u00a0\n Rainbow lode and has extracted and is extracting large amounts of ore therefrom, the exact amount being unknown, but exceeding in value the sum of $50,000.\n It is prayed that appellant declare its title and, when declared, that it be adjudged without merit; that appellees' title be established and appellant enjoined from further assertion of rights adverse to appellees, and for an accounting.\n There is an averment, however, that requires notice. It is as follows:\n'That the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Montana over this suit is invoked and depends upon two grounds, to wit:\n\n'(1) Upon the ground that the construction and application of sections 2322, 2324, 2325, and 2332 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (Comp. St.  4618, 4620, 4622, 4631) are involved, and the amount in controversy exceeds in value the sum of three thousand ($ 3,000) dollars, exclusive of interest and costs, all of which will appear from the facts hereinafter set forth.\n\n'(2) ...'\n\n The averment is explicit and, we may assume, had a purpose; but appellees do not wish to be taken at their word. The confidence they thought and expressed when invoking the powers of the court in the first instance-and providing, we may assume, for review in case of an adverse decision-they now recant and urge that it should not be used to question or disturb their success or become an avenue of relief to their antagonist. This is not unusual and counsel has cited prior examples and the action of the court therein.\n The principle of decision which the court then announced is familiar. It is that the ground of jurisdiction in the District Court and ultimately in this court on appeal from the Circuit Court of Appeals is the statement of the suing party of his cause of suit. And there must \n\n[249 U.S. 12, 23]\n\u00a0\n be substance in it, not mere verbal assertion or the anticipation of defenses. Taylor v. Anderson, \n234 U.S. 74\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 724; Hull v. Burr, \n234 \nU.S. 712, 720\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 892\n\n\n Has appellees' statement these defects? As we have seen, there is a confident assertion that the construction and application of the designated sections of the Revised Statutes are involved, and, turning to them, we find that they are the foundation of the rights to mining claims and express the conditions of their acquisition and extent, and, it would seem, are often the basis of controversies as to them and the solution of the controversies. And realizing this, we may suppose, appellees were at pains to set out the conditions and steps they observed, and lest there might be omission, and in remedy of it if there should be, they availed themselves by appropriate allegations of section 2332, R. S.; that is, they alleged that they were in the actual, open, exclusive and uninterrupted possession of the Elm Orlu, working the same for more than five years (the period of limitation under section 2332) continuously from the date of discovery. And counsel admitted upon a question from the bench at the oral argument, that the allegation had jurisdictional purpose and that resort was had to the federal court that appellees might avail themselves of the provisions of section 2332 and of Clipper Mining Co. v. Eli Mining Co., \n194 \nU.S. 220, 226\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 632, the Supreme Court of Montana having decided1 that a notice of location which failed to comply, as appellees' did, with a statute of Montana was defective. The allegation, therefore, was part of appellees' case- fortified the other allegations as grounds of suit and recovery-and made the suit one involving the construction and application of that section. The motion to dismiss is, therefore, denied.\n On the merits the case is not of novelty. It is the usual \n\n[249 U.S. 12, 24]\n\u00a0\n one of priority of rights in a mineral-bearing vein. The averments of appellees we have given. They are met by appellant by denials, counter averments of location and rights, not only by grounds of defense but of affirmative relief; prayers for recompense for trespasses upon its rights and that its title be quieted against the assertion of appellees.\n In summary description of the controversies in the case we may say they center in the Rainbow lode, so-called-in regard to which the parties are in absolute antagonism both in averment and contention-and incidentally in other lodes.\n Upon the issues thus joined the District Court made certain findings which were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. We take them up in their order as we shall thereby be able to separate the questions of law from the questions of fact.\n\n 1. \nThe court found that the Elm Orlu was located before the Black Rock. Of this finding there can be no doubt if the procedure of the law was observed in the location of the Elm Orlu. The steps in that procedure and their order are well established. The first of them is the discovery of mineral-bearing rock within the claim, and it must precede location. The subsequent steps-marking the boundaries, posting notice, recording-are the declaration of title; the patent is the final evidence of it. Such steps being observed, the right is acquired under the Revised Statutes to the vein on its course and dip to the extent that its top or apex is within the surface boundaries of the claim or within vertical planes drawn downward through them. Lawson v. United States Mining Co., \n207 U.S. 1\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 15; Stewart Mining Co. v. Ontario Mining Co., \n237 U.S. 350\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 610.\n It is, however, provided by section 2322, R. S., that there must be not only compliance with the laws of the United States, but with 'state, territorial and local \n\n[249 U.S. 12, 25]\n\u00a0\n regulations' and appellant asserts that the location of appellees' predecessors did not comply with the territorial statute of Montana and that, therefore, though the location preceded that of appellant, it was destitute of legal sufficiency.\n And it is contended that the Supreme Court of Montana has decided in several cases2 that the requirements of the state statute are imperative and that one of these cases, Baker v. Butte City Water Company, was affirmed by this court. Butte City Water Co. v. Baker, \n196 U.S. 119\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 211.\n It is further contended that 'from the day when final entry of the Black Rock was made, certainly from the day when patent therefor issued, the patentee's title not only to the surface of the claim, but to every vein or lode, the top or apex of which was found within the boundaries thereof became unassailable.'\n The following is the relevant chronology: The location of the Elm Orlu, following discovery of mineral, was made April 18, 1875, the declaratory statement thereof recorded on the 22d of that month; the location of the Black Rock was made November 6, 1875, the declaratory statement recorded the 13th of the same month. The entry for patent of the Black Rock was made November 24, 1880, and patent issued February 15, 1882; the Elm Orlu made final entry December 30, 1882, and patent issued January 31, 1884.\n Such being the order of procedure of the parties, which acquired the title? Or, to express the issue in conformity to the contentions of appellant, was there defect in the location of appellees by reason of the Montana statute and did the prior issue of patent to appellant give impregnability to its title and right to the veins in controversy? The District Court, and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirming it, decided both issues against appellant on the \n\n[249 U.S. 12, 26]\n\u00a0\n grounds: (1) That the Montana cases did not furnish the rule of decision for the federal courts, the better reasoning being (for which cases were cited) that as the Montana statute did not impose a forfeiture hence none resulted from defects in the declaratory statement of the Elm Oriu. (2) That the Elm Orlu people were in possession of their claim, working the same-of which the Black Rock people had knowledge-and that hence the latter could not avail themselves of the defects in the location of the Elm Orlu. Yosemite Mining Co. v. Emerson, \n208 U.S. 25\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 196, was adduced. In the latter ground we concur, and we need not express opinion of the other although it has impressive strength and was conceded to have in Yosemite Mining Co. v. Emerson. Indeed, there was a revulsion in the state against the ruling of the cases and a law was enacted making the issue of a patent for a mining claim conclusive evidence of compliance with the requirements of the laws of the state and making valid all locations under them theretofore made 'that in any respect had failed to comply with the requirements of such laws, except as against one who has located the same ground in good faith and without notice.'\n Yosemite Mining Co. v. Emerson was concerned with a regulation of the state of California which prescribed the manner of the location of a claim. The regulation had not been conformed to and the validity of the location was attacked on that ground by a subsequent locator who had had notice of the claim, he contending that there was forfeiture of it. The contention was rejected and we said, that to yield to it would work great injustice and subvert the very purpose for which the posting of notices was required, which was, we further said, 'to make known the purpose of the discoverer to claim title to the' claim 'to the extent described and to warn others of the prior appropriation.' The comment is obviously applicable to the asserted defects in the declaratory statement of \n\n[249 U.S. 12, 27]\n\u00a0\n appellees. It, like the California requirement, had no other purpose than 'to warn others of the prior appropriation' of the claim, and such is the principle of constructive notice. It-constructive notice-is the law's substitute for actual notice, and to say that it and actual notice are equivalents would seem to carry the self-evidence of an axiom. Besides, in this case there was unequivocal possession of the Elm Orlu and it is elementary that such possession is notice to all the world of the possessor's rights thereunder. Simmons Creek Coal Co. v. Doran, \n142 U.S. 417\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 239.\n The other contention of appellant is, as we have said, that the title not only to the surface of its claim but to every vein whose top or apex was found within it became impregnable by the issue of patent to it. We need not follow the details of counsel's argument to sustain the contention-its reliance is on the dates on which entries for the patents were made, the Black Rock entry preceding that of the Elm Orlu. It is, however, admitted that by the issue of the patent to the Elm Orlu 'it was thereby conclusively adjudicated or determined that at the time of final entry the applicants were entitled to a patent to that claim.' But the admission is combined with the declaration that 'to authorize the courts to give effect to a mining patent as of a date anterior to the final entry, it must be made to appear that prior to that date there was a valid location [italics counsel's] upon which the patent issued.' And to establish that appellees' was not a valid location appellant relies upon the asserted defect in the declaratory statement. With that defect we have dealt and have decided that it had not the consequences ascribed to it. We may say, however, that priority of right is not determined by dates of entries or patents of the respective claims, but by priority of discovery and location, which may be shown by testimony other than the entries and patents. In the absence from the record of an adverse \n\n[249 U.S. 12, 28]\n\u00a0\n suit there is no presumption that anything was considered or determined except the question of the right to the surface. Lawson v. United States Mining Co., supra.\n The relevancy of that case is resisted. Appellant urges that by the application of the Black Rock for patent appellees were 'confronted with the necessity of either adversing or suffering the consequence of a failure to do so,' and the consequence is said to be that the Elm Orlu was made subordinate in time and right to the Black Rock. We cannot assent. The application of the Black Rock for patent did not show a surface conflict and the doctrine of the Lawson Case is that on an application for apatent only surface rights are determined, and Lindley is quoted for the proposition that \"an application for a patent invites only such contests as affect the surface area. ... Prospective underground conflicts are not the subject of adverse claims.\"\n It is true, as we have seen, there was some overlapping of the lines of the claims. If, however, a conflict was thus indicated the Black Rock secured the advantage. The ground within the overlapping lines was included within the Black Rock patent and expressly excepted from the application of the Elm Orlu for its patent. And no part of the decree was determined by it.\n\n 2. \nThe District Court found from the testimony that the Elm Orlu was of prior location and right and in this was confirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. The inevitable consequence is that appellees have title to the veins or lodes whose tops or apices are within the Elm Orlu. This consequence appellant admits at the very beginning of its argument, and says that one of the vital questions in the case is the priority of the claims and that if the Elm Orlu had priority over the Black Rock the appellees would be entitled to all the Rainbow lode between the planes designated by the court and would be also entitled \n\n[249 U.S. 12, 29]\n\u00a0\n 'to all ores within the intersection spaces of that vein with the Jersey Blue vein and the Creden vein.'\n We state the admission not in estoppel of appellant, but only in concentration of attention upon the question for decision. In its solution there are in dispute many elements of importance. Among these necessarily is the question: In which of the claims do the veins apex, course and dip? In the question there is complexity and grounds for diversity of judgment, and the District Court felt and expressed them after hearing and estimating the testimony and the admission of the parties.\n The court (Judge Bourquin) said that the chief contesting claims, the Elm Orlu and the Black Rock, 'have a common side line for 850 feet of the Elm Orlu east and of the Black Rock west end.' And further said:\n'It is now admitted that the Rainbow vein at the apex crosses the Elm Orlu west end line, courses easterly, crosses the common side line and branches in the Black Rock, one strand crossing the Black Rock north side line, and one coursing easterly a disputed distance; that the Pyle strand of the Rainbow at some depth in the Elm Orlu diverges from the south side of the said vein and coursing easterly unites with the Rainbow at the Black Rock 1,100 level; that the Jersey Blue vein at the apex crosses the Black Rock west end line and courses easterly a disputed distance, it and the Rainbow converging on strike and dip to union or crossing; that the Creden vein at some depth in the Elm Orlu near the Black Rock west end diverges from the north side of the Rainbow, courses northwesterly under both claims, and unites with or is cut off by the Jersey Blue. Very large ore bodies are in the Rainbow under both claims, at places bisected on strike by the common side line, and both parties have mined them under both claims. From various names of the veins those herein are chosen to avoid confusion.'\n\n And to all other elements of decision, presented in a trial \n\n[249 U.S. 12, 30]\n\u00a0\n which occupied 16 days, the court gave a painstaking consideration and in estimate of them found the issues in favor of appellees, and carefully adjudged the rights of the contestants according to the lines of their respective properties and the relation of the mineral veins to them.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the findings, saying, by Circuit Judge Gilbert:\n'The appellant does not assert that the findings of fact are unsupported by competent evidence, but contends that they are contrary to the weight of the evidence. The trial court made its findings after an evidently careful and painstaking investigation of the testimony and the exhibits, and after a personal inspection of the mining properties. We have examined the record sufficiently to see that the findings are all supported by the credible testimony of reputable witnesses. Upon settled principles, which this court has always recognized, findings no made upon conflicting testimony are conclusive upon this appeal.'\n\n And we said in Lawson v. United States Mining Co., supra, of the conclusion of the Circuit Court of Appeals in such case-and the concession is as great as appellant is entitled to-'that if the testimony does not show that it [the conclusion of the court] is correct, it fails to show that it is wrong, and under those circumstances we are not justified in disturbing that conclusion. It is our duty to accept a finding of fact unless clearly and manifestly wrong.' The findings accepted, the conclusions of law must be pronounced to be of necessary sequence.\n One of the defenses of appellant is that on October 29, 1906, the Clark-Montana Realty Company, then being the owner of an undivided one- fourth interest in the Black Rock claim, executed and delivered to the predecessors in interest of appellant a deed of release and quitclaim of all its 'right, title, interest, claim and demand ... in and to that certain portion, claim and mining right, title and property on those certain ledges, veins, lodes or deposits \n\n[249 U.S. 12, 31]\n\u00a0\n of quartz and other rock in place, containing precious metals of gold, silver and other metals. ...' And it was stated that it was 'the intention of the party of the first part to convey to the party of the second part all of its right, title and interest in and to the above- described property' (referring to the claim, which was described), 'together with all the dips, spurs and angles, and also all the metals, ores, gold, silver and metal bearing quartz, rock and earth therein. ...'\n The deed is urged as an estoppel and appellant insists that it 'operates to grant the fractional interest in 'all earth, rock and ores' found within the exterior limits of the Black Rock claim extended downward vertically,' citing therefor Montana Mining Co. v. St. Louis Mining & Milling Co. of Montana, \n204 U.S. 204\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 254, and Bogart v. Amanda Consolidated Gold Mining Co., 32 Colo. 32, 74 Pac. 882.\n The cited cases are distinguishable from that at bar. In Montana Mining Co. v. St. Louis Mining & Milling Co. the land was conveyed 'together with all the mineral therein contained,' and the words were distinguished from those conveying extralateral rights and considered as a subject of the grant. In the other case the conveyance was of land in conflict between two claims which were in litigation, and in execution of the intention of the parties the deed was interpreted to convey 'not merely the surface ground in conflict, as contradistinguished from the mineral wealth beneath, but with this surface ground all underlying minerals' except one vein which had been excluded.\n In the case at bar the conveyance was of an undivided one-fourth interest in and to the 'mining claim known as the 'Black Rock' quartz lode mining claim.' It passed no rights or interest that did not belong to that claim or would not appertain to it. Or, to put it in another way, the deed passed the rights and interests that were derived from the United States by the location of that claim and conveyed by the patent to the locators. It was not intended to convey \n\n[249 U.S. 12, 32]\n\u00a0\n any of the rights of the Elm Orlu and denude it of the extralateral rights that the law conferred upon it. In other words, the contention of appellant would make the deed a conveyance of the Elm Orlu as well as of the Black Rock.\n We do not stop to specialize either the contests of or the judgments on particular veins. Their relative locations and the rights in them are disposed of by what we have said. But an earnest and special contest is made on the finding of the court in regard to a vein designated as the Pyle strand. The District Court said, as we have seen, 'that the Pyle strand of the Rainbow at some depth in the Elm Orlu diverges from the south side of the said vein and, coursing easterly, unites with the Rainbow at the Black Rock 1,100 level.' \n3\n And the court decreed the appellees to be the owners of and entitled to the possession of it throughout its entire depth as far as its apex was within the Elm Orlu, but expressly reserved the question of the point where the apex passes out of the Elm Orlu. In other words, in the language of the Circuit Court of Appeals, 'the court left to future development the question of how far the Pyle apex continued in the appellees' location, and to what extent beneath the Black Rock it united with the Rainbow in such position as to be controlled by the apex in the Elm Orlu.' This action of the District Court is attacked by appellant. It admits, however, that the Pyle strand in its downward course unites with the Rainbow at or about a point which would be intersected by a vertical plane passed through the easterly end line of the Elm Orlu extended northerly in its own direction, but denies that the apex or any portion of the apex is within the Elm Orlu and asserts that where its apex is found is altogether conjectural and that 'for aught that appears from the evidence, it may \n\n[249 U.S. 12, 33]\n\u00a0\n have its apex in the Black Rock and, indeed, this is probably the case.' And it is urged that a situation is presented not of the weight of evidence, but of the absence of evidence, or, to quote counsel, the decision is 'one which finds no support whatever in the testimony.' But manifestly these are but assertions-attacks on the estimate of the testimony made by the District Court and Circuit Court of Appeals and the conclusion it justifies.\n It is further said that issue was made upon the title to the Pyle strand and that it was the duty of the court to definitely pass upon it and to decide for appellant, but that 'instead of entering such a decree, the court so framed, and intentionally so framed, its decree that it would not be a bar to a new suit which appellees might thereafter bring against this appellant to quiet title to all of the vein below the plane of union between it and the Pyle strand, if by further development they discovered additional evidence in support of their contention that the Pyle strand did apex in the Elm Orlu at the point of alleged forking and at its apex continued thence easterly to and across the east end line of the Elm Orlu.'\n It is true the apex of the Pyle strand was found to be within the Elm Orlu, but all else as to the vein was reserved and, in the circumstances, properly reserved. There was simply retention of the case for supplementary proceedings, as the Circuit Court of Appeals observed, to carry out the decree and make it effective under altered circumstances. Joy v.

U S(1919)\nNo. 325\nArgued: Decided: May 19, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 14, 15]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William C. Prentiss, of Washington, D. C., for appellants.\n\n\n[250 U.S. 14, 17]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought by appellants to recover the value of certain timber cut from the public lands of the \n\n[250 U.S. 14, 18]\n\u00a0\n United States in the state of Colorado, called 'tie slash' or 'tie slashing,' the term being used to describe the tops of trees the bodies of which have been used for making railroad ties.\n The right of recovery is based upon contracts with the Denver, Northwestern & Pacific Railway Company which had been given the right to cut timber upon the public lands adjacent to the line of its road by the Act of Congress of March 3, 1875, c. 152, 18 Stat. 482 (Comp. St.  4921- 4926).\n The Court of Claims sustained a demurrer to the petition and dismissed it. To review that action this appeal has been prosecuted.\n Appellants were, in June, 1906, by due appointment of the railway company, its timber agents, to cut timber from the public lands for construction of the railroad under the act of Congress, and by agreement with the company they were given all of the 'tie slash' of the trees cut down for the purpose. Pursuant to the contract, and prior to October, 1906, they manufactured and delivered to the company 88,797 ties, which left a large amount of 'tie slash.'\n By a letter from one N. J. O'Brien, describing himself as 'Chief, Field Division, G. L. O.,' and expressed to be by instructions from the Commissioner of the General Land Office, there was granted to appellants authority to cut timber under the act of Congress and 'to sell and dispose of all tops and lops of trees that' they 'might cut for construction' of the road which could not be used for road construction purposes. Inquiry first was to be made of the officers of the railway company if they would purchase the tops and lops appellants had on hand.\n The letter contained a ruling of the Land Office that contractors should confine their cutting strictly to such timber as was needed by the railway company and that such 'refuse' as resulted from such cutting might 'be \n\n[250 U.S. 14, 19]\n\u00a0\n disposed of by the railroad company or by the contractors without violation of existing law.' A violation of the law, it was stated, would require a notice to the company to nullify the contract and agency and would subject the contractors to be proceeded against 'as in ordinary cases of timber trespass.'\n Thereafter appellants entered into another contract with the company under which they manufactured additional ties and delivered them to it, and a further amount of 'tie slash' was left. A large amount of this appellants agreed to sell to the Fraser River Timber Company of Denver, Colorado, and to the Leyden Coal Company of the same place they sold 200 cars of mining props cut by them from the 'tie slash,' all to be used in the state of Colorado.\n March 7, 1907, the land from which the ties had been cut was by presidential proclamation included in the Medicine Bow National Forest and the officers of the Forest Service permitted appellants to remove the poles already cut from the 'tie slash' and also to have all of tops and refuse on the so-called 'fireguard' 200 feet wide along the railway for a distance of two miles, but refused to allow them to have any of the remainder of the 'tie slash,' and took possession of and sold it; and the proceeds were covered into the Treasury of the United States. To recover the sum of the proceeds thus covered into the Treasury, or such other amount as might be found to have been received by the United States from such sale, this action was brought.\n The elements for consideration are not many. The first of these is the act of 1875, supra. It grants as right of way to the railway company [ the grant is to railroad companies of a certain description-we make it particular for convenience] through the public lands of the United States to the extent of 200 feet on each side of its central line, and the right to take from the public lands \n\n[250 U.S. 14, 20]\n\u00a0\n adjacent to its line '... timber necessary for the construction of said railroad.' The right given is to take 'timber,' and this, it is argued, necessarily means 'trees,' and as there is no provision for disposition of what shall be left of them after using such portions for railroad purposes, it must be determined by 'reason and analogy,' and from these appellants argue that the railway company was entitled to the 'tie slash' as incident to its right to cut under the act of Congress. They adduce United States v. Cook, 19 Wall. 591; Shiver v. United States, \n159 U.S. 491\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 54; Stone v. United States, \n167 U.S. 178\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 778.\n The instances of the cases, however, are not in analogy to that of the case at bar. In the first the right was given to Indians as a legitimate use of land reserved by them from the cession of a larger tract to the United States, the right of use and occupancy being unlimited. The second case involved the cutting and sale of timber by a homesteader and they were considered a use of the land, his privileges with respect to standing timber being analogous to those of a tenant for life; the third case was of like kind, and the other two cases were cited. Other cases referred to by appellants struggled with the problem without solving it and we need not review or comment upon their reasoning nor consider some state cases.\n The contention of appellants encounters the rule that statutes granting privileges or relinquishing rights are to be strictly construed; or, to express the rule more directly, that such grants must be construed favorably to the government and that nothing passes but what is conveyed in clear and explicit language-inferences being resolved not against but for the government. Wisconsin Central Railway v. United States, \n164 U.S. 190\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 45; United States v. Oregon, etc., Railway, \n164 U.S. 526\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 165. And the government invokes the rule in the present case and cites in implied support of the invocation United States v. Denver, etc., Railway, \n150 U.S. 1\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 11, and in express \n\n[250 U.S. 14, 21]\n\u00a0\n support of it United States v. Denver, etc., Railway (C. C.) 190 Fed. 825, 826. And these cases were cited by the Court of Claims for its judgment.\n The rule, it seems to us, is particularly applicable. There was a grant of timber by the Cat of March 3, 1875, not of trees, but of timber for purposes of railroad construction, not as a means of business of of profit; nor could it be made an element, as contended, of compensation to the agents employed to cut it.\n Appellants invoke the Act of March 3, 1891, c. 561, 26 Stat. 1095, 1099, in justification and as giving them a right independently of their asserted right derived through the railway company. Section 8 of that act ( Comp. St.  5114) provides that in criminal prosecutions for trespass on public timber lands in Colorado (and some other states) or to recover timber or lumber cut, it shall be a defense to show that the timber was cut or removed from the lands for use in the state by a resident thereof for agricultural, mining, manufacturing or domestic purposes under the rules of the Interior Department, and had not been transported out of the state. But it is provided that nothing in the act contained shall operate to enlarge the rights of any railway company to cut timber on the public domain, and there are other provisions giving the Secretary of the Interior the power to designate the tracts from which the timber may be cut or to prescribe the rules and regulations for the cutting.\n We think it is clear that appellants are not within the provisions of the act. They are not and were not in the designated classes nor contemplated the uses which the act protects. They were agents of the railway company for so much of the timber as was to be used in railroad construction; of what was left they were simply vendors for profit. To enable them to so use the act or to use it for any but the designated purposes would be a violation of that provision of the act which forbids its operation \n\n[250 U.S. 14, 22]\n\u00a0\n 'to enlarge the rights of any railway company to cut timber on the public domain'; it would make the act available to a railroad as a means of profit or other purpose than road construction. And its value would be a temptation to do so. In this case it is alleged that the value of the 'tie slash' that the officers of the Forest Service took possession of (it was only part of that which was cut) 'was, and is, $26,454.90.'\n Finally, appellants rely upon the letter of the Chief, Field Division, General Land Office, supra. The immediate answer is that made by the Court of Claims: the want of power in the officer to enlarge the Act of March 3, 1875, and to give rights in the public lands not conferred by it.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the decision. \n\n\n\n","34":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCAMP v. GRESS(1919)\nNo. 279\nArgued: Decided: June 2, 1919\n\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 308, 309]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. T. D. Savage and Thomas H. Willcox, both of Norfolk, Va., for petitioners. \n\n[250 U.S. 308, 310]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. D. Lawrence Groner, of Norfolk, Va., W. M. Toomer, of Jacksonville, Fla., and Alexander Akerman, of Macon, Ga., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Section 51 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1101 [Comp. St.  1033]) declares that (with exceptions not here material)--\n'No civil suit shall be brought in any District Court against any person by any original process or proceeding in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant; but where the jurisdiction is founded only on the fact that the action is between citizens of different states, suit shall be brought only in the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant.'\n\n Resting jurisdiction wholly on diversity of citizenship, Gress, a citizen and resident of Florida, brought, in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Virginia, this action against P. D. Camp, P. R. Camp, and John M. Camp, alleging them to be citizens of Virginia and residents of that district. One of them, John M., filed a 'plea to jurisdiction,' asking that the suit be dismissed, because he was not a citizen or resident of the district in which it was brought, but a citizen of North Carolina, resident in the Eastern district thereof. P. D. and P. R. Camp filed a separate 'plea to jurisdiction' setting up the same facts, alleging that the cause of action sued on was joint and inseparable, and denying jurisdiction as to themselves also, because there was none as to John M. Camp. The pleas were overruled; the case proceeded to trial; a verdict was rendered against the three defendants; and judgment was entered thereon. Exceptions had been duly taken both by John M. and by P. D. and P. R. Camp to the decision overruling their pleas to the jurisdiction, and by the three defendants to certain ruling at the trial alleged to be erroneous; but \n\n[250 U.S. 308, 311]\n\u00a0\n the judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (244 Fed. 121, 156 C. C. A. 549). A writ of certiorari was granted by this court (\n245 U.S. 655\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 14).\n First. The several defendants below, although not citizens of the same state, were all citizens of states other than that of the plaintiff. Hence the diversity of citizenship requisite to federal jurisdiction existed. Sweeney v. Carter Oil Co., \n199 U.S. 252\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 55. The objection of John M. Camp is not to the jurisdiction of a federal court, but to the jurisdiction over him of the court of the particular district; that is, the objection is to the venue. He asserts the personal privilege not to be sued in a district other than that of his residence, since the action is not brought in the district of the plaintiff's residence. If he were a sole defendant, or if none of the defendants resided in the district where suit was brought, the privilege asserted would be supported by the very language of the statute. Macon Grocery Co. v. Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co., \n215 U.S. 501\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 184. Section 51 of the Judicial Code does not in terms provide for the case where there are several defendants. Does the limitation of jurisdiction to the district of the residence 'of either the plaintiff or the defendant' mean also of all the plaintiffs or all the defendants, so that, when the several defendants are not all residents of the district in which they are sued, the nonresident may assert the privilege not to be sued therein? The precise question has not been decided by this court; but the construction already given to this section in analogous cases and to analogous provs ions in other statutes makes it clear that the privilege asserted should be sustained.\n Section 51 of the Judicial Code embodies in substance the Act of March 3, 1887, c. 373,  1, 24 Stat. 552, as corrected by Act of August 13, 1888, c. 866,  1, 25 Stat. 433 (Comp. St.  1033). From the passage of the original Judiciary Act September 24, 1789, c. 20,  11, 1 Stat. 73, 79 ( Comp. St.  991), until 1887, suit could be brought not only in the district of defendant's resi \n\n[250 U.S. 308, 312]\n\u00a0\n dence, but also in any other district in which the defendant was found. The 1887-1888 act accomplished its purpose of restricting the jurisdiction of the federal courts, in part, by limiting the districts in which suit might be brought to that of the defendant's or of the plaintiff's residence. See In re Keasbey & Mattison Co., \n160 \nU.S. 221, 228\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 273. In Smith v. Lyon, \n133 U.S. 315\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 303, the question was presented whether this limitation prohibited suit in a district in which some, but not all, of the plaintiffs were resident. The court felt itself controlled largely by the construction which had been given in Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 3 Cranch, 267, to a clause of the original Judiciary Act, similar in language and analogous in subject-matter, and had been steadfastly adhered to since. There this court construed the phrase 'where ... the suit is between a citizen of the state where the suit is brought, and a citizen of another state,' as meaning 'that where the interest is joint, each of the persons concerned in that interest must be competent to sue, or liable to be sued, in those courts [courts of the United States].' Adopting a like construction, this court held in Smith v. Lyon, supra, that suit could not be brought in a district in which some, but not all, of the plaintiffs resided. The rule declared in Strawbridge v. Curtiss had been applied indiscriminately to plaintiffs and defendants; and after the decision in Smith v. Lyon it was generally assumed in the lower courts that the rule there applied to plaintiffs must likewise be applied to defendants. \n1\n Compare Shaw v. Quincy Mining \n\n[250 U.S. 308, 313]\n\u00a0\n Co., \n145 U.S. 444\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 935; Geneva Furniture Co. v. Karpen, \n238 \nU.S. 254, 259\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 788. The same assumption appears to have been made in Interior Construction & Improvement Co. v. Gibney, \n160 U.S. 217\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 272, where the question was raised whether the resident defendant could avail himself of the objection that another defendant, who was a nonresident, was not liable to suit therein. And in Ladew v. Tennessee Copper Co., \n218 \nU.S. 357, 364\n, 365 S., 31 Sup. Ct. 81, a like rule was applied; for it was there held that, although an alien defendant could be sued in any district where found, an American citizen joined with him as codefendant could not, without his consent, be sued in a district other than that of his or the plaintiff's residence.\n It is said, however, that section 51, if read in connection with section 50 (Comp. St.  1032) and in the light of their regislative history, shows that it was the intention of Congress to confer jurisdiction over all the defendants found within the district, if one of them resides therein. Section 50,2 which embodies without substantial change the Act of February 28, 1839, c. 36,  1, 5 Stat. 321, makes provision for enforcing a cause of action which exists against several persons, although one of them is neither an inhabitant of nor found within the district in which suit is brought and does not voluntarily appear. It does so by permitting the court to entertain jurisdiction without prejudice to the rights of the party not regularly served nor voluntarily appearing. The argument is that, in order to give \n\n[250 U.S. 308, 314]\n\u00a0\n effect to the retention in section 50 of the words 'found within the disrict,' we must, although these words were omitted from section 51, hold that, where there are several defendants, the court has jurisdiction of all, if one or more are residents of the district, and the others are found there. The argument overlooks the fact that section 50 is applicable not only to cases in which the venue is dependent upon the residence of a defendant in the district where suit is brought, but also to those cases in which it is dependent upon the residence of the plaintiff. Ordinarily jurisdiction could be obtained in the district of the plaintiff's residence only over nonresidents, because all of the defendants must be nonresidents in order to satisfy the requirement of diversity of citizenship. And as to these there can be personal jurisdiction only so far as found within or voluntarily appearing within the district. To such persons the term 'inhabitants' in section 50 obviously cannot refer. If the provision therein concerning those not 'found' had been omitted, a suit would fail in case any one of those who at common law was a necessary party defendant should not be found therein or voluntarily appear. Shields v. Barrow, 17 How. 130. As the act of 1887-1888 did not restrict jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship in those cases where the venue is determined by the residence of the plaintiff, it was appropriate to retain in the earlier statute (now section 50) the words 'found within the district,' although it had ceased to be operative in cases where the venue is determined by the residence of the defendants.\n On the other hand, section 52 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1034) makes it clear that the construction contended for by defendant is unsound. It provides that where a state contains more than one district a suit (not of a local nature) against a single defendant must be brought in the district where he resides, 'but if there are two or more defendants, residing in different districts of the state, it may be \n\n[250 U.S. 308, 315]\n\u00a0\n brought in either district.' We thus have an express declaration by Congress that under one particular set of circumstances a codefendant may be sued in a district in which he does not reside. 'Expressio unius est exclusio alterius.' This section follows directly after that which contains the general prohibition against suing a defendant in a district other than that in which he or the plaintiff resides, and constitutes one of the specified exceptions to the general prohibition. It shows, therefore, that the prohibition of section 51 expresses the deliberate purpose of Congress that a person shall not be compelled to submit to suit in the federal District Court in a state within which neither he nor the plaintiff resides, although a codefendant may reside therein. The history of section 52 confirms this conclusion. It is substantially a re-enactment of section 740 of the Revised Statutes. After the passage of the act of 1887-1888 restricting the jurisdiction of the federal courts, considerable doubt arose as to whether the provisions of that act now contained in section 51 of the Judicial Code did not repeal section 740 of the Revised Statutes. Compare Petri v. Creelman Lumber Co., \n199 U.S. 487\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 133.3 Congress re-enacted in the Judicial Code this provision expressly permitting, in states having more than one district, all defendants resident within the state to be sued in any district thereof in which one of them resides; while it made no similar provision for the case where the several defendants reside in different states. If Congress, in re-enacting the provisions of section 51, had intended that it should establish a rule with reference to defendants resident in different states contrary to the construction placed by the overwhelming weight of authority upon \n\n[250 U.S. 308, 316]\n\u00a0\n the identical provision contained in the earlier statute, it would have expressed that intention in unmistakable language.\n No reason appears, therefore, for refusing to apply here the rule of Smith v. Lyon, supra. The objection made below that the plea to the jurisdiction is bad because not limited by its terms to the question of jurisdiction over the particular defendant is highly teh nical, and was hardly insisted upon here; and the contention that his exemption from suit was waived by the acknowledgment on the summons of service is clearly unfounded. John M. Camp properly asserted his privilege by plea to the jurisdiction, and the plea should have been sustained. It follows that the judgment against him is void; that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, in so far as it affirms the judgment of the District Court against him, should be reversed; and the suit should be dismissed as to him.\n Second. The plea to the jurisdiction filed by P. D. and P. R. Camp was properly overruled. The objection was based wholly on the fact that John M. Camp was not suable within the district. This is an exemption from suit personal to the nonresident of the district. A resident codefendant cannot avail himself of the objection. \n4\n If John M. had been an indispensable party, the failure to obtain jurisdiction over him would, of course, be fatal to the maintenance of the suit. Barney v. Baltimore City, 6 Wall. 280. But he was not an indispensable party; and under section 50 of the Judicial Code the trial court might, if it had sustained John M.'s plea to the jurisdiction, have rendered judgment against the other two defend \n\n[250 U.S. 308, 317]\n\u00a0\n ants; for this is an action on a joint contract, and one of the several joint contractors is not an indispensable party defendant in such a suit. Clearwater v. Meredith, 21 How. 489.\n Third. P. D. Camp and P. R. Camp contend that, in view of the error in overruling John M. Camp's plea to the jurisdiction and proceeding to judgment against him, the court may not confine its action to correcting the error by setting aside the judgment and dismissing the suit as to him, but must set aside the judgment as against all the defendants, thus requiring a new trial as against the other two. But this is not a necessary result of erroneously retaining jurisdiction over John M. Camp; for, as above shown, John M. was not an indispensable party to a suit to enforce the liability of the other two joint obligors; and if the trial court had sustained his plea to the jurisdiction, the suit might, under section 50 of the Judicial Code, have proceeded to judgment as against the other defendants. Whether the error committed in retaining jurisdiction over John M. requires a reversal of the judgment as against the other defendants depends upon whether that error may have prejudiced them. The record does not show that the error committed could have prejudiced them in any way; and their counsel admitted at the bar that the error had not prevented them from availing themselves of any defense, and had not influenced the admission or rejection of evidence, or the granting or refusal of any instruction asked or given. Only error which may have resulted in prejudice could justify reversal of a judgment. Compare Yazoo & Mississippi Valley Railroad Co. v. Mullins (No. 273) \n249 U.S. 531\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 368, decided April 21, 1919\n\n\n It is, however, contended that the Virginia practice would require a reversal of the judgment as against all defendants, and that the Conformity Act (Revised Statutes,  914 [Comp. St.  1537]) requires that the state practice be followed. If such were the Virginia practice, which is denied, it \n\n[250 U.S. 308, 318]\n\u00a0\n would not be binding on this court. The Conformity Act by its express terms refers only to proceedings in District (and formerly Circuit) Courts and has no application to appellate proceedings either in this court or in the Circuit Court of Appeals. Such proceedings are governed entirely by the acts of Congress, the common law, and the ancient English statutes. United States v. King, 7 How. 833, 844; Boogher v. Insurance Co., \n103 U.S. 90\n, 95; Chateaugay Ore & Iron Co., Petitioner, \n128 U.S. 544\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 150; St. Clair v. United States, \n154 \nU.S. 134, 153\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 1002; Francisco v.

In cases coming from federal courts the Supreme Court is given by statute full power to enter such judgment or order as the nature of the appeal or writ of error (or certiorari, section 240 of the Judicial Code [Comp. St.  1217]) requires. Revised Statutes,  701 (Comp. St.  1669). Circuit Court of Appeals Act of March 3, 1891, c. 517,  11, 26 Stat. 826, 829 (Comp. St.  1124). See, also, section 10 of the same act ( Comp. St.  1670). Compare Ballew v. United States, \n160 \nU.S. 187, 198\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 263, et seq. And by Act of February 26, 1919 ( Public-No. 281-65th Congress), amending section 269 of the Judicial Code ( Comp. St.  1246) the duty is especially enjoined of giving judgment in appellate proceedings 'without regard to technical errors, defects, or exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.'\n The error in retaining jurisdiction over John M. Camp does not, therefore, require that the judgment as against the other two defendants be set aside.\n Fourth. P. D. and P. R. Camp contend, however, that the judgment against them should be reversed also on the ground that there was error in the instructions as to the measure of damages . The contention must be examined, as the whole case is here on writ of certiorari and the objection was properly saved. Lutcher & Moore Lumber Co. v. Knight, \n217 \nU.S. 257, 267\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 505; Delk v. St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad Co., \n220 \nU.S. 580, 588\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 617. \n\n[250 U.S. 308, 319]\n\u00a0\n Gress was the owner of the entire capital stock of the Morgan Lumber Company, a corporation which held the title to sawmill properties in Florida. The three defendants Camp were the owners of valuable timber lands near the mill. By contract under seal dated August 18, 1913, the Camps agreed to join with Gress in organizing a corporation under the name of Levy County Lumber Company to which Gress would convey the sawmill properties which the parties valued at $125,000, and the Camps would convey the timber lands which they valued at $375,000; that Gress should receive, in exchange for the mill properties, five-eighteenths of the stock in the new company, and the Camps, in exchange for the lands, thirteen-eighteenths of the stock; and that the parties should in that proportion finance the company. Gress was ready and willing and able to perform his part of the contract; and the Camps broke it by definitely refusing to perform. The only question in the case seriously controverted was the amount of damages recoverable. There was evidence that by reason of the breach of contract which resulted in depriving the mill of its timber supply its value depreciated heavily. The trial judge charged the jury that among the elements of damages recoverable was the amount of the depreciation in the market value of the mill between the date of the contract and the date of the breach. The objection made to this ruling was based wholly on the ground that, as the mill properties were vested in the Morgan Lumber Company, Gress could not recover more than nominal damages, although he owned all of its stock. The contention is that before it could be determined whether plaintiff, as owner of the stock of the Morgan Lumber Company, sustained any damages by reason of the depreciation in value of the mill property, an accounting and settlement of the Morgan Lumber Company's affairs would be necessary; and it is urged that the lower court, in rejecting a ruling to that \n\n[250 U.S. 308, 320]\n\u00a0\n effect and in charging as it did, held erroneously that the person who owns the entire capital stock of a corporation is in fact and in law identical with the corporation.\n The contention appears to rest upon a misapprehension of the plaintiff's position. The contract recited that Gress owned the mill, and that the title only was in the Morgan Lumber Company. If so, the depreciation would clearly be a loss suffered by Gress, and he could recover as compensation an amount equal tot hat loss, since he was equitable owner with power to require an immediate conveyance of the legal title. There was also introduced in evidence a vote of the directors of the Morgan Lumber Company, which, referring to the contract of August 18, 1913, as having been made by Gress 'representing the Morgan Lumber Company,' approved the same 'in its entirety.' There was not a particle of evidence that any other person had any interest of any kind in the corporation or its assets. Consequently whether Gress entered into the contract technically on his own behalf or technically as agent for the corporation, his undisclosed principal, is immaterial. In either case the suit is one brought by him individually; in either case all the loss suffered through defendant's breach of contract is recoverable by Gress; in either case the measure of damage is the same. \n5\n There is no basis for the contention that an accounting and settlement of the Morgan Lumber Company's affairs was necessary in order to determine the amount of plaintiff's loss; and the failure to require such an accounting does not involve any disregard of the corporate entity.\n The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals denying the contention that the plaintiff was entitled to recover only thirteen-eighteenths of the loss due to the depre \n\n[250 U.S. 308, 321]\n\u00a0\n ciation in the mill properties was clearly correct. If the jury believed as contended that defendant's breach of contract, by depriving those properties of a timber supply, reduced their value, the plaintiff's loss in that respect was the whole of the reduced value. On the other hand, if the market value of the timber lands increased, the plaintiff's loss from being deprived of the gain from this source was, as the court ruled, only five-eighteenths of that gain. There was no other objection taken which requires us to consider whether the rulings as to damages were in other respects proper.\n The judgment as to P. D. Camp and P. R. Camp is affirmed, and as to John M. Camp is reversed, and the case as so modified is remanded to the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Virginia, with directions to dismiss the suit as to John M. Camp.\n Modified and affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] E. g., Turk v. Illinois Cent. R. Co., 218 Fed. 315, 316, 134 C. C. A. 111 (Sixth Circuit); Excelsior Pebble Phosphate Co. v.

Consaul and Joseph W. Bailey, both of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[250 U.S. 208, 212]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Proceeding in equity under the law of Kentucky for an accounting from the Capital Trust Company as administrator de bonis non of the estate of Thomas N. Arnold, deceased, and that the estate be settled and distributed.\n Defendant in error Calhoun and Calhoun & Sizer, a firm cm posed of C. C. Calhoun and Adrian Sizer, attorneys at law, appeared in the proceeding and by cross-petition prayed judgment against the trust company as such administrator for the sum of $1,504.50, with interest from July 10, 1915. \n\n[250 U.S. 208, 213]\n\u00a0\n An outline of the facts is as follows:\n Thomas N. Arnold, prior to his death, believing that he had a just claim against the United States, entered into a contract with the firm of Calhoun & Sizer and employed it to undertake the prosecution of the claim, and on August 1, 1905, entered into a written contract with it by which in consideration of the services rendered and to be rendered by it in the prosecution of the claim, he agreed to pay it a fee equal in amount to 50 per cent. of whatever sum of money should be awarded or collected on the claim, the payment of which was made a lien upon the claim or upon any draft or evidence of payment that might be issued in liquidation thereof.\n The firm undertook the prosecution of the claim and bills were introduced in Congress for its payment, and on May 22, 1908, it was referred to the Court of Claims by a resolution of the United States Senate for findings of fact under section 14 of the Act of March 3, 1887, c. 359, 24 Stat. 507, now section 151 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1138 [Comp. St.  1142]). About that time the firm of Calhoun & Sizer was dissolved and subsequently Arnold died and the beneficiaries of the estate entered into a written contract with defendant in error, C. C. Calhoun, to continue the prosecution of the claim and agreed to pay him 50 per cent. of the amount which might be collected, the fee to be a lien 'on any warrant' which might ' be issued in payment of the claim.'\n January 15, 1912, the Court of Claims made findings of fact in the matter of the claim and stated the amount thereof as $5,051. The court's findings were certified to Congress and that body, by an act approved March 4, 1915 (38 Stat. 968, c. 140), made an appropriation for the payment of the claim and the Secretary of the Treasury was directed to pay it.\n The act, however, contained the following provisions:\n'That no part of the amount of any item appropriated in this bill in excess of twenty per centum thereof shall be \n\n[250 U.S. 208, 214]\n\u00a0\n paid or delivered to or received by any agent or agents, attorney or attorneys on account of services rendered or advances made in connection with said claim. It shall be unlawful for any agent or agents, attorney or attorneys to exact, collect, withhold or receive any sum which in the aggregate exceeds twenty per centum of the amount of any item appropriated in this bill on account of services rendered or advances made in connection with said claim, any contract to the contrary notwithstanding. Any person violating the provisions of this act shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be fined in any sum not exceeding one thousand dollars.' 38 Stat. 996.\n\n June 7, 1915, Calhoun requested the Secretary of the Treasury to issue a warrant to him for the sum of $1,003, which he recited was to be payable to him on account of services as attorney in the claim of the Capital Trust Company against the United States, as appropriated for by the act of Congress, the receipt of said warrant to be taken and accepted as a full and final release and discharge of any claim he had against the United States on account of services in said claim.\n Afterward, on July 1, 1915, notice was given to Calhoun, as attorney for the claimant, that in settlement of the claim a check was mailed to him for $1,003, being 20 per cent. of the claim, and to the trust company as administrator de bonis non of Arnold, check for $4,012. A part of this money is still in the hands of such administrator and there is no other property belonging to the estate.\n The cross-petition additionally asserts the following: No part of the fee except the sum of $1,003 has been paid and there is a balance due of $ 1,504.50, with interest from July, 191, the date the money was received by the trust company.\n July 10, 1915, Calhoun presented his claim to the administrator duly proved and demanded payment, but payment was refused. The whole of the $1, 504.50, there \n\n[250 U.S. 208, 215]\n\u00a0\n fore, remains unpaid, and he, Calhoun, has a lien upon the fund for the payment, he having accepted the check for $1,003 under protest and only on account. The contract preceded the act of Congress and when the act was passed such contracts were lawful and Congress was without authority to take from him his property without due process of law or just compensation therefor or to deprive him of his liberty of contract.\n This is repeated and emphasized in various ways and the Fifth Amendment is especially invoked as sustaining it, and for which reasons it is alleged that the 'attempted limitation of attorney's fees by said act' was 'null and void.'\n A demurrer to the cross-petition was overruled and the trust company answered. A detail of its averments is not necessary. It practically admits those of the cross-petition and pleads in defense the provisions of the act of Congress, and also section 3477, R. S. (Comp. St.  6383).\n A demurrer was sustained to the answer and judgment rendered for Calhoun for the sum of $1,504.50, with interest from July 1, 1915. The judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. The court said:\n'This case runs on all fours with Black v. O'Hara's Adm'r, 175 Ky. 623, 194 S. W. 811, where it was held that the act of Congress approved March 14, 1915, appropriating money for the payment of similar claims and containing a similar provision limiting an attorney's fee to 20 per cent. of the amount recovered, was in so far as it attempted to limit the amount of the fee heretofore earned, unconstitutional and invalid.\n\n'We have been urged to recede from the rule announced in Black v. O'Hara's Adm'r, supra, as being unsound in principle; but after a careful reconsideration of the reasoning by which the decision in that case is supported, we are satisfied of its soundness and reaffirm it.'\n\n We encounter at the outset a question upon the form \n\n[250 U.S. 208, 216]\n\u00a0\n of the judgment. The cross-petition was presented in a proceeding to require an accounting of the administrator of Arnold and the petition asserted a claim and lien upon the money in the administrator's hands received from the United States government. The judgment, however, does not refer to that money or the lien upon it; it provides only that Calhoun recover of the administrator 'the sum of fifteen hundred four and 50\/100 dollars, with interest from July 1, 1915, and his costs herein and may have execution,' etc.\n If the judgment only etablishes a claim against the administrator to be satisfied, not out of the moneys received from the United States but from other assets of the estate, a situation is presented which it was said in Nutt v. Knut, \n200 \nU.S. 13, 21\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 216, would not encounter legal objection. In other words, the limitation in the act appropriating the money to 20 per cent. as the amount to be paid to an agent or attorney would have no application or be involved.\n But the judgment is construed by the parties as having more specific operation, construed as subjecting the money received from the government to the payment of the balance of Calhoun's fee, doubtless because the estate has no other property. On that account it is attacked by the trust company and defendant by Calhoun. The controversy thus presented is discussed by counsel in two propositions: (1) The validity of the contract independently of the limitation imposed by Congress upon the appropriated money; (2) the power of Congress to impose the limitation as to that money. The latter we regard as the main and determining proposition; the other may be conceded, certainly so far as fixing the amount of compensation for Calhoun's services (we say Calhoun's services, as the appearance of the firm of Calhoun & Sizer was withdrawn), and even so far as the contract provided for a lien, if the distinction made by counsel be tenable-that \n\n[250 U.S. 208, 217]\n\u00a0\n is, a distinction between a lien on the claim and a lien 'upon any draft or evidence of payment,' to quote from the first agreement, or 'on any warrant which may be issued in payment,' to quote from the second agreement.\n So far as the contract fixed the amount of fee it is within the rule of Nutt v. Knut, supra, and, for the sake of the argument, the lien may be conceded to be valid against section 3477, R. S., to the contrary, if it be regarded as having been given, not upon the claim, but upon its evidence, as counsel contend. It may, therefore, not only excape the defect that was held fatal to the lien asserted in Nutt v. Knut, but may claim the support of McGowan v. Parish, \n237 U.S. 285\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 543.\n We, however, need not dwell upon the distinctions (their soundness may be disputed) nor upon the contentions based upon them, because, as we have said, we consider the other proposition, that is, the power of Congress over the appropriated money and the limitation of payment out of it to an agent or attorney to 20 per cent. of the claim, to be the decisive one.\n In its discussion counsel for Calhoun have gone far afield and have invoked many propositions of broad generality-have even adduced as impliedly against the power, if we understand counsel, the constitution of the Court of Claims and its jurisdiction as weight in the same direction.\n We can only instance some of the points of the argument. The Act of February 26, 1853, c. 80, 10 Stat. 161, now section 823, R. S. (Comp. St.  1375), is cited as recognizing the right of attorneys to compensation for their services in claims against the United States and it is said that contracts for such compensation have been universally sanctioned as legal. And, further, official statement are adduced to the effect that the Court of Claims is so constituted 'that the successful prosecution of a claim' in it 'is something more than a merely perfunctory performance on the part of \n\n[250 U.S. 208, 218]\n\u00a0\n counsel'; it is a matter of great business hazard and risk to counsel when done upon purely contingent fees. And in many cases, it is further urged, no other than contingent fees are possible and to deny them is practically to deny the right to counsel. Mr. Justice Miller is quoted from, in Taylor v. Bemiss, \n110 U.S. 42\n, 3 Sup. Ct. 441, in illustration of such result and its injury.\n The right to counsel being thus recognized, and recognized antecedently to the contract now involved, it became, counsel contend, a 'pre-existing valid right,' and to take it away is to divest the right-to take it away is to deprive of property of value assured of protection by the Constitution of the United States. To sustain the contentions a number of state cases are cited. Among them is Black v. O'Hara, Adm'r, 175 Ky. 623, 194 S. W. 811, the case which the Court of Appeals regarded as authority for its ruling in the present case.\n In a general sense there is force and much appeal in the contentions, but we think they carry us into considerations beyond our cognizance. Liberty in any of its exertions and its protection by the Constitution are of concern. The right to bind by contract and require performance of the contract are examples of that liberty and that protection and they might have resistless force against any interfering or impairing legislation if the contest in the case was simply one between Calhoun and the Arnold estate. But there are other elements to be considered-there is the element of the condition Congress imposed on the subject-matter of the controversy regarded as a condition of its grant. Relief could only be had through legislation. This was petitioned and the Senate of the United States was prompted to refer the claim to the Court of Claims. A defect of remedy remained even after the court had been thus invoked and had reported the amount and facts of the claim. Further legislation was necessary, but it could not have beenc ompelled; it \n\n[250 U.S. 208, 219]\n\u00a0\n was optional, not compulsory; and it would seem to require no argument to convince that the terms of its enactment must be taken as expressed and the relief it granted accepted with the condition imposed upon it. Indeed, the proposition is confused by its discussion. And it is certainly difficult to deal with the distinction that counsel makes between preexisting and prospective transactions. The right is absolute and universal and necessarily must be to have any strength at all. It is only arbitrary in the sense that many of the contract between Arnold and Calhoun, have seen there was exertion of one of its powers in the present case-not, however, to interfere with or lessen the asserted obligation of the contract between Arnold and Calhoun, but to limit only the application of the money gratuitously appropriated in the payment of attorney's fees. The contention is that this cannot be done, or, to put it another way, that the appropriation, though it could not be compelled, was yet subservient to the contract of Calhoun (and, we may interject, if for 50 per cent. for any per cent. or terms) and that he was entitled to all the contract provided, denuded of the condition imposed upon the appropriation.\n The contention has no legal basis, and it may be said it has no equitable one. Neither the justice nor the policy of what sovereignty may do or omit to do can be judged from partial views or particular instances. It is easy to conceive what difficulties beset and what circumstances had to be considered in legislating upon such claims. Definite dispositions were matters of reflection and, it may be, experience-imposition was to be protected against as well as just claims provided for, and, considering claimants and their attorneys in the circumstances, it may have seemed to Congress that the limitation imposed was fully justified, that 20 per cent. of the amounts appropriated would be a proper adjustment between them. We are not concerned, however, to accuse or defend. Whatever might have been \n\n[250 U.S. 208, 220]\n\u00a0\n the moving considerations, the power exercised must be sustained. Frisbie v. United States, \n157 U.S. 160\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 586; Ball v. Halsell, \n161 U.S. 72\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 554.\n The first case dealt with conditions upon pension legislation; the second concerned a claim against the United States on account of Indian depredations. It is, therefore, contended that they are unlike Calhoun's contract with Arnold and that their principle is not applicable. We think otherwise. The legislation passed on was sustained as within the power of government.\n We conclude, therefore, that Calhoun's claim for a balance due as fees cannot be paid out of the moneys appropriated by Congress and now in the hands of the administrator de bonis non, or recognized as having any validity as against that fund. Beyond this we need not go.\n Judgment reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES concurs in the result.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the decision. \n\n\n\n","36":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCAPITOL TRANSP CO. v.

The findings of fact are contested here, and because of some expressions it is suggested that the Circuit Court of Appeals is to be taken not to have made findings of its own upon the facts. On the contrary it appears to us to have reconsidered the evidence, giving to the findings below only the weight usually accorded to those of the tribunal that see the witnesses and we see no sufficient reason for departing from the general rule where the two lower courts have concurred. Luckenbach v. McCahan Sugar Refining Co., \n248 \nU.S. 139, 145\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 53. \n\n[249 U.S. 334, 336]\n\u00a0\n We are urged to reconsider the question whether the limitation of liability is not made independent of the 'privity or knowledge' of the owner by the omission of those words from the Act of June 26, 1884, c. 121 ,  18, 23 Stat. 53, 57 (Comp. St.  8028), coupled with the repeal, in section 30, of all laws and parts of laws in conflict with the provisions of that act. It is argued that the effect of the omission and the repealing section is to do away with the former qualification in Rev. Stat .  4283 (Comp. St.  8021), and the argument is fortified by a reference to the history of the act, which shows that some of the Senators thought it important to make the limitation absolute. On the other hand in butler v. Boston & Savannah Steamship Co., \n130 \nU.S. 527, 553\n, 554 S., 9 Sup. Ct. 612, 616 (32 L. Ed. 1017), it was said by Mr. Justice Bradley that possibly the later act was intended to remove all doubt as to the application of the law to all cases of loss 'caused without the privity or knowledge of the owner.' We find no different expression in O'Brien v. Miller, \n168 \nU.S. 287, 303\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 140. Mr. Justice Bradley's opinion was adopted after considerable discussion in Richardson v. Harmon, \n222 \nU.S. 96, 106\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 27, and Richardson v. Harmon was accepted as establishing that the statute does not limit liability for the personal acts of the owners done with knowledge, in the late case of Pendleton v. Benner Line, \n246 \nU.S. 353, 356\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 330. In that case the argument that the limitation of the exoneration to acts, etc., done or incurred without the privity or knowledge of the owner was repealed by the Act of 1884, was presented in the fullest way.\n We very much appreciate the danger that the act should be cut down from its intended effect by too easy a finding of privity or knowledge on the part of owners, as also by too liberal an attribution to them of contracts as personally theirs. We are not disposed to press the law in those directions further than the cases go. But in this case in addition to the finding of the owner's privity to the unseaworthiness was the further finding that the \n\n[249 U.S. 334, 337]\n\u00a0\n contract was the personal contract of the petitioner-a finding that seems warranted if any contract by a corporation can fall within the class. That such contracts may impose a liability that cannot be transferred to what is left of the ship is decided. Luckenbach v. W. J. McCahan Sugar Refining Co., \n248 \nU.S. 139, 149\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 53. Upon the whole case we cannot escape from the conclusion that the decree must be affirmed.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","37":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCAREY v. SOUTH DAKOTA(1919)\nNo. 346\nArgued: Decided: May 19, 1919\n\n\n\n W. E. Carey was prosecuted by the State of South Dakota for shipping game birds.\nJudgment of conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state (39 S. D. 524, 165 N. W. 539), and defendant brings error.\n Affirmed. \n\n[250 U.S. 118, 119]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Joe Kirby, of Sioux Falls, S. D., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Clarence C. Caldwell and Edwin R. Winans, both of Sioux Falls, S. D., for State of South Dakota.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By the federal Migratory Bird Act (Act March 4, 1913, c. 145, 37 Stat. 828, 847 [Comp. St.  8837]), Congress provided that:\n'All wild geese, wild swans, brant, wild ducks, snipe, plover, woodcock, rail, wild pigeons, and all other migratory game and insectivorous birds which in their northern and southern migrations pass through or do not remain permanently the entire year within the borders of any state or territory, shall hereafter be deemed to be within the custody and protection of the government of the United States, and shall not be destroyed or taken contrary to regulations hereinafter provided therefor.'\n\n These regulations relate to the fixing of 'closed seasons, having due regard to the zones of temperature, breeding habits, and times and line of migratory flight.' The act further declared that:\n'Nothing \n\n[250 U.S. 118, 120]\n\u00a0\n herein contained shall be deemed to affect or interfere with the local laws of the states and territories for the protection of nonmigratory game or other birds resident and breeding within their borders, nor to prevent the states and territories from enacting laws and regulations to promote and render efficient the regulations of the Department of Agriculture provided under this statute.'\n\n Regulations were proclaimed October 1, 1913 (38 Stat. 1960), and were amended by the proclamation of August 31, 1914 (38 Stat. 2024), and the proclamation of October 1, 1914 (38 Stat. 2032).\n Before the passage of the federal law the Legislature of South Dakota had provided (Laws 1909, c. 240,  29) that:\n'No person shall ... ship, convey or cause to be shipped or transported by common or private carrier, to any person, either within or without the state, ... wild duck of any variety. ...'\n\n For violation of this statute by shipping on November 19, 1915, by express, wild ducks from a point within the state to Chicago, Ill., Carey was prosecuted in a state court. He insisted that the state statute had been abrogated by the federal law. The contention was overruled, and he was convicted by the trial court. Its judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state (State v. Carey, 39 S. D. 524, 165 N. W. 539). The case comes here on writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1156 [Comp. St.  1214]).\n It is admitted that, in the absence of federal legislation on the subject, a state has exclusive power to control wild game within its borders and that the South Dakota law was valid when enacted, although it incidentally affected interstate commerce. Geer v. Connecticut, \n161 U.S. 519\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 600; Silz v. Hesterberg, \n211 U.S. 31\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 10. The contention made by Carey is that Congress assumed exclusive jurisdiction over this class of migratory birds by the 1913 act; that then existing state laws on the subject were thereby abrogated or suspended; that the power of the states to legislate on the subject was limited to such subsequent \n\n[250 U.S. 118, 121]\n\u00a0\n enactments as were designed to render more effective regulations issued by the Department of Agriculture, and that the statute in question was obviously not of that character, both because it antedated the federal act and because the regulations issued under the federal act permitted the killing of wild ducks in South Dakota between September 7 and December 1, during which period the wild ducks shipped on November 19 had presumably been killed. On behalf of the state, it was contended that this provision of its statute is not inconsistent with the federal law; and that its statute is in any event valid, because the federal law is unconstitutional. United States v. McCullagh (D. C.) 221 Fed. 288. The Supreme Court of South Dakota did not pass upon the constitutional question, but upheld the state statute on the ground that it was not inconsistent with the federal law, since it did not appear that the ducks in question had been killed in violation of any regulation adopted under it.\n The prohibition of the federal act is limited to the provision that the birds 'shall not be destroyed or taken contrary to regulations.' The regulations merely prescribe the closed seasons; that is, neither the federal law nor the regulations deal with shipping. \n1\n The prohibition of the state law here in question is limited to forbidding persons to 'ship ... by common or private carrier.' It applies alike whether the shipment is made in open or closed season, and it applies although the birds were lawfully killed or taken. This provision of the state law is obviously not inconsistent with the federal law. The fact that other provisions of this state statute may be so (which we do not consider) is immaterial, as the provision here in question may clearly stand alone. Brazee v. Michigan, \n241 \nU.S. 340, 344\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 561, Ann. Cas. 1917C, 522; Guinn v. United States, \n238 \nU.S. 347, 366\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 926, L. R. A. 1916A, 1124; Louisville & Nashville Railroad Co. v. \n\n[250 U.S. 118, 122]\n\u00a0\n Garrett, \n231 \nU.S. 298, 311\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 48; Presser v. Illinois, \n116 \nU.S. 252, 263\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 580.\n It is, however, urged that Congress has manifested its intention to assume exclusive jurisdiction of the subject; and that the failure to make any provision in the federal act concerning shipping, evidences the purpose of Congress that the shipping of game birds shall not be prohibited. This argument rests upon the clause which declares that the migratory birds 'shall hereafter be deemed to be within the custody and protection of the government of the United States.' But that clause may not be read without its context; and the words immediately following show that the custody and protection is limited to prohibiting their being 'destroyed or taken contrary to regulations' which are to fix the closed seasons in the several zones. If, reading the federal act as a whole, there were room for doubt, two established rules of construction would lead us to resolve the doubt in favor of sustaining the validity of the state law. First. The intent to supersede the exercise by a state of its police powers is not to be implied unless the act of Congress fairly interpreted is in actual conflict with the law of the state. Savage v. Jones, \n225 \nU.S. 501, 533\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 715; Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Haber, \n169 \nU.S. 613, 623\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 488. Second. Where a statute is reasonably susceptible of two interpretations, by one of which it would be clearly constitutional and by the other of which its constitutionality would be doubtful, the former construction should be adopted. Harriman v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n211 \nU.S. 407, 422\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 115; Knights Templars' Indemnity Co. v. Jarman, \n187 \nU.S. 197, 205\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 108.\n The Supreme Court of South Dakota did not err in its judgment unholding the constitutionality of the provision of the state statute under which the plaintiff in error was convicted; and its judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (Act July 3, 1918, c. 128, 40 Stat. 755 [Comp.

U S(1919)\nNo. 122\nArgued: Decided: November 10, 1919\n\n\n\n Messrs. William R. Andrews, and George H. Lamar, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Messrs. Solicitor General Alex C. King, of Atlanta, Ga., Asst. Attorney General Davis, and George M. Anderson, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought to recover from the United States $51,000 in American gold coin with interest from 1869, \n\n[250 U.S. 545, 546]\n\u00a0\n based upon a contract alleged to have been made in that year by the United States as the result of a deposit of the principal sum claimed on a war vessel of the United States. The court, concluding that the facts alleged had no substantial tendency to establish a contract liability on the part of the United States either express or implied, dismissed the suit for want of jurisdiction as its power to adjudge against the United States extended only to obligations of that character. A written opinion was filed, but no finding of facts was made. The United States suggests that the cause be remanded for such finding, but if that course were pursued only the relevant facts could be embraced in the finding and as all such facts were admitted by the court below, the case is open to our consideration and we think there is no necessity for remanding it.\n In the petition which was filed in 1902 by Ricardo Cartas, now the appellant, it was alleged that about 33 years before, in January, 1869, Carlos del Costillo deposited on board the American flagship Contoocook, then in Havana Harbor, Spanish gold the equivalent of $51,000 in American gold coin. It was alleged that the deposit was evidenced by a receipt given by the American consul at Havana and that the petitioner was the grandson of Costillo and was vested by inheritance with all his rights growing out of the deposit. It was further alleged that the deposit was a contract between the depositor and the United States binding the United States to preserve and return the deposit when demanded, and that it had never been returned; indeed, that no demand for its return had been made during the time which elapsed either by Costillo or by any one authorized to represent him or his interest. Further, it was averred that, although it appeared from the files of the Navy Department that a few months after the deposit was made, that is in April, 1869, it had been returned by the officer commanding the Contoocook \n\n[250 U.S. 545, 547]\n\u00a0\n to one Arridondo, acting as the agent of Costillo and who was believed by such commanding officer to be fully authorized to receive it, nevertheless the contract obligation on the part of the United States yet existed because said Arridondo was not the agent of Costillo and the United States remained bound to return the said deposit and was not relieved therefrom by the payment made by such officer, although in good faith to a person not entitled to receive it.\n Admitting the facts thus alleged, it is indisputable that the only question for decision is the making of the alleged contract with the United States. Indeed, it is to that question and to that question alone that the errors assigned and the contentions advanced to sustain them relate. They all are based upon a power in the commanding officer to contract on behalf of the United States asserted to be conferred by paragraph 13 of article 8 of the 'Articles for the Government of the Navy' ( Rev. Stat.  1624 [Comp. St.  2969]), as elucidated by section 1020 of the Navy regulations. A brief reference to the matters thus relied upon will bring us to the end of the controversy.\n The first, the statutory provision, imposes a penalty upon any person in the navy who--\n'takes, receives, or permits to be received, on board the vessel to which he is attached, any goods or merchandise, for freight, sale, or traffic, except gold, silver, or jewels, for freight or safe-keeping, or demands or receives any compensation for the receipt or transportation of any other article than gold, silver, or jewels, without authority from the President or the Secretary of the Navy.'\n\n The wide discretion possessed by the commanding officer of a naval vessel concerning the receipt on board, for the protection of private rights, of gold, silver or jewels, which it was the obvious purpose of this statute not to modify, since the power as to such articles was excepted from the additional limitation which the statute imposed \n\n[250 U.S. 545, 548]\n\u00a0\n as to other articles, affords no ground for the implication that contract obligations would automatically arise as against the United States from the mere exercise by the officer of his discretion. A consideration of the nature of the objects which the provision excepted and the complex and varied character of the conditions which might call for the exercise of the discretion add cogency to this view and at once suggest the incongruity and conflict which must result from the contrary contention.\n And this view serves also to dispose of the contention based upon section 1020 of the Navy Regulations which but comprehensively recognizes that compensation due for services rendered as the result of the exercise of the discretion of the officer, to permit the articles in question to be taken on board, should be applied, not for the benefit of the United States in virtue of any contract relation with the subject, but for the benefit of the officers and men designated in the proportions stated in the regulation. Indeed, the co-ordination which the regulation thus manifests between the burden resulting from the exercise of the discretion to receive on board and the distribution of the emoluments arising from its exertion serves to point out the entire unison between the expression of legislative power and the administrative regulation and to make clear the disregard of both which would inevitably result from sustaining the contention as to contract obligation on the part of the United States now relied upon.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","39":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCAVANAUGH v. LOONEY(1919)\nNo. 107\nArgued: Decided: January 13, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. Joseph Manson McCormick, of Dallas, Tex., for appellants. \n\n[248 U.S. 453, 454]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. B. F. Looney and C. M. Cureton, both of Austin, Tex., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The University of Texas is a state institution under immediate control of officers known as regents, appointed by the Governor, with its principal educational departments in Travis and Galveston counties. An act of the Legislature, approved August 30, 1911 (S. B. No. 20, c. 6, General Laws Texas) undertook to authorize the regents to purchase or condemn through proceedings in the district courts such lands within those counties as they might deem expedient for extension of campus or other university purposes. Appellants have long owned and used as a residence homestead twenty-six acres in Travis county desirable as an addition to the university grounds. Having failed in their efforts to purchase, the regents were about to meet and ask the Attorney General to institute proceedings to condemn this entire tract. Thereupon appellants instituted this proceeding against them and the Attorney General in the United States District Court seeking to restrain their threatened action--\n'on the ground [among others] that said law conflicts with the Constitution of the United States, in that the defendants are thereby pretendedly authorized to take plaintiffs' property without due process of law, and plaintiffs are thereby deprived of the equal protection of the laws.'\n\n They alleged invalidity of the act because in conflict with both state and federal Constitutions and averred:\n'That unless restrained by writ for this honorable court, the said defendants constituting the board of regents of the University of Texas will, at their next meeting aforesaid, request the Attorney General to file a petition in the dis \n\n[248 U.S. 453, 455]\n\u00a0\n trict court of Travis county for the condemnation of their property or a part thereof under said pretended act, and that the said Attorney General, unless so restrained, will comply with said request of the board of regents, acting under said purported act, and that the filing of such petition will cause irreparable loss and damage to your petitioners by impounding their property in court pending the disposition of said proceeding and will cloud the title thereto and prevent the vending of same or any part thereof.'\n\n The challenged act provides: That if the regents cannot agree with the owners for purchase they shall request the Attorney General to file petition in the district court of the county, describing the land, stating purpose for which desired, and praying that its value be ascertained and decree be entered vesting title thereto in the state; that upon filing such petition the owner shall be cited as in other civil causes; that at the first term thereafter the cause shall be tried by a jury upon a single issue as to the value of the land and the decision of such jury shall be final-provided there shall be a right of appeal as in other civil cases; that when the value has been ascertained and the court satisfied therewith it shall enter a decree vesting title but not until such amount together with all reasonable costs and expenses including reasonable attorney's fees shall be paid to the owner or into court for his benefit.\n It is alleged that the act of 1911 especially offends the Constitution of Texas because a local law passed without the required notice; and that it is bad under both federal and state Constitutions because (1) it delegates to the board of regents power to determine what property is reasonably necessary for the purposes mentioned and forbids inquiry concerning this by the court; (2) it forbids inquiry into the damages to the remainder of a tract where a part only is taken; and (3) it permits the state \n\n[248 U.S. 453, 456]\n\u00a0\n to acquire fee simple title to property which thereafter may be sold. It is further alleged that appellants' property is so situated that to take a part would necessarily cause serious damage to the remainder.\n A special court assembled as provided by section 266, Judicial Code ( Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1162 [Comp. St.  1243]), denied application for preliminary injunction without opinion and allowed this direct appeal.\n It is now settled doctrine--\n'that individuals, who, as officers of the state, are clothed with some duty in regard to the enforcement of the laws of the state, and who threaten and are about to commence proceedings, either of a civil or criminal nature, to enforce against parties affected an unconstitutional act, violating the federal Constitution, may be enjoined by a federal court of equity from such action.'

The jurisdiction should be exercised only where intervention is essential in order effectually to protect property rights against injuries otherwise irremediable.\n When considered in connection with established rules of law relating to the power of eminent domain, complainants' allegation of threatened 'irreparable loss and damage' appear fanciful. The detailed circumstances negative such view and rather tend to support the contrary one. Nothing indicates that any objections to the validity of the statute could not be presented in an orderly way before the state court where defendants intended to institute condemnation proceedings; and if by any chance the state courts should finally deny a federal right the \n\n[248 U.S. 453, 457]\n\u00a0\n appropriate and adequate remedy by review here is obvious.

Cunningham, Jr., both of Savannah, Ga., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Samuel H. Sibley, of Union, Ga., and John C. Hart, of Atlanta, Ga., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity brought by the Railway Company to prevent the collection of certain taxes, which, it is alleged, would be contrary to Article 1,  10, and to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The case was heard on bill, demurrer and answer and certain agreed facts, and the Court of first instance issued an injunction as prayed. The decree was reversed however by the Supreme Court of Georgia and a writ of error was taken out to bring the case here. It presents another attempt to accomplish, by a change in form, what in Wright v. Central of Georgia Ry. Co., \n236 U.S. 674\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 471, was held to be an unconstitutional result.\n In that decision it was explained how the Central of Georgia Railway Company had become the holder of leases from the Augusta & Savannah and the Southwestern Railroad of property which by the charters of the lessors was to be taxed only in a certain way and to a certain amount. An attempt had been made to tax the lessee for the property, the leases being for one hundred and one years, renewable in like periods upon the same terms forever. The tax was laid upon the real estate, road \n\n[248 U.S. 525, 527]\n\u00a0\n bed, and franchise value, (with a certain deduction,) of the two lessors. It was held that the statutes made the fee exempt from other taxation than that provided for, in favor as well of the lessee as of the lessor. The taxes now attempted to be levied are upon the leasehold interests of the lessee in the same roads and it is argued that, if the leases produce a profit in excess of the rental, the value is required to be taxed by the Constitution of the State. But the Constitution was subsequent to the charters that created the exemption and must yield to them if they apply to the present attempt. We are of opinion that although the decision in the former case necessarily was confined to the question before the Court, the reasoning applies with equal force to that now before us. The cases of Rochester Ry. Co. v. Rochester, \n205 U.S. 236\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 469, and Jetton v. University of the South, \n208 U.S. 489\n, 28 Sup.

Baird, \n239 \nU.S. 126, 132\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 28. We must follow the precedent that was established after full discussion and with recognition of the difficulties involved.\n The charter contracts in question are of a kind that goes back to the time when railroads were barely beginning and that would not be likely to be repeated, but of course will be carried out by the State according to what was meant when they were made.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","41":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCENTRAL OF GEORGIA RY.

Ct. 181, as it had been decided a few terms earlier that it was exempt from taxation upon the fee of the same roads. Wright v. Central of Georgia R. Co., \n\n[250 U.S. 519, 524]\n\u00a0\n \n236 U.S. 674\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 471. A rehearing was granted on the question whether the exemption thus adjudged to exist extends to portions of the plaintiff in error's road let to it by the Southwestern Railroad and the Muscogee Railroad, which were assumed to be embraced in the decision but were not specially discussed. The consideration of the court was directed especially to the charter of the Augusta and Waynesboro Rail Road granted in 1838 and having features characteristic of the conception of railroads then entertained. \n236 \nU.S. 678, 679\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 471. It is argued that the charters of the other lessors just named, granted at a later date, even when limiting the corporation's liability to taxation in similar words, should be construed in a different way.\n The charters of the Southwestern and the Muscogee Railroads were not granted until 1845, and while like the earlier ones they provided that the said railway and its appurtenances and all property therewith connected, or the capital stock of the said Rail Road Company, should not be subject to be taxed higher than one-half of one per cent. upon its annual net income, they did not contain the provisions that showed the Legislature in 1838 to contemplate indifferently a revenue derived from using, from sharing, or from letting the special privileges granted-provisions that were of weight in the decision of the Court.\n But we are satisfied that between 1838 and 1845 there had been no such change in the policy of Georgia as to require the same words to be given a different meaning at the later date from that which we have decided that they had at the former. Circumstances had not changed when express power to let was given in 1852. The Muscogee was merged in the Southwestern under an act of 1856, but the exemption remained superior to legislative change. Southwestern R. R. Co. v. Georgia, \n92 U.S. 676\n. As remarked by Chief Justice Waite in a like suit between the same parties, the language of the exempting clause is somewhat unusual, and means the railroad specified in the \n\n[250 U.S. 519, 525]\n\u00a0\n charter and none other. Southwestern R. R. Co. v. Georgia, \n116 U.S. 231\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 375. But conversely it means that that road shall be exempt while owned by this corporation whether used or demised.\n We see nothing in the later statutes or Constitutions that attempts to substitute a new contract or to impair the obligation of the one originally made. Different opinions were entertained on the main question which this rehearing does not reopen; but taking that as settled we cannot believe that any real distinction can be made between the charter of the Augusta and Waynesboro and those of the Southwestern and Muscogee roads.\n The decree of last term must stand and that of the state Court must be reversed.\n Decree reversed.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, Mr. Justice PITNEY, Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice CLARKE dissent. \n\n\n\n","42":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHALKER v. BIRMINGHAM & N. W. RY. CO.(1919)\nNo. 283\nArgued: Decided: April 21, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[249 U.S. 522, 523]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. C. E. Pigford, of Jackson, Tenn., and Watson E. Coleman, of Washington, D.

Spragins, of Jackson, Tenn., for defendants in error.\n\n\n[249 U.S. 522, 525]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The point for determination is the liability of J. W. Wright, Jr., a citizen and resident of Alabama with his chief office therein, who engaged in the business of constructing a railroad in Tennessee, for the tax prescribed by section 4 of 'An act to provide revenue for the state of Tennessee and the counties and municipalities thereof,' approved May 1, 1909 (Acts of Tenn. 1909, c. 479, pp. 1726, 1727, 1735), which provides:\n'Sec. 4. Be it further enacted, that each vocation, occupation, and business hereinafter named in this section is hereby declared to be a privilege, and the rate of taxation on such privilege shall be as hereinafter fixed, which privilege tax shall be paid to the county court clerk as provided by law for the collection of revenue.\n\n ...\n'Each foreign construction company, with its chief office outside of this state, operating or doing business \n\n[249 U.S. 522, 526]\n\u00a0\n in this state, directly or by agent, or by any subletting contract, each, per annum, in each county . . . $100.00\n\n'Each domestic construction company and each foreign construction company, having its chief office in this state, doing business in this state, each, per annum, in each county . . . $25.00\n\n'The above tax shall be paid by persons, firms, or corporations engaged in the business of constructing bridges, waterworks, railroads, street-paving construction work, or other structures of a public nature.'\n\n Replying to the claim that the statute in effect discriminates against citizens of other states the Supreme Court of Tennessee, in Wright v. Jackson Const. Co., 138 Tenn. 145, 152, 153, 196 S. W. 488, 490, said:\n'The determining feature in the legislation quoted is the having of one's chief office in this state. Any citizen of this state, as well as any citizen of a foreign state, who has his chief office out of the state, must pay the $100 tax; so of any domestic corporation, as well as foreign corporation, having its chief office out of the state. Any foreign corporation or citizen of another state, or firm, as well as domestic corporations, citizens of this state, and firms of this state having its or their chief office in this state, are all alike entitled to carry on a railroad construction business here on the payment of $25. There is no discrimination at all.'\n\n With this conclusion we are unable to agree. Accepting the construction placed upon it by the Supreme Court, we think the quoted section does discriminate between citizens of Tennessee and those of other states by imposing a higher charge on the latter than it does on the former, contrary to section 2, art. 4, of the federal Constitution:\n'The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.'\n\n The power of a state to make reasonable and natural classifications for purposes of taxation is clear and not questioned; but neither under form of classification nor \n\n[249 U.S. 522, 527]\n\u00a0\n otherwise can any state enforce taxing laws which in their practical operation materially abridge or impair the equality of commercial privileges secured by the federal Constitution to citizens of the several states.\n'Excise taxes, it is everywhere conceded, may be imposed by the states, if not in any sense discriminating; but it should not be forgotten that the people of the several states live under one common Constitution, which was ordained to establish justice, and which, with the laws of Congress, and the treaties made by the proper authority, is the supreme law of the land; and that that supreme law requires equality of burden, and forbids discrimination in state taxation when the power is applied to the citizens of the other states. Inequality of burden, as well as the want of uniformity in commercial regulations, was one of the grievances of the citizens under the Confederation; and the new Constitution was adopted, among other things, to remedy those defects in the prior system.' Ward v. Maryland, 12 Wall. 418, 431 (20 L. Ed. 449); Guy v. Baltimore, \n100 U.S. 434\n, 439; Blake v. McClung, \n172 \nU.S. 239, 254\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 165; Darnell & Son v. Memphis, \n208 \nU.S. 113, 121\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 247.\n\n As the chief office of an individual is commonly in the state of which he is a citizen, Tennessee citizens engaged in constructing railroads in that state will ordinarily have their chief offices therein, while citizens of other states so engaged will not. Practically, therefore, the statute under consideration would produce discrimination against citizens of other states by imposing higher charges against them than citizens of Tennessee are required to pay. We can find no adequate basis for taxing individuals according to the location of their chief offices- the classification, we think, is arbitrary and unreasonable. Under the federal Constitution a citizen of one state is guaranteed the right to enjoy in all other states equality of commercial privileges with their citizens; but he cannot have his chief office in every one of them. \n\n[249 U.S. 522, 528]\n\u00a0\n It is insisted that no tender of any sum for license tax was made in time, and therefore plaintiff in error cannot question the validity of the enactment because of discrimination. But the Supreme Court expressly declared that the statute fixed the liability of Wright at $100. A tender of less would have availed nothing and it was therefore unnecessary.\n The judgment of the court below is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\n\n\n","43":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHESAPEAKE & DELAWARE CANAL CO. v. U.S.(1919)\nNo. 192\nArgued: Decided: May 19, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. Charles J. Biddle, of Philadelphia, Pa., for plaintiff in error. \n\n[250 U.S. 123, 124]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Alexander C. King, Sol. Gen., of Atlanta, Ga., and G. Carroll Todd and Lincoln R. Clark, both of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1912 the United States sued the Canal Company to recover the amount of three dividends which had been declared on shares of its capital stock owned by the government, in the years 1873, 1875, and 1876, payment of which, it was averred, had been refused when demand was made therefor in the year 1911\n\n\n After various vicissitudes the case went to trial on issue joined on the plea of payment by the company and it comes into this court on writ of error to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.\n There are forty-one assignments of error in this court, which counsel in their brief compress into five questions, and these resolve themselves, at once, into three, viz.: (1) The applicability of the statute of limitations of the state of Delaware; (2) the admissibility in evidence of certain books of the Department of the Treasury; and (3) the propriety of a requested instruction in favor of the Canal Company.\n Such a record constrains us to repeat the following:\n'This practice of unlimited assignments is a perversion of the rule, defeating all its purposes, bewildering the counsel of the other side, and leaving the court to gather from a brief, often as prolix as the assignments of error, which of the latter are really relied on.' Phillips, etc., Construction Co. v. Seymour, \n91 U.S. 646\n, 648 (23 L. Ed. 341), Grayson v. Lynch, \n163 U.S. 468\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 1064, and Central Vermont Ry. Co. v. White, \n238 U.S. 507\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 865, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 252.\n\n The plea of the statute of limitations was rejected by both lower courts, and, although the specific assignment of this ruling as error in the Circuit Court of Appeals is \n\n[250 U.S. 123, 125]\n\u00a0\n not repeated in this court, it will be considered because possibly embraced within some of the general assignments.\n Both lower courts ruled that the government was not bound by the state statute of limitations and that the doctrine of laches was not applicable to it, but they agreed that a rebuttable presumption of payment arose after the lapse of more than twenty years from the date when the debt became due, without suit being instituted to collect it, and that, this appearing from the pleadings of the government, the burden was upon it of overcoming the presumption by evidence that payment, as it averred, had not been made. The company, without introducing any testimony, relied wholly upon this presumption of payment.\n Although the burden of the responsibility of proving nonpayment was accepted by the government, the Canal Company, nevertheless, argues that the state statute of limitations is also applicable.\n It is settled beyond controversy that the United States when asserting 'sovereign' or governmental rights is not subject to either state statutes of limitations or to laches.\n That the doctrine of laches is not applicable to the government was announced by Mr. Justice Story on the circuit in 1821 and afterward in 1824 authoritatively, upon principle, in United States v. Kirkpatrick, 9 Wheat. 720.\n This rule has been often approved and was applied so lately as Utah Power & Light Co. v. United States, \n243 \nU.S. 389, 409\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 387.\n That the United States is not bound by state statutes of limitations is settled with equal definiteness in United States v. Nashville, etc., Ry. Co., \n118 U.S. 120\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 1006; United States v. Whited & Wheless, \n246 \nU.S. 552, 561\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 367.\n Whether this rule extends to and includes the presumption of payment arising from the lapse of twenty years \n\n[250 U.S. 123, 126]\n\u00a0\n without suit to collect is not questioned by appropriate exceptions in the record before us, and it is, therefore, not decided. It is not intended, however, to approve the holding of the Circuit Court of Appeals on this subject. United States v. Thompson, \n98 U.S. 486\n, 489, and cases hereinbefore cited.\n The contention of the Canal Company that the government by becoming a stockholder in a private corporation so abdicated its governmental character that, under the circumstances of this case, it was bound as a private person by statutes and rules of limitation, cannot be allowed.\n If the government were asserting any rights with respect to the conduct of the corporation's affairs, its contracts or its torts, then its rights, duties and privileges would be no greater than those of any other stockholder. Bank of the United States v. Planters' Bank, 9 Wheat. 904, 907. But here the government is pursuing a right to recover, which is not affected by its relation to the corporation as a stockholder. The declaration of the dividends, which is admitted, gave it the status of a creditor of the company, and, thereafter, the right to recover was unaffected by any stockholder relation. To this must be added that the statutes and rules of limitation relate to the remedy to enforce the right, and not to the corporate relation from which the right springs, and that, since these dividends constituted 'public money' applicable to public purposes only, the government in collecting them was acting in its governmental capacity as much as if it were collecting taxes, such as those with which, no doubt, the stock which produced the dividends was purchased. The Circuit Court of Appeals answered this contention in a manner not to be improved upon, saying (223 Fed. 926, 928, 139 C. C. A. 406, 408 [L. R. A. 1916B, 734]):\n'We may perhaps add a few words to say that the fallacy of the company's argument seems to lurk in the assumption that in this action the government is asserting a right \n\n[250 U.S. 123, 127]\n\u00a0\n in its character as a stockholder. Undoubtedly the right came into being because the government owns the stock, but in no other respect has the suit anything to do with such ownership. The government is not suing as a stockholder; it is suing as a creditor, and in this character alone is it now to be considered.'\n\n The questions remain as to the admissibility of the books and the sufficiency of the evidence to carry the case to the jury.\n The government produced a witness who testified that he, in conspiracy with another employe of the Canal Company, embezzled the amount of these dividends and that to conceal their crime they placed in the files of the Canal Company, from which they were produced in evidence, forged drafts purporting to have been drawn by Assistant Treasurers of the United States upon the treasurer of the Canal Company for payment of these dividends and also what purported to be receipts therefor. This witness testified that until 1886, when he left the employ of the Canal Company, no notice of the declaration of the three dividends in controversy had been sent to the government, as had been the practice when earlier dividends were declared; that until that time no payment of them had been made, and that the names signed to the drafts and receipts were fictitious.\n The government also produced the notices by the Canal Company of the declaration of each of the fourteen earlier dividends and the record of the payment of them.\n To supplement this evidence the books were produced in evidence, the admission of which is assigned as error.\n Employes of the Department of the Treasury, who produced the books testified: That they were records of the department compiled by authority of law under the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury and were the volumes in daily use by officials and employes in the discharge of their duties; that part of them were printed \n\n[250 U.S. 123, 128]\n\u00a0\n from the original records of miscellaneous revenues, in which such dividends would be classed, while others were printed compilations from books not of original entry, and the testimony was that the volumes produced were intended to, and the witnesses believed did, show all of the miscellaneous receipts and disbursements of the government from 1848 to 1914. They showed the receipt by the government of fourteen dividends paid by the Canal Company prior to those in controversy, and the witnesses testified that a careful search made by them failed to discover any record in the books of the receipt of any of the three dividends sued for. There was an elaborate description of the method employed by the Department of the Treasury in keeping its accounts and of the necessarily contemporaneous character of the original entries, which it is not necessary to rehearse. The copies produced were printed by the Public Printer.\n The objection is that these are not books of original entry and that they are not certified as copies of public records are required to be by Rev. St.  882 (Comp. St.  1494).\n It is enough to say of this last contention that although the books admitted were printed from written public records, they were so printed by authority of law and were produced from the custody of the Department of the Treasury, where they were used as original records in the transaction of the daily business of the department, and therefore they did not require certification.\n They were public records, kept pursuant to constitutional and statutory requirement. Constitution of the United States, Article 1,  9, cl. 7; Act of Congress, approved September 2, 1789, c. 12,  2 (1 Stat. 65 ); Rev. St.  257 (Comp. St.  386); Act of Congress, approved September 30, 1890 (26 Stat. 504, 511, c. 1126); Act approved July 31, 1894, (c. 174 ,  15, 28 Stat. 210 [Comp. St.  388]). Thus, their character as public records required by law to be kept, the official character of their contents entered under the sanction of public duty, \n\n[250 U.S. 123, 129]\n\u00a0\n the obvious necessity for regular contemporaneous entries in them and the reduction to a minimum of motive on the part of public officials and employes to either make false entries or to omit proper ones, all unite to make these books admissible as unusually trustworthy sources of evidence. Gaines v. Relf, 12 How. 472, 570; Bryan et al. v. Forsyth, 19 How. 334, 338; Post v. Supervisors, \n105 U.S. 667\n, 670; Oakes v. United States, \n174 \nU.S. 778, 783\n, 796 S., 19 Sup. Ct. 864; Holt v. United States, \n218 \nU.S. 245, 253\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 2, 20 Ann. Cas. 1138. Obviously such books are not subject to the rules of restricted admissibility applicable to private account books. The considerations which we have found rendered the books admissible in evidence as tending to prove the truth of the statements of entries contained in them also make them admissible as evidence tending to show that because the receipt of the dividends was not entered in them they were not received and therefore were not paid. The evidence may not be as persuasive in the latter case as in the former, but that it was proper evidence to be submitted to the jury for the determination of its value we cannot doubt. Such books so kept presumptively contained a record of all payments made, and the absence of any entry of payment, where it naturally would have been found if it had been made, was evidence of nonpayment proper for the consideration of the jury. United States v. Teschmaker et al., 22 How. 392, 405; State v. McCormick, 57 Kan. 440, 46 Pac. 777, 57 Am. St. Rep. 341; Bastrop State Bank v. Levy, 106 La. 586, 31 South. 164; Wigmore on Evidence,  1531, and section 1633, par. 6.\n We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that the evidence introduced carries clear conviction that the dividends were never paid, and that the request of the Canal Company for an instructed verdict in its favor was properly denied. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","44":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO & E I R. CO. v.

Whitnel, of East St. Louis, Ill., for plaintiff in error.[ Chicago & E I R Co v. Collins Produce Co \n249 U.S. 186\n (1919) ]\n\n\n[249 U.S. 186, 188]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles Wham and Fred L. Wham, both of Centralia, Ill., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[249 U.S. 186, 189]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On March 21, 1913, the plaintiff in error, the initial carrier, accepted a carload of live poultry from the de fendant \n\n[249 U.S. 186, 190]\n\u00a0\n in error, the shipper, for transportation from Cypress, Illinois, to Newark, New Jersey, and issued the customary bill of lading, containing the provision that the carrier should not be liable for any loss or damage to the property 'caused by the act of God ... or the authority of law.'\n In the progress of transportation the car arrived at Dayton, Ohio, on the morning of March 25th, and was there delayed by a flood caused by rains so unprecedented that on that date martial law was declared applicable to Dayton and the territory in which the car was held. The flood waters overflowed the rails on which the car stood, but did not reach the body of the car so as to affect the health of the poultry and access to and from it was readily maintained by the caretaker.\n On March 31st the state military authorities took possession of the car and distributed its contents to persons rendered destitute by the flood.\n Suit against the carrier, based on the bill of lading, commenced in a state court, was removed to the appropriate District Court of the United States.\n On the trial of the case the shipper introduced evidence tending to prove that the confiscation was due to the solicitation of representatives of the carrier and to their false representation that the fowls were dying from lack of food and attention and had been or were about to be abandoned by the caretaker, but the railroad company denied this and introduced evidence tending to prove that there was no such solicitation or false representation and that the confiscation was rendered necessary by the exigencies of the situation and by the necessity for supplying food to the people rendered homeless by the flood.\n The trial court charged the jury:\n That it was the duty of the carrier to transport the property to destination, if it could do so; that it could not overcome the flood or the action of the military authori ties \n\n[249 U.S. 186, 191]\n\u00a0\n and that if the latter acted of their own volition the shipper could not recover; but that if the military authorities seized the consignment solely upon and by reason of the invitation of the railroad company, and if, but for this confiscation, the property or any part of it, in the exercise of ordinary care, could have been transported to its destination, then the defendant, the carrier, would be liable for the value of such part of it as the jury might find from the evidence could have reached its destination, to be determined by the invoice price at the point of shipment, less any deterioration caused by the delay solely incident to the flood.\n The verdict was for the shipper and we are asked to review the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals affirming the judgment of the District Court entered upon that verdict. 235 Fed. 857, 149 C. C. A. 169.\n The carrier argues that three errors each requiring reversal of the judgment appear in the record.\n The first claim is that the court refused to rule, that by its terms, the Carmack Amendment (Act June 29, 1906, chap. 3591, sec. 7, pars. 11, 12, 34 Stat. 595 [Comp. St.  8604a, 8604aa]) casts upon the shipper the burden of proving affirmatively that the loss which occurred on a connecting line was 'caused by' the connecting carrier. But, assuming that the question is presented by the record, which is doubtful, Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Ry. Co. v. Wallace, \n223 \nU.S. 481, 491\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 205, rules that, under the act as construed in Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. Riverside Mills, \n219 \nU.S. 186, 205\n, 206 S., 31 Sup. Ct. 164, 31 L. R. A. (N. S.) 7, in such a case as we have here the liability of the initial carrier is as if the shipment had been between stations in different states, but both upon its own line, and this renders the contention untenable. Adams Express Co. v. Croninger, \n226 U.S. 491\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 148, 44 L. R. A. (N. S.) 257, does not conflict with this conclusion, Cincinnati, New Orleans & Texas Pacific Railway Co. v. Rankin, \n241 \nU.S. 319, 326\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 555, L. R. A. 1917A, 265.\n The second claim is that error was committed in the ad \n\n[249 U.S. 186, 192]\n\u00a0\n mission of testimony of military officers that the confiscation of the property resulted from communications received by them by postal card and telephone from the agents and officials of the railway company respecting the condition of the poultry and that the caretaker had abandoned it, without evidence being required to identify the senders of such messages as officers or agents of the company. But this evidence, while taken in the form of depositions by the shipper, was introduced by the carrier. One who asks a court and jury to believe evidence which he introduces will not be heard to claim that, for technical reasons, it was not admissible.\n There remains only the contention that substantial error was committed by the Circuit Court of Appeals in approving as sound law the charge to the jury that if the military authorities seized the consignment of poultry solely upon and by reason of the invitation of the railroad company, and that if but for this confiscation the property, or any part of it, in the exercise of ordinary care, could have been transported to its destination, then the carrier would be liable, etc.\n The shipment was not lost by the 'act of God,' and the defense of the carrier on the facts was narrowed to the claim that it was prevented from performing its contract 'by the authority of law'-by the appropriation by the military authorities.\n The verdict approved by two courts will be accepted by this court as a conclusive finding in favor of the shipper upon the questions of fact involved.\n The duties and liabilities of a common carrier have been so fully discussed by this court, notably in Railroad Co. v. Lockwood, 17 Wall. 357, and in Bank of Kentucky v. Adams Express Co., \n93 U.S. 174\n, that they need not be restated here.\n The common-law principle making the common carrier an insurer is justified by the purpose to prevent negli gence \n\n[249 U.S. 186, 193]\n\u00a0\n or collusion between dishonest carriers or their servants and thieves or others, to the prejudice of the shipper, who is, of necessity, so remote from his property, when in transit, that proof of such collusion or negligence when existing, would be difficult if not impossible. Coggs v. Bernard, 2 Lord Raymond, 909; Riley v. Horne, 5 Bing. 217. The obligation to transport and to deliver is so exceptional and absolute in character that the relation of the carrier to the shipper was characterized in Railroad Co. v. Lockwood, supra, as so partaking of a fiduciary character as to require the utmost fairness and good faith on its part in dealing with the shipper and in the discharge of its duties to him, and so lately as American Express Co. v. Mullins, \n212 U.S. 311\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 381, 15 Ann. Cas. 536, this court declared that if a carrier, by connivance or fraud, permitted a judgment to be rendered against it for property in its charge, such judgment could not be invoked as a bar to a suit by a shipper.\n These decisions, a few from many, illustrate the character of the relation of trust and confidence which must be sustained between a common carrier and a shipper. It rests at bottom upon a commercial necessity and public policy which would be largely defeated if the carrier were permitted by false representations, or by representations, which, though not intentionally false, were not known to be true, to procure the appropriation by military or other authority of property in its custody, as the jury found was done in this case, and thereby defeat its obligation to carry and deliver.\n These principles of law governing the relations between the carrier and the shipper, amply justified the charge of the trial court to the jury and the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","45":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO & N.

By the order the commission practically assigned two-thirds to the railroad company and one-third to the owner of the plant, and required the latter to secure the right of way at its own expense and to invest the railroad company with a perpetual right to use the same for railroad purposes.\n In the state courts the railroad company, without questioning the terms of the apportionment, if the cost was to be divided, contended that the statute as construed and the order as made were repugnant to the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, in that to require the company to bear any part of the cost was to take its property for a private use without its consent, or, if the use were public, to take the property for such use without compensation. Both phases of the contention were overruled and this is the matter on which error is assigned.\n The facts are not in dispute and are these:\n The plant is about a quarter of a mile from the railroad \n\n[249 U.S. 416, 419]\n\u00a0\n company's station at Springfield, Minn., a place of over 1,500 inhabitants, and has been in operation as much as 20 years. During that time the railroad company has maintained and operated a side track leading from its main line to the plant and the products of the latter have been shipped out and fuel and other supplies shipped in over this trach. The railroad company has been free to use the track for other purposes and has done so occasionally. The yearly shipments from the plant have been about 250 carloads and those to the plant about 50 carloads, the freight charges thereon exceeding $10,000. Without the side track the plant would be a failure and the public would be without its products; with it the plant is a success and the products reach and are used by the public. The demand for the products has come to exceed greatly the capacity of the plant and the owner is now enlarging it at a cost of $150,000. The output, as also the aggregate freight charges, will be more than doubled thereby. The entire output moves over this railroad, no other being accessible. To serve the enlarged plant and handle the increased shipments, out and in, the present side track-about 460 yards-must be rearranged and extended about 350 yards. The estimated cost of the work according to plans substantially agreed on will be about $2,300.\n Under the settled rule in Minnesota a side track such as is in question here is not merely a private siding, but 'additional trackage for public use.' If need be the right of way for it may be acquired by condemnation. It becomes the property of the railroad company and an integral part of its railroad system, and is wholly under its control. Besides enabling the public to get the products of the industry served, it is at the service of all who have occasion to use it and must be operated accordingly. Range Sand-Lime Brick Co. v. Great Northern Ry. Co., 137 Minn. 314, 163 N. W. 656, L. R. A. 1918B, 784, and cases cited. \n\n[249 U.S. 416, 420]\n\u00a0\n Of such a track, and of the power of the state to impress on it a public character, this court said in Union Lime Co. v. Chicago & Northwestern Ry. Co., \n233 \nU.S. 211, 222\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 522, 525 (58 L. Ed. 924):\n\"The uses for which the track was desired are not the less public because the motive which dictated its location over this particular land was to reach a private industry, or because the proprietors of that industry contributed in any way to the cost.' \n1\n There is a clear distinction between spurs which are owned and operated by a common carrier as a part of its system and under its public obligation and merely private sidings [citing cases].\n\n'While common carriers may not be compelled to make unreasonable outlays (Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Nebraska, \n217 U.S. 196\n [30 Sup. Ct. 461, 18 Ann. Cas. 989]), it is competent for the state, acting within the sphere of its jurisdiction, to provide for an extension of their transportation facilities, under reasonable conditions, so as to meet the demands of trade; and it may impress upon these extensions of the carriers' lines, thus furnished under the direction or authority of the state, a public character regardless of the number served at the beginning. The branch or spur comes into existence as a public utility and as such is always available as localities change and communities grow.'\n\n In our opinion the conditions here were such as to bring the action of the state through its Legislature and commission within the range of that power.\n Recognizing then that the side track is for a public and not a private use, we come to the question whether requiring the railroad company to bear a part of the cost involves a taking of its property without compensation.\n As a common carrier a railroad company assumes and must discharge the obligations which inhere in the nature of its business. Among these obligations is that of providing reasonably adequate facilities for serving the \n\n[249 U.S. 416, 421]\n\u00a0\n public. Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. North Dakota, \n236 \nU.S. 585, 595\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 429, L. R. A. 1917F, 1148, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 1. To do this requires an expenditure of money, of course, but the expenditure is for property which will belong to the company and be employed in its business. The money is not taken from the company and given to others, nor is the use of the facilities to be uncompensated. Like other property employed by the company in the transportation of persons or property, the facilities have a real bearing on the rates which it is entitled to charge. Therefore an enforced discharge of the duty to provide such a facility does not amount to a taking of property without compensation merely because it is attended with some expense. Wisconsin, etc., R. R. Co. v. Jacobson, \n179 \nU.S. 287, 302\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 115; Minneapolis & St. Louis R. R. Co. v. Minnesota, \n193 U.S. 53\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 396; Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. North Carolina Corporation Commission, \n206 \nU.S. 1, 26\n, 27 S., 27 Sup. Ct. 585, 11 Ann. Cas. 398; Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 262, 278\n, 279 S., 30 Sup. Ct. 330; Oregon R.

Ct. 422; Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. v. Public Service Commission of West Virginia, \n242 U.S. 603\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 234.\n Of course, the expense is an important element to be considered in determining whether the requirement is within the bounds of reasonable requlation or is essentially arbitrary, but it is not the only one. The nature and volume of the business to be affected, the revenue to be derived from it, the character of the facility required, the need for it and the advantage to be realized by shippers and the public are also to be considered. Tested by these criteria we think the order in question is not arbitrary, but reasonable.\n The case of Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Nebraska, \n217 U.S. 196\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 461, 18 Ann. Cas. 989, on which the railroad company relies, is plainly distinguishable. The Nobraska statute there condemned, as applied by the state court, required the company to \n\n[249 U.S. 416, 422]\n\u00a0\n bear the cost of 'reduplicating already physically adequate accommodations,' on the demand and for the benefit of certain shippers, and this in the absence of exceptional circumstances, if any there could be, making such an extraordinary requirement reasonable. Besides, the statute made no provision for a preliminary hearing before an administrative body and yet subjected the company to the risk of a fine of at least five hundred dollars if it awaited a hearing in court on the reasonableness of the demand.\n Here there was provision for a full hearing before the commission and also in the district court of the county. Both found the existing facilities inadequate, and there was ample evidence to sustain the finding; so the order cannot be regarded as calling for a reduplication of what already is supplied.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Hairston v.

St.  1214]), was so amended that the revisory jurisdiction of this Court over the decisions of state courts, exercisable by writ of error, was confined to cases involving the validity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under the United States, the decision being against their validity, or involving the validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised under a state, on the ground of repugancy to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, the decision being in favor of their validity; and by which the final judgment or decree of a state court of last resort based upon a decision adverse to a right or immunity claimed under the Constitution or a statute of the United States, previously reviewable by writ of error, was (with other kinds specified) made reviewable only in case this court, in the exercise of its discretionary authority, should require, 'by writ of certiorari or otherwise,' that the judgment be certified to it for review. See Phila. & Reading C. & I. Co. v. Gilbert, \n245 U.S. 162\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 58; Ireland v. Woods, \n246 \nU.S. 323, 328\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 319. The words 'or otherwise' add nothing of substance to the thought expressed by the new act. Huguley Mfg. Co. v. Galeton Cotton Mills, \n184 \nU.S. 290, 295\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 452.\n In the case before us the questions raised by the record and assignments of error relate wholly to the alleged denial by the Supreme Court of Iowa of certain rights and immunities asserted by plaintiff in error under the Act of Congress approved April 22, 1908, commonly known as the Employers' Liability Act (35 Stat. 65 c. 149 [Comp. St.  8657-8665]; Act April 5, 1910, 36 Stat. 291, c. 143). Hence, under the new system established by the Act of 1916, the judgment is in the class \n\n[249 U.S. 164, 166]\n\u00a0\n of those that are reviewable in this court not by writ of error but by writ of certiorari.\n By section 7 of the latter act it was provided that the right of review under existing laws in respect of judgments entered before the act took effect (October 6, 1916) should remain unaffected for the period of six months thereafter, but at the end of that time should cease. The present writ of error was applied for within the six-months period- December 19, 1916-and the question whether our jurisdiction is properly invoked by this form of writ depends upon whether the judgment sought to be reviewed was 'entered before this act takes effect' within the meaning of section 7.\n The action was brought against the railway company in a district court to recover damages for the death of plaintiff's intestate, and a trial by jury resulted in a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff. Defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Iowa, and that court on November 26, 1915, delivered an opinion for affirmance (Basham v. Chicago G. W. Ry. Co., 178 Iowa, 998, 154 N. W. 1019), and judgment was entered accordingly. A petition for a rehearing was filed, which, after consideration, was overruled April 7, 1916 (Basham v. Chicago G. W. R. Co., 178 Iowa, 998, 157 N. W. 192), and a writ of procedendo was awarded. Thereafter a second petition for rehearing was filed, and, having been fully considered, was overruled on December 18, 1916, and judgment to that effect duly entered. The petition for allowance of a writ of error from this court, presented on the following day to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Iowa, averred that the final order and judgment affirming the judgment of the district court was entered by the Supreme Court on the 18th day of December, 1916; and for review of this judgment a writ of error was prayed for and allowed.\n We think this was a correct statement of the effective date of the judgment sought to be reviewed.\n Section 237, Judicial Code, both before and since the \n\n[249 U.S. 164, 167]\n\u00a0\n amendment of September 6, 1916, permits of the review by this court only of the final judgment or decree of the highest state court in which a decision in the suit could be had. It is only a judgment marking the conclusion of the course of litigation in the courts of the state that is subjected to our review. Hence, whatever its form of finality, if a judgment be in fact subject to reconsideration and review by the state court of last resort through the medium of a petition for rehearing, and such a petition is presented to and entertained and considered by that court, we must take it that by the practice prevailing in the state the litigation is not brought to a conclusion until this petition is disposed of, and until then the judgment previously rendered cannot be regarded as a final judgment within the meaning of the act of Congress. We said recently in an analogous case:\n'If it were not so a judgment of a state court susceptible of being reviewed by this court would, notwithstanding that duty, be open at the same time to the power of a state court to review and reverse.' Andrews v. Virginian Ry. Co., \n248 U.S. 272\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 101, decided January 7, 1919\n\n\n\n It results that in the present case the judgment of the Supreme Court of Iowa did not become a 'final judgment' until December 18, 1916, and by reason of the nature of the only federal questions raised in the record it then was reviewable in this court only by writ of certiorari, because of the above-cited provisions of the act of 1916.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","47":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO, R.

Kennedy, all of Ohaha, Neb., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Barnum & Bailey, who owned rolling stock adapted to carrying their circus equipment and personnel, made, in 1913, a special contract with the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company concerning transportation on its lines. The railway agreed, for a sum fixed, to give the right to use its tracks and locomotives, fully manned and supplied, to haul the circus trains. Barnum & Bailey agreed, among other things, that the railway was not acting therein as a common carrier; that it should not be liable for any injury, though arising from negligence, either to their own person or property, or to that of any other of their \n\n[248 U.S. 359, 362]\n\u00a0\n employes; and that they would indemnify the railway against any such injury.\n While the circus train was being moved in Nebraska, from Lincoln, to Atlantic, Iowa, it was crashed into by one of the railway's regular passenger trains, and Maucher, an employe of the circus, was injured. He had, by his contract of employment, agreed to release all railroad companies from any claim for injuries suffered while traveling with the circus on their lines; but he brought, in a state court of Nebraska, an action against the railway for damages, alleging that he had been injured by its negligence. The railway defended on the ground that its contract with Barnum & Bailey, and thus with the plaintiff, operated to release it from all liability; that, since the contract related to a movement in interestate commerce, its validity was to be determined by the federal law; and that by the federal law the contracts were valid, although undertaking to release the railway from liability, since it was not acting as common carrier. Santa Fe, Prescott & Phoenix Railway Co. v. Grant Bros. Construction Co., \n228 U.S. 177\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 474. The trial court held that the liability was to be determined by the law of Nebraska, and entered judgment for plaintiff, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state. Maucher v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co., 100 Neb. 237, 159 N. W. 422. The case came here on writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1156 [Comp. St.  1214]).\n The railway admits that prior to the enactment of the Carmack Amendment (Act June 29, 1906, c. 3591,  7, pars. 11, 12, 34 Stat. 584, 595 [Comp. St.  8604a, 8604aa]) Congress had not dealt with the right of carriers to limit by contract their liability for injuries occurring in interstate transportation, and that consequently the state were free to establish their own laws and policies and apply them to such contracts. Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Hughes, \n191 U.S. 477\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 132. But it contends that this power of the states was superseded by the Carmack Amendment, since that amendment dealt with the power of carriers to contract in respect to such liability \n\n[248 U.S. 359, 363]\n\u00a0\n (Adams Express Co. v. Croninger, \n226 U.S. 491\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 148, 44 L. R. A. [N. S.] 257; Boston & Maine Railroad v. Hooker, \n233 U.S. 97\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 526, L. R. A. 1915B, 450, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 593); that it was the intention of Congress to deal with the whole subject; and that the rights of plaintiff in respect to personal injuries are governed by the federal law. But the Carmack Amendment deals only with the shipment of property. Its language is so clear as to leave no ground for the contention that Congress intended to deal with the transportation of persons. Furthermore plaintiff was not even a passenger on the railway. His claim rests not upon a contract of carriage, but upon the general right of a human being not to be injured by the negligence of another. Compare Southern Pacific Co. v. Schuyler, \n227 \nU.S. 601, 613\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 277, 43 L. R. A. (N. S.) 901. The case presents no substantial federal question.

Taliaferro, both of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. W. A. Ledbetter, of Oklahoma City, Okl., and H. L. Stuart, of Gainesville, Tex., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action brought by the defendant in error for knocking down and killing her intestate, Roberts. He stepped upon the railroad track when a train was approaching in full view and was killed. It may be assumed, as the State court assumed, that, if the question were open for a ruling of law, it would be ruled that the plaintiff could not recover. But the Oklahoma Constitution provides that 'the defense of contributory negligence or of assumption of risk shall, in all cases whatsoever, be a question of fact, and shall, at all times, be left to the jury.' Article 23,  6. The case was left to the jury and they found a verdict for the plaintiff. Judgment was entered for her and was affirmed on error by the Supreme Court of the State, which held that the provision applied to the case and that when so applied it did not contravene the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n The State Constitution was in force when the death occurred and therefore the defendant had only such right to the defense of contributory negligence as that Constitution allowed. The argument that the Railroad Company had a vested right to that defense is disposed of by the decisions that it may be taken away altogether. Arizona Employers' Liability Cases, \n250 U.S. 400\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 553; Bowersock v. Smith, \n243 \nU.S. 29, 34\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 371. It is said that legislation cannot \n\n[251 U.S. 54, 56]\n\u00a0\n change the standard of conduct, which is matter of law in its nature into matter of fact, and this may be conceded; but the material element in the constitutional enactment is not that it called contributory negligence fact but that it left it wholly to the jury. There is nothing, however, in the Constitution of the United States or its Amendments that requires a State to maintain the line with which we are familiar between the functions of the jury and those of the Court. It may do away with the jury altogether, Walker v. Sauvinet, \n92 U.S. 90\n; modify its constitution, Maxwell v. Dow, \n176 U.S. 581\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 448, 494; the requirements of a verdict, Minneapolis & St. Louis R. R. Co. v. Bombolis, \n241 U.S. 211\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 595, L. R. A. 1917A, 86, Ann.

As it may confer legislative and judicial powers upon a commission not known to the common law, Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., \n211 U.S. 210\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 67; it may confer larger powers upon a jury than those that generally prevail. Provisions making the jury judges of the law as well as of the facts in proceedings for libel are common to England and some of the States, and the controversy with regard to their powers in matters of law more generally as illustrated in Sparf v. United States, \n156 \nU.S. 51, 715\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 273, and Georgia v. Brailsford, 3 Dall. 1, 4, shows that the notion is not a novelty.

The bank defended upon the theory that, exercising rights given by section 12 of the National Bank Act (Act June 3, 1864, c. 106, 13 Stat. 102; R. S.  5139 [Comp. St.  9676]), she transferred the stock to her husband, and in turn he had hypothecated it to secure his personal note. Being of opinion that the National Bank Act did not inhibit an inquiry concerning all the circumstances, the trial court permitted introduction of proof to that end; the jury found the bank had knowledge of facts sufficient to charge it with notice that the transaction amounted to a contract of suretyship by the wife; and judgment in her favor was affirmed by the state Supreme Court.

This writ of error was applied for July 13, 1917-within three months.\n Act Sept. 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726, 727, 728, limited our power to review judgments or decrees in state courts which became final subsequent to date when it went into effect (October 6, 1916), upon writs of error, to those cases 'where is drawn in question the validity of treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under the United States, and the decision is against their validity; or where is drawn in question the- \n\n[249 U.S. 448, 450]\n\u00a0\n *validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised under any state, on the ground of their being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of their validity.' Section 2 (Comp. St.  1214). It also authorized this court to bring up for review and determination by certiorari 'any cause wherein a final judgment or decree has been rendered or passed by the highest court of a state in which a decision could be had, where is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under the United States, and the decision is in favor of their validity; or where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised under any state, on the ground of their being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, and the decision is against their validity.' And it further distinctly directed that, except as to writs of certiorari addressed to the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, 'no writ of error, appeal, or writ of certiorari intended to bring up any cause for review by the Supreme Court shall be allowed or entertained unless duly applied for within three months after entry of the judgment or decree complained of.' Section 6 (section 1228a). Where a petition for rehearing is entertained, the judgment does not become final for purposes of our review until such petition has been denied or otherwise disposed of, and the three months' limitation begins to run from date of such denial or other disposition,\n Plaintiff in error presented its petition here for a writ of certiorari to bring up the present cause April 15, 1918; this was denied April 22, 1918. \n246 U.S. 673\n, 38 Sup.

The defendant operates a street railway under a franchise granted by the plaintiff while a town. By section 6 of the ordinance making the grant the grantees were allowed to charge certain fares provided that they should make the arrangement stated above. The defence pleaded against being required to comply with these terms is that the Denver City Tramway Company charges five cents, the maximum fare allowed, for its part of the service, so that the defendant gets nothing, and that the defendant filed a schedule of rates with the State Public Utilities Commission which now are the defendant's established rates and charges. On demurrer the Supreme Court of the State held that this town, at least, deriving its powers from legislative grant, could make no contract of this sort that was not subject to control by the legislature, that the Public Utilities Commission had been authorized by the legislature to regulate the matter in controversy, that it had done so, and that this proceeding should be dismissed.\n Of course we do not go behind the decision of the Court that the matter in controversy was subject to regulation by the Commission and was regulated by it in due form if the State could confer that power. The plaintiff says that the State could not conter it since to do so would impair the obligation of a contract. Upon that point we agree with the Court below that clearer language than can be found in the State laws and this ordinance must be used before a public service is withdrawn from public control. Milwaukee Electric Ry. & Light Co. v. Railroad Commission of Wisconsin, \n238 \nU.S. 174, 180\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 820. The cases generally are cases where the railroad or other company sets up contract rights against the city. Whether when the railroad consents a legislature would not have all the power that the city could have to modify even a constitutionally protected contract need not be considered \n\n[248 U.S. 294, 297]\n\u00a0\n here. If we deal with the present case on the merits there seems to be no sufficient reason why the writ of error should not be dismissed. It is giving the plaintiff the benefit of a very great doubt if we assume that the question on the merits was saved.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","51":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY OF LOS ANGELES v. LOS ANGELES GAS & ELECTRIC CORPORATION(1919)\nNo. 50\nArgued: October 23, 1919Decided: December 8, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[251 U.S. 32, 33]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. B. Mathews, of Los Angeles, Cal., for appellants.\n Messrs. Paul Overton and Herbert J. Goudge, both of Los Angeles, Cal., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant city is a municipal corporation of the State of California and the other appellants are its officers, having official relation to it and its rights and powers.\n The appellee is a California corporation invested with and in exercise of a franchise for generating and selling electricity through a system of poles and wires and other works in the public streets of Los Angeles, among others, in that known as York Boulevard.\n It, the appellee-to which we shall refer as the corporation-brought this suit in the District Court to declare invalid and restrain the execution of an ordinance of the city providing for a municipal electric street-lighting system and making way for it in such way, it is charged, that it obstructed, trespassed upon and made dangerous \n\n[251 U.S. 32, 34]\n\u00a0\n the system of the corporation in violation of its rights under the Constitution of the United States.\n The District Court granted the prayer of the bill upon the grounds relied on and hence the appeal from its decision direct to this Court.\n The ordinance attacked is very long by reason of its repetitions. It, however, can be intelligibly reduced to a few provisions. It was passed March 6, 1917, and approved the next day, and declares in its title its purpose to be to provide for the removal and relocation of poles and other property in the public streets of the city 'when necessary in order that the municipal electrical street lighting system may be constructed, operated and maintained.' Such system and its installation 'as speedily as may be practicable' is declared necessary 'for the public peace, health and safety.'\n It is recited that certain 'fixtures, appliances and structures' ( they are enumerated) are maintained in the streets and it is necessary 'in order that sufficient space may be secured for the said municipal electrical system ... and that the work of constructing and establishing the same may be carried on, to provide for the removal or relocation of poles and other properties so maintained by such persons and corporations.'\n It is therefore ordained that (section 1) whenever it shall appear to the Board of Public Works that the removal or relocation kof such 'fixtures, appliances or structures' (there is an enumeration again which we omit as useless repetition) is necessary in order of such 'fixtures, appliances or structures' the Board shall give notice to the person, firm or corporation owning or controlling the property to remove or relocate the same. The notice to designate the property to be removed and the place to which it shall be removed, and it shall be the duty of such person, firm or corporation to comply with the notice within five days of its receipt. To fail or refuse to so \n\n[251 U.S. 32, 35]\n\u00a0\n comply or to diligently prosecute the work of removal is made unlawful ( sections 2 and 3) and (section 4) made a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than $500 or by imprisonment in the city jail for a period of not more than six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each day's delay is made a separate offense.\n In case of failure to remove or prosecute the work of removal the Board of Public Works is given power to do what the notice directs. ( Section 5.)\n By section 6 the dependency of the city upon private contracts for lighting the public streets and other public places is declared, some of which contracts, it is said, have expired and all will have expired by July, 1917, thus making the completion of the municipal system necessary to provide for lighting the streets without interruption and the removal or relocation of the appliances owned or controlled by various persons, firms or corporations immediately necessary in order that the city may complete and install its system. And it is declared that the 'ordinance is urgently required for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety.'\n The ordinance was preceded by acts of interference by the city with the property of the corporation in other streets and also in York Boulevard, which interference was enjoined by interlocutory and final decree by the Superior Court of Los Angeles County in a suit brought by the corporation-the city not defending. And it was interference, not displacement, and the court's decree was adapted to the extent of the interference. The decree as to other streets than York Boulevard was as follows:\n'... From in any manner trespassing upon, interfering with, moving or displacing the poles or wires, or either or any of them, owned or controlled wholly or in part by plaintiff [the corporation in this case]; or erecting or placing any pole, cross-arm or other electrical appliance or equipment or attaching any wire or cable to or upon \n\n[251 U.S. 32, 36]\n\u00a0\n any pole, cross-arm or other electrical appliance or equipment in a fixed position within the distance from any pole, cross-arm, wire or other electrical appliances or equipment owned or controlled wholly or in part by plaintiff [the corporation in this case], as prescribed by the laws of the State of California and the rules and regulations of the Railroad Commission of said State. ...'\n\n As to York Boulevard the decree was as follows:\n'... From conveying, running or transmitting electric power or energy through the lines and wires heretofore erected and constructed, by said City of Los Angeles, its agents, servants and employes,' until the wires, poles, and equipment of the city are removed to the distance 'prescribed by the laws of the State of California and the rules and regulations of the Railroad Commission thereof.'\n\n The decree contained a provision upon which the city bases a contention, or rather a suggestion, to which we shall presently refer. The provision is as follows:\n'Nothing herein contained shall be construed as prohibiting or restraining the City of Los Angeles or its proper boards, officers or agents from carrying into effect any ordinance of said city providing for the removal or relocation of poles, anchors, cross-arms, wires, street lamps or other fixtures, appliances or structures owned or controlled by said plaintiff [the corporation in this case] and located in, upon, over or under any public street or other public place of said city.'\n\n The ground or basis of the ordinance of March 6, 1917, here involved is the same as that of the interference in the suit in the state court, that is, the right to displace the corporation's property in order that the municipal system may be operated or erected. There is no attempt here, as there was no attempt in that suit, at absolute displacement. The order of the Board of Public Works, issued in accordance with the direction of the ordinance, required the corporation to change or shift or lower its wires to \n\n[251 U.S. 32, 37]\n\u00a0\n the detriment of their efficient use, as it is contended. There is some conflict as to the extent and effect which, however, we are not called upon to reconcile. It was stipulated:\n'That the value of the right to exercise the franchises of the Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corporation in the public streets and thoroughfares of the city of Los Angeles exceeded the sum of $3,000 and was in excess of $4,000.'\n\n And it was testified that if the city in constructing its system proceeds as it has done in ordering the removal of poles and wires, it will cost the corporation between $50,000 and $60,000; but passing by the particular instance of interference and considering the ordinance's broad assertion of right, the contentions of the city and the corporation are in sharp contradiction.\n We say 'the ordinance's broad assertion of right' to distinguish the narrower right of the city to erect a system of its own. Of the latter right there is no question. The District Court conceded it, indeed praised the project, but decided that it could not be exercised to displace other systems, without compensation, occupying the streets by virtue of franchises legally granted. Thus the only question is whether the city may as matter of public right and without compensation clear a 'space' for the instrumentalities of its system by removing or relocating the instrumentalities of other systems. The city asserts the affirmative- asserts the right to displace other systems as an exercise of the police power, and, further, as an incident of its legislative power. It is further asserted that these powers are attributes of government, and that their exercise when not palpably pably arbitrary, is not subject to judicial interference, and that--\n'Every intendment is to be indulged in favor of its validity, and doubts resolved in a way to uphold the law-making power [in this case the city]; and a contrary conclusion will never be reached upon light consideration.' Ex parte Haskell, 112 Cal. 412, 44 Pac. 725, 32 L. R. A. 527. \n\n[251 U.S. 32, 38]\n\u00a0\n In counter propositions the corporation urges its franchise and the right it conveys to occupy the streets of the city, rights, it is said, having the inviolability of a contract and the sanctity of private property, not indeed free from reasonable regulation, if such regulation is governmental, but free from molestation or displacement to make 'space' for a city system, for that is proprietary. We have, therefore, the not unusual case of rights asserted against governmental power-a case somewhat fruitful of disputable considerations and upon which judgment may not be easy or free from controversy. But there is some point where power or rights must prevail, however plausible or specious the argument of either against the other may be. As for example, in the present case. The city has undoubtedly the function of police; it undoubtedly has the power of municipal lighting and the installation of its instrumentalities (Russell v. Sebastian, \n233 \nU.S. 195, 202\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 517, L. R. A. 1918E, 882, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 1282); but function and power may be exceeded and so far as wrongful be restrained. And such was the conclusion of the District Court applying the Constitution of the United States, and such the ground of its judgment.\n\n In what way the public peace or health or safety was imperiled by the lighting system of the corporation or relieved by its removal or change, the court was unable to see and it is certainly not apparent. The court pointed out that there were several lighting systems in existence and occupying the streets and that there was no contest, or disorder or overcharge of rates or peril, or defect of any kind, and therefore concluded that the conditions demonstrated that while the city might install its own system there was no real 'public necessity' arising from consideration of public health, peace or safety requiring the city to engage in the business of furnishing light.\n The court reasoned and concluded that what the city did was done not in its governmental capacity-an exertion of the police power-but in its 'proprietary or quasi \n\n[251 U.S. 32, 39]\n\u00a0\n private capacity' and that therefore the city was subordinate in right to the corporation, the latter being an earlier and lawful occupant of the filed. The difference in the capacities is recognized and the difference in attendant powers pointed out in decisions of this court. Vilas v. Manila, \n220 U.S. 345\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 416; Russell v. Sebastian, \n233 U.S. 195\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 517, L. R. A. 1918E, 882, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 1282; South Carolina v. United States, \n199 U.S. 437\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 110, 4 Ann. Cas. 767; New Orleans v. Drainage Comm., \n197 U.S. 453\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 471; Vicksburg v. Vicksburg Waterworks Co., \n206 \nU.S. 496, 508\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 762\n\n\n The city's contentions are based on a confusion of these capacities and the powers or rights respectively attributed to them and upon a misunderstanding of the reservations in the decree of the state court. The reservations were made only in prudence, not to define the existence or extent of powers, and forestall their challenge, but to leave both to the occasion when either of them might be asserted or denied. And it is clear that it was not intended to confound the capacities in which the city might act and the relation of the city's acts to those capacities.\n It is not necessary to repeat the reasoning or the examples of the cases cited above, by which and in which the different capacities of the city are defined and illustrated. A franchise conveys rights and if their exercise could be prevented or destroyed by a simple declaration of a municipal council, they would be infirm indeed in tenure and substance. It is to be remembered that they come into existence by compact, having, therefore, its sanction, urged by reciprocal benefits, and are attended and can only be exercised by expenditure of money, making them a matter of investments and property, and entitled as such against being taken without the proper process of law-the payment of compensation.\n The franchise of the present controversy was granted prior to 1911 and hence has the attributes and rights described in Russell v. Sebastian, supra. Its source, as was that of the franchise in that case, is the Constitution of \n\n[251 U.S. 32, 40]\n\u00a0\n the State and is that 'of using the public streets and thoroughfares thereof ... for introducing into and supplying' a city 'and its inhabitants either with gaslight or other illuminating light.' We said of such that--\n The 'breath of the offer was commensurate with the requirements of the undertaking which was invited. The service to which the provision referred was a community service. It was the supply of a municipality- which had no municipal works-with water or light.'\n And again:\n'The individual or corporation undertaking to supply the city with water or light was put in the same position as though such individual or corporation had received a special grant of the described street rights in the city which was to be served.'\n\n We can add nothing to this definition of rights, and, we may repeat, they did not become immediately violable or become subsequently violable.\n It will be observed that we are not concerned with the duty of the corporation operating a public utility to yield uncompensated obedience to a police measure adopted for the protection of the public, but with a proposed uncompensated taking or disturbance of what belongs to one lighting system in order to make way for another. And this the Fourteenth Amendment forbides. What the grant was at its inception it remained and was not subject to be displaced by some other system, even that of the city, without compensation to the corporation for the rights appropriated.\n We think, therefore, that the decree of the District Court protecting the corporation's rights from disturbance under the ordinance in question must be and it is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY and Mr. Justice CLARKE dissent. \n\n\n\n","52":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY OF PAWHUSKA v. PAWHUSKA OIL & GAS CO.(1919)\nNo. 281\nArgued: March 25, 1919Decided: June 9, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 394, 395]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Preston A. Shinn, of Pawhuska, Okl., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. T. J. Leahy, of Pawhuska, Okl., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A city in Oklahoma is complaining here of an order of the corporation commission of the state, made in 1917, regulating the rates and service of a gas company engaged in supplying natural gas to the city and its inhabitants. The company has a franchise, granted by the city in 1909, which entitles it to have its pipe lines in the streets and alleys of the city and provides that the gas shall be supplied at flat or meter rates, at the option of the consumer, and that the rates shall not be in excess of fixed standards.\n When the franchise was granted there was a provision in the state Constitution (article 18,  7) reading:\n'No grant, extension, or renewal of any franchise or other use of the streets, alleys, or other public grounds or ways of any municipality, shall divest the state, or any of its subordinate subdivisions, of their control and regulation of such use and enjoyment. Nor shall the power to regulate the charges for public services be surrendered; and no exclusive franchise shall ever be granted.'\n\n And there also was a statutory provision (Rev. Stat. 1903,  398; Rev. Laws 1910,  593) declaring:\n'All such grants shall be subject at all times to reasonable regulations by ordinance as to the use of streets and prices to be paid for gas or light.'\n\n In 1913 the state Legislature adopted an act providing that the corporation commission 'shall have general super \n\n[250 U.S. 394, 396]\n\u00a0\n vision over all public utilities, with power to fix and establish rates and to prescribe rules, requirements and regulations, affecting their services.' Laws 1913, c. 93,  2. It was under this act, and after a full hearing on a petition presented by the gas company, that the order in question was made. The od er abrogates all flat rates, increases the meter rates, requires that the gas be sold through meters to be supplied and installed at the company's expense, and recites that the evidence produced at the hearing disclosed that the franchise rates had become inadequate and unremunerative and that supplying gas at flat rates was productive of wasteful use. On an appeal by the city the Supreme Court of the state affirmed the order. 166 Pac. 1058\n\n\n The city contended in that court-and it so contends here-that at the time the franchise was granted it alone was authorized to regulate such charges and service within its municipal limits, that the Legislature could not transfer that authority to the Corporation Commission consistently with the Constitution of the state, and that in consequence the act under which the commission proceeded and the order made by it effected an impairment of the franchise contract between the city and the gas company in violation of the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States. Or, stating it in another way, the contention of the city was and is that the authority to regulate the rates and service, which concededly was reserved at the time the franchise was granted, was irrevocably delegated to the city by the Constitution and laws of the state, and therefore that the exertion of that authority by any other state agency, even though in conformity with a later enactment of the Legislature, operated as an impairment of the franchise contract.\n Dealing with this contention the state court, while fully conceding that the earlier statute delegated to the city the authority claimed by it, held that this delegation was \n\n[250 U.S. 394, 397]\n\u00a0\n to endure only 'until such time as the state saw fit to exercise its paramount authority,' that under the state Constitution the Legislature could withdraw that authority from the city whenever in its judgment the public interest would be subserved thereby, and that it was effectively withdrawn from the city and confided to the corporation commission by the act of 1913. The claim that this impaired the franchise contract was overruled.\n It is not contended, nor could it well be, that any private right of the city was infringed, but only that a power to regulate in the public interest theretofore confided to it was taken away and lodged in another agency of the state-one created by the state Constitution. Thus the whole controversy is as to which of two existing agencies or arms of the state government is authorized for the time being to exercise in the public interest a particular power, obviously governmental, subject to which the franchise confessedly was granted. In this no question under the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States is involved, but only a question of local law, the decision of which by the Supreme Court of the state is final.\n'Municipal corporations are political subdivisions of the state, created as convenient agencies for exercising such of the governmental powers of the state as may be intrusted to them. For the purpose of executing these powers properly and efficiently they usually are given the power to acquire, hold, and manage personal and real property. The number, nature, and duration of the powers conferred upon these corporations and the territory over which they shall be exercised rests in the absolute discretion of the state. Neither their charters, nor any law conferring governmental powers, or vesting in them property to be used for governmental purposes, or authorizing them to hold or manage such property, or exempting them from taxation upon it, constitutes a contract with \n\n[250 U.S. 394, 398]\n\u00a0\n the state within the meaning of the federal Constitution.' Hunter v. Pittsburg, \n207 \nU.S. 161, 178\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 40, 46 (52 L. Ed. 151).\n\n In Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518, 629-630, 659-664, 668, 694, it was distinctly recognized that as respects grants of political or governmental authority to cities, towns, counties, and the like the legislative o wer of the states is not restrained by the contract clause of the Constitution; and in East Hartford v. Hartford Bridge Co., 10 How. 511, p. 533 (13 L. Ed. 518), where was involved the validity of a state statute recalling a grant to a city, theretofore made and long in use, of power to operate and maintain a ferry over a river, it was said, that the parties to the grant did not stand--\n'in the attitude towards each other of making a contract by it, such as is contemplated in the Constitution, and as could not be modified by subsequent legislation. The Legislature was acting here on the one part, and public municipal and political corporations on the other. They were acting, too, in relation to a public object, being virtually a highway across the river, over another highway up and down the river. From this standing and relation of these parties, and from the subject-matter of their action, we think that the doings of the Legislature as to this ferry must be considered rather as a public law than as contracts. They related to public interests. They changed as those interests demanded. The grantees likewise, the towns being mere organizations for public purposes, were liable to have their public powers, rights, and duties modified or abolished at any moment by the Legislature. ... Hence, generally, the doings between them and the Legislature are in the nature of legislation rather than compact, and subject to all the legislative conditions just named, and therefore to be considered as not violated by subsequent legislative changes.'\n\n In New Orleans v. New Orleans Waterworks Co., \n142 U.S. 79\n, p. 91, 12 Sup. Ct. 142, p. 147 (35 L. Ed. 943), where a city, relying on the contract clause, sought a review by this court of a \n\n[250 U.S. 394, 399]\n\u00a0\n judgment of a state court sustaining a statute so modifying the franchise of a waterworks company as to require the city to pay for water used for municipal purposes, to which it theretofore was entitled without charge, the writ of error was dismissed on the ground that no question of impairment within the meaning of the contract clause was involved. Some of the earlier cases were reviewed, and it was said:\n'But further citations of authorities upon this point are unnecessary; they are full and conclusive to the point that the municipality, being a mere agent of the state, stands in its governmental or public character in no contract relation with its sovereign, at whose pleasure its charter may be amended, changed, or revoked, without the impairment of any constitutional obligation, while with respect to its private or proprietary rights and interests it may be entitled to the constitutional protection. In this case the city has no more right to claim an immunity for its contract with the Waterworks Company than it would have had if such contract had been made directly with the state. The state, having authorized such contract, might revoke or modify it at its pleasure.'\n\n The principles announced and applied in these cases have been reiterated and enforced so often that the matter is no longer debatable.

BIRD(1919)\nNo. 195\nArgued: Decided: March 3, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. George Wayne Anderson, of Richmond, Va., for petitioner.\n Mr. James E. Cannon, of Richmond, Va., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n November 4, 1909, the chancery court at Richmond upon petition filed the preceding day appointed a receiver for the Ainslie Carriage Company; February 3, 1910, the company was adjudged bankrupt in involuntary proceedings instituted November 6, 1909. At time of receiver's appointment taxes assessed upon the bankrupt's personal property for the years 1907, 1908 and 1909 were due the \n\n[249 U.S. 174, 175]\n\u00a0\n city of Richmond for which it had not distrained, although having authority so to do. Respondents, landlords of the bankrupt, under express statutory authority, levied a distress warrant November 1, 1909, upon its goods and chattels on account of rent due for the period since April 1, 1908. The question is whether their claim is entitled to priority of payment over the taxes. The Circuit Court of Appeals answered in the affirmative. Bird v. City of Richmond, 240 Fed. 545, 153 C. C. A. 349.\n The city, while not disputing that levy of the distress warrant gave respondents a valid lien, claims priority under section 64a, Bankruptcy Act-'The court shall order the trustee to pay all taxes legally due and owing by the bankrupt to the United States, state, county, district, or municipality in advance of the payment of dividends to creditors, and upon filing the receipts of the proper public officers for such payment he shall be credited with the amount thereof, and in case any question arises as to the amount or legality of any such tax the same shall be heard and determined by the court.' Act July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 563 (Comp. St .  9648).\n Respondents maintain: (1) That their lien, perfected through distraint, was fully protected by section 67d (as it read prior to 1910), Bankruptcy Act-'Liens give or accepted in good faith and not in contemplation of or in fraud upon this act, and for a present consideration, which have been recorded according to law, if record thereof was necessary in order to impart notice, shall not be affected by this act.' 30 Stat. 564. And (2) that under Virginia law such a lien is superior to the inchoate one which the city had for unpaid taxes but neglected to perfect by exercising the summary power granted by its charter to distrain therefor after September 1st in year for which levied.\n It is not denied that respondents obtained a present valid lien upon the bankrupt's goods and chattels distrained November 1, 1909; nor is it now claimed this was annulled by adjudication of bankruptcy. That the \n\n[249 U.S. 174, 176]\n\u00a0\n city of Richmond had no lien for past-due taxes upon these goods and chattels when the chancery court receiver took possession, we think must be regarded as settled by Jackson Coal Co. v. Phillips Line, 114 Va. 40, 49, 50, 75 S. E. 681, 684 (1912), and this notwithstanding differences between its charter, and that of Petersburg. The Supreme Court of Virginia there said:\n'With respect to that part of the decree appealed from, which directed the payment of taxes due from the Phillips Line, and its predecessor in title, to the state of Virginia and the city of Petersburg, out of the fund under the control of the court, and giving the taxes priority of payment over the creditors of the receivers, the court erred, except as to the taxes for the year 1910. The property upon which these taxes were assessed was wholly personal, and no effort appears to have been made, certainly as to the years prior to 1910, either by the auditor of the state or by the city of Petersburg, to collect the taxes until the property was placed in the hands of the receivers in this cause and an account of debts against the Phillips Line ordered. The state had a right, under sections 604- 623 of the Code, for one year from the date on which the taxes in her favor were assessed, to levy upon the property assessed with the taxes, which right was not exercised; and it appears that the city of Petersburg had a right of distress against the property assessed with taxes in its favor, which the city might have exercised before the taxes were returned delinquent, or the property upon which they were assessed had passed into the hands of subsequent purchasers, and thereby secured a lien therefor, but these rights were never exercised. Under these circumstances, neither the state nor the city had a lien upon the property of the Phillips Line when it went into the hands of the receivers for the taxes due them, respectively, and, therefore, the position of the state and city was no better than that of the general \n\n[249 U.S. 174, 177]\n\u00a0\n creditors of the company, and they were not entitled to share in the proceeds of sale of the company's property, except as to the amount of taxes due them [the state and the city], respectively, for the year 1910, assessed against and due from the receivers.'\n\n Respondents therefore must prevail unless priority over their lien is given by section 64a to claim for taxes which, under state law, occupied no better position than one held by a general creditor. Section 67d, Bankruptcy Act, quoted supra, declares that liens given or accepted in good faith and not in contemplation of or in fraud upon this act, shall not be affected by it. Other provisions must, of course, be construed in view of this positive one. Section 64a directs that taxes be paid in advance of dividends to creditors; and 'dividend' as commonly used throughout the act means partial payment to general creditors. In section 65b (Comp. St.  9649), for example, the word occurs in contrast to payment of debts which have priority. And as the local laws gave no superior right to the city's unsecured claim for taxes we are unable to conclude that Congress intended by section 64a to place it ahead of valid lienholders.\n New Jersey v. Anderson, \n203 U.S. 483\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 137, is not decisive of any point here contested; it only adjudged that New Jersey's claim was for a tax within the meaning of section 64a and entitled to be treated accordingly.

U S(1919)\nNo. 80\nArgued: Decided: January 13, 1919\n\n\n\n Messrs. William E. Russell, of New York City, and L. T. Michener, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Messrs. Assistant Attorney General Thompson and Harvey D. Jacob, of Washington, D. C., for the United States. \n\n[248 U.S. 405, 406]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appeal from the Court of Claims involving the construction of an act of Congress passed March 4, 1909, c. 314, 35 Stat. 1065, entitled 'An act fixing the compensation of certain officials in the custom service, and for other purposes.' This case is concerned particularly with section 2, which provides as follows:\n'That the Secretary of the Treasury be, and he is hereby, authorized to increase and fix [italics ours] the compensation of inspectors of customs, as he may think advisable, not to exceed in any case the rate of six dollars per diem, and in all cases where the maximum compensation is paid no allowance shall be made for meals or other expenses incurred by inspectors when required to work at unusual hours.'\n\n The Court of Claims construed the provision as authorizing the Secretary to decrease the salary of inspectors and dismissed Cochnower's petition that presented a claim for the difference between the salary at which he was serving and that from which he was reduced by the Secretary, in contest of the Secretary's power. From the judgment of the court (51 Ct. Cl. 461) this appeal was taken.\n Cochnower's petition shows that he served in the customs service in various capacities and at various salaries, which he details, from 1879 to June 13, 1908, when he was appointed day inspector at $5 per diem, at which rate he served until July 1, 1910, when he was reduced to $4 per diem, at which rate he is now serving.\n The case is one simply of statutory construction and depends primarily on the words 'increase and fix' which we have italicized in our quotation of section 2. In opposition to the Court of Claims' view of them, counsel for Cochnower have indulged in a wide range and have been elaborate in citation and review of prior legislation and the decisions of the courts upon it. Counsel for the \n\n[248 U.S. 405, 407]\n\u00a0\n government have confined themselves to narrower limits and even urge that the argument based on 'long continued and contemporaneous construction ... is irrelevant for the reason that section 8 of the said Act of 1909 repealed all laws and parts of laws inconsistent' with it, and that its obvious purpose was to relieve the Secretary from whatever construction might have been put upon his acts or those of his predecessors under previous legislation. In other words, as we understand the government, the Act of 1909 is to stand by itself and was intended to be and must be taken as the measure of the Secretary's power after its enactment; that it could not be limited or opposed by prior legislation, for that had been repealed; nor by prior practices, for they had been superseded, and a new rule of authority and practice pronounced. We may accept this as the gage of the government and consider how far the act is a grant of authority to the Secretary.\n Primarily we may say that the creation of offices and the assignment of their compensation is a legislative function. Glavey v. United States, \n182 U.S. 595\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 891; United States v. Andrews, \n240 U.S. 90\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 349. And we think the delegation of such function and the extent of its delegation must have clear expression or implication. The Act of 1909 does give a power to the Secretary, but the power is not absolute; it is expressed with qualification. The government's contention makes it absolute, having no limit but the discretion of the Secretary. The contention gives the qualification no purpose, makes it simply a confusion or clumsiness of words. But why are they to be so regarded? Congress did not have to disguise its purpose or furtively accomplish it. And if Congress accidentally fell into the equivocal, the resulting uncertainty must be resolved by the application of the simple rule of considering all the words of a statute in their proper dependence. Reverting then to the statute, we discover that it was at pains to \n\n[248 U.S. 405, 408]\n\u00a0\n express clearly the power to 'increase.' If it had been intended to give the power to 'decrease'-an accurately opposite power-it would have been at equal pains to have explicitly declared it; and thus the unlimited discretion in the Secretary contended for by the government would have been simply and directly conferred and not left to be guessed from a circumlocution of words or to be picked out of a questionable ambiguity. We say questionable ambiguity because its existence can be readily disputed. If it exists at all it exists in the word 'fix' in the collocation 'fix the compensation.' But the instant signification of the word is the opposite of change-it declares stability and confirmation-and, giving it this sense, it is the natural complement of the power to increase, establishes the increase (fixes it) thereafter as the legal compensation. And this, we think, is the proper construction, direct, intelligible and adequate.\n It is, however, urged that the act implies minimum and maximum salaries, especially of inspectors, and also the power of classification of inspectors. We are not called upon to dispute it. The fact or the power does not enlarge the authority to increase salaries into an authority to decrease them. The power given can otherwise be accommodated.\n We think, therefore, that the Court of Claims erred in dismissing the petition and its judgment is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","55":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOLEMAN v. U S(1919)\nNo. 343\nArgued: April 29, 1919Decided: May 19, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 30, 31]\n\u00a0\n Mr. H. T. Newcomb, of New York City, for appellant.\n Mr. Solicitor General Alex. C. King, of Atlanta, Ga., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to recover $6,721.71 paid for a tax upon the distributive shares of the children of Walter H. Coleman in his personal property. The tax was demanded and paid under the Act of June 13, 1898, c. 448,  29, 30 Stat. 448, 464, 465. The later Act of June 27, 1902, c. 1160 ,  3, 32 Stat. 406, directed the refunding of so much of such taxes 'as may have been collected on contingent beneficial interests which shall not have been vested prior to July first,' 1902, and forbade a tax to be imposed upon such an interest. On July 1, 1902, Coleman was dead but his debts had not been paid, the year allowed for the proof of claims against his estate had not expired, and the expenses of administration had not been ascertained. Therefore, it is said, the interest of his children still was contingent. United States v. Jones, \n236 U.S. 106\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 261, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 316; McCoach v. Pratt, \n236 U.S. 562\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 421. The tax was collected on May 29, 1903. On March 17, 1914, the claimants applied to the Collector of Internal Revenue and through him to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to refund it. The application was rejected and on March 9, 1916, the claimant began this suit. The Court of Claims held that it was barred by the Act of July 27, 1912, c. 256, 37 Stat. 240. \n\n[250 U.S. 30, 32]\n\u00a0\n That statute provides that 'all claims for the refunding of any internal tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected' under the above-mentioned  29 of the Act of June 13, 1898, 'or of any sums alleged to have been excessive, or in any manner wrongfully collected under the provisions of said Act may be presented to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on or before the first day of January, nineteen hundred and fourteen, and not thereafter.' By  2 payment of claims so presented is directed. The act is entitled 'An Act extending the time for the repayment of certain war revenue taxes erroneously collected,' and the claimant contends that the present claim is not of that sort, that this tax having been paid without protest or any reservation of rights, the claim is only for a bounty conferred by the Act of 1902 and that the benevolence of that act never has been withdrawn. But, bounty or not, the direction in the Act of 1902 was on the footing that the sums ordered to be repaid were collected erroneously, Vanderbilt v. Eidman, \n196 U.S. 480\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 331, and was an order for the refunding of a tax alleged to have been erroneously collected. The present tax had not been collected when the Act of June 27, 1902, was passed, but was collected afterwards contrary to its terms. There was little bounty in its application to such a case. No argument can make it plainer than do the words themselves that the Act of 1912 applies to the present claim, and that it was presented too late.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","56":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOLLETT v. ADAMS(1919)\nNo. 274\nArgued: Decided: April 28, 1919\n\n\n\n Messrs. Wilmer S. Hunt, of Houston, Tex., and H. B. Seay, of Dallas, Tex., for appellant. \n\n[249 U.S. 545, 546]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit is equity was brought in the District Court for the Southern District of Texas by a trustee in bankruptcy. A motion to dismiss the bill for want of jurisdiction was sustained, and the propriety of that ruling is the sole question presented on this direct appeal. See Judicial Code (Act Jan. 28, 1915, c. 22)  238, 38 Stat. 804 (Comp. St.  1215).\n The allegations of the bill are to this effect: March 17, 1917, a petition in bankruptcy against Ford C. Cotten was filed in the District Court for the Northern District of Texas, on which in due course he was adjudged a bankrupt. The plaintiff became the trustee. On December 22, 1916, and for some time theretofore, Cotten was the owner and in possession of certain real and personal property in Wharton county, Tex., and on that day transferred the same to James R. Adams, the defendant. Adams was then asserting that Cotten was indebted to him in the sum of $45, 311 for property obtained from him through deceit and fraud, and a suit to enforce that claim was pending in a state court in Collin county, Tex. In August, 1916, a writ of attachment in that suit had been levied on the property here in question, but under the laws of Texas the attachment lien was void and of no effect. The transfer from Cotten to Adams was made with the purpose of effecting a settlement of that suit and the claim involved therein, and at the time of the transfer the parties entered into a written agreement wherein it was stipulated that if Cotten was not adjudged a bankrupt on a petition presented within four months after the transfer was filed for record, Adams should dismiss the suit and pay the unpaid costs, and, if on a petition so filed Cotten was adjudged a bankrupt, Adams should have the \n\n[249 U.S. 545, 547]\n\u00a0\n right to prosecute the suit to judgment and to enforce all liens acquired through the attachment. The deed transferring the real property was filed for record shortly after it was executed, but the agreement never was so filed and constituted a secret understanding between the parties. Following the transfer Adams took possession of the property, real and personal; was still in possession, claiming title and exercising the rights of an owner, when this bill was brought, and had refused, on demand made, to surrender the property to the trustee. At the time of the transfer Cotten was insolvent and intended thereby to effect a preference in favor of Adams, all of which the latter knew or had reasonable cause to believe; and in fact the transfer resulted in such a preference, for the assets were not sufficient to pay all creditors. The property transferred was not exempt, but was such as creditors lawfully could subject to the payment of their claims. Some or all of the personalty has been disposed of by Adams. The real property is in the Southern District of Texas, where this suit was brought. Cotten and the trustee reside in the Northern district, where the bankruptcy proceeding is pending, and Adams resides in the Eastern district. The suit in the state court has not been dismissed, but is still pending in substantially the same condition as when the transfer was made.\n The bill contains a prayer for the recovery of the real property or its value, for an accounting as to the proceeds of the personalty, and for other relief the detail and propriety of which require no attention here.\n The motion which the court below sustained challenged its jurisdiction on the grounds (1) that the bill could not be brought in that court without the defendant's consent, which was not given; (2) that the bill was not brought in the district where the bankruptcy proceeding was pending or in that of the residence of the defendant; and (3) that the subject-matter of the bill already was involved \n\n[249 U.S. 545, 548]\n\u00a0\n in the pending suit in the state court in Collin county, a court of competent jurisdiction, and adequate relief could be had in that suit.\n On its face the bill shows very plainly that it is brought to avoid a transfer by the bankrupt, which the trustee regards as a voidable preference within the meaning of section 60b of the Bankruptcy Act (Act July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 562 [Comp. St.  9644]), and to recover the property transferred or its value. There are also present some indications of a purpose to claim relief under sections 67e and 70e (Comp. St.  9651, 9654), but this does not call for special comment, for in point of jurisdiction there is no distinction between a suit under these sections and one under section 60b.\n It well may be that under the original terms of the Bankruptcy Act, c. 541, 30 Stat. 544, the bill could not have been brought in the court below without the defendant's consent, (Bardes v. Hawarden Bank, \n178 U.S. 524\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 1000), but the act was amended materially in 1903 and again in 1910 (Act Feb. 5, 1903, c. 487, 32 Stat. 797; Act Jan. 25, 1910, c. 412, 36 Stat. 838), and it was after those amendments became effective that the bill was brought. The pertinent provisions, with the amendments affecting jurisdiction in italics, are as follows:\n Section 23b: 'Suits by the trustee shall only be brought or prosecuted in the courts where the bankrupt, whose estate is being administered by such trustee, might have brought or prosecuted them if proceedings in bankruptcy had not been instituted, unless by consent of the proposed defendant, except suits for the recovery of property under section sixty, subdivision b; section sixty-seven, subdivision e; and section seventy, subdivision e.' (Comp. St.  9607.)\n Section 60b: 'If a bankrupt shall have procured or suffered a judgment to be entered against him in favor of any person or have made a transfer of any of his property, and if, at the time of the transfer, or of the entry of the judgment, or of the recording or registering of the transfer if by law recording or registering thereof is required, and \n\n[249 U.S. 545, 549]\n\u00a0\n being within four months before the filing of the petition in bankruptcy or after the filing thereof and before the adjudication, the bankrupt be insolvent and the judgment or transfer then operate as a preference, and the person receiving it or to be benefited thereby, or his agent acting therein, shall then have reasonable cause to believe that the enforcement of such judgment or transfer would effect a preference, it shall be voidable by the trustee and he may recover the property or its value from such person. And for the purpose of such recovery any court of bankruptcy, as hereinbefore defined, and any state court which would have had jurisdiction if bankruptcy had not intervened, shall have concurrent jurisdiction.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Sections 1(8) and 2 (Comp. St.  9585, 9586) define 'courts of bankruptcy' as including the several District courts of the United States, and section 2(20) invests the courts of bankruptcy with power to 'exercise ancillary jurisdiction over persons or property within their respective territorial limits in aid of a receiver or trustee appointed in any bankruptcy proceedings pending in any other court of bankruptcy.'\n The amendments are couched in plain words and effect a material change in the jurisdiction of suits by trustees to avoid preferential transfers and recover the property or its value under section 60b. The exception ingrafted on section 23b takes such suits out of the restrictive provisions of that section; the sentence added to section 60b makes them cognizable in the courts of bankruptcy, as well as in such state courts as could have entertained them if bankruptcy had not intervened; and the new clause in section 2 dispels any doubt that otherwise might exist respecting the power of a court of bankruptcy other than the one in which the bankruptcy proceeding is pending to entertain such a suit where the property sought to be recovered is within its territorial limits. \n\n[249 U.S. 545, 550]\n\u00a0\n The court below is a court of bankruptcy and the property in question is within its territorial limits, so the jurisdiction under the terms of the Bankruptcy Act is plain. The suit is a local one in the sense of section 54 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1036) and this enabled the court to reach the defendant, who resides in another district in the same state, by original process sent to and served in the district of his residence. Such a suit, apart from the terms of the Bankruptcy Act, is excepted by section 51 of the Code (Comp. St.  1033) from the general provision that a defendant may not be sued in any district other than that of which he is an inhabitant.\n Of the objection based on the pendency of the suit in the state court in Collin county it is enough to say that the trustee is not a party to that suit and that it has none of the elements of a suit to avoid the transfer in question. Whether if this were otherwise it would affect the jurisdiction of the court below as a court of the United States we need not consider. See Louisville Trust Co. v. Knott, \n191 U.S. 225\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 119; Courtney v. Pradt, \n196 U.S. 89\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 208; Mississippi Railroad Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., \n225 \nU.S. 272, 279\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 756\n\n\n We conclude that the court should have overruled the objections urged against its jurisdiction, but we intimate no opinion on the merits other than that the case made by the bill has enough of substance to entitle the plaintiff to a decision therein in the court below in regular course. See Geneva Furniture Co. v. Karpen, \n238 \nU.S. 254, 258\n, 259 S., 35 Sup.

CITY OF COLUMBUS, OHIO(1919)\nNo. 715\nArgued: January 10, 1919Decided: April 14, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[249 U.S. 399, 400]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Joseph S. Clark, of Philadelphia, Pa., for appellant.\n\n\n[249 U.S. 399, 401]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry L. Scarlett, of Columbus, Ohio, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Columbus Railway, Power & Light Company filed its complaint and amended bill of complaint in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of Ohio, against the city of Columbus, Ohio. and officials and members of the city council of the city, asking an injunction against the enforcement of ordinances concerning the operation of street railways upon certain streets in the city of Columbus. Upon motions to dismiss, and for a temporary injunction, the District Court held that there was no jurisdiction as the amended bill of complaint presented no substantial federal question, and, \n\n[249 U.S. 399, 402]\n\u00a0\n considering the case upon its merits, held that the amended bill did not state facts constituting a valid cause of action in equity against the defendant, and dismissed the same. An appeal was prosecuted to this court; the case has been argued and submitted.\n The amended bill of complaint alleges in substance that the company and its predecessors have since the enactment of two ordinances, hereinafter mentioned, and until the 20th of August, 1918, operated a system of street railway lines in the city of Columbus. The two ordinances in question are referred to in the bill and attached thereto. The one, denominated the 'blanket franchise ordinance' was passed February 4, 1901, and the other, called the 'Central Market franchise ordinance,' was passed January 1, 1901. The allegations as to these two ordinances are supplemented by a statement of certain so-called perpetual franchise ordinances on certain streets. The two ordinances, above referred to, are each for the term of 25 years. The ordinances were duly accepted by the grantees thereof. Under the provisions of the blanket franchise ordinance the grantee and its successors are required to issue and sell eight tickets for 25 cents, and give universal free transfers. The issue and sale of such tickets continued until August 20, 1918, when, it is alleged, the franchise under that ordinance was surrendered and canceled by the railway company. Under the Central Market franchise ordinance the company issued and sold eight tickets for 25 cents, and gave universal transfers, and continued so to do until August 20, 1918, when, it is alleged, the franchise was surrendered and canceled by the company.\n The bill sets forth allegations as to the extent of the business of the company: That its railway system includes more than 110 miles of main track, and supplies the only, street railway service in the \n\n[249 U.S. 399, 403]\n\u00a0\n city of Columbus, except a very limited service furnished by interurban cars running at long intervals upon certain streets; that the company also supplies power for war and industrial purposes, and is the only commercial company furnishing electricity in the city of Columbus. That Columbus and its suburbs contain a population of more than 250,000 persons, and constitute a large industrial, manufacturing, military, and railroad center. That more than 25,000 persons are employed in the manufacture of munitions, clothing, and a great variety of other war materials for use directly by the United States government, and for the use of others furnishing war supplies to the government; also large railroad shops in which are employed many thousands of persons engaged in the making and repair of railroad engines, cars, and other equipment used and to be used by the United States Railroad Administration. That a large majority of the employes of these shops do and must depend upon the street railway service of the company as their means of transportation to and from their places of employment; and in said area is located the Columbus Barracks, in which are quartered more than 100,000 recruits per annum, who also are dependent upon said street railway service. That the discontinuance or impairment of the plaintiff's street railway service would cause irreparable harm to the government of the United States, to the city of Columbus and to all persons dependent upon the service. That the company has more than $12,000, 000 invested in the street railway lines and equipment. It has large amounts of outstanding mortgage bonds, of which the sum of $7,295,000 is chargeable against its street railway property, the annual interest charged being more than $333,000. The operation and management of the company show increased and increasing costs of operation and decreased and decreasing net revenue as a result of the war in which the United States \n\n[249 U.S. 399, 404]\n\u00a0\n was then engaged. The bill charges increases in the cost of coal and in wages paid to the employes. The net earnings of the operations of the lines for the 12 months ending June 30, 1918, after deducting operating expenses, taxes, and a proper charge for depreciation, were $301,987, an amount insufficient by more than $31,000 to pay the interest on the outstanding bonds of the company, properly chargeable to the railroad property, and barely enough to pay 2 1\/2 per cent. on the value of the property employed by the company in furnishing street railway service to Columbus. That in June, 1918, the street railway employes of the company demanded an increase in wages, and inaugurated a strike, which resulted in the discontinuance of the service of the company for two days. That the controversy was referred to the National War Labor Board, which board on July 31, 1918, rendered its decision increasing the wages of the street railway employes more than 50 per cent., thereby increasing the operating expenses of the street railway line by about $560,000 per year. It is averred that as a result of such operations, for the current year ending June 30, 1919, the gross earnings will fall short of paying expenses, depreciation and taxes by approximately $250,000, and that there will be no earnings from which to pay its interest charges, or to yield any return to the company on the value of its property. That on August 20, 1918, the company surrendered and canceled its blanket franchise and its Central Market franchise by notification in writing addressed to the city of Columbus, the mayor, council and clerk thereof. The company charges that the rates of fare prescribed by the terms and conditions of the two ordinances were not either before or when said franchises were surrendered as above stated and would not be if longer enforced against the company, sufficient to enable it to maintain its street railway property in good order and repair and to perform its duty as a public \n\n[249 U.S. 399, 405]\n\u00a0\n utility; that the further operation of the street railway lines in the city of Columbus under the two ordinances would be not only impracticable, but inpossible, and that the enforcement of the said rates of fare would violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; that said rates of fare are inadequate and confiscatory, and their enforcement will deprive the company of its property without due process of law. The company charges that the defendants, unless enjoined, will attempt to force it to continue to operate its street railway lines under the said blanket and Central Market franchises in violation of rights secured to it by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The amended bill further sets forth that controversies, confusion, risks, and multiplicity of suits will result from the resistance of the company to the enforcement of the inadequate and confiscatory rates of fare prescribed in said ordinance. The bill prays for an injunction restraining the defendants from compelling the company, or attempting so to do, to operate its lines of street railway in the city of Columbus under the said ordinances, from in any way forcing, compelling, or attempting to compel, it to charge and collect only the rates of fare prescribed by the two ordinances for carrying passengers, and from interfering in any way with the operation by the company of the lines of street railway covered by the said perpetual franchises.\n In the written notice of surrender of the franchises, attached to the bill as part thereof, the alleged facts as to the operation of the company are set forth much as stated in the amended bill, and the award of the National War Labor Board is set out. The request of February 25, 1918, to the city council to authorize the company to charge higher rates, is stated, which was refused, as was a later request. A recital of the recommendation of the War Labor Board for increased rates of fare is also \n\n[249 U.S. 399, 406]\n\u00a0\n set out in the written notice. The statement is made that the company refused to continue the issue and sale of tickets as prescribed in the blanket franchise and Central Market ordinances and to longer operate its cars thereunder; that in order to give good street railway service to the people of Columbus the company will continue to operate the street railway lines, but not under the two franchises, or either of them, upon all of the streets of the city, until notified by it to withdraw from those streets not covered by the aforesaid perpetual franchises, and the company gave notice that it would thereafter charge 5 cents for a single ride and 1 cent for each transfer.\n The District Court held that the bill made no case properly invoking the jurisdiction of a federal court upon constitutional grounds; that upon the merits, which the District Court considered, the bill should be dismissed for want of equity.\n As to the jurisdiction of the court: If the court had decided the case upon the question of jurisdiction alone, that question should have been certified here, and none other would have been presented upon such appeal. Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231)  238, 36 Stat. 1157 ( Comp. St.  1215). As we have said, the court decided the case upon the merits, and dismissed the bill. As a constitutional question is involved the appeal brings the whole case here. We are of opinion that there was jurisdiction in the District Court to entertain the bill as it presented questions arising under the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution not so wholly lacking in merit as to afford no basis of jurisdiction. Jurisdiction does not depend upon the decision of the case, and should be entertained if the bill presents questions of a character giving the party the right to invoke the judgment of a federal court. We think the elaborate and careful opinion of the District Judge of itself shows that substantial questions arising under the federal Constitution were presented by the bill and that the court had jurisdiction. \n\n[249 U.S. 399, 407]\n\u00a0\n Upon the merits the decision of the case turns upon the nature and character of the ordinances granting the twenty-five year franchises. The theory upon which the bill was framed, and the case argued here by appellant, is that the grants were legislative in character, and gave to the railway company the right and privilege of using the streets of the city for a period of 25 years; that to compel their operation at unremunerative rates is to take the property of the company without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The insistence on the part of the city is that under the controlling laws of Ohio, in force when these ordinances were passed and accepted, and the terms of the ordinances, binding contracts were created, obligating the city, which had authority from the state for that purpose, to permit the operation by the company upon the streets of the city for the period of 25 years upon the terms and conditions set forth in the ordinances.\n That a city, acting under state authority, may in matters of proprietary right make binding contracts of the nature contained in these ordinances, is well established by the adjudications of this court. Vicksburg v. Vicksburg Waterworks Co., \n206 U.S. 496\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 762\n\n\n Whether these ordinances constituted such contracts depends upon the proper construction of the statutes of Ohio in force at the time, and the terms of the ordinances in question.\n It is conceded that the statutes of Ohio regulating this matter are substantially the same as those set forth in the margin of the report of the decision of this court in Cleveland v. Cleveland City Railway Co., \n194 U.S. 517\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 756. After the consideration therein given them, it would be superfluous to state them again or to undertake to repeat the reasons which impelled the decision of the court. In the Cleveland Case this court held that upon acceptance of the ordinance it became a binding contract, governed by the rates of fare \n\n[249 U.S. 399, 408]\n\u00a0\n authorized to be charged during the period of 25 years for which the ordinance ran; that the rates contracted for became binding upon the city, and could not be altered by subsequent municipal action consistently with the constitutional rights of the railway company. Summing up the matter this court said:\n'In reason, the conclusion that contracts were engendered, would seem to result from the fact that the provisions as to rates of fare were fixed in ordinances for a stated time and no reservation was made of a right to alter, that by those ordinances existing rights of the corporations were surrendered, benefits were conferred upon the public, and obligations were imposed upon the corporations to continue those benefits during the stipulated time. When, in addition, we consider the specific reference to limitations of time which the ordinances contained, and the fact that a written acceptance by the corporations of the ordinances was required, we can see no escape from the conclusion, that the ordinances were intended to be agreements binding upon both parties definitely fixing the rates of fare which might be thereafter charged.' \n194 U.S. 536\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 763.\n\n While the precise question now involved was not presented to the court in Interurban Railway & Terminal Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 98 Ohio St. 287, 120 N. E. 831 (s. c., 16 Ohio Law Reporter, 393), it is evident that the Supreme Court of Ohio takes the same view of the effect of such ordinances as was declared by this court in the Cleveland Case. In the opinion in the Interurban Railway Case, the previous Ohio cases, as well as the decisions of this court, are reviewed, and the conclusion as to the effect of the Ohio statutes is in accord with that announced by this court.\n The ordinances involved in this case are specific in their terms, and in the so-called blanket franchise ordinance they obligate the company during the life of the franchise to furnish adequate and efficient service and first-class, \n\n[249 U.S. 399, 409]\n\u00a0\n commodious cars for the accommodation of its patrons. The company is authorized to charge certain fares during the term named, and no more. It is required to run cars upon certain streets, not in excess of certain intervals. Upon the expiration of the franchise the company, unless a further renewal be granted, was obligated to remove its tracks, etc., from the streets of the city, leaving the same in good condition.\n In the Central Market franchise ordinance the time was fixed for the running of the cars and the size of the trains was regulated. The company was obligated to pay the city 2 per cent. of the gross receipts from local passenger fares during the term of the franchise. The grant was expressly limited to 25 years. Upon the expiration of that period the city had a right to purchase upon giving notice 2 years before the expiration of the term of its intention to do so. We can have no doubt that under the authority of the laws referred to, and in view of the terms of the ordinances in question and the acceptances by the grantees, the city of Columbus made valid and binding contracts with the companies, binding for the term of 25 years. By these contracts, obligatory alike upon the city and the company, the city granted the right to use the streets and the company bound itself to furnish the contemplated service at the rates of fare fixed in the ordinances. We cannot agree with the contention of the appellant that these were permissive franchises, granted and accepted with the right upon the part of the company to abandon the uses and purposes for which the franchises were granted because the rates fixed became unremunerative as alleged in the amended bill. The authority under which the city acted came from the state, and was granted by proper statutes passed for that purpose. The contracts were made between the city and the company, and became mutually binding for the period named in the ordinances. \n\n[249 U.S. 399, 410]\n\u00a0\n This case does not involve the remedies which may be invoked against a street railway company which is or may become insolvent because of conditions arising since it entered into a given contract. The company seeks now by its own action to terminate the contracts, still binding upon it by their terms as to rates of fare to be charged, and seeks to have the aid of a court of equity by enjoining the city from any further requirement of service under them.\n There is no showing that the contracts have become impossible of performance. Nor is there any allegation establishing the fact that taking the whole term together the contracts will be necessarily unprofitable. This case is not like the Denver Water Works Case, \n246 U.S. 178\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 278, and the Detroit Street Railway Co. Case, \n248 U.S. 429\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 151, in both of which the franchise to use the streets of the city had expired by limitation, and it was sought to require continued operation of a waterworks system in the one case and in the other of a street railway system, under rates which would afford no adequate return to the companies. In this case the company seeks the aid of a court of equity to avoid contracts duly made and entered into while the same are yet in force.\n We are unable to find in the allegations in this bill any statement of facts which absolves the company from the continued obligation of its contracts, unless the facts to which we have referred bring the case, as is contended, within the doctrine of vis major, justifying the company in its attempt to surrender its franchise, and be absolved from further obligation.\n We come then to consider whether the amended bill shows the happening of an event or events which have released the company from the obligations of the contract, and authorized it to cancel the same upon the surrender of its franchise. Justification for that course is said to exist in the conditions following the World War \n\n[249 U.S. 399, 411]\n\u00a0\n and resulting therefrom, particularly in the great increase in wages by the arbitral award of the War Labor Board, which was due to the necessity of meeting the high cost of living as a direct result of war conditions. This, it is contended, presents a situation that made the subsequent keeping of the contract practically impossible, except at a ruinous loss to the company. It is insisted that the principle recognized by this court in Kronprinzessin Cecilie, \n244 U.S. 13\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 490, when applied to this case shows the existence of conditions excusing the performance of the contract. In that case it was held that the master and owner of the German steamship Kronprinzessin Cecilie were justified in apprehending that she would be seized as a prize if she completed her voyage to Plymouth and Cherbourg on the eve of the war, and her return to this country was a reasonable and justifiable precaution in view of the situation; that there was no liability for the shipments of gold agreed to be carried in that case; that the contract, not making an exception in the event of war intervening before delivery of the cargo, the circumstances showing peril of belligerent capture afforded an implied exception to the carrier's undertaking.\n Much reliance is had by the appellant on the language used by Mr. Justice Jackson speaking for this court in Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Hoyt, \n149 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 15 S., 13 Sup. Ct. 779, 784 (37 L. Ed. 625), wherein it was said:\n'There can be no question that a party may by an absolute contract bind himself or itself to perform things which subsequently become impossible, or pay damages for the nonperformance, and such construction is to be put upon an unqualified undertaking, where the event which causes the impossibility might have been anticipated and guarded against in the contract, or where the impossibility arises from the act or default of the promisor. But where the event is of such a character that it cannot be reasonably supposed to have been in the contemplation of the contracting \n\n[249 U.S. 399, 412]\n\u00a0\n parties when the contract was made, they will not be held bound by general words, which, though large enough to include, were not used with reference to the possibility of the particular contingency which afterwards happens.'\n\n Particular reliance is had upon the last sentence of the paragraph just quoted. This language was used in interpreting a contract of doubtful import, as the context shows. Such interpretation was made in view of the situation of the parties at the time when the contract was made, and in view of the nature of the undertaking under consideration. It certainly was not intended to question the principle, frequently declared in decisions of this court, that if a party charge himself with an obligation possible to be performed, he must abide by it unless performance is rendered impossible by the act of God, the law, or the other party. Unforeseen difficulties will not excuse performance. Where the parties have made no provision for a dispensation, the terms of the contract must prevail. United States v. Gleason, \n175 \nU.S. 588, 602\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 228, and authorities cited; Carnegie Steel Co. v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 156, 164\n, 165 S., 36 Sup. Ct. 342. The latest utterance of this court upon the subject is found in Day v. United States, \n245 U.S. 159\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 57, in which it was said:\n'One who makes a contract never can be absolutely certain that he will be able to perform it when the time comes, and the very essence of it is that he takes the risk within the limits of his undertaking. The modern cases may have abated somewhat the absoluteness of the older ones in determining the scope of the undertaking by the literal meaning of the words alone. The Kronprinzessin Cecilie, \n244 U.S. 12\n, 22 [37 Sup. Ct. 490]. But when the scope of the undertaking is fixed, that is merely another way of saying that the contractor takes the risk of the obstacles to that extent.'\n\n In the present case the terms of the contract are not doubtful. The term for which the company was given \n\n[249 U.S. 399, 413]\n\u00a0\n the right to use the streets of the city was definitely stated, and the terms, including the rates of fare which the company might charge, were explicitly laid down. There is no occasion to interpret general terms in the light of the intention of the parties or the circumstances of the case.\n In the Kronprinzessin Cecilie Case the unexpected event which excused performance was the imminent danger of the capture of the vessel by a belligerent which would have ended the possibility of performing the contract.\n In Metropolitan Water Board, Appellant, v. Dick, Kerr & Co., Ltd., Respondent, decided by the House of Lords November 26, 1917 \n\n[249 U.S. 399, 1918]\n\u00a0\n A. C. 119, a firm of contractors contracted with a water board to construct a reservoir to be completed within six years, subject to a proviso that if by reason of any difficulties, impediments, or obstructions howsoever occasioned the contractor should in the opinion of the engineer, have been unduly delayed or impeded in the completion of the contract, it should be lawful for the engineer to grant an extension of time for completion. By a notice given by the Ministry of Munitions in February, 1916, in exercise of the powers conferred by the Defense of the Realm Acts and Regulations, the contractors were required to cease work on their contract, which they did. It was held that the provision for extending the time did not apply to the prohibition of the ministry; that the interruption created by the prohibition was of such a character and duration as to make the contract when resumed a different contract from the contract when broken off, and that it had ceased to be operative. In that case there was a direct intervention of the power of the government, a feature not appearing in the case now under consideration.\n It is undoubtedly true that the breaking out of the World War was not contemplated, nor was the subsequent \n\n[249 U.S. 399, 414]\n\u00a0\n action of the War Labor Board within the purview of the parties when the contract was made. That there might be a rise in the cost of labor, and that the contract might at some part of the period covered become unprofitable by reason of strikes or the necessity for higher wages might reasonably have been within their contemplation when the contract was made and provisions made accordingly. There is no showing in the bill that the war or the award of the War Labor Board necessarily prevented the performance of the contract. Indeed, as we have said, there is no showing, as in the nature of things there cannot be, that the performance of the contract, taking all the years of the term together will prove unremunerative. We are unable to find here the intervention of that superior force which ends the obligation of a valid contract by preventing its performance. It may be, and taking the allegations of the bill to be true, it undoubtedly is, a case of a hard bargain. But equity does not relieve from hard bargains simply because they are such. It may be that the efficiency of the service and fairness in dealing with the company which performs such important and necessary service ought to require an advance in rates; such was the strongly announced opinion of the War Labor Board. But these and kindred considerations address themselves to the duly constituted authorities having the control of the subject-matter.\n We reach the conclusion that the District Court was right in holding that this bill presented no grounds absolving the company from its contract, and justifying the surrender of its franchise. It follows that the decree is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","58":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOMMERCIAL CABLE CO. v. BURLESON(1919)\nNo. 815\nArgued: March 7, 1919Decided: June 9, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. Charles E. Hughes, of New York City, for appellants.\n Mr. Solicitor General King, of Atlanta, Ga., for appellees. \n\n[250 U.S. 360, 361]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By virtue of the Joint Resolution of July 16, 1918 (40 Stat. 904, c. 154 [Comp. St. 1918,  3115 3\/4 x, appendix]), considered in the Dakota Central Telephone Case, \n250 U.S. 163\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 507, 63 L. Ed. --, decided June 2, 1919, the President, by proclamation dated November 2, 1918 (Sess. Laws 65th Cong., 2d Sess., part 2, 'Proclamations, 1918,' p. 228), assumed control, possession, and supervision 'of each and every marine cable system and every part thereof owned or controlled and operated by any company or companies organized and existing under the laws of the United States, or any state thereof.'\n As in the case of the telephone lines, the proclamation conferred authority upon the Postmaster General to carry out its provisions. In the name of the President, the Postmaster General then took possession and assumed control of the cable lines owned or under the control of the two companies which are appellants on these records. The companies thereupon filed their bills in the court below to enjoin the Postmaster General or his representatives from interfering with their property because (1) n der the circumstances alleged the President had no power to take possession and control of the cable lines; (2) if he had such power, he was not justified in exerting it under the conditions stated; and (3) as the result of the failure to provide adequate compensation, the taking of the cable lines was void for repugnancy to the Constitution. These propositions were based upon elaborate averments concerning the subject- matter. On motion of the defendant the bills were dismissed for want of equity. The court held that as under the facts admitted the first two propositions raised no question of power, but only charged a wrongful exercise of a discretion vested, they stated no ground for relief as the subject was not justiciable, and that as to the third proposition there was no equity in the bill because the provision \n\n[250 U.S. 360, 362]\n\u00a0\n made for compensation met the constitutional requirement.\n By appeals, the cases were brought here and were argued and submitted in March last. While they were under advisement the United States directed attention to the fact that by authority of the President all the cable lines with which the two corporations were concerned, and to which the bills related, had been turned over to and had been accepted by the corporations, and the Government hence had no longer any interest in the controversy. As the result of submitting an inquiry to counsel as to whether the cases had become moot, that result is admitted by the United States, but in a measure is disputed by the appellants for the following reasons: First, it is said that as the taking over of the lines by the President was wholly unwarranted and without any public necessity whatever, there is ground to fear that they may again be wrongfully taken unless these cases now proceed to a decree condemning the original wrong; and, second, that although it is true that during the operation of the property while under the control of the Government all the revenues derived from it were separately kept and have been returned to the owners of the property- a result which financially is satisfactory to them-nevertheless, unless there is a decree in this case, the owners can feel no certitude that the revenues may not be claimed from them by the United States in the future.\n But we are of opinion that these anticipations of possible danger afford no basis for the suggestion that the cases now present any possible subject for judicial action, and hence it results that they are wholly moot and must be dismissed for that reason. In giving effect, however, to that conclusion, we are of opinion that the decree below, which in substance rejected the rights asserted by the complainants, ought not to be allowed to stand, but on the contrary, following the well established precedents (United \n\n[250 U.S. 360, 363]\n\u00a0\n States v. Hamburg-Amerikanische Co., \n239 U.S. 466\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 212; United States v. American-Asiatic Steamship Co., \n242 U.S. 537\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 233), the decrees below should be reversed and the cases remanded to the lower court, with directions to set aside the decrees and to substitute decrees dismissing the bills without prejudice and without costs, because the controversy which they involve has become moot and is no longer therefore a subject appropriate for judicial action.\n And it is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","59":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOMPANIA GENERAL DE TABACOS DE FILIPINAS v. ALHAMBRA CIGAR &(1919)\nNo. 180\nArgued: Decided: March 3, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[249 U.S. 72, 73]\n\u00a0\n Mr. F. C. Fisher, of Manila, P. I., for appellant.\n Mr. H. W. Van Dyke, of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Suit was brought by the appellant, a corporation organized under the laws of Spain, in the Court of First Instance of Manila. The complainant set up: That for more than 27 years it had been engaged in the business of manufacturing cigars and cigarettes in the Philippine Islands. That its factory is known as 'La Flor de la Isabela,' which name is used upon the packages and containers of the products manufactured by complainant and on the advertising matter in its cigar and cigarette business. That on April 5, 1887, the kingdom of Spain as the sovereign authority in the Philippine Islands issued to it, under laws then in force, a certificate of registration and ownership of certain trade-marks and trade-names and label designs therein described and enumerated, including the trade-name 'La Flor de la \n\n[249 U.S. 72, 74]\n\u00a0\n Isabela,' conferring the right upon the complainant to all the benefits appurtenant thereto, including the right to prosecute for infringement. That the trade-name has been in continuous use solely by the complainant from the issuance of the Spanish certificate of registration and ownership to the time of bringing suit, except for the acts of the appellee. That by reason of the long-continued use of the phrase 'La Flor de la Isabela' to designate its factory and its products the said phrase and sundry abbreviations thereof, when applied to the manufactures of tobacco as a distinguishing brand or name, had come to have a secondary meaning designating and denoting that they are the products of its factory. In common parlance the name 'La Flor de la Islabela' is abbreviated to 'Isabelas' when applied to cigars or cigarettes. That on or about the 1st of June, 1914, the defendant, now appellee, a corporation organized under the laws of the Philippine Islands, engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigars and cigarettes in Manila and elsewhere in the Philippine Islands, unlawfully misappropriated to its own use and benefit the word 'Isabelas' in its secondary meaning as a distinguishing brand or name of its tobacco products. That the unlawful use of the name 'Isabelas' as the distinguishing brand or name of the products of the defendant is calculated to deceive the public into the belief that the goods of the defendant so designated and branded are the goods manufactured by the complainant, and that the use thereof by the defendant will cause it irreparable injury. An injunction was prayed against the defendant, and an accounting sought.\n The Court of First Instance found in favor of the complainant because of its exclusive ownership of the Spanish trade-mark, and in favor of the defendant on the question of unfair competition. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, that court found in favor of the defendant upon both issues, and directed a reversal of the \n\n[249 U.S. 72, 75]\n\u00a0\n judgment below. 33 Phil. Rep. 485. Appeal to this court was sought and allowed upon the ground that the judgment of the Supreme Court was in an action which involved the Paris Treaty of 1898 between the United States and Spain, because it is therein provided that the property rights of private establishments or associations having legal capacity to acquire and possess property, and especially the rights of property secured by copyrights and patents acquired by Spaniards in the Philippine Islands at the time of the ratification of the treaty, shall not be impaired, but shall continue to be respected.\n This appeal was perfected before the Act of September 6, 1916, 39 Stat. 726, c. 448, and is controlled by section 248 of the Judicial Code ( Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1158), which provided that this court should have jurisdiction to review, revise, reverse, modify or affirm the final judgments and decrees of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands in all actions, cases, causes, and proceedings in which the Constitution, or any statute, treaty, title, right, or privilege of the United States is involved.\n The contention is that the provisions of this treaty were involved in the decision of the Supreme Court thereby authorizing this appeal.\n By the treaty of Paris of 1898 (30 Stat. 1758) Spain ceded to the United States the archipelago known as the Philippine Islands. In article 8 of the treaty it is provided that the relinquishment or cession, as the case may be, '... cannot in any respect impair the property rights which by law belong to the peaceful possession of property of all kinds, of provinces, municipalities, public or private establishments, ecclesiastical or civic bodies, or any other associations having legal capacity to acquire and possess property in the aforesaid territories renounced or ceded, or of private individuals, of whatsoever nationality such individuals may be.' Article 13 provides that 'the rights of property secured by copyrights and patents acquired \n\n[249 U.S. 72, 76]\n\u00a0\n by Spaniards in the Island of Cuba, and in Porto Rico, the Philippines and other ceded territories at the time of the exchange of the ratifications of this treaty, shall continue to be respected.' Treaties in Force, 1904, pp. 722, 725, 726.\n It is the evident purpose of these provisions in view of the cession of territory made by Spain to the United States, to preserve private rights of property, and to provide that the change of sovereignty should work no impairment of such rights.\n The Philippine Act of 1902, carried into the section of the Judicial Code which we have quoted, intended to give this court jurisdiction in cases involving rights secured by the treaty of 1898 and other treaties of the United States. A good illustration of a case of this character is found in Vilas v. Manila, \n220 U.S. 345\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 416, where certain claims were made against the city of Manila, which it was contended survived, notwithstanding the cession to the United States. A writ of error was sued out to a judgment of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands denying relief because of its holding that the municipality of Manila after the treaty was a totally different corporate entity and in nowise liable for debts created under the Spanish sovereignty. Exception was taken to the jurisdiction, but this court held that the case involved the treaty of 1898, as the question was made to turn in the court below upon the consequence of the change of sovereignty and the reincorporation of the city after the substituted sovereignty. Mr. Justice Lurton, who delivered the opinion of the court, said:\n'This disposes of the question of the jurisdiction of this court grounded upon the absence from the petition of the plaintiffs of any distinct claim under the treaty of Paris, since under section 10 of the Philippine Organic Act of July 1, 1902, this court is given jurisdiction to review any final decree or judgment of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands where any treaty of the \n\n[249 U.S. 72, 77]\n\u00a0\n United States 'is involved.' That treaty was necessarily 'involved,' since neither the court below nor this court can determine the continuity of the municipality nor the liability of the city as it now exists for the obligations of the old city, without considering the effect of the change of sovereignty resulting from that treaty. See Reavis v. Fianza, \n215 U.S. 16\n, 22 [30 Sup. Ct. 1].'\n\n In this case no such question is presented. The decision involved no consideration of treaty rights, nor were the same discussed in the judgment in the court below. The Philippine Supreme Court in determining the issues, held that the name 'Isabela,' which appellees were charged with using, was a geographical and descriptive term and incapable of registration as a trade-mark either under the Philippine Act No. 666 (Pub. Laws 1902-1903), or the law as it existed under the Spanish regime; that the Spanish trade-name as registered consisted of the words 'La Flor de la Isabela' and the trademark of a shield with certain devices thereon. That the action was not for the infringement of the trade-name 'La Flor de la Isabela,' but was for the violation of the trade-name 'Isabela.' And that unfair competition was not shown.\n Certainly the treaty, in providing that property rights of this class should be respected, did not intend to prevent the consideration by the courts of the nature and extent of the rights granted, or prohibit the application of laws for the enforcement and regulation of such property rights when not in derogation thereof. Philippine Act 666,  14, Comp. of the Acts of the Philippine Com.  68, itself provides that certificates issued under the Spanish-sovereignty, unannulled under the royal decree of 1888, shall be conclusive evidence of the exclusive right of ownership of such trademarks or trade-names.\n Reliance is had by appellant, to sustain the jurisdiction, on the decision of this court in Ubeda v. Zialcita, \n226 U.S. 452\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 165. There suit was brought upon a trade-mark registered \n\n[249 U.S. 72, 78]\n\u00a0\n under the Spanish regime. The record shows that the appeal was allowed upon two grounds: (1) That the amount involved exceeded $25,000; (2) alleged violation of treaty rights in the decision that the trade-mark being itself an imitation of earlier trade-marks prevented an injunction in favor of its owner. As to the treaty claim this court said (\n226 U.S. 454\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 166 [57 L. Ed. 296]):\n'In such a case [the wrongful appropriation of an earlier mark] the Philippine Act denies the plaintiff's right to recover. Act No. 666,  9. See section 12, and No. 744,  4. ... It is said that to apply the rule there laid down would be giving a retrospective effect to section 9 as against the alleged Spanish grant of December 16, 1898, to the plaintiff, contrary to the general principles of interpretation and to article 13 of the Treaty of Paris, of April 11, 1899, providing that the rights of property secured by copyrights and patents shall continue to be respected. But the treaty, if applicable, cannot be supposed ... to contravene the principle of section 9, which only codifies common morality and fairness. The section is not retrospective in any sense, for it introduces no new rule.'\n\n Certainly, this was far from holding that a right of appeal existed because a right secured by the treaty was involved.\n The present case was decided upon grounds entirely compatible with continued respect for the trade-mark and trade-name rights granted by the Spanish sovereignty. It results that in the sense of the statute, giving a right to review in this court, no treaty of the United States was involved in the decree which it is sought to reverse.\n The appeal must be\n Dismissed. \n\n\n\n","60":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOON v.

Consequently, under the Act of September 6, 1916 (39 Stat. L. c. 448,  2, p. 726 [Comp.

GRANT(1919)\nNo. 104\nArgued: Decided: January 13, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. F. G. Morris, of El Paso, Tex., for plaintiff in error.[ Cordova v. Grant \n248 U.S. 413\n (1919) ]\n\n\n[248 U.S. 413, 416]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Walter B. Grant, of Boston, Mass., and T. J. Beall, of El Paso, Tex., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[248 U.S. 413, 417]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action of trespass to try title to land in Texas lying between the present and former bed of the Rio Grande. The plaintiff (the present defendant in error) alleged that his testator and those under whom the latter claimed had held the land under color of title from the State of Texas for the several statutory periods of limitation, and that the defendant unlawfully entered when the plaintiff had the legal title in possession as devisee. The jurisdiction of the District Court was based upon diversity of citizenship. The defendant pleaded that the plaintiff's title depended upon whether the land was within the United States, and that that depended upon whether the Rio Grande, established as the boundary in 1852, had changed its channel in such a way as to continue to be the boundary or not-the land in question having been upon the Mexican side of the river in 1852 and now being on the side of the United States. The defendant \n\n[248 U.S. 413, 418]\n\u00a0\n went on to allege that while the United States now exercises a de facto jurisdiction over the territory where the land lies, it does so with the admission by treaty and diplomatic correspondence that the boundary is unsettled, and that 'the treaties and acts of the respective governments placing said boundary disputes within the jurisdiction of certain special authorities, of which this court must take judicial notice, must necessarily have deprived the courts of each of said republics of jurisdiction,' etc. On this ground it was prayed that the Court either dismiss the case or stay the trial until the boundary should be established. Subject to this the defendant pleaded not guilty and the ten years statute of limitation of Texas. The plaintiff demurred to the plea to the jurisdiction as showing on its face that the United States and Texas were exercising de facto jurisdiction over the land; set up that it was agreed between the United States and Mexico that Mr. Wilbur Keblinger should decide what lands in the disputed territory were proper subjects of litigation in the courts of the United States and of Texas, that he had decided this land to be such, and that his finding had been acquiesced in by both governments. He further alleged that the Government of the United States always had claimed and now claims the land as belonging to the United States, and he denied all the defendant's allegations of fact.\n It was agreed that the patents from the State of Texas under which the plaintiff claimed bounded the grants on the Rio Grande, and that if the additions now in controversy had been made by accretion, they belonged to the plaintiff. It also was admitted, and agreed that the Court in deciding upon the demurrer might notice, that the United States, the State of Texas and the County and City of El Paso were then and for many years before exercising government control and political jurisdiction over the property in question and that the United States and \n\n[248 U.S. 413, 419]\n\u00a0\n State had enforced their laws over the whole of the same. It was agreed further that the Court might take notice of the correspondence between the Secretary of State, the Mexican Ambassador and Keblinger, the opinion of the Boundary Commission, and the action of the United States thereon. It appeared from the documents that the United States, while admitting that the boundary line was in question between the two countries, never had admitted any derogation of its de facto jurisdiction over the tract; that it had suggested to the Federal Courts that as a matter of comity they should not put into execution writs of ejectment, etc., against persons alleging Mexican titles, but that it found it necessary to limit this comity so as to exclude from it persons who had no prima facie Mexican titles in order to stop occupation by squatters who were taking advantage of the Government's forbearance. Keblinger was appointed to determine what persons showed a prima facie title. He decided against the defendant and with the sanction of the Government informed the plaintiff that the Government would not object if he should proceed.\n The District Court sustained the demurrer to the plea to the jurisdiction and the only color of right to bring the case to this Court by direct appeal consists in a suggestion that the construction of a treaty is involved.\n The decision of a court that it has jurisdiction on the ground taken by the demurrer simply means that the Court finds the Government in fact asserting its authority over the territory and will follow its lead. It does not matter to such a decision that the Government recognizes that a foreign power is disputing its right and that it is making efforts to settle the dispute. The reference to Keblinger and his finding are important only as showing that there is no present requirement of comity to refrain from exercising the jurisdiction which in any event the Courts possess. Jurisdiction is power and matter of fact. \n\n[248 U.S. 413, 420]\n\u00a0\n The United States has that power and the Courts may exercise their portion of it unless prohibited in some constitutional way.\n If the passage quoted from the answer is sufficient to open the contention that treaties had contracted for the establishment of a boundary commission with exclusive jurisdiction and so had prohibited the Courts from dealing with the question, neither the validity nor the construction of any treaty was drawn in question; or if an attenuated question can be discovered it is no more than formal. A commission sat under the last of the treaties and its action was rejected by the Government as abortive. As the Government had withdrawn its suggestion of comity so far as the present case is concerned, there was no reason why the Court should not proceed to trial, and there is no reason why the present writ should not be dismissed as it was in Warder v. Loomis, \n197 U.S. 619\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 799, and in Warder v. Cotton, \n207 U.S. 582\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 259. It follows that some other questions argued cannot be discussed.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","62":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCORN PRODUCTS REFINING CO. v.

Magaw, of Omaha, Neb., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. J. L. Hunt, of Topeka, Kan., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error (plaintiff in the original action) is a corporation which manufactures in the state of Illinois a proprietary table syrup composed of 85 per cent. corn syrup or glucose, 10 per cent. molasses, and 5 per cent. sorghum, and sells it under the name of 'Mary Jane' in cans labeled as follows:\n'5 Pounds Net Weight.\n\n'Mary Jane.\n\n'Reg.

Contains Sulphur Dioxide.\n\n'M'f'd by Corn Products Refining Co.\n\n'General Offices-New York, U. S. A.'\n\n Prior to the beginning of the action plaintiff had agents and representatives employed in soliciting orders for this syrup from wholesale merchants in the state of Kansas; the orders being filled by shipping the required quantity of the syrup in interstate commerce in the original sealed cans with original labels attached. Defendants, who are the members of the state board of health of Kansas, deeming 'Mary Jane' to be misbranded in several particulars within the meaning of the Food and Drugs Law of that state (chapter 266, Sess. Laws, Kan. 1907, as amended by chapter 184, Laws 1909, embodied in chapter 35, Gen. Stat. Kan. 1909; chapter 32, Gen. Stat. Kan. 1915), and regulations adopted by the board under authority of that law, notified plaintiff's agents and representatives and other persons selling and dealing in 'Mary Jane' syrup that, unless plaintiff complied with regulation 6 of the state board by attaching in a conspicuous place on the outside of each can sold or offered for sale within the state a label with the word 'compound' printed upon it, and stating definitely the percentage of each ingredient of which the syrup was composed, they would be arrested and prosecuted. Similar warnings were communicated to wholesale and retail dealars who were and long had been selling this syrup in Kansas under the original brand and label.\n Plaintiff brought an equitable action against the members of the board of health in one of the district courts of the state, setting up the pertinent facts alleging that defendants were acting under the authority of the state \n\n[249 U.S. 427, 430]\n\u00a0\n law and certain regulations adopted by them pursuant to it, and among others regulation 6, requiring that in the case of syrups the principal label should state definitely the percentage of each ingredient, in the case of compounds, mixtures, imitations, or blends; plaintiff further averring that the state law and the regulations referred to, particularly regulation 6, were void because in conflict with the interstate commerce clause (article I,  8) of the Constitution of the United States and the act of Congress of June 30, 1906 (chapter 3915, 34 Stat. 768 [Comp. St.  8717-8728]), and also in conflict with the provisions of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that defendants were interfering with plaintiff's interstate commerce and with its lawful business in the state of Kansas, thereby threatening plaintiff with great and irreparable damage, and praying for an injunction.\n Their general demurrer having been overruled, defendants answered and the case came on for hearing, with the result that the district court made a finding 'that all of the allegations of plaintiff's petition are true,' and adjudged that there should be a perpetual injunction restraining defendants from interfering with the sale of 'Mary Jane' in the state of Kansas upon the ground that it was misbranded when sold under the label above referred to, and in particular from interfering, because of regulation 6, with persons dealing in or selling the syrup, so branded, within the state.\n Upon appeal the Supreme Court of Kansas reversed the judgment with direction that the district court enter judgment for the defendants (99 Kan. 63, 163 Pac. 615); and the case comes here on writ of error under section 237, Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1156 [Comp. St.  1214]), as amended September 6, 1916 (chapter 448, 39 Stat. 726), upon the contention that the Kansas statute and the regulations adopted by the state board pursuant to it, as interpreted and applied by the state court of last resort, are repugnant to the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States (article I,  8) and to the due process \n\n[249 U.S. 427, 431]\n\u00a0\n and equal protection provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, and especially are in conflict with the federal Food and Drugs Act.\n Upon the argument here, the attack was centered upon the effect of regulation 6, which, so far as pertinent, reads as follows:\n'Manufacturers of proprietary foods are required to state upon the label the names and percentages of the materials used, so far as is necessary to secure freedom from adulteration and misbranding: (1) In the case of syrups, the principal label shall state definitely, in conspicuous letters, the percentage of each ingredient, in the case of compounds, mixtures, imitations, or blends. When the name of the syrup includes the name of one or more of the ingredients, the preponderating ingredient shall be named first.'\n\n It will be convenient to deal first with the contention made under the Fourteenth Amendment. It is not seriously insisted that there is a denial of the equal protection of the laws, and we see no ground for such a contention. There is no discrimination against plaintiff in error or its product, or against syrups as a class.\n It is, however, urged that since plaintiff's syrup is a proprietary food, made under a secret formula and sold under its own distinctive name, and since it contains no deleterious or injurious ingredients, the effect of the regulation in requiring plaintiff to disclose upon the label the ingredients and their proportions amounts to a taking of its property without due process of law. Evidently the purpose of the requirement is to secure freedom from adulteration and misbranding; the mischief of misbranding being that purchasers may be misled with respect to the wholesomeness or food value of the compound. And it is too plain for argument that a manufacturer or vendor has no constitutional right to sell goods without giving to the purchaser fair information of what it is that is being sold. The right of a manufacturer to maintain \n\n[249 U.S. 427, 432]\n\u00a0\n secrecy as to his compounds and processes must be held subject to the right of the state, in the exercise of its police power and in promotion of fair dealing, to require that the nature of the product be fairly set forth.

Ct. 125.\n We turn to the questions raised under the commerce clause and the act of Congress.\n Although the Supreme Court in its opinion said nothing about interstate commerce, it cannot be doubted, in the state of the record, that defendants' activities against which relief was sought included incidental interference with plaintiff's interstate commerce in the 'Mary Jane' syrup, and that the general judgment in favor of defendants amounts to an adjudication that the state law and regulations are to be enforced with respect to plaintiff's product indiscriminately, not only when sold and offered for sale in domestic commerce, but also while in the hands of the importing dealers for sale in the original packages, and hence, in contemplation of law, still in the course of commerce from state to state. The silence of the Supreme Court upon the subject cannot change the result in this regard. In cases of this kind, we are concerned, not with the characterization or construction of the state law by the state court, nor even with the question whether it has in terms been construed, but solely with the effect and operation of the law as put in force by the state.

Ct. 126. \n\n[249 U.S. 427, 433]\n\u00a0\n The question of repugnancy to the commerce clause may be treated (a) aside from federal legislation; and (b) in view of Food and Drugs Act of Congress June 30, 1906, c. 3915, 34 Stat. 768.\n Upon this question, in both aspects, the judgment under review is clearly sustained by the decision of this court in Savage v. Jones, \n225 U.S. 501\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 715, which is precisely in point. That case raised a question whether a statute of Indiana relating to concentrated commercial feeding stuffs for animals (Acts 1907, c. 206), which required the packages, when sold or offered for sale, to bear in a conspicuous place a tag or label having plainly printed on it in the English language (among other things) a guaranteed analysis stating the minimum of crude fat and crude protain, determined by a prescribed method, and the ingredients from which the concentrated commercial feeding stuff was compounded, as applied to sales of complainant's products in original packages by importing purchasers, constituted an unwarranted interference with interstate commerce, either independently of or in the light of the Food and Drugs Act of Congress. The court, finding (\n225 U.S. 524\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 715) that the evident purpose of the Indiana statute was to prevent fraud and imposition in the sale of food for domestic animals, that its requirements were directed to that end and were not unreasonable, and that it was not aimed at interstate commerce, but without discrimination sought to promote fair dealing in the described articles of food, held (\n225 U.S. 528\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 715) that the statute was a lawful exercise of the police power of the state, including the required disclosure of the ingredients contained in feeding stuffs offered for sale in that state and the provision for their inspection and analysis. Upon the question whether there was any conflict with the act of Congress, after pointing out (\n225 U.S. 529\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 724) that the object of the latter act was to prevent adulteration and misbranding by prohibiting the introduction into any state from another \n\n[249 U.S. 427, 434]\n\u00a0\n state of articles of food or drugs adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act, and that included in the definition of the term 'food' were 'all articles used for food, drink, confectionery, or condiment by man or other animals, whether simple, mixed or compound,' and (\n225 U.S. 531\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 725) that in the enumeration of the acts constituting a violation of the statute Congress had not included (as the Indiana statute did include) a failure to disclose the ingredients of the article, save in specific instances where morphine, opium, cocaine, or other substances particularly mentioned were present, and after reciting the provision of the federal act that an article 'for the purposes of this act' shall be deemed misbranded if the package or label bear any statement, design, or device regarding it or the ingredients or substances it contains which shall be false or misleading, the court proceeded to say ( \n225 U.S. 532\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 725):\n'But this does not cover the entire ground. It is one thing to make a false or misleading statement regarding the article or its ingredients, and it may be quite another to give no information as to what the ingredients are. As is well known, products may be sold, and in case of so-called proprietary articles frequently are sold, under trade-names which do not reveal the ingredients of the composition and the proprietors refrain from revealing them. Moreover, in defining what shall be adulteration or misbranding for the purposes of the federal act, it is provided that mixtures or compounds known as articles of food under their own distinctive names, not taking or imitating the distinctive name of another article, which do not contain 'any added poisonous or deleterious ingredients,' shall not be deemed to be adulterated or misbranded if the name be accompanied on the same label or brand with a statement of the place of manufacture. Section 8. Congress has thus limited the scope of its prohibitions. It has not included that at which the Indiana statute aims. Can it be said that Congress, nevertheless, \n\n[249 U.S. 427, 435]\n\u00a0\n has demed to the state, with respect to the feeding stuffs coming from another state and sold in the original packages, the power the state otherwise would have to prevent imposition upon the public by making a reasonable and nondiscriminatory provision for the disclosure of ingredients, and for inspection and analysis? If there be such denial, it is not to be found in any express declaration to that effect. Undoubtedly Congress, by virtue of its paramount authority over interstate commerce, might have said that such goods should be free from the incidental effect of a state law enacted for these purposes. But it did not so declare. There is a proviso in the section defining misbranding for the purposes of the act that 'nothing in this act shall be construed' as requiring manufacturers of proprietary foods which contain no unwholesome added ingredient to disclose their trade formulas 'except in so far as the provisions of this act may require to secure freedom from adulteration or misbranding.' Section 8. We have already noted the limitations of the provisions referred to. And it is clear that this proviso merely relates to the interpretation of the requirements of the act, and does not enlarge its purview or establish a rule as to matters which lie outside its prohibitions. Is, then, a denial to the state of the exercise of its power for the purposes in question necessarily implied in the federal statute? For when the question is whether a federal act overrides a state law, the entire scheme of the statute must, of course, be considered, and that which needs must be implied is of no less force than that which is expressed. If the purpose of the act cannot otherwise be accomplished-if its operation within its chosen field else must be frustrated and its provisions be refused their natural effect-the state law must yield to the regulation of Congress within the sphere of its delegated power. [Citing cases.] But the intent to supersede the exercise by the state of its police power as to matters not covered by the federal legislation \n\n[249 U.S. 427, 436]\n\u00a0\n is not to be inferred from the mere fact that Congress has seen fit to circumscribe its regulation and to occupy a limited field. In other words, such intent is not to be implied unless the act of Congress fairly interpreted is in actual conflict with the law of the state. This principle has had abundant illustration.'\n\n And, after citing many previous decision of this court, and analyzing several of them, the opinion proceeds (\n225 U.S. 539\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 728):\n'Applying these established principles to the present case, no ground appears for denying validity to the statute of Indiana. That state has determined that it is necessary in order to secure proper protection from deception that purchasers of the described feeding stuffs should be suitably informed of what they are buying and has made reasonable provision for disclosure of ingredients by certificate and label, and for inspection and analysis. The requirements, the enforcement of which the bill seeks to enjoin, are not in any way in conflict with the provisions of the federal act. They may be sustained without impairing in the slightest degree its operation and effect. There is no question here of conflicting standards, or of opposition of state to federal authority. It follows that the complainant's bill in this aspect of the case was without equity.'\n\n An attempt is made to distinguish Savage v. Jones, upon the ground that the Indiana statute there under consideration covered a field of regulation which had not been included in the federal statute, whereas, it is said, the Kansas Food and Drugs Law is almost literally a reproduction of the federal law upon the same subject. It is true that the Kansas statute mutatis mutandis follows quite closely the lines of the act of Congress, and that its eighth section, which defines the term 'misbranded,' is almost a copy of the corresponding section of the federal act; but in the following proviso at the close of the section the words italicized have been inserted by the state Legislature, they not appearing in the federal act:\n'And pro- \n\n[249 U.S. 427, 437]\n\u00a0\n vided further, that nothing in this act shall be construed as requiring or compelling proprietors or manufacturers of proprietary foods, which contain no unwholesome ingredients, to disclose their trade formulas, except in so far as the provisions of this act, or the rules and regulations of the state board of health, may require to secure freedom from adulteration or misbranding.'\n\n These italicized words make a very substantial difference. Section 3 of the Kansas act provides that 'the state board of health is authorized and directed to make and publish uniform rules and regulations, not in conflict with the laws of this state, for carrying our the provisions of this act'; and under this authority regulation 6 was adopted and published, which requires manufacturers of certain proprietary foods, including syrups that are compounds, mixtures, or blends, to state definitely upon the principal label the percentage of each ingredient. It is insisted that the regulation goes beyond the authority conferred upon the state board because it is inconsistent with the definition of 'misbranding' contained in the act, and therefore cannot be deemed to be a regulation required to secure freedom from misbranding. Upon this particular point the opinion of the Kansas Supreme Court is silent; but the decision of the district court upon the demurrer sustained the validity of the regulation as being within the authority of the board; the Supreme Court did not overrule this; the question is one of state law; and we must assume that the regulation, having been adopted by the board and in effect sustained by the decision of the Supreme Court, is within the authorization of the statute. This being so, it must be treated as an enactment proceeding from the legislative power of the state; and hence it stands upon precisely the same basis as the requirement of the Indiana statute (quoted in \n225 U.S. 504\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 715, and referred to above) that commercial feeding stuffs should bear a label showing among other things a guaranteed analysis stating the \n\n[249 U.S. 427, 438]\n\u00a0\n minimum percentage of crude fat and crude protein and the ingredients from which the article was compounded. It was because of the absence from the federal act of a provision requiring the ingredients to be disclosed that this court held that Congress had limited the scope of its prohibitions and had not included that at which the Indiana statute aimed.\n The Food and Drugs Act of Congress has not been changed in any material respect from the form it bore when Savage v. Jones arose. By Acts of August 23, 1912 (chapter 352, 37 Stat. 416), and March 3, 1913 (chapter 117, 37 Stat. 732 [Comp. St.  8724]), section 8 has been amended, but not in any manner that affects the present question.\n The fact that the Kansas statute mutatis mutandis follows quite closely the federal act, and that section 8 defines the term 'misbranded' almost in the very words of the corresponding section of the act of Congress, with the significant difference in the final proviso to which we have called attention, is not dispositive of the question whether Congress has covered the field to the exclusion of state regulation. This is to be determined by what the act of Congress omits, not by what it contains, and by considering whether, in words or by necessary implication, Congress has prohibited the states from making any regulation in respect of the omitted matter. Further argument upon the question is foreclosed by the decision in Savage v. Jones that an omission from the act of Congress of a provision requiring feeding stuffs transported in interstate commerce to give affirmative information as to the ingredients of the article amounted to a limitation by Congress of the scope of its prohibitions, and that, although not including that at which the Indiana statute aimed, Congress had not denied to the state, with respect to feeding stuffs coming from another state and sold in original packages, the power to prevent imposition upon the public by making a reasonable and nondiscriminatory \n\n[249 U.S. 427, 439]\n\u00a0\n provision for the disclosure of ingredients and for inspection and analysis.\n That decision is conclusive also upon this point: That the proviso in sec. 8 of the federal act that 'nothing in this act shall be construed as requiring or compelling proprietors or manufacturers of proprietary foods which contain no unwholesome added ingredient to disclose their trade formulas, except in so far as the provisions of this act may require to secure freedom from adulteration or misbranding,' merely relates to the interpretation of the requirements of the federal act, and does not enlarge its purview or establish a rule as to matters which lie outside its prohibitions.\n Savage v. Jones was decided after elaborate argument and upon full consideration. We see no reason to reconsider the conclusion there reached or to deny to the case its proper authority. Its doctrine was followed and applied in Sligh v. Kirkwood, \n237 \nU.S. 52, 61\n, 62 S., 35 Sup. Ct. 501; Hebe Co. v. Shaw, \n248 \nU.S. 297, 304\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 125.\n It is argued that the present case is controlled rather by McDermott v. Wisconsin, \n228 \nU.S. 115, 130\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 431, 47 L. R. A. (N. S.) 984, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 39, and in effect that this case must be taken as overruling Savage v. Jones. The contention is unfounded. The authority of the earlier decision was expressly recognized in the opinion of the court in the later; the distinction being placed (\n228 \nU.S. 131, 132\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 431, 47 L. R. A. [N. S.] 984, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 39) upon the question whether the regulations of the state concerning the same subject-matter were in conflict with the acts of Congress. The Wisconsin statute was held to be in conflict because it required that packages of foodstuffs received through the channels of interstate commerce, bearing labels intended to be in compliance with the act of Congress, while the goods were still unsold and were in the possession of the importer for the purpose of sale and being exposed and offered for sale by him, as a condition of their legitimate sale within the state, should bear the label required by the state law and none other- In \n\n[249 U.S. 427, 440]\n\u00a0\n effect requiring the label that showed compliance with the act of Congress to be removed from the package before the first sale by the importer, and while the goods remained still subject to federal inspection.\n The judgment under review should be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","63":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCORSICANA NAT.

St.  9831), in the then Circuit (now District) Court of the United States for the Northern District of Texas by plaintiff in error, a national banking association which we may call for convenience the bank, against defendant in error, formerly a member of its board of directors and its vice president, to hold him liable personally for damages sustained by the bank in consequence of his having knowingly violated, as was alleged, the provisions of section 5200, Rev. Stat., as amended June 22, 1906 (34 Stat. 451, c. 3516 [Comp. St.  9761]), by participating as such director and vice president in a loan of the bank's funds to an amount exceeding one- tenth of its paid-in capital and surplus.\n The action appears to have been commenced in February, 1910, and, after delays not necessary to be recounted, was tried before the District Court with a jury. A verdict was directed in favor of defendant, and the judgment thereon was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, no opinion being delivered in either court. The judgment of affirmance is now under review.\n The amended section 5200, Rev. Stat., as it stood at the time the alleged cause of action arose, reads as follows, the matter inserted by the amendment being indicated by brackets:\n'Sec. 5200. The total liabilities to any association, of any person, or of any company, corporation, or firm for money borrowed, including in the liabilities of a company \n\n[251 U.S. 68, 71]\n\u00a0\n or firm, the liabilities of the several members thereof, shall at no time exceed one-tenth part of the amount of the capital stock of such association actually paid in [and unimpaired and one-tenth part of its unimpaired surplus fund: Provided, however, that the total of such liabilities shall in no event exceed thirty per centum of the capital stock of the association]. But the discount of bills of exchange drawn in good faith against actually existing values, and the discount of commercial or business paper actually owned by the person negotiating the same, shall not be considered as money borrowed.'\n\n The pertinent portion of the other section reads as follows:\n'Sec. 5239. If the directors of any national banking association shall knowingly violate, or knowingly permit any of the officers, agents, or servants of the association to violate any of the provisions of this title, all the rights, privileges, and franchises of the association shall be thereby forfeited. ... And in cases of such violation, every director who participated in or assented to the same shall be held liable in his personal and individual capacity for all damages which the association, its shareholders, or any other person, shall have sustained in consequence of such violation.'\n\n Under the rule settled by familiar decisions of this court, in order for the bank to prevail in this action it must appear not only that the liabilities of a person, company, firm, etc., to the bank for money borrowed were permitted to exceed the prescribed limit, but that defendant, while a director, participated in or assented to the excessive loan or loans, not through mere negligence, but knowingly and in effect intentionally (Yates v. Jones Nat. Bank, \n206 \nU.S. 158, 180\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 638), with this qualification, that if he deliberately refrained from investigating that which it was his duty to investigate, any resulting violation of the statute must be regarded as 'in effect intentional' \n\n[251 U.S. 68, 72]\n\u00a0\n (Thomas v. Taylor, \n224 \nU.S. 73, 82\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 403; Jones Nat. Bank v. Yates, \n240 \nU.S. 541, 555\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 429).\n The facts are involved, and need to be fully stated. And necessarily, in order to test the propriety of the peremptory instruction given by the trial judge, we must bring into view the facts and the reasonable inferences which tended to a different conclusion, and where the evidence was in substantial dispute must adopt a view of it favorable to plaintiff; but of course we do this without intending to intimate what view the jury ought to have taken, had the case been submitted to it.\n On June 10, 1907, plaintiff, whose banking house was at Corsicana, Tex., had $100,000 capital and $100,000 surplus, aggregating $200,000, and making $20,000 the applicable limit under section 5200. Defendant was a director and vice president of the bank, active-perhaps dominant-in the conduct of it banking business, and familiar with the state of its finances.\n The averment of a breach of duty relates to an alleged excessive loan or loans made on or about the date last mentioned to Fred Fleming and D. A. Templeton, who for a considerable time had been engaged in business as private bankers in Corsicana and in several other towns in Texas under the firm name of Fleming & Templeton, and also had conducted at Corsicana a branch bank for the Western Bank & Trust Company, a state institution of which Fleming was president and Templeton vice president and whose main banking house appears to have been at Dallas, about 50 miles from Corsicana. There was evidence that early in June, 1907, Fleming & Templeton terminated their private banking business at Corsicana and turned over their deposit accounts-between $30,000 and $40,000-to the Corsicana National Bank, plaintiff herein, together with money or exchange on the Western Bank & Trust Company sufficient to meet them. Whether the firm was in fact dissolved at that time or later, and \n\n[251 U.S. 68, 73]\n\u00a0\n whether the dissolution applied to their other branches, or to the Corsicana business only, were points concerning which under the evidence there was some doubt.\n On or about June 10th, while the president of the bank was absent on vacation, defendant loaned for the bank to Fleming and Templeton $30,000 ( less discount) upon two promissory notes for $15,000 each, maturing in six months. Defendant testified that both Fleming and Templeton negotiated with him, asking for two separate loans of $15,000 each, telling him that they had dissolved partnership and were winding up and closing out at Corsicana, and would turn over between $30,000 and $40,000 of deposits to the Corsicana National Bank. He further testified:\n'One of the considerations of this loan was the transfer of the deposits and with it the accounts of Fleming & Templeton.'\n\n He insisted that two separate loans were made, of $15,000 each, one to Fleming for which Templeton was surety, the other to Templeton for which Fleming was surety. But defendant's own account of the circumstances under which and the special inducement upon which the loan was made, with other evidence to be recited below, left room for a reasonable inference that there was in fact but a single loan, and that separate notes were taken in order to avoid the appearance of a loan in excess of the limit. They were in the usual form of joint and several notes, payable to plaintiff's order. One was signed, 'Fred Fleming, D. A. Templeton;' the other, 'D. A. Templeton, Fred Fleming'-without naming either maker as surety. Discount to the amount of $900 was deducted, and the net proceeds, $ 29,100, were paid by a draft drawn by the bank on the Western Bank & Trust Company to the order of 'Fleming & Templeton,' which was sent by mail inclosed in a letter written upon the Bank's letter head, dated June 10, 1907, and addressed to Templeton at Dallas, in which letter, after acknowledging receipt of the two notes for $15,000 each, 'signed by \n\n[251 U.S. 68, 74]\n\u00a0\n yourself and Fred Fleming,' it was stated:\n'We have deducted the discount, $900.00, and hand you herewith our draft No. A-7830, on Western Bank & Trust Company, order Fleming & Templeton, for $29,000.00.'\n\n The retained copy of this letter appears to have been introduced in evidence; at the foot, opposite the place of signature, are the initials 'V. P.' With regard to this, as also to certain other 'V. P.' letters, dated in the following December and relating to renewal of the notes, defendant testified:\n'I think I signed the letters which are offered in evidence as Exhibit H,' etc.\n\n There was evidence that the draft for $29,100 was indorsed in the firm name by Templeton and deposited in the Western Bank & Trust Company at Dallas to the credit of the joint account of Fleming & Templeton, to make up in part an overdraft amounting to more than $125,000; this account having been overdrawn constantly, and in large but varying amounts, since the preceding April.\n As a result of an examination of the bank made a few days later, the Comptroller of the Currency wrote to its president under date June 22d, severely criticizing the Fleming-Templeton loan, among others, as excessive under section 5200, R. S., and saying:\n'Immediate arrangements must be made to reduce these loans to the legal limit.'\n\n It was a fair inference that defendant knew of this letter, or in the proper performance of his duties would have known of it. Whether any reply was made to it did not appear.\n Notwithstanding the warning thus given, when the notes matured in December they were renewed with defendant's assent for a further period of six months, joint notes being given to the bank as before, and the further sum of $900 being paid by Fleming & Templeton to the bank for interest in this way: Plaintiff, under defendant's direction, charged the amount in a single \n\n[251 U.S. 68, 75]\n\u00a0\n item to the Western Bank & Trust Company, for account of the borrowers, and the latter institution acknowledged the charge, gave credit to plaintiff for the amount, and charged it against the joint account of Fleming & Templeton. During December some correspondence passed between defendant at Corsicana, he writing as vice president of the bank, and Templeton at Dallas, relating to the renewal of the notes, tending to show that they were regarded by both writers as representing a single obligation of 'Fleming & Templeton.' Thus Templeton on December 3d wrote to defendant, 'Referring to the notes of Fleming & Templeton,' etc.; and defendant wrote to him on the following day, mentioning 'renewal notes of loan to you and Mr. Fleming.'\n The evidence tended to show that up to the time of the renewal the borrowers were apparently solvent, but that about January 15, 1908, they became manifestly and notoriously insolvent. The Western Bank & Trust Company closed its doors on that date and went into liquidation, with Fleming and Templeton owing it several hundred thousand dollars. About the same time Fleming and perhaps Templeton went into bankruptcy, and Templeton afterwards died, and their respective estates paid small dividends upon their obligations. The jury would have been warranted in finding that it was evident to defendant, as a banker, on and after the 15th of January, that there would be a substantial loss upon the Fleming and Templeton notes.\n On February 6, 1908, an official bank examiner visited the bank, with the result that on the 26th the Deputy Comptroller wrote calling the attention of its officers to alleged repeated violations of the national banking law in the conduct of its affairs, specifying certain loans in excess of the limit prescribed by section 5200, among them 'Fleming & Templeton, $30,000,' and stating that--\n'The directors who are responsible for the loans or permitted \n\n[251 U.S. 68, 76]\n\u00a0\n them to be made should assume liability for any loss that may be sustained thereon and not throw the burden of such loss on innocent stockholders.'\n\n On March 11th the directors, including defendant, united in signing a letter to the Comptroller in reply to his criticisms, among other things saying:\n'Reference to the Fleming & Templeton item of $30,000, we beg to say that this item has been disposed of by the bank and they now owe us nothing.'\n\n It was a reasonable inference that defendant intended to admit that it was a single loan and in excess of the limit.\n In explanation of the statement that it had been 'disposed of by the bank,' the evidence tended to show that on February 12, 1908, nearly a month after the insolvency of Fleming and Templeton had become notorious, and a few days after the bank examiner's visit, defendant and the president of the bank caused the two notes of December 10 to be transferred 'without recourse' to an affiliated corporation known as the Corsicana National Land & Loan Company (they being directors and officers of this corporation also), upon payment of $29,400, the full face value, less discount, as consideration; the payment being made by a transfer of credit upon the books of the bank. Defendant relies upon this as wholly relieving the bank from loss by reason of the loan, and consequently as releasing him from responsibility to the bank. But the evidence tended to show further that the loan company in January, 1910, shortly before this suit was brought, rescinded the transaction upon the ground of fraud, and that there was a settlement as between the loan company and the bank, based upon an acknowledgment by the latter of the former's right to rescind.\n A brief account of the relations between these two corporations, and of their dealings respecting the notes in question, becomes material. The loan company was organized in the month of May, 1907, under the laws of the state of Texas, with $50,000 capital stock, and with \n\n[251 U.S. 68, 77]\n\u00a0\n stockholders and directors identical with those of the bank. The capital of the company was subscribed for and paid out of a special dividend declared by the directors of the bank for the purpose, and each stockholder had the same proportion of stock in the company as in the bank. The purpose of the new corporation, as declared in its charter, was the 'accumulation and loan of money.' Defendant testified:\n'The purpose of the loan company, a state corporation, was to take such paper as the bank could not handle. It was organized by the stockholders of the bank, and paid for out of the earnings of our bank. ... The loans of the loan company were largely real estate loans. It was to help out the bank in every possible [way].'\n\n From the organization of the company in the spring of 1907 until the spring of 1909, defendant was a director and active in the management of the company as well as of the bank. He testified that the stockholders of the two corporations were identical, and continued to be so during the entire period just mentioned; that 'whenever there was a sale of bank stock it carried with it that particular shareholder's stock in the loan company.' During the same period the two corporations had the same president, vice president, and directors, while the assistant cashier of the bank was secretary of the loan company.\n So far as appeared, the transfer of the Fleming and Templeton notes to the loan company, and the payment made by the company to the bank, were never expressly authorized or ratified by the stockholders of either corporation; nor did it appear that the stockholders of the loan company ever authorized its directors to employ its funds in taking bad or doubtful paper off the hands of the bank at a loss, much less to relieve the directors of the bank from responsibility for its losses.\n In April or May, 1909, there was a change in the control of the bank, due to sales of a majority of the stock followed \n\n[251 U.S. 68, 78]\n\u00a0\n by a change of officers; defendant retiring as both stockholder and director. The corresponding shares of the stock of the loan company were transferred at the same time, and the new management officered the company as well as the bank. So far as appeared from the evidence, the transfer of defendant's stock carried with it no agreement that he should not be held responsible to the bank because of the Fleming and Templeton loan, nor any approval of the transfer of the loan to the loan company.\n The bank and the loan company held annual meetings of stockholders on January 11, 1910, at which, for the first time so far as appears, the boards of directors were so selected that a majority of one board no longer were directors of the other corporation. This was done by electing, as five out of nine directors of the loan company, individuals holding one share of stock each, recently placed in their names for the purpose of qualifying them. They were not stockholders of the bank; but, except for them, the stockholders of the two corporations still were the same, and it was a reasonable inference that the two meetings were attended by the same individuals. Minutes of these stockholders' meetings, and of certain meetings of the respective boards of directors, were introduced in evidence and supplemented by other testimony, from all of which the following additional corporate proceedings appeared: The stockholders of the loan company, more than a majority in interest being present, unanimously adopted a resolution reciting the taking of the notes of December 10, 1907, by the bank from Fleming and Templeton, and that on or about January 15, 1908, the makers became insolvent and the notes worthless and uncollectible, and setting forth that, with knowledge of this fact, certain of the directors and officers of the bank illegally and wrongfully transferred the notes to the loan company, for which the same officers and directors, \n\n[251 U.S. 68, 79]\n\u00a0\n being likewise officers and directors of the loan company, illegally and wrongfully transferred to the bank out of the funds of the loan company the face value of the notes, whereby the bank had committed a wrong upon the loan company and was liable to it therefor, and by this resolution the directors of the company were authorized to adjust and settle this demand against the bank and to tender and return to the bank the Fleming and Templeton notes and indebtedness with any collateral security held for them. The directors of the loan company thereafter and on the same day passed a resolution to the like effect, and appointed a committee to make demand upon the bank for return of the money wrongfully transferred to the bank for the notes and to adjust and settle this demand; the notes and indebtedness of Fleming and Templeton and any collateral security held therefor being at the same time tendered and ordered to be returned to the bank. This committee appeared before the stockholders' meeting of the bank and formally presented the demand, whereupon these stockholders authorized their board of directors to act upon the claim made on the bank by the loan company and to adjust and settle it, if they should conclude that the bank was liable to the loan company; otherwise, to reject it. A few days later a meeting of the new board of directors of the bank was held, at which a communication from the loan company committee was presented, in substance the same as that previously presented to the bank stockholders, and the resolution of the bank stockholders thereon was read; and thereupon the directors authorized the president of the bank, if he believed the claim of the loan company to be just, to proceed to settle it in such a way as he might deem to be to the best interest of the bank. Under this authority, the president of the bank communicated to the loan company committee in substance that the bank recognized the legality and justness of the claim of the loan company and \n\n[251 U.S. 68, 80]\n\u00a0\n would pay it, provided the company would purchase from the bank a certain cotton mill property for the sum of $65,000, accept $30,000 of this in payment of its demand against the bank, transfer to the bank the Fleming and Templeton notes and indebtedness, with all collateral securing the same, and execute to the bank its own promissory note for the remaining $ 35,000, with the cotton mill property as security. This was agreed to by the directors of the loan company, and the settlement was carried out accordingly. Shortly after this the present action was brought.\n The 'collateral security' above referred to appears to have consisted of certain shares of stock in a corporation known as the Fleming Ranch & Cattle Company, acquired in the winding-up of the bankrupt estate of Fleming. These shares, so far as the evidence Showed, were the only thing of value recovered either by the loan company or by the bank from the estates of the borrowers. After the present suit was commenced, the Fleming Ranch & Cattle Company was liquidated, and in the distribution of its assets the bank received sums aggregating $9,149.34, which are credited as payments on account of its claim against defendant.\n So far as the above-recited facts were in dispute, there was substantial evidence tending to support a view of them favorable to plaintiff's contentions. What weight should be given to it was for the jury, not the court, to determine. Hepburn v. Dubois, 12 Pet. 345, 376; Lancaster v. Collins, \n115 \nU.S. 222, 225\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 33; Chicago & Northwestern Ry. Co. v. Ohle, \n117 \nU.S. 123, 129\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 632; Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, \n140 \nU.S. 76, 91\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 720; Troxell v. Del., Lack. & Western R. R., \n227 \nU.S. 434, 444\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 274.\n We proceed to consider, in the order of convenience, the questions raised upon the record.\n And, first, as to the direction of a verdict in favor of defendant. Plaintiff, in the amended petition upon which \n\n[251 U.S. 68, 81]\n\u00a0\n the case went to trial, after a circumstantial statement respecting the transaction of June 10, 1907, alleged that the discount of the notes--\n'was an excessive loan, whether regarded as one loan to the firm to Fleming & Templeton, as plaintiff alleges the fact to be, or regarded as two loans, as contended for by the defendant in his pleadings heretofore filed herein.'\n\n The designation of Fleming & Templeton, as a 'firm' is but descriptive, and not essential, and the pleading is sufficient, if the proof tended to show a single and excessive loan made to them jointly in any capacity, or made in form one-half to each, but in substance as a single loan.\n In our opinion, the trial judge clearly erred in holding, as in effect he must have held, that there was no substantial evidence from which the jury might find that there was an excessive loan, in the making of which defendant, as a director of the bank, knowingly participated. That he acted for the bank in the matter, and that he knew that any loan in excess of $20,000 was prohibited, he admitted. His denial that it was a single loan, or that he knew it to be such, is not conclusive; there being substantial evidence inconsistent with it, tending to show facts and circumstances attendant upon the transaction, of which he had knowledge, and also subsequent conduct in the nature of admissions by him, inconsistent with his testimony upon this point. The account of the negotiations, as given in defendant's own testimony; the fact that he knew that the firm of Fleming & Templeton, even if dissolved, was still in liquidation; that one of the inducements for the loan (or 'loans') was the transfer of deposit accounts of equal or greater amount from the firm to the bank; that Templeton alone (as shown by the exhibits) appears to have corresponded with defendant concerning the notes; that defendant himself, as vice president of the bank, wrote to Templeton acknowledging receipt of the two notes for $15,000 each, 'signed \n\n[251 U.S. 68, 82]\n\u00a0\n by yourself and Fred Fleming,' and, having 'deducted the discount, $900,' inclosed the bank's draft 'order Fleming & Templeton for $29,100'; that when the notes fell due in December the correspondence concerning their renewal was conducted by defendant with Templeton alone, and they were treated as representing a single loan, and the discount was charged by defendant or under his direction in a single item; that after the borrowers had become notoriously insolvent, in February, 1908, defendant took part in transferring the notes 'without recourse' to the affiliated loan company in the manner and under the circumstances above stated; that the transfer was effected a few days after the visit of the bank examiner; that when the Deputy Comptroller wrote to the bank, classifying 'Fleming & Templeton $30,000' as an excessive loan, and demanding that the directors responsible from making it should assume the loss, defendant joined in signing the reply that has been quoted-all this, to say nothing of other circumstances that might be mentioned, would have warranted the jury in finding, notwithstanding defendant's denial, that in fact the disputed transaction was a single loan of $30,000, less discount, or, to be precise , $29,100 made to Fleming and Templeton jointly; that defendant knew and assented to this at the time; and that the taking of two notes was but a device to conceal the true nature of the transaction.\n\n\n (2)\n Irrespective of whether there was but a single loan, or were two separate loans, plaintiff in error contends that the liability of a surety must be added to his direct and primary liability in determining his total liabilities for money borrowed within the meaning of section 5200, and that in the present case, although the notes should be found to have represented two entirely separate loans, each within the limit, they must be added together in order to determine whether the limit was exceeded. Cochran v. United States, \n157 \nU.S. 286, 295\n, 296 S., 15 Sup. Ct. 628, is cited, where it was held \n\n[251 U.S. 68, 83]\n\u00a0\n that the word 'liabilities,' as employed in section 5211, R. S. (Comp. St .  9774), included contingent liabilities. We do not regard the case as controlling, because the purpose of that section, and the language employed, differ materially from the purpose and the language of the provision we are dealing with. As to whether in section 5200 the words 'the total liabilities ... of any person ... for money borrowed,' etc., require the liability of a surety or of an indorser for money borrowed by another to be added to his direct liability for money borrowed by himself in ascertaining whether the limit is exceeded-whatever view we might entertain, were the matter res nova-we are advised that by the practice and administrative rulings of the Comptroller of the Currency during a long period, if not from the beginning of national banking, liabilities which are incurred by one person avowedly and in fact as surety or as indorser for money borrowed by another are not included in the computation. We feel constrained to accept this as a practical construction of the section; and we are not prepared to say that in an action against a director, who knows and relies upon the fact that a particular obligation is signed by one merely as surety, although not so described, the defendant may not be permitted to show the truth.\n\n\n (3)\n In view of certain contentions urged here in behalf of defendant, and perhaps acceded to by the courts below, it should be said that the question whether defendant knowingly participated in or assented to the making of a loan in excess of the limit prescribed by section 5200 is not to be confused by any consideration of the supposed standing of the borrowers, personal or financial. The statutory limit is a special safeguard prescribed by Congress for the very purpose (among others) of preventing undue reliance upon the financial standing of borrowers. Nor would the absence of any improper motive or a desire for personal profit on defendant's part be a defense; nor the fact that \n\n[251 U.S. 68, 84]\n\u00a0\n in spite of a loss upon this transaction the bank remained solvent, or even prosperous. Neither is the question of defendant's liability, or the extent of it, to be affected by the fact, if it be a fact, that other officers or directors of the bank were in part responsible, yet defendant alone was sued; nor that the bank refrained from suing him until after a change in the stockholding interest or control. Again, in the absence of some special agreement-and none such appears-it is immaterial whether the new stockholders were aware of the excessive loan, or of defendant's alleged liability in the premises, at the time they acquired their stock, or whether they possibly may now profit by an increase in the value of the shares in the event of a recovery against him.\n It is clear from the language of section 5239, Rev. Stat., that every director knowingly participating in or assenting to a violation of any of the provisions of the act is 'liable in his personal and individual capacity,' without regard to the question whether other directors likewise are liable. The violation is in the nature of a tort, and the party injured may sue one or several of the joint participants. Bigelow v. Old Dominion Copper Co., \n225 \nU.S. 111, 132\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 641, Ann. Cas. 1913E, 875. And the liability extends to 'all damages which the association, its shareholders, or any other person, shall have sustained in consequence of such violation.' In the present action the bank represents the interest of its shareholders, as well as of its creditors; and if there was a violation of the act by defendant, with resulting diminution of its assets, the bank is entitled to recover the damages thus sustained, notwithstanding it remained solvent, and irrespective of any changes in its stockholding interest or control occurring between the time the cause of action arose and the time of the commencement of the suit or of the trial. Even if it appeared that new stockholders acquired their interests with knowledge of the fact that such a loss had been sustained and that defendant was responsible for it, \n\n[251 U.S. 68, 85]\n\u00a0\n neither they nor the bank would be thereby estopped from having full recovery from defendant. There is no reason in the law to disentitle a purchaser of shares from even relying upon the responsibility of directors to make good previous losses as an element adding intrinsic value to the shares. Compare Bigelow v. Old Dominion Copper Co., 74 N. J. Eq. 457, 500, 71 Atl. 153.\n\n\n (4)\n Defendant, among other defenses, pleaded the two-year statute of limitations of the state of Texas. Plaintiff demurred on the ground that this limitation was not a bar, and also replied, setting up certain facts that need not now be recited. The demurrer was overruled.\n The provisions of the Texas statutes upon the subject are Vernon's Sayles' Tex. Civ. Stat. 1914, arts. 5687, 5688, and 5690, set forth in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[251 U.S. 68, 86]\n\u00a0\n In our opinion, the action is not one of the kinds specified in article 5687, to which the two-year limitation applies, but is within the general description of article 5690, and subject only to the limitation of four years. Hence the limitation pleaded was no defense; and it is not contended that there was any basis in fact for pleading the four-year limitation.\n\n\n (5)\n Assuming the Fleming and Templeton notes were found to represent an excessive loan, knowingly participated in or assented to by defendant as a director of the bank, in our opinion the cause of action against him accrued on or about June 10, 1907, when the bank through his act parted with the money loaned, receiving in return only negotiable paper that it could not lawfully accept because the transaction was prohibited by section 5200, Rev. Stat. The damage as well as the injury was complete at that time, and the bank was not obliged to await the maturity of the notes, because immediately it became the duty of the officers or directors who knowingly participated in making the excessive loan to undo the wrong done by taking the notes off the hands of the bank and restoring to it the money that had been loaned. Of \n\n[251 U.S. 68, 87]\n\u00a0\n course, whatever of value the bank recovered from the borrowers on account of the loan would go in diminution of the damages; but the responsible officials would have no right to require the bank to pursue its remedies against the borrowers or await the liquidation of their estates. The liability imposed by the statute upon the directors is a direct liability, not contingent or collateral.\n\n\n (6)\n The question is raised whether the entire sum loaned, plus interest and less salvage, should be treated as damages sustained by the bank through the violation of the provisions of section 5200, Rev. Stat.- assuming it be found that defendant did knowingly violate them-or whether only the excess above what lawfully might have been loaned (presumably $20, 000) should be so regarded. We assume that if, in good faith and in the ordinary course of business, defendant had made a loan of $20,000 to Fleming and Templeton, and if while this loan remained unpaid he had afterwards and as a separate transaction unlawfully loaned them an additional $10,000 in excess of the limit, the damage legally attributable to his violation of the limiting provision would have been but $10,000. But that is not this case. According to the evidence, the $30,000, less discount, was paid out by the bank as a single payment; and, if the jury found it to have been loaned in excess of the statutory limit (whether in form one loan or two), it must be upon the ground that it was a single transaction. That being so it would follow that the entire amount disbursed by the bank was disbursed in violation of the law. The cause of action against a director knowingly participating in or assenting to such excessive loan would be complete at that moment, and entire; there would be no legal presumption that the borrowers would have accepted a loan within the limit, if their application for the excessive loan had been refused; nor that a director who in fact violated his duty as defined by law would, if mindful of it, have loaned them even $20,000. To mitigate in his favor \n\n[251 U.S. 68, 88]\n\u00a0\n the damages resulting from a breach of his statutory duty by resorting to the hypothesis that, if he had not disregarded the law in this respect, he would have pursued a different course of action within the law, would be an unwarranted resort to fiction in aid of a wrongdoer, and at the expense of the party injured. Hence the entire excessive loan would have to be regarded as the basis for computing the damages of the bank.\n\n\n (7)\n In behalf of defendant it is insisted that, assuming the loan was excessive, no loss accrued to the bank by reason of it, because the Fleming and Templeton notes and indebtedness were transferred to the loan company February 12, 1908, for a cash consideration equivalent to their face value, less interest to maturity.\n Plaintiff in error contends that the bank and the loan company were so identical in ownership and united in management that the latter was but the alter ego of the former, and a loss to the loan company on the notes was the same as a loss to the bank, not only practically, but in contemplation of law. On the other hand, the argument of defendant in error regards the two corporations as if they were wholly independent, treats the transfer of the notes from the bank to the loan company, in February, 1908, as valid and the money or credit contemporaneously transferred to the bank like money coming from an outside party, and looks upon the retransfer in January, 1910, as voluntary on the part of the bank, and an unnecessary assumption of loss that otherwise it had escaped.\n We cannot accede to either contention in the extreme. Because the bank and the loan company were distinct legal organizations, operating under separate charters derived from different sources, and possessing independent powers and privileges, we are constrained to hold that, notwithstanding the identity of stock ownership and their close affiliation in management, for some purposes they must be regarded as separate corporations-for \n\n[251 U.S. 68, 89]\n\u00a0\n instance, as being capable in law of contracting with each other. See Nashua Railroad v. Lowell Railroad, \n136 \nU.S. 356, 372\n, 373 S., 375, et seq., 10 Sup. Ct. 1004. But in considering the practical effect of such intercorporate dealings, especially as bearing upon the duties of the common directors and the authority of the stockholders to control them, we need not and ought not to overlook the identity of stock ownership. Thus the transfer of the notes in February, 1908, from the bank to the loan company, in consideration of their full face value ostensibly or actually paid by the company to the bank, evidently could have no effect in relieving the stockholding interest from loss, since each stockholder of one corporation had a corresponding interest in the stock of the other, and any theoretical saving that accrued to him as a stockholder of the bank was balanced by a corresponding loss sustained in his capacity as a stockholder of the company. At the same time the stockholders, in reviewing that transaction, might lawfully and properly base their action upon all the facts af the situation; recognizing the legal separateness of the corporations as existing in order to test the validity of the transfer and the feasibility of setting it aside without litigation, while giving effect to their community of interest in deciding whether this should be done, and, if so, then in what manner and upon what terms.\n\n\n (8)\n Regarding the two corporations as legally separate, and ignoring for the moment the community of stockholding interest, it is plain that the transaction of February 12, 1908, in which the bank sold the Fleming and Templeton notes and indebtedness to the loan company for their full face value, was prima facie tantamount to a satisfaction of the damages that the bank had sustained by reason of the excessive loan, but that it had this effect only provided the transaction was good and valid as against the loan company and its stockholders, or was duly ratified by them; for if it was invalid, or was made \n\n[251 U.S. 68, 90]\n\u00a0\n under circumstances rendering it voidable by the loan company, or the stockholders, neither the bank nor defendant was entitled to have the transaction stand for their benefit, and if in fact it was avoided for good cause, the bank would be entitled to its action against defendant, the same as if the annulled transaction never had occurred.\n Was there good cause for the rescission? The fact that the same persons were directors and managers of both corporations subjects their dealings inter sese to close scrutiny. That two corporations have a majority or even the whole membership of their boards of directors in common does not necessarily render transactions between them void; but transactions resulting from the agency of officers or directors acting at the same time for both must be deemed presumptively fraudulent, unless expressly authorized or ratified by the stockholders; and certainly, where the circumstances show, as by the undisputed evidence they tended to show in this case, that the transaction would be of great advantage to one corporation at the expense of the other, especially where, in addition to this, the personal interests of the directors, or any of them, would be enhanced at the expense of the stockholders, the transaction is voidable by the stockholders within a reasonable time after discovery of the fraud. Twin Lick Oil Co. v. Marbury, \n91 U.S. 587\n, 589; Wardell v. Railroad Co., \n103 U.S. 651\n, 657, et seq.; Thomas v. Brownville, etc., Railroad Co., \n109 \nU.S. 522, 524\n, 3 S. Sup. Ct. 315; Richardson v. Green, \n133 \nU.S. 30, 43\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 280; McGourkey v. Toledo & Ohio Ry., \n146 \nU.S. 536, 552\n, 565 S., 13 Sup. Ct. 170\n\n\n The evidence having tended to show a transfer of the notes in question from the bank to the loan company 'without recourse,' for a consideration equivalent to their full face value, after the insolvency of the makers had been brought to light, with resulting discredit of the notes as marketable paper and probable inability of the makers to pay them, a transaction carried out by directors and \n\n[251 U.S. 68, 91]\n\u00a0\n officers who acted as agents or trustees for both corporations, and one at least of whom, as the jury might find, was subject to criticism from the Comptroller of the Currency, and to an action at the suit of the bank, for making an excessive loan, it clearly was open to the jury to find that the transfer was fraudulent as against the loan company, and as against the stockholders of both companies. The jury should have been instructed to this effect, and, further, that if they found the transfer to have been fraudulent, the stockholders had the right to rescind it within a reasonable time after discovery of the fraud, and that if, having such right, the stockholders of the loan company asserted it and gave notice of its claim to the bank in the manner shown by the minutes, and the bank, recognizing and acknowledging the justness of the claim, restored to the loan company what was accepted as the equivalent in value of that which the bank had received in the transaction of February, 1908, this was not to be regarded as a voluntary or unnecessary assumption of loss by the bank, but on the contrary the result, so far as defendant was concerned, was the same as if by court decree, in a suit brought by the loan company, or by the stockholders, the bank had been compelled to make such restitution, and that thereafter the rescinded transaction could not be regarded as amounting, even in form of law, to a satisfaction of the damages sustained by the bank as a result of the Fleming and Templeton loan.\n So far as the evidence showed, neither the stockholders of the loan company, nor indeed its board of directors, ever expressly ratified or affirmed the transfer. Nor does it appear that there was any unreasonable delay on the part of the stockholders in taking action to set it aside after they had become aware of the circumstances; such delay as there was the bank waived, as it had a right to do; and defendant does not appear to have changed his position, or to have been prejudiced, by reason of it. \n\n[251 U.S. 68, 92]\n\u00a0\n Assuming, in defendant's favor, that because the corporations were legally separate they could not undo the transaction of February, 1908, without formal corporate action, the procedure adopted was sufficient for the purpose. It is objected that the personnel of the boards was changed for the very purpose of accomplishing the rescission, and that the new members were mere figureheads or dummies for the controlling stockholders, and had no bona fide stock of their own. But if the transaction of 1908 was a fraud as against the loan company, and done without authority of the stockholders, they were quite within their rights in acting through dummies, if necessary, in order to set it aside. We do not think it was necessary to change the membership of the boards; similar action by boards having identical membership would have had the same effect, if done by the express authority of the stockholders in order to undo an improper and unlawful act of former directors injurious to their interests.\n It is said that the rescission was put through in order to enable the bank to bring the present action against defendant. But it was not done to build up a ground of action against him, for this arose, if at all, prior to February 12, 1908; the damage to the bank being sustained when with his participation and assent its money was paid to Fleming and Templeton in June, 1907, for promissory notes that the bank could not lawfully take. Defendant's liability to the bank, if he was liable, was direct and primary, and to it the notes occupied the status of collateral security. Had the disposition made of them in February, 1908, been valid and unassailable, it would have borne the appearance of a satisfaction of the damages only because the two corporations were legally separate; but in substance, so far as the stockholders were concerned, it would have satisfied nothing, because it merely transferred money to them in one capacity by taking it from them in another. Defendant had no right to have the transaction remain \n\n[251 U.S. 68, 93]\n\u00a0\n in effect as a screen to protect him from suit by the bank under section 5239, Rev. Stat. So far as it may be supposed to have protected him while it remained unrescinded, the result was entirely gratuitous; no consideration having proceeded from him in the matter. Indeed, if his act in shifting the discredited loan was done in part to give him immunity from such an action as the present, this would furnish an additional ground entitling the stockholders to set the transfer aside. And if, either on this ground or on the ground that the transfer was put through for the advantage of one corporation at the expense of the other, by officers or directors acting at the same time for both and without the authority of the stockholders, the transaction was voidable by the stockholders and they resolved to avoid it, it would savor of absurdity to sustain defendant's contention that this was done in order to enable the bank to sue him; for, of course, they would have the right to do it for that very purpose.\n\n\n (9)\n In defendant's behalf it is insisted that at the time of the proceedings of January, 1910, the value of the cotton mill property was much less than $65,000, so that in the exchange made the bank in effect parted with little or no value for the return to it of the Fleming and Templeton notes and indebtedness. But for reasons already sufficiently indicated, we are of opinion that defendant is not entitled to raise an inquiry into the value of this property, as bearing either upon the question of the bank's right of action against him or upon the question of damages. If the loan company or the stockholders had good ground for rescinding the 1908 transaction, and this was done pursuant to their resolution, they might waive a return of the precise consideration and accept such equivalent in exchange as to them seemed proper. Because of the identity of the stockholding interest, the transaction, even while it stood, was, as we have shown, only a pseudo satisfaction of the bank's loss in the Fleming \n\n[251 U.S. 68, 94]\n\u00a0\n and Templeton loan; and when the real parties affected by this loss undertook on just grounds to set aside the transfer of the notes, and took such proceedings through action of the two corporations as were necessary for that purpose, they had a right to recognize the community of interest in settling the terms upon which this should be done, and defendant has no standing to complain.\n If there be a seeming inconsistency in sustaining a rescission of the 1908 transaction avowedly based upon the ground that the loan company had unjustly been subjected to a loss therein, while at the same time we treat as unimportant the question whether upon such rescission full restitution was made to that company, it should be said that we treat it as unimportant only so far as defendant is concerned, and, if there be inconsistency, it is no more than corrective of the unreality of the 1908 transaction itself. It is defendant who invokes that transaction as an actual realization by the bank of full value through a sale of the notes that it held as collateral security for its claim against him. If, regarding it as an actual sale, it was voidable, because done by agents acting at the same time in a dual capacity, or for other reasons, he cannot complain that the parties entitled to avoid it treated it as actual for the purpose of setting it aside, and in the consequent readjustment recognized a substantial identity of interest between seller and purchaser in the rescinded transaction that rendered it hardly an actual sale. For, to the extent that the sale was a sham, there was no realization by the bank upon the collateral security and hence no satisfaction of the damages claimed against him.\n The judgment under review must be reversed, to the end that there may be a new trial in accordance with the views above expressed.\n Judgment reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Art. 5687.

MALLEY(1919)\nNo. 649\nArgued: March 6, 1919Decided: March 17, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[249 U.S. 223, 224]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Felix Rockemann, of Boston, Mass., for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[249 U.S. 223, 227]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for respondent.\n\n\n[249 U.S. 223, 230]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action to recover taxes paid under protest to the Collector of Internal Revenue by the petitioners, the plaintiffs. The taxes were assessed to the plaintiffs as a joint-stock association within the meaning of the Income Tax Act of October 3, 1913, c. 16, Section II, G ( a), 38 Stat. 114, 166, 172, and were levied in respect of dividends received from a corporation that itself was taxable upon its net income. The plaintiffs say that they were not an association but simply trustees, and subject only to the duties imposed upon fiduciaries by Section II, D. The Circuit Court of Appeals decided that the plaintiffs, together, it would seem, with those for whose benefit they held the property, were an association, and ordered judgment for the defendant, reversing the judgment of the District Court. 250 Fed. 817, -- C. C. A. --. \n\n[249 U.S. 223, 231]\n\u00a0\n The facts are these: A Maine paper manufacturing corporation with eight shareholders had its mills on the Nashua River in Massachusetts and owned outlying land to protect the river from pollution. In 1912 a corporation was formed in Massachusetts. The Maine corporation conveyed to it seven mills and let to it an eighth that was in process of construction, together with the outlying lands and tenements, on a long lease, receiving the stock of the Massachusetts corporation in return. The Maine corporation then transferred to the plaintiffs as trustees the fee of the property subject to lease, left the Massachusetts stock in their hands, and was dissolved. By the declaration of trust the plaintiffs declared that they held the real estate and all other property at any time received by them thereunder, subject to the provisions thereof, 'for the benefit of the cestui que trusts (who shall be trust beneficiaries only, without partnership, associate or other relation whatever inter sese)' upon trust to convert the same into money and distribute the net proceeds to the persons then holding the trustees' receipt certificates-the time of distribution being left to the discretion of the trustees, but not to be postponed beyond the end of twenty years after the death of specified persons then living. In the meantime the trustees were to have the powers of owners. They were to distribute what they determined to be fairly distributable net income according to the interests of the cestui que trusts but could apply any funds in their hands for the repair or development of the property held by them, or the acquisition of other property, pending conversion and distribution. The trust was explained to be because of the determination of the Maine corporation to dissolve without waiting for the final cash sale of its real estate and was declared to be for the benefit of the eight shareholders of the Maine Company who were to receive certificates subject to transfer and sub \n\n[249 U.S. 223, 232]\n\u00a0\n division. Then followed a more detailed statement of the power of the trustees and provision for their compensation, not exceeding one per cent. of the gross income unless with the written consent of a majority in interest of the cestui que trusts. A similar consent was required for the filling of a vacancy among the trustees, and for a modification of the terms of the trust. In no other matter had the beneficiaries any control. The title of the trust was fixed for convenience as The Massachusetts Realty Trust.\n The declaration of trust on its face is an ordinary real estate trust of the kind familiar in Massachusetts unless in the particular that the trustees' receipt provides that the holder has no interest in any specific property and that it purports only to declare the holder entitled to certain fraction of the net proceeds of the property when converted into cash 'and meantime to income.' The only property expressly mentioned is the real estate not transferred to the Massachusetts corporation. Although the trustees in fact have held the stock of that corporation and have collected dividends upon it, their doing so is not contemplated in terms by the instrument. It does not appear very clearly that the eight Maine shareholders might not have demanded it had they been so minded. The function of the trustees is not to manage the mills but simply to collect the rents and income of such property as may be in their hands, with a large discretion in the application of it, but with a recognition that the receipt holders are entitled to it subject to the exercise of the powers confided to the trustees. In fact, the whole income, less taxes and similar expenses, has been paid over in due proportion to the holders of the receipts.\n There can be little doubt that in Massachusetts this arrangement would be held to create a trust and nothing more. 'The certificate holders ... are in no way associated together nor is there any provision in the ... \n\n[249 U.S. 223, 233]\n\u00a0\n [instrument] for any meeting to be held by them. The only act which (under the [declaration of] trust ...) they can do is consent to an alteration ... of the trust' and to the other matters that we have mentioned. They are confined to giving or withholding assent, and the giving or withholding it 'is not to be had in a meeting but is to be given by them individually.' 'The sole right of the cestuis que trust is to have the property administered in their interest by the trustees, who are the masters, to receive income while the trust lasts, and their share of the corpus when the trust comes to an end.' Williams v. Milton, 215 Mass. 1, 8, 10, 11, 102 N. E. 355, 358. The question is whether a different view is required by the terms of the present act. As by D above referred to trustees and associations acting in a fiduciary capacity have the exemption that individual stockholders have from taxation upon dividends of a corporation that itself pays an income tax, and as the plaintiffs undeniably are trustees, if they are to be subjected to a double liability the language of the statute must make the intention clear. Gould v. Gould, \n245 \nU.S. 151, 153\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 53; United States v. Isham, 17 Wall. 496, 504.\n The requirement of G (a) is that the normal tax thereinbefore imposed upon individuals shall be paid upon the entire net income accruing from all sources during the preceding year 'to every corporation, jointstock company or association, and every insurance company, organized in the United States, no matter how created or organized, not including partnerships.' The trust that has been described would not fall under any familiar conception of a joint-stock association, whether formed under a statute or not. Smith v. Anderson, 15 Ch. D. 247, 273, 274, 277, 282; Eliot v. Freeman, \n220 \nU.S. 178, 186\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 360. If we assume that the words 'no matter how created or organized' apply to 'association' and not only to 'insurance company,' still it would be a wide departure \n\n[249 U.S. 223, 234]\n\u00a0\n from normal usage to call the beneficiaries here a joint-stock association when they are admitted not to be partners in any sense, and when they have no joint action or interest and no control over the fund. On the other hand, the trustees by themselves cannot be a jointstock association within the meaning of the act unless all trustees with discretionary powers are such, and the special provision for trustees in D is to be made meaningless. We perceive no ground for grouping the two-beneficiaries and trustees-together, in order to turn them into an association, by uniting their contrasted functions and powers, although they are in no proper sense associated. It seems to be an unnatural perversion of a well-known institution of the law.\n We do not see either that the result is affected by any technical analysis of the individual receipt holder's rights in the income received by the trustees. The description most in accord with what has been the practice would be that, as the receipts declare, the holders, until distribution of the capital, were entitled to the income of the fund subject to an unexercised power in the trustees in their reasonable discretion to divert it to the improvement of the capital. But even if it were said that the receipt holders were not entitled to the income as such until they got it, we do not discern how that would turn them into a joint- stock company. Moreover the receipt holders did get it and the question is what portion it was the duty of the trustees to withhold.\n We presume that the taxation of corporations and joint-stock companies upon dividends of corporations that themselves pay the income tax was for the purpose of discouraging combinations of the kind now in disfavor, by which a corporation holds controlling interests in other corporations which in their turn may control others, and so on, and in this way concentrates a power that is disapproved. There is nothing of that sort here. Upon the \n\n[249 U.S. 223, 235]\n\u00a0\n whole case we are of opinion that the statute fails to show a clear intent to subject the dividends on the Massachusetts corporation's stock to the extra tax imposed by G (a).\n Our view upon the main question opens a second one upon which the Circuit Court of Appeals did not have to pass. The District Court while it found for the plaintiffs, ruled that the defendant was entitled to retain out of the sum received by him the amount of the tax that they should have paid as trustees. To this plaintiffs took a cross writ of error to the Circuit Court of Appeals. There can be no question that although the plaintiffs escape the larger liability, there was probable cause for the defendant's act. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue rejected the plaintiff's claim, and the statute does not leave the matter clear. The recovery therefore will be from the United States. Rev. St.  989 (Comp. St.  1635). The plaintiffs, as they themselves alleged in their claim, were the persons taxed, whether they were called an association or trustees. They were taxed too much. If the United States retains from the amount received by it the amount that it should have received, it cannot recover that sum in a subsequent suit.\n Judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.\n Judgment of the District Court affirmed. \n\n\n\n","65":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDAKOTA CENT TEL CO. v.

Sweet, of Rapid City, S. D., for defendants in error.\n\n\n[250 U.S. 163, 179]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Involving as this case does the existence of state power to regulate, without the consent of the United States, telephone rates for business done wholly within the state over lines taken over into the possession of the United States and which by the exercise of its governmental authority it operates and controls, it does not in principle differ from the North Dakota case (Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. State of North Dakota, \n250 U.S. 135\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 502, 63 L. Ed. --), just announced, where it was decided that under like conditions the state had no such power as to railroad rates. We consider this case as far as may be necessary, by a separate opinion, however, because the authority under which the control was exerted is distinct and because of the assumption in argument that this distinction begets a difference in the principles applicable.\n In January, 1919, the state of South Dakota on the relation of its Attorney General and Railroad Commissioners sued the Dakota Central and other telephone companies doing business within the state to enjoin them from putting in effect a schedule of rates as to local business which it was alleged had been prepared by the Postmaster General and which it was averred the telephone companies were about to apply and enforce. It was charged that such rates were higher than those fixed by state authority and that the proposed action of the companies would be violative of state law, since the companies were under the \n\n[250 U.S. 163, 180]\n\u00a0\n duty to disregard the action of the Postmaster General and apply only the lawful state rates. The duty of the relators, as state officers, to prevent such wrong was alleged-a duty in which, it was further asserted, the state had a pecuniary interest springing from the expenditure which it was obliged to make for telephone services.\n The companies answered, disclaiming all interest in the controversy on the ground that by contract, a copy of which with one of the defendant companies was annexed, their telephone lines and everything appurtenant thereto had passed into the possession and control of the United States and were being operated by it as a governmental agency. The answer also alleged that any connection of the companies through their officials or employes with the business was solely because of employment by the United States. The purpose to enforce the rates fixed by the Postmaster General was admitted and it was averred that the suit was one over which the court had no jurisdiction because it was against the United States.\n The case was heard on the bill, answer, exhibits, and an admission by all the parties that the contract annexed to the answer was accurate and that a similar one had been made with all the other defendants.\n Assuming that Congress had power to take over the telephone lines, that it had conferred that power upon the President, that the power had by the President been called into play conformably to the authority granted, and that the telephone lines were under the complete control of the United States, the court yet held that the state had the power to fix the local rates. In reaching this conclusion the o urt, assuming argumentatively that the right which the United States possessed gave at least the implied authority to fix all rates, nevertheless held that such power did not embrace intrastate rates because they had been carved out of the grant of power by Congress in conferring authority on the President. It was \n\n[250 U.S. 163, 181]\n\u00a0\n therefore decided that the President, the Postmaster General, and those operating the telephone service under his authority were mere wrongdoers in giving effect to the rates fixed by the Postmaster General and in refusing to enforce the conflicting intrastate rates made lawful by state law. The proceedings to prevent this wrong, it was held, did not constitute a suit against the United States and the injunction prayed was granted.\n The appellees do not confine their contention to the question of statutory construction below decided. On the contrary, they press questions of power which the court below assumed and did not pass upon and insist upon a construction of the statute contrary to that which the court below took for granted as a prelude to the question of construction upon which is based its conclusion.\n We must dispose of the issues thus insisted upon before testing the soundness of the interpretation of the statute upon which the court below acted, and for the purpose of considering them as well as the question of construction which the court below expressly decided, we state the case.\n On the 16th of July, 1918, congress adopted a joint resolution (40 Stat. 904, c. 154 [Comp. St. 1918,  3115 3\/4 x, appendix]), providing:\n'That the President during the continuance of the present war is authorized and empowered, whenever he shall deem it necessary for the national security or defense, to supervise or to take possession and assume control of any telegraph, telephone, marine cable, or radio system or systems, or any part thereof, and to operate the same in such manner as may be needful or desirable for the duration of the war, which supervision, possession, control, or operation shall not extend beyond the date of the proclamation by the President of the exchange of ratifications of the treaty of peace: Provided, that just compensation shall be made for such supervision, possession, control, or operation, to be determined by the President: ... \n\n[250 U.S. 163, 182]\n\u00a0\n Provided further, that nothing in this act shall be construed to amend, repeal, impair, or affect existing laws or powers of the states in relation to taxation or the lawful police regulations of the several states, except wherein such laws, powers, or regulations may affect the transmission of government communications, or the issue of stocks and bonds by such system or systems.'\n\n Six days thereafter, on the 22d of July, the President exerted the power thus given. Its exercise was manifested by a proclamation, which, after reciting the resolution of Congress, declared:\n'It is deemed necessary for the national security and defense to supervise and take possession and assume control of all telegraph and telephone systems and to operate the same in such manner as may be needful or desirable.\n\n'Now, therefore, I, Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States, under and by virtue of the powers vested in me by the foregoing resolution, and by virtue of all other powers thereto me enabling, do hereby take possession and assume control and supervision of each and every telegraph and telephone system, and every part thereof, within the jurisdiction of the United States, including all equipment thereof and appurtenances thereto whatsoever and all materials and supplies.\n\n'It is hereby directed that the supervision, possession, control, and operation of such telegraph and telephone systems hereby by me undertaken shall be exercised by and through the Postmaster General . ...'\n\n The proclamation gave to the Postmaster General plenary power to exert his authority to the extent he might deem desirable through the existing owners, managers, directors or officers of the telegraph or telephone lines, andi t was provided that their services might continue as permitted by general or special orders of the Pestmaster \n\n[250 U.S. 163, 183]\n\u00a0\n General. It was declared that--\n'From and after twelve o'clock midnight on the 31st day of July, 1918, all telegraph and telephone systems included in this order and proclamation shall conclusively be deemed within the possession and control and under the supervision of said Postmaster General without further act or notice.'\n\n Under this authority the Postmaster General assumed possession and control of the telephone lines and operated the same. On the 31st day of October, 1918 , the President through the Postmaster General, in the exertion of the duty imposed upon him by the resolution of Congress to make compensation, concluded a contract with the telephone companies of the most comprehensive character covering the whole field while the possession, control and operation by the United States continued. By its terms stipulated amounts were to be paid as consideration for the possession, control and operation by the United States and the earnings resulting from such operation became the property of the United States. Although concluded in October, 1918, by stipulation the contract related back to the time when the President took over the property.\n Following this, by authority of the President, the Postmaster General fixed a general schedule of rates and it was the order to put this schedule in effect which gave rise to the suit, the trial, and the resulting judgment which we have now under consideration.\n That under its war power Congress possessed the right to confer upon the President the authority which it gave him we think needs nothing here but statement, as we have disposed of that subject in the North Dakota railroad rate case. And the completeness of the war power under which the authority was exerted and by which completeness its exercise is to be tested suffices, we think, to dispose of the many other contentions urged as to the want of power in Congress to confer upon the President the authority which it gave him. \n\n[250 U.S. 163, 184]\n\u00a0\n The proposition that the President in exercising the power exceeded the authority given him is based upon two considerations: First, because there was nothing in the conditions at the time the power was exercised which justified the calling into play of the authority; indeed, the contention goes further and assails the motives which it is asserted induced the exercise of the power. But as the contention at best concerns not a want of power, but a mere excess or abuse of discretion in exerting a power given, it is clear that it involves considerations which are beyond the reach of judicial power. This must be since, as this court has often pointed out, the judicial may not invade the legislative or executive departments so as to correct alleged mistakes or wrongs arising from asserted abuse of discretion.\n The second contention, although it apparently rests upon the assertion that there was an absence of power in the President to exert the authority to the extent to which he did exert it, when it is correctly understood amounts only to an asserted limitation on the power granted based upon a plain misconception of the terms of the resolution of Congress by which the power was given. In other words, it assumed that by the resolution only a limited power as to the telephone lines was conferred upon the President, and hence that the assumption by him of complete possession and control was beyond the authority possessed. But although it may be conceded that there is some ground for contending, in view of the elements of authority enumerated in the resolution of Congress, that there was power given to take less than the whole if the President deemed it best to do so, we are of opinion that authority was conferred as to all the enumerated elements and that there was hence a right in the President to take complete possession and control to enable the full operation of the lines embraced in the authority. The contemporaneous official steps taken to give effec to the resolution, \n\n[250 U.S. 163, 185]\n\u00a0\n the proclamation of the President, the action of the Postmaster General under the authority of the President, the contracts made with the telephone companies in pursuance of authority to fix their compensation, all establish the accuracy of this view, since they all make it clear that it was assumed that power to take full control was conferred and that it was exerted so as to embrace the entire business and the right to the entire revenues to arise from the act of the United States in carrying it out. Indeed, Congress in subsequently dealing with the situation thus produced would seem to have entertained the same conception as to the scope of the power conveyed by the resolution and dealt with it from that point of view. Act Oct. 30, 1918, c. 197, 40 Stat. 1017\n\n\n This brings us to the proposition upon which the court based its conclusion, that is, that although complete possession, exclusive control, and the right to all the revenues derived from the operation of the business were in the United States as the result of the resolution, the proclamation, and the contracts, yet as to intrastate earnings, the state power remained to 'incumber' the authority of the United States, because that situation necessarily resulted from the terms of the congressional resolution.\n This superficially was based on an interpretation of the resolution, but in substance was caused by the application to the clause of the resolution interpreted, of the erroneous presumption as to the continuance of state power dealt with in the North Dakota case. Let us see if this is not necessarily so. The provision dealt with was the proviso of the resolution which in the first place saved 'the lawful police regulations of the several states' and therefore subjected the control of the United States to the operation of such power, and in the second place prohibited the states during the United States control from exerting authority as to the issue of stocks and bonds.\n It was conceded that the words 'police power' were \n\n[250 U.S. 163, 186]\n\u00a0\n susceptible of two significations, a comprehensive one embracing in substance the whole field of state authority and the other a narrower one including only state power to deal with the health, safety and morals of the people. Although it was admitted that the reservation, considered intrinsically, was not susceptible of being interpreted in the broader of the two lights, it was held that it was necessary to so interpret it because of the clause of the proviso prohibiting the states from legislating concerning the issue of stocks and bonds by the companies during the United States control. The reasoning was this: It was inconceivable, it was said, that the subject, stocks and bonds, should have been withdrawn from state control by an express prohibition unless that subject would have been under state control in the absence of the prohibition, a result which could only exist by giving the saving clause as to police power its widest significance. But the fact that the rule of construction applied had the result of incorporating in the act of Congress unlimited state authority merely as the result of a prohibition by Congress against the exertion of state power in a specific instance, in and of itself admonishes of the incorrectness of the rule. But its want of foundation is established by two further considerations: (1) Because it causes the provision as to stocks and bonds, which was plainly enacted to preserve the financial control of the United States over the corporations, to limit if not destroy such control; (2) because by converting the prohibition against state power into an affirmative and comprehensive grant of that power, it so interprets the act as to limit the grant of authority which the act beyond doubt gave to the United States. These considerations not only show the mistake of the interpretation, but also point out the confusion and conflict which must necessarily arise from giving effect to the mistaken presumption of the continuance of state power to which we hv e previously referred.\n\n\n[250 U.S. 163, 187]\n\u00a0\n Inherently the power of a state to fix rates to be charged for intrastate carriage or transmission is in its nature but derivative, since it arises from the depends upon the duty of those engaged in intrastate commerce to charge only reasonable rates for the services by them rendered, and the authority possessed by the state to exact a compliance with that duty. Conceding that it was within the power of Congress, subject to constitutional limitations, to transplant the state power as to intrastate rates into a sphere where it, Congress, had complete control over telephone lines because it had taken possession of them and was operating them as a governmental agency, it must follow that in such sphere there sould be nothing upon which the state power could be exerted except upon the power of the United States; that is, its authority to fix rates for the services which it was rendering through its governmental agencies. The anomaly resulting from such conditions adds cogency to the reasons by which in the North Dakota case the error in presuming the continuance of state power in such a situation was pointed out and makes it certain that such a result could be brought about only by clear expression or at least from the most convincing implication.\n This disposes of the case, but before leaving it we observe that we have not overlooked in its consideration the references made to proceedings in Congress concerning the resolution at the time of its passage, and further, that we have also considered all the suggestions made in the many and voluminous briefs filed on behalf of various state authorities and individuals having interests in suits pending elsewhere, concerning the construction of the resolution. In saying this, however, we must except suggestions as to want of wisdom or necessity for conferring the power given, or as to the precipitate or uncalled for exertion of the power as conferred, from all of which we have turned aside because the right to consider them was wholly beyond the sphere of judicial authority. \n\n[250 U.S. 163, 188]\n\u00a0\n In view of our conclusion we shall in this case, as we did in the previous one and for the reasons therein stated, content ourselves with reversing the judgment below upon the merits with directions for such further proceedings as may be not inconsistent with this opinion.\n And it is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS dissents. \n\n\n\n","66":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDANA v.

The controversy concerned the right to tax under the Massachusetts Statutes of 1909, c. 490, pt. 4,  1, as amended by St. 1912, c. 678, the passing of certain interests under the will of Edith L. Dana, in the Duluth and Gladstone Real Estate Trust, in 30 preferred shares and 45 common shares of the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company and in 130 shares of the Boston Ground Rent Trust.\n The probate court held in favor of the treasurer and receiver general- that all of the interests of the testatrix in the several trusts and companies named were taxable under the Massachusetts statute. The case was decided in the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts on June 29, 1917, and final decree entered July 23, 1917. 227 Mass. 562, 116 N. E. 941. The ground upon which it is sought to bring the case here on writ of error rests upon the assertion that the Supreme Judicial Court erred in sustaining the succession tax because it was imposed on or on account of real estate situated outside of Massachusetts; therefore rendering the assessment of the tax a violation of rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment to \n\n[250 U.S. 220, 222]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution of the United States, in that it took the property of the plaintiff in error without due process of law.\n The case was decided, and the decree entered in the Supreme Judicial Court, since the passage of Act Sept. 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726, amending, by section 2 thereof, section 237 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1156 [Comp. St.  1214]). Since the passage of the amendment, cases brought within its effect, of the character of this one, cannot be brought here by writ of error unless there is drawn in question the validity of a statute of or an authority exercised under the state on the ground of their being repugnant to the federal Constitution, treaties, or laws. Other cases of alleged denial of federal rights, as specified in the statute, can be reviewed in this court only upon writ of certiorari.\n An examination of the record in the case and the opinion of the Supreme Judicial Court, shows that neither the validity of the statute, nor the validity of any authority exercised under the state was drawn in question. The case was decided on the view which the Supreme Judicial Court entertained of the character of the property involved, and neither in the record nor in the opinion of the court does it appear that any quesion of the court does it appear that any question validity of the statute of the state, or of an authority exercised under the state, on the ground of their repugnancy to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States. It follows that the only right of review in this court of the decree of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts was by writ of certiorari. It is only necessary to refer to our decisions construing the amendment of September 6, 1916. Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Co. v. Gilbert, \n245 U.S. 162\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 58; Ireland v.

COOLEY(1919)\nNo. 37\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. Edwin A. Krauthoff, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiffs in error.[ Danciger v. Cooley \n248 U.S. 319\n (1919) ]\n\n\n[248 U.S. 319, 321]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edwin A. Austin, of Topeka, Kan., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Danciger Bros., who conducted a mail-order liquor business in Kansas City, Missouri, brought this suit in a Kansas court to recover from Cooley certain moneys collected by him, under an arrangement with them, as the purchase price of intoxicating liquors sold by them in interstate commerce, and also to enforce a similar claim assigned to them by anothr liquor dealer. After issue and trial Cooley prevailed and the judgment was affirmed; the appellate court holding that the arrangement under which the moneys were collected involved a violation of section 239 of the Criminal Code of the United States (Act March 4, 1909, c. 321, 35 Stat. 1136 [Comp. St.  10409]), and that, applying the settled rule of the Kansas courts, a principal who employs an agent to make collections in violation of a criminal law cannot compel the agent to account for what he collects. 98 Kan. 38, 484, 157 Pac. 453, 158 Pac. 1119. The case is here on writ of error sued out prior to the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726.\n These are the facts: During the year 1910 Danciger Bros. received through the mails several orders for whisky from customers in Topeka, Kansas, and in each instance shipped the liquor from Kansas City, Missouri, to Topeka as freight. Each package was consigned to the shipper's order and was to be delivered by the carrier only on the surrender of the bill of lading properly indorsed. A sight draft was drawn on the customer for the purchase price and this with the bill of lading attached was sent to Cooley under an arrangement whereby he was to collect the draft, was then to hand the bill of lading \n\n[248 U.S. 319, 322]\n\u00a0\n suitably indorsed to the customer to enable the latter to get the package from the carrier, and ultimately was to remit to Danciger Bros. The amount collected less a commission for the service rendered. Before this arrangement was made the banks had refused to make such collections.\n The assigned claim need not be separately described, for it was essentially like the other.\n As the transactions occurred before the passage of the Webb-Kenyou Act, March 1, 1913, c. 90, 37 Stat. 699 (Comp. St.  8739), we are not concerned with it, but only with the situation therefore existing.\n Whether section 239 of the Criminal Code reaches and embraces acts done by an agent such as Cooley was in this instance, or is confined to acts of common carriers and their agents, is a question about which there has been some contrariety of opinion, and it is now before this court for the first time. Of course, the chief factor in its solution must be the words of the statute. Omitting what is irrelevant here, they are:\n'Sec. 239. Any railroad company, express company, or other common carrier, or any other person who, in connection with the transportation of any ... intoxicating liquor ... from one state ... into another state, ... shall collect the purchase price or any part thereof, before, on, or after delivery, from the consignee, or from any other person, or shall in any manner act as the agent of the buyer or seller of any such liquor, for the purpose of buying or selling or completing the sale thereof, saving only in the actual transportation and delivery of the same, shall be fined,' etc.\n\n A reference to the conditions existing when the section was enacted, in 1909, will, together with its words, conduce to a right understanding of the evil at which it is aimed and the relief it is intended to afford. The conditions \n\n[248 U.S. 319, 323]\n\u00a0\n were these: In some of the states there were state-wide laws prohibiting the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquor; in some there was a like prohibition operative only in particular districts, and in other states the business was lawful. But the prohibitory laws did not reach sales or transportation in interstate commerce, for under the Constitution of the United States that was a matter which only Congress could regulate. True, there was a regulation by Congress, known as the Wilson Act Aug. 8, 1890, c. 728, 26 Stat. 313 (Comp. St.  8738), which subjected liquor transported into a state to the operation of the laws of the state enacted in the exercise of its police power, but the time when the liquor was thus to come within the operation of those laws was after the shipment arrived at the point of destination and was there delivered by the carrier. Rhodes v. Iowa, \n170 \nU.S. 412, 426\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 664. Thus a state, although able effectively to prohibit the manufacture and sale of liquor within its own territory, was unable to prevent its introduction from other states through the channels of interstate commerce. Of course, the real purpose of the prohibitory laws was to prevent the use of liquor by cutting off the means of obtaining it. But with the channels of interstate commerce open those laws were failing in their purpose, for dealers in states where it was lawful to sell were supplying the wants of intending users in states where manufacture and sale were prohibited. This interstate business generally was carried on by means of orders transmitted through the mails and of shipments made according to some plan whereby ultimate delivery was dependent on payment of the purchase price. The plans varied in detail, but not in principle or result. All included the collection of the purchase price at the point of destination before or on delivery. One made the carrier having the shipment the collecting agent; another committed the collections to a separate carrier, the liquor being forwarded as railroad freight \n\n[248 U.S. 319, 324]\n\u00a0\n and the bill of lading being sent to an express company with instructions to hand it to the buyer when the money was paid; and still another made use of an agent, such as Cooley was here, the bill of lading being sent to him with a sight draft on the buyer for the purchase price. In some instances the liquor was consigned to the buyer and in others to the shipper's order, the bill of lading then being suitably indorsed by the shipper.\n Where the transactions were real and not merely colorable, the business so conducted was lawful interstate commerce and entitled to protection as such until the sale and transportation were consummated by the delivery of the liquor to the vendee at the point of destination. Such was the decision of this court in American Express Co. v. Iowa, \n196 U.S. 133\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 182, a case which arose out of the transportation into the state of Iowa of a collect-on-delivery shipment of liquor ordered from a dealer in Illinois. The Supreme Court of Iowa had held that, as the sale was to be completed in that state by payment and delivery there, the laws of the state enacted to prevent sales of liquor therein applied. This court reversed that ruling and said in the opinion ( \n196 \nU.S. 143, 144\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 184 [49 L. Ed. 417]):\n'The right of the parties to make a contract in Illinois for the sale and purchase of merchandise, and in doing so to fix by agreement the time when [and] the condition on which the completed title should pass, is beyond question. The shipment from the state of Illinois into the state of Iowa of the merchandise constituted interstate commerce. ...\n\n'When it is considered that the necessary result of the ruling below was to hold that wherever merchandise shipped from one state to another is not completely delivered to the buyer at the point of shipment so as to be at his risk from that moment the movement of such merchandise is not interstate commerce, it becomes apparent \n\n[248 U.S. 319, 325]\n\u00a0\n that the principle, if sustained, would operate materially to cripple if not destroy that freedom of commerce between the states which it was the great purpose of the Constitution to promote. If upheld, the doctrine would deprive a citizen of one state of his right to order merchandise from another state at the risk of the seller as to delivery. It would prevent the citizen of one state from shipping into another unless he assumed the risk; it would subject contracts made by common carriers and valid by the laws of the state where made to the laws of another state, and it would remove from the protection of the interstate commerce clause all goods on consignment upon any condition as to delivery, express or implied. Besides, it would also render the commerce clause of the Constitution inoperative as to all that vast body of transactions by which the products of the country move in the channels of interstate commerce by means of bills of lading to the shipper's order with drafts for the purchase price attached, and many other transactions essential to the freedom of commerce, by which the complete title to merchandise is postponed to the delivery thereof.'\n\n After that decision the matter of further regulating interstate commerce in liquor was much considered in Congress and as a result of extended hearings conducted by the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate that committee, speaking through Senator Knox, proposed the enactment of what afterwards became sections 238-240 of the Criminal Code ( Comp. St.  10408-10410). The report of the committee shows that its attention was directed to the practice of shipping liquor from one state into another, to be paid for as a condition to delivery, and that the committee regarded it as an evil which should be met and corrected.\n With the conditions just described in mind we come to examine section 239. It consists of two parts, both relating to liquor transported from one state into another. The first deals with the collection of the purchase price, and \n\n[248 U.S. 319, 326]\n\u00a0\n the second with acts done 'for the purpose of buying or selling or completing the sale' of 'any such liquor.' If the meaning of the first is affected by the second it is not in a restrictive way, but the reverse, so, if Cooley and his acts are within the first, the second need not be noticed further. The first, as before quoted, says:\n'Any railroad company, express company, or other common carrier, or any other person who, in connection with the transportation of any ... intoxicating liquor ... from one state ... into another state, ... shall collect the purchase price or any part thereof, before, on, or after delivery, from the consignee, or from any other person, ... shall be fined,' etc.\n\n The words 'any railroad company, express company, or other common carrier,' comprehend all public carriers; and the words 'or any other person' are equally broad. When combined they perfectly express a purpose to include all common carriers and all persons; and it does not detract from this view that the inclusion of railroad companies and express companies is emphasized by specially naming them. To hold that the words 'or any other person' have the same meaning as if they were 'or any agent of a common carrier' would be not merely to depart from the primary rule that words are to be taken in their ordinary sense, but to narrow the operation of the statute to an extent that would seriously imperil the accomplishment of its purpose. The rule that where particular words of description are followed by general terms the latter will be regarded as applicable only to persons of things of a like class is invoked in this connection, but it is far from being of universal application, and never is applied when to do so will give to a statute an operation different from that intended by the body enacting it. Its proper office is to give effect to the true intention of that body, not to defeat it. United States v. Mescall, \n215 U.S. 26\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 19. \n\n[248 U.S. 319, 327]\n\u00a0\n Without question the practice of collecting the purchase price at the point of destination as a condition to delivery is the thing at which the statute is aimed. Through that practice the sale of liquor in interstate commerce was rapidly increasing. But, as before shown, such collections were not confined to carriers and their agents, but often were made by others. In principle and result there was no difference; the evil was the same in either event. Besides, if the statute were made applicable only to carriers and their agents, it could be evaded so readily by having other collectors that it would accomplish nothing. The volume of the business and the attending mischief would be unaffected. Doubtless all this was in mind when the statute was drafted and accounts for its comprehensive terms. That the words 'or any other person' are intended to include all persons committing the acts described is, as we think, quite plain.\n To be within the statute it is essential that the act of collecting the purchase price be done 'in connection with the transportation of' the liquor. The statute does not say 'in the transportation,' but 'in connection with' it. Transportation, as this court often has said, is not completed until the shipment arrives at the point of destination and is there delivered. Rhodes v. Iowa, \n170 \nU.S. 412, 415\n, 420 S., 18 Sup. Ct. 664; Vance v. Vandercook Co., \n170 \nU.S. 438, 451\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 674; Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Cook Brewing Co., \n223 \nU.S. 70, 82\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 189; Kirmeyer v. Kansas, \n236 \nU.S. 568, 572\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 419; Rosenberger v. Pacific Express Co., \n241 \nU.S. 48, 50\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 510. What Cooley did, while not part of the transportation, was closely connected with it. He was at the point of destination and held the bill of lading, which carried with it control over the delivery. Conforming to his principal's instructions he required that the purchase price be paid before the bill of lading was passed to the vendee. The money was paid under that requirement and he then turned over the bill of lading. A delivery of the shipment \n\n[248 U.S. 319, 328]\n\u00a0\n followed and that completed the transportation. Had the carrier done what he did all would agree that the requisite connection was present. As the true test of its presence is the relation of the collection, rather than the collector, to the transportation, it would seem to be equally present here.\n We conclude that section 239 reaches and embraces acts done by an agent such as Cooley was. The ruling on the right of a principal to recover from an agent money received by the latter in carrying out an arrangement between them which involved the violation of a criminal statute turned on a question of local law and cannot be re-examined here.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","68":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDARLING v.

A demurrer was sustained by the Court of first instance and on appeal by the Supreme Court of Appeals, and the bill was dismissed. 96 S. E. 307. The material facts are few. The plaintiff holds leases of the beds \n\n[249 U.S. 540, 542]\n\u00a0\n from the State. The original ones were made in 1884 and 1885 for twenty years. In 1903, 1905 and 1912 they were what is called reassigned to the plaintiff by what we understand to have been new leases, by statute to be deemed continuations of the original leases. In 1896 the City of Newport News was incorporated with the grant of the right to build sewers, which the City built in the manner complained of. The grant, coupled with Acts of 1908, c. 349, pp. 623, 624, authorizes the present discharge through Salter's Creek into the tide waters of Hampton Roads, with the effect alleged. By section 2137 of the Code of Virginia it is provided that so long as a lessee of oyster beds continues to pay the rent reserved 'he shall have the exclusive right to occupy said land for a period of twenty years, subject to such rights, if any, as any other person or persons may previously have acquired.' By section 2137a, originally Act of March 5, 1894, c. 743,  2, Acts 1893-94, pp. 840, 847, while he pays rent as required 'the State will guarantee the absolute right to the renter to continue to use and occupy the same for the period of twenty years the renter acquired.' The bill alleges that if the statutes purport to authorize the destruction of the plaintiff's oysters they are contrary to the Constitution of the United States and specifically to the Fourteenth Amendment. In the assignment of errors to the Supreme Court of Appeals the statutes are said also to violate the contract clause. Article 1,  10. The jurisdiction of this Court is clear.\n The fundamental question as to the rights of holders of land under tide waters does not present the conflict of two vitally important interests that exists with regard to fresh water streams. There the needs of water supply and of drainage compete. Missouri v. Illinois, \n200 \nU.S. 496, 521\n, 522 S., 26 Sup. Ct. 268. The ocean hitherto has been treated as open to the discharge of sewage from the cities upon its shores. Whatever science may accomplish in the future \n\n[249 U.S. 540, 543]\n\u00a0\n we are not aware that it yet has discovered any generally accepted way of avoiding the practical necessity of so using the great natural purifying basin. Unless precluded by some right of a neighboring State, such as is not in question here, or by some act of its own, or of the United States, clearly a State may authorize a city to empty its drains into the sea. Such at least would be its power unless it should create a nuisance that so seriously interfered with private property as to infringe Constitutional rights. And we apprehend that the mere ownership of a tract of land under the salt water would not be enough of itself to give a right to prevent the fouling of the water as supposed. The ownership of such land, as distinguished from the shore, would be subject to the natural uses of the water. So much may be accepted from the decisions in Virginia and elsewhere as established law. Hampton v. Watson, 119 Va. 95, 89 S. E. 81, L. R. A. 1916F, 189; Haskell v. New Bedford, 108 Mass. 208, 214; Marcus Sayre Co. v. Newark, 60 N. J. Eq. 361, 45 Atl. 985; Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. Illinois, \n146 \nU.S. 387, 459\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 110\n\n\n The question before us then narrows itself to whether the State has done any act that precludes it from exercising what otherwise would be its powers. On that issue we shall not inquire more curiously than did the Supreme Court of Appeals into the statutory warrant for the leases, or go into relative dates, but shall assume, for the purposes of decision, that the plaintiff is a lessee and is entitled to the benefit of the clauses that we have quoted from the Code. But we agree with the Court below that when land is let under the water of Hampton Roads, even though let for oyster beds, the lessee must be held to take the risk of the pollution of the water. It cannot be supposed that for a dollar an acre, the rent mentioned in the Code, or whatever other sum the plaintiff paid, he acquired a property superior to that risk, or that by the mere making of the lease, the State contracted, if it \n\n[249 U.S. 540, 544]\n\u00a0\n could, against using its legislative power to sanction one of the very most important public uses of water already partly polluted, and in the vicinity of half a dozen cities and towns to which that water obviously furnished the natural place of discharge. See Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. Illinois, \n146 U.S. 387\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 110; Trimble v. Seattle, \n231 U.S. 683\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 218. The case is not changed by the guaranty in section 2137a. That is directed to the possession of the land, not to the quality of the water. It is unnecessary to cite the cases that have affirmed so frequently that the construction of public grants must be very strict.\n The Constitution of Virginia, like some others, requires compensation for property taken or damaged for public use. Const. 1902,  58. But this seems to be construed by the dissenting Judge as well as by the Court below as not including damage like this, which would not have been a wrong even without the act of the legislature. It is a question that has been subject to much debate. See for example, Caledonian Railway v. Walker's Trustees, 7 App. Cas. 259, 293, et seq.; Taft v. Commonwealth, 158 Mass. 526, 548, 33 N. E. 1046; Transportation Co. v. Chicago, \n99 U.S. 635\n, 642. But upon that point we follow the Supreme Court of the State.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","69":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDE GANAY v. LEDERER(1919)\nNo. 319\nArgued: Decided: June 9, 1919\n\n\n\n Messrs. James Wilson Bayard and Frank P. Prichard, both of Phildelphia, Pa., for plaintiff.\n\n\n[250 U.S. 376, 377]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General H. La Rue Brown, for defendant.\n\n\n[250 U.S. 376, 378]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Act of October 3, 1913, c. 16,  2a, subd. 1, 38 Stat. 166, provides:\n'That there shall be levied, assessed, collected and paid annually upon the entire net income arising or accruing from all sources in the preceding calendar year to every citizen of the United States, whether residing at home or abroad, and to every person residing in the United States, though not a citizen thereof, a tax of 1 per centum per annum upon such income, except as hereinafter provided; and a like tax shall be assessed, levied, collected, and paid annually upon the entire net income from all property owned and of every business, trade, or profession carried on in the United States by persons residing elsewhere.'\n\n Under this statutory provision a question arose as to the taxability of income from certain securities of Emily R. De Ganay, a citizen and resident of France. The District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania held the income from the securities taxable. 239 Fed. 568. The case is here upon certificate from the Circuit Court of Appeals, from which it appears: That Emily R. De Ganay is a citizen of France, and re \n\n[250 U.S. 376, 379]\n\u00a0\n sides in that country. That her father was an American citizen domiciled in Pennsylvania, and died in 1885, having devised one-fourth of his residuary estate, consisting of real property, to the Pennsylvania Company for Insurance on Lives and Granting Annuities, in trust to pay the net income thereof to her. She also inherited from her father a large amount of personal property in her own right free from any trust. This personal property is invested in stocks and bonds of corporations organized under laws of the United States and in bonds and mortgages secured upon property in Pennsylvania. Since 1885 the Pennsylvania Company has been acting as her agent under power of attorney, and has invested and reinvested her property, and has collected and remitted to her the net income therefrom. The certificates of stocks, bonds and mortgages had been and were in 1913 in the company's possession in its offices in Philadelphia. The company made a return of the income collected for the plaintiff for the year 1913 both from her real estate, which is not in controversy here, and her net income from corporate stocks and bonds and the bonds and mortgages held by her in her own right. The tax was paid under protest and recovery was sought by the proper action.\n The question certified is limited to the net income collected by virtue of the power of attorney from the personal property owned by the plaintiff in her own right.\n The power of attorney, which is attached to the certificate, authorizes the agent:\n'To sell, assign, transfer any stocks, bonds, loans, or other securities now standing or that may hereafter stand in my name on the books of any and all corporations, national, state, municipal or private; to enter satisfaction upon the record of any indenture or mortgage now or hereafter in my name, or to sell and assign the same and to transfer policies of insurance, and the proceeds, \n\n[250 U.S. 376, 380]\n\u00a0\n also any other moneys to invest and reinvest in such securities as they may in their discretion deem safe and judicious to hold for my account; to collect and receipt for all interest and dividends, loans, stocks, or other securities now or hereafter belonging to me; to indorse checks payable to my order and to make or enter into any agreement or agreements they may deem necessary and best for my interest in the management of my business and affairs; also to represent me, and, in my behalf, to vote and act for me at all meetings connected with any company in which I may own stocks or bonds or be intr ested in any way whatever, with power also as attorney or attorneys under it for that purpose to make and substitute, and to do all lawful acts requisite for effecting the premises, hereby ratifying and confirming all that the said attorney or substitute or substitutes shall do therein by virtue of these presents.'\n\n The question certified is:\n'If an alien nonresident own stocks, bonds, and mortgages secured upon property in the United States or payable by persons or corporations there domiciled, and if the income therefrom is collected for and remitted to such nonresident by an agent domiciled in the United States, and if the agent has physical possession of the certificates of stock, the bonds and the mortgages, is such income subject to an income tax under the Act of October 3, 1913?'\n\n The question submitted comes to this: Is the income from the stock, bonds, and mortgages, held by the Pennsylvania Company, derived from property owned in the United States? A learned argument is made to the effect that the stock certificates, bonds, and mortgages are not property, that they are but evidences of the ownership of interests which are property; that the property, in a legal sense, represented by the securities, would exist if the physical evidences thereof were destroyed. But we are of opinion that these refinements are not decisive of \n\n[250 U.S. 376, 381]\n\u00a0\n the congressional intent in using the term 'property' in this statute. Unless the contrary appears, statutory words are presumed to be used in their ordinary and usual sense, and with the meaning commonly attributable to them. To the general understanding and with the common meaning usually attached to such descriptive terms, bonds, mortgages, and certificates of stock are regarded as property. By state and federal statutes they are often treated as property, not as mere evidences of the interest which they represent. In Blackstone v. Miller, \n188 \nU.S. 189, 206\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 277, 279 (47 L. Ed. 439), this court held that a deposit by a citizen of Illinois in a trust company in the city of New York was subject to the transfer tax of the state of New York and said:\n'There is no conflict between our views and the point decided in the case reported under the name of State Tax on Foreign Held Bonds, 15 Wall. 300 [21 L. Ed. 179]. The taxation in that case was on the interest on bonds held out of the state. Bonds and negotiable instruments are more than merely evidences of debt. The debt is inseparable from the paper which declares and constitutes it, by a tradition which comes down from more archaic conditions. Bacon v. Hooker, 177 Mass. 335, 337 [58 N. E. 1078, 83 Am. St. Rep. 279].'\n\n The Court of Appeals of New York, recognizing the same principle, treated such instruments as property in People ex. rel. Jefferson v. Smith, 88 N. Y. 576, 585:\n'It is clear from the statutes referred to and the authorities cited and from the understanding of business men in commercial transactions, as well as of jurists and legislators, that mortgages, bonds, bills and notes have for many purposes come to be regarded as property and not as the mere evidences of debts, and that they may thus have a situs at the place where they are found like other visible, tangible chattels.'\n\n We have no doubt that the securities, herein involved, are property. Are they property within the United States? It is insisted that the maxim 'mobilia sequuntur personam' \n\n[250 U.S. 376, 382]\n\u00a0\n applies in this instance, and that the situs of the property was at the domicile of the owner in France. But this court has frequently declared that the maxim, a fiction at most, must yield to the facts and circumstances of cases which require it, and that notes, bonds and mortgages may acquire a situs at a place other than the domicile of the owner, and be there reached by the taxing authority. It is only necessary to refer to some of the decisions of this court. New Orleans v. Stemple, \n175 U.S. 309\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 110; Bristol v. Washington County, \n177 U.S. 133\n, 20 Sup. C. 585; Blackstone v. Miller, supra; State Board of Assessors v. Comptoir National d'Escompte, \n191 U.S. 388\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 109; Carstairs v. Cochran, \n193 U.S. 10\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 318; Scottish Union & National Ins. Co. v. Bowland, \n196 U.S. 611\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 345; Wheeler v. New York, \n233 \nU.S. 434, 439\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 607; Iowa v. Slimmer, \n248 \nU.S. 115, 120\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 33. Shares of stock in national banks, this court has held, for the purpose of taxation may be separated from the domicile of the owner, and taxed at the place where held. Tappan v. Merchants' National Bank, 19 Wall. 490.\n In the case under consideration the stocks and bonds were those of corporations organized under the laws of the United States, and the bonds and mortgages were secured upon property in Pennsylvania. The certificates of stock, the bonds and mortgages were in the Pennsylvania Company's offices in Philadelphia. Not only is this so, but the stocks, bonds and mortgages were held under a power of attorney which gave authority to the agent to sell, assign, or transfer any of them, and to invest and reinvest the proceeds of such sales as it might deem best in the management of the business and affairs of the principal. It is difficult to conceive how property could be more completely localized in the United States. There can be no question of the power of Congress to tax the income from such securities. Thus situated and held, and with the authority given to the local agent over them, we think the income derived is clearly from property \n\n[250 U.S. 376, 383]\n\u00a0\n within the United States within the meaning of Congress as expressed in the statute under consideration. It follows that the question certified by the Circuit Court of Appeals must be answered in the affirmative.\n So ordered.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in this case. \n\n\n\n","70":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDEBS v. U S(1919)\nNo. 714\nArgued: Decided: March 10, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. Seymour Stedman, of Chicago, Ill., for plaintiff in error. \n\n[249 U.S. 211, 212]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John Lord O'Brian, of Buffalo, N. Y., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an indictment under the Espionage Act of June 15, 1917, c. 30, tit. 1,  3, 40 Stat. 219, as amended by the Act of May 16, 1918, c. 75,  1, 40 Stat. 553 (Comp. St. 1918,  10212c). It has been cut down to two counts, originally the third and fourth. The former of these alleges that on or about June 16, 1918, at Canton, Ohio, the defendant caused and incited and attempted to cause and incite insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny and refusal of duty in the military and naval forces of the United States and with intent so to do delivered, to an assembly of people, a public speech, set forth. The fourth count alleges that he obstructed and attempted to obstruct the recruiting and enlistment service of the United States and to that end and with that intent delivered the same speech, again set forth. There was a demurrer to the indictment on the ground that the statute is unconstitutional as interfering with free speech, contrary to the First Amendment, and to the several counts as insufficiently stating the supposed offence. This was overruled, subject to exception. There were other exceptions to the admission of evidence with which we shall deal. The defendant was found guilty and was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment on each of the two counts, the punishment to run concurrently on both.\n The main theme of the speech was Socialism, its growth, and a prophecy of its ultimate success. With that we have nothing to do, but if a part or the manifest intent of the \n\n[249 U.S. 211, 213]\n\u00a0\n more general utterances was to encourage those present to obstruct the recruiting service and if in passages such encouragement was directly given, the immunity of the general theme may not be enough to protect the speech. The speaker began by saying that he had just returned from a visit to the workhouse in the neighborhood where three of their most loyal comrades were paying the penalty for their devotion to the working class- these being Wagenknecht, Baker and Ruthenberg, who had been convicted of aiding and abetting another in failing to register for the draft. Ruthenberg v. United States, \n245 U.S. 480\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 168. He said that he had to be prudent and might not be able to say all that he thought, thus intimating to his hearers that they might infer that he meant more, but he did say that those persons were paying the penalty for standing erect and for seeking to pave the way to better conditions for all mankind. Later he added further eulogies and said that he was proud of them. He then expressed opposition to Prussian militarism in a way that naturally might have been thought to be intended to include the mode of proceeding in the United States.\n After considerable discourse that it is unnecessary to follow, he took up the case of Kate Richards O'Hare, convicted of obstructing the enlistment service, praised her for her loyalty to Socialism and otherwise, and said that she was convicted on false testimony, under a ruling that would seem incredible to him if he had not had some experience with a Federal Court. We mention this passage simply for its connection with evidence put in at the trial. The defendant spoke of other cases, and then, after dealing with Russia, said that the master class has always declared the war and the subject class has always fought the battles-that the subject class has had nothing to gain and all to lose, including their lives; that the working class, who furnish the corpses, have never yet had a voice in declaring war and never yet had a voice in declaring \n\n[249 U.S. 211, 214]\n\u00a0\n peace. 'You have your lives to lose; you certainly ought to have the right to declare war if you consider a war necessary.' The defendant next mentioned Rose Pastor Stokes, convicted of attempting to cause insubordination and refusal of duty in the military forces of the United States and obstructing the recruiting service. He said that she went out to render her service to the cause in this day of crises, and they sent her to the penitentiary for ten years; that she had said no more than the speaker had said that afternoon; that if she was guilty so was he, and that he would not be cowardly enough to plead his innocence; but that her message that opened the eyes of the people must be suppressed, and so after a mock trial before a packed jury and a corporation tool on the bench, she was sent to the penitentiary for ten years.\n There followed personal experiences and illustrations of the growth of Socialism, a glorification of minorities, and a prophecy of the success of the international Socialist crusade, with the interjection that 'you need to know that you are fit for something better than slavery and cannon fodder.' The rest of the discourse had only the indirect though not necessarily ineffective bearing on the offences alleged that is to be found in the usual contrasts between capitalists and laboring men, sneers at the advice to cultivate war gardens, attribution to plutocrats of the high price of coal, &c., with the implication running through it all that the working men are not concerned in the war, and a final exhortation, 'Don't worry about the charge of treason to your masters; but be concerned about the treason that involves yourselves.' The defendant addressed the jury himself, and while contending that his speech did not warrant the charges said, 'I have been accused of obstructing the war. I admit it. Gentlemen, I abhor war. I would oppose the war if I stood alone.' The statement was not necessary to warrant the jury in finding that one purpose of the speech, whether incidental \n\n[249 U.S. 211, 215]\n\u00a0\n or not does not matter, was to oppose not only war in general but this war, and that the opposition was so expressed that its natural and intended effect would be to obstruct recruiting. If that was intended and if, in all the circumstances, that would be its probable effect, it would not be protected by reason of its being part of a general program and expressions of a general and conscientious belief.\n The chief defences upon which the defendant seemed willing to rely were the denial that we have dealt with and that based upon the First Amendment to the Constitution, disposed of in Schenck v. United States, \n249 U.S. 47\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 247. His counsel questioned the sufficiency of the indictment. It is sufficient in form. Frohwerk v. United States, \n249 U.S. 204\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 249. The most important question that remains is raised by the admission in evidence of the record of the conviction of Ruthenberg, Wagenknecht and Baker, Rose Pastor Stokes, and Kate Richards O'Hare. The defendant purported to understand the grounds on which these persons were imprisoned and it was proper to show what those grounds were in order to show what he was talking about, to explain the true import of his expression of sympathy and to throw light on the intent of the address, so far as the present matter is concerned.\n There was introduced also an 'Anti-War Proclamation and Program' adopted at St. Louis in April, 1917, coupled with testimony that about an hour before his speech the defendant had stated that he approved of that platform in spirit and in substance. The defendant referred to it in his address to the jury, seemingly with satisfaction and willingness that it should be considered in evidence. But his counsel objected and has argued against its admissibility at some length. This document contained the usual suggestion that capitalism was the cause of the war and that our entrance into it 'was instigated by the predatory capitalists in the United States.' It alleged that the war \n\n[249 U.S. 211, 216]\n\u00a0\n of the United States against Germany could not 'be justified even on the plea that it is a war in defence of American rights or American 'honor.\" It said:\n'We brand the declaration of war by our Governments as a crime against the people of the United States and against the nations of the world. In all modern history there has been no war more unjustifiable than the war in which we are about to engage.'\n\n Its first recommendation was, 'continuous, active, and public opposition to the war, through demonstrations, mass petitions, and all other means within our power.' Evidence that the defendant accepted this view and this declaration of his duties at the time that he made his speech is evidence that if in that speech he used words tending to obstruct the recruiting service he meant that they should have that effect. The principle is too well established and too manifestly good sense to need citation of the books. We should add that the jury were most carefully instructed that they could not find the defendant guilty for advocacy of any of his opinions unless the words used had as their natural tendency and reasonably probable effect to obstruct the recruiting service , &c., and unless the defendant had the specific intent to do so in his mind.\n Without going into further particulars we are of opinion that the verdict on the fourth count, for obstructing and attempting to obstruct the recruiting service of the United States, must be sustained. Therefore it is less important to consider whether that upon the third count, for causing and attempting to cause insubordination, &c., in the military and naval forces, is equally impregnable. The jury were instructed that for the purposes of the statute the persons designated by the Act of May 18, 1917, c. 15, 40 Stat. 76 (Comp. St. 1918,  2044a-2044k), registered and enrolled under it, and thus subject to be called into the active service, were a part of the military forces of the United States. The Government presents a strong argument from the history of the statutes that the instruction \n\n[249 U.S. 211, 217]\n\u00a0\n was correct and in accordance with established legislative usage. We see no sufficient reason for differing from the conclusion but think it unnecessary to discuss the question in detail.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","71":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDELAWARE, L & W R. CO. v. U S(1919)\nNo. 158\nArgued: March 26, 1919Decided: April 14, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[249 U.S. 385, 386]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Benjamin Carter and F. Carter Pope, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a petition to recover additional pay for the carriage of the mails upon two routes from July 1, 1907, to July 1, 1909-the claimant alleging and the United States denying that it had contracts at fixed rates for four years from July 1, 1905. The Court of Claims, without stating in terms what the contracts were, set forth the transactions that fixed the relations of the parties, and rejected the claims. Under the statutes in force at the time a maximum price per mile was fixed with reference to the average weights carried by the railroad. This average was ascertained by weighing the mails for thirty days once in four years. The quadrennial weighing for the two routes concerned (from Hoboken to Buffalo and from Hoboken to Denville, New Jersey) took place in the spring of 1905, upon a notice from the Post Office Department that it was in order to obtain the data for adjusting the pay from July 1, 1905, to June 30, 1909. At about the same time the Post Office Department in accordance with its practice sent to the railroad a circular calling for a verified return of the distances on the routes and for an acceptance, as it was called, more properly an offer, in the following form:\n'In case the Post Office Department authorizes the transportation of mails over this line or any part of it, the railroad company agrees to accept and perform the service upon the conditions prescribed by law and the regulations of the Department.'\n\n Before July 1, 1905, these returns were executed, and on \n\n[249 U.S. 385, 387]\n\u00a0\n September 15 the Post Office Department notified the railroad that the compensation for transporting the mails on the Buffalo route 'has been fixed from July 1, 1905, to June 30, 1909,' upon returns, at certain sums. 'This adjustment is subject to future orders and to fines and deductions, and is based on a service of not less than six round trips per week.' The notice for the Denville route, sent September 16, 1905, was similar except that there was inserted after 'has been fixed from July 1, 1905, to June 30, 1909,' the words 'unless otherwise ordered.' There is nothing else bearing on the contracts except that the Post Office Regulations contemplate contracts for and not exceeding four years.\n The rate thus fixed was paid for two years, but on September 12, 1907, in pursuance of an Act of Congress of March 2, 1907, c. 2513, 34 Stat. 1205, 1212, authorizing the Postmaster General to readjust the compensation to be paid after July 1 of that year, and to reduce the rate on certain average weights, he ordered the reduction complained of. The service was continued on an understanding that it was without prejudice to the rights of the railroad in case it should be decided that it was entitled to the old rate for four years from July 1, 1905. The Court of Claims allowed the higher rate up to the time of the notice of the reduction but disallowed the rest, and the Railroad Company appealed.\n It would be very difficult to say that the writings to which we have referred constituted a contract on the part of the railroad to carry the mails for four years and on the part of the Government to accept the service for that time, even subject to the reservations that were expressed on its side. If in view of the circumstances and past practices a finding of such a contract was warranted no such finding has been made and this Court cannot make it. It is not a conclusion of law from the facts. But, however this may be, the notice to the railroad that the \n\n[249 U.S. 385, 388]\n\u00a0\n compensation has been fixed at certain rates, in one case 'unless otherwise ordered' and in both 'subject to future orders' excludes the possibility of holding that a change of rate could not be made so far as the writen words were concerned. So it was decided in Eastern Railroad Co. v. United States, \n129 U.S. 391\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 320, which answers the argument that the future orders referred to did not extend to a change of rates. In that case, to be sure, the railroad made no protest, but the decision was not placed upon that ground alone but also upon the effect of the words 'unless otherwise ordered.' It is said that the Postmaster General had no power to change the rates in 1905 when the papers were signed. But that would not obliterate the reservation and bind the United States to a different contract from that which the documents expressed if they expressed anything more than the rate at which the service was rendered while it was rendered. The United States was free to adopt the reservation in its favor and it did adopt it by the Act of 1907. As the case stands, the railroad was free, as in the Eastern Railroad Case, to decline to carry at the new rates, but could not insist upon the old ones after notice that they had been revised.\n It is argued that the Act of 1907 could not be put into effect without a reweighing. The Act directs the Postmaster General to readjust the compensation to be paid from and after the first day of July, 1907, for the transportation of mail on certain routes 'by making the following changes in the present rates per mile per annum for the transportation of mail on such routes, and hereafter the rates on such routes shall be as follows: On routes carrying their whole length an average weight of mail per day of more than five thousand pounds and less than forty-eight thousand pounds the rate shall be five per centum less than the present rates on all weight carried in excess of five thousand pounds up to forty- eight thousand pounds'; with further reductions arrived at in like manner. The references to \n\n[249 U.S. 385, 389]\n\u00a0\n average weights are not enough to require reweighing. They are an enumeration of the elements identifying and determining the present rates that are to be reduced. We see no reason to suppose that Congress intended to require a special and expensive investigation at the cost of the Government rather than to adopt the existing practice and to order the reduction without reference to the exact time when the last thirty days' weighing occurred or should occur.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","72":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDENVER & R.G.R. CO. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF DENVER(1919)\nNo. 322\nArgued: Decided: June 2, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. E. N. Clark, of Denver, Colo., for plaintiff in error. \n\n[250 U.S. 241, 242]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James A. Marsh and Norton Montgomery, both of Denver, Colo., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to enjoin the enforcement of an ordinance directing the removal of a railroad track from the intersection of two streets in Denver. On the hearing the plaintiff prevailed, but this was reversed by the Supreme Court of the state with a direction to dismiss the complaint ( City and County of Denver v. Denver & Rio Grande R. Co. [Colo.] 167 Pac. 969, L. R. A. 1918D, 659), and the direction was followed. The case is here on two writs of error when one would suffice.\n The ordinance is assailed as contravening the contract and commerce clauses of the Constitution and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n In 1881 a union depot with appurtenant tracks was established in Denver, the streets and alleys within the grounds thus occupied being vacated by the city, and since then all railroads entering the city have used this depot and its tracks. Wynkoop street is outside the depot grounds and extends east and west along their south line. The depot faces that street and is but a short distance from it. On the other side of the depot are the depot tracks. These connect on the west with several railroad yards, including that of the Rio Grande Company, and on the east with other railroad yards, including that of the Union Pacific Company. Wynkoop street is intersected just opposite the entrance to the depot by Seventeenth street, which extends northward through the city and is one of its main thoroughfares. Persons and vehicles approaching or leaving the depot pass over this intersection; the number doing so each day being approximately 2,000. \n\n[250 U.S. 241, 243]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiff, the Rio Grande Company, has a track in Wynkoop street from Nineteenth street to Fourteenth street. At its eastern terminus-near Nineteenth street-this track meets a track of the Union Pacific Company which is connected with the yard of that company, and at Fourteenth street it curves and leads to the Rio Grande Company's yard. Originally it was part of the Rio Grande Company's main line, but since 1881, when the Union Depot was established, it has been used only as a side track in serving industries on the south side of Wynkoop street.\n The ordinance assailed directs the removal of so much of this track as lies within the intersection of Wynkoop and Seventeenth streets, that is to say, the protion over which persons and vehicles pass in moving to and from the Union Depot; and a preamble recites that the use of that portion of the track impedes public travel, affects the safety of persons approaching or leaving the Union Depot, and is no longer essential to the Rio Grande Company.\n The Union Pacific Company has a track in the same intersection which the ordinance deals with in the same way, but that company apparently is not complaining.\n If the ordinance is enforced, the Rio Grande Company can reach the industries on its track in Wynkoop street, between Seventeenth and Nineteenth streets, only through the tracks of the Union Depot and the Union Pacific. Because of this it will be subjected to some expense and delay not heretofore attending that service, and it also will be prevented from switching cars to and from those industries for other railroads and thereby will lose some revenue. But, according to the record, the loss in expense and otherwise incident to these disadvantages will be relatively small.\n The track in Wynkoop street has been there since 1871, and we shall assume, as did the Supreme Court of the state, that it was put there in virtue of some ordinance of \n\n[250 U.S. 241, 244]\n\u00a0\n that period, and that the ordinance became a contract and the right granted became a vested property right. But, as this court often has held, such contracts and rights are held subject to the fair exercise by the state, or the municipality as its agent, of the power to adopt and enforce such regulations as are reasonably necessary to secure the public safety; for this power 'is inalienable even by express grant,' and its legitimate exertion contravenes neither the contract clause of the Constitution nor the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. Goldsboro, \n232 \nU.S. 548, 558\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 364; Chicago & Alton R. R. Co. v. Tranbarger, \n238 \nU.S. 67, 76\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 678. Of course, all regulations of this class are subject to judicial scrutiny, and where they are found to be plainly unreasonable and arbitrary must be pronounced invalid, as transcending that power and falling within the condemnation of one or both, as the case may be, of those constitutional restrictions.\n The scope of the power and instances of its application are shown in the decisions sustaining regulations (a) requiring railroad companies at their own expense to abrogate grade crossings by elevating or depressing their tracks and putting in bridges or viaducts at public crossings, Northern Pacific R. R. Co. v. Duluth, \n208 U.S. 583\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 341; Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Minneapolis, \n232 U.S. 430\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 400; Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Omaha, \n235 U.S. 121\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 82; (b) requiring a railroad company at its own cost to change the location of a track and also to elevate it as a means of making travel on a highway safe, New York, etc., R. R. Co. v. Bristol, \n151 U.S. 556\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 437; (c) prohibiting a railroad company from laying more than a single track in a narrow busy street although its franchise authorized it to lay a double track there, Baltimore v. Baltimore Trust Co., \n166 U.S. 673\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 696; and (d) requiring a gas company whose mains and pipes were laid beneath the surface of a street under an existing franchise to shift them to another \n\n[250 U.S. 241, 245]\n\u00a0\n location at its own cost to make room for a public drainage system, New Orleans Gas Co. v. Drainage Commission, \n197 U.S. 453\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 471.\n Is the ordinance here in question plainly unreasonable and arbitrary? That there is occasion for some real regulation is clear. The crossing is practically in the gateway to the city. Persons in large numbers pass over it every day-many of them unacquainted with the surroundings. Moving engines and cars to and fro over such a place makes it one of danger. Any one of several forms of corrective regulation might be applied. To illustrate: The city might call on the railroad company to construct and maintain a viaduct over the crossing or a tunnel under it, or might lay on the company the duty of maintaining watchmen or flagmen at the crossing. What it actually does by the ordinance is to call on the company to remove the track from the crossing and avail itself of other accessible and fairly convenient means of getting cars to and from its track east of the crossing. No doubt in this the company will experience some disadvantages, but they will be far less burdensome than would be the construction and maintenance of a viaduct or tunnel, and not much more so than would be the keeping of watchmen or flagmen at the crossing.\n The situation is unusual and the ordinance deals with it in a rather practical way. Giving effect to all that appears, we are unable to say that what is required is plainly unreasonable and arbitrary.\n Counsel for the company manifest some concern lest the rates for switching cars to and from its track east of the crossing may not be satisfactory, but there hardly can be any real trouble along that line. The rates will be subject to investigation and supervision by public commissions just as are other railroad rates, and possible differences over them will be susceptible of ready adjustment. \n\n[250 U.S. 241, 246]\n\u00a0\n The objection that the ordinance offends against the commerce clause of the Constitution is not tenable. The ordinance makes no discrimination against interstate commerce, will not impede its movement in regular course, and will affect it only incidentally and indirectly. South Covington Ry. Co. v.

CITY OF DETROIT(1919)\nNo. 666\nArgued: Decided: January 13, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[248 U.S. 429, 430]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Elliott G. Stevenson, of Detroit, Mich., for appellant.\n Messrs. Allan H. Frazer and Richard I. Lawson, both of Detroit, Mich., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Detroit United Railway Company brought this action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan to enjoin the city of Detroit from enforcing the provisions of an ordinance regulating street railway fares in that city. The ordinance was passed August 9, 1918. It is printed in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[248 U.S. 429, 431]\n\u00a0\n The bill attacks the ordinance upon two constitutional grounds: First, that it impairs the obligation of the company's existing contracts; second, that it is confiscatory and hence deprives the company of its property without due process of law. The suit came on for hearing before the district judge upon an application for a temporary injunction, the judge denied the application and upon his own motion dismissed the bill.\n The question upon this appeal is: Did the bill, taking its allegations to be true, state grounds for relief to which the company was entitled upon the facts set forth? The action of the District Court was equivalent to sustaining a demurrer to the bill.\n___ Sec. 6. Any such person, partnership or corporation which shall violate the provisions of this ordinance, or shall attempt to do so, and any officer, agent, servant or employe who shall order or direct any such violation or attempted violation of the provisions of this ordinance, shall be guilty of an offense, and upon conviction shall be fined not to exceed five hundred dollars, or imprisoned in the Detroit House of Correction for not to exceed ninety days, or shall be both fined and imprisoned in the discretion of the court, for each violation.\n Sec. 7. This ordinance is passed for the public welfare in the case of an emergency involving the peace, health and safety of the people of the city, and it is ordered to take immediate effect. It may be amended or repealed at any time by the common council of the city of Detroit. Unless so amended or repealed it shall remain in force for one year from August 9, 1918. \n\n[248 U.S. 429, 432]\n\u00a0\n The bill alleges that the complainant company is the owner of all the street railways in the city of Detroit, constituting a system of tracks of upwards of 270 miles. The sources of title of the company are set forth in the bill, and shown by many exhibits. It is sufficient for the present purpose to say: That the system consists of a considerable mileage of tracks upon which the franchises have expired; upon other portions of the system there are unexpired franchises, some of them derived from villages in which the roads were constructed, which villages were subsequently incorporated into the city. That from December 1, 1917, its system was operated, except the so-called three-cent lines, upon terms as follows: Five-cent cash fares for each passenger carried on or over its lines, including so-called universal transfers, with workingmen's tickets, eight for twenty-five workingmen's tickets, eight for and on the so-called three- cent lines a cash fare of five cents, with eight tickets for twenty-five cents between certain hours; good only on such three-cent lines with the privilege of a transfer on payment of a five-cent cash fare, and also with the privilege of purchase of six tickets for twenty-five cents, also good between certain hours. It is averred that afterwards it became necessary to increase rates of fare. The bill recites the demand of the employes of the company for increased wages, which was refused; that a submission of the controversy was made to the War Labor Board; that the board after a hearing awarded a substantial increase of wages, and recommended an increase in passenger fares to enable the company to meet this cost. The bill alleges that the increase made by the War Labor Board amounted to about $2,000,000 per annum. The company petitioned the city for an increase of rates of fare, and this petition was denied.\n On August 7, 1918, the company put in force a schedule of its own, making single fares six cents, with ten tickets for fifty-five cents, cash fare or tickets good on connecting or inter \n\n[248 U.S. 429, 433]\n\u00a0\n secting lines within the city. It is contended that this action of the company was without legal authority. Whether this was authorized or not, is not an issue involved in this case, and we express no opinion concerning it. The matters involved in this bill concern the validity of the ordinance passed August 9, 1918\n\n\n It is further alleged that Detroit is a city of a population exceeding 750,000; that it is an industrial city with much the larger part of its male population employed in industrial plants within and adjacent to the city; that the operation of the company's railway system was the only means of transportation of such employes from their homes to their places of employment; and that the interruption of the operation of the company's system, or the separation in operation of the franchise from the non-franchise lines, would paralyze the industrial and business life of the city, throw thousands of its residents out of employment, and result in shutting down its industrial plants and factories. Allegations follow, setting forth the value of the company's property, and stating that the effect of the ordinance, if enforced, will be to require the operation of the company's system at a deficit, and, consequently, with no return on the investment.\n The learned District Judge answered the contention of the company by holding, in substance, that as to the non-franchise lines the remedy of the company was to abandon the service and take its property from the city streets, and that as to the franchise lines the exception of the fifth section of the ordinance saved the company's contract rights from impairment. There can be no question that it was within the city's power to compel the company as to its non-franchise lines to remove its tracks from the streets of the city. This was settled in Detroit United Railway Co. v. Detroit, \n229 U.S. 39\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 697. The city did not do so. Instead of taking such action it passed the ordinance in controversy, providing for the continued operation of \n\n[248 U.S. 429, 434]\n\u00a0\n the company's system. This ordinance has application to the entire street railway system. In section 1 it provides that no more than five cents shall be charged for a single ride, or six tickets for twenty-five cents, for one continuous trip through the city over any line operated without a franchise. Section 2 purports to preserve the right to charge franchise rates when fixed by contract. Section 3 provides for fares, eight tickets for twenty-five cents, except when such fares are contrary to contract rights. Section 4 provides that where a trip is over two or more lines, whether franchise or not, the maximum fare shall be five cents, or six tickets for twenty-five cents, and no transfers shall be exacted which raise these rates of fare. Section 5 defines a continuous trip to mean a journey from one point in the city to another, whether on one car line or by means of transfers, and the company is required to furnish transfers to carry the provisions of the ordinance into effect. It is further provided that the ordinance is not to be construed as an attempt to impair the obligation of any valid contract, but shall apply to all street railway passenger traffic in the city except when the same is governmed by the provisions of a contract. Section 6 provides for fines or imprisonment for violations of the provisions of the ordinance. Section 7 provides that the ordinance shall be in effect for the term of one year from August 9, 1918, unless sooner amended or repealed.\n The allegations of the bill, which for the present purposes must be taken as true, are ample to the effect that the enforcement of this ordinance will result in a deficit to the company. We cannot construe the exception of section 5, having reference to existing franchise contracts, in such way as to modify the requirements of section 4 which in explicit terms fixes the fares for trips over two or more lines whether franchise lines or not, and limits the maximum fare without charge for transfers. This must be read in view of the definition of a continuous \n\n[248 U.S. 429, 435]\n\u00a0\n trip in section 5 as meaning a journey from one point to another point in the city whether the same is made on one car line or by means of transfers from car to car or from line to line. The exception in section 5 can have no further effect consistently with the other provisions of the ordinance, particularly those of section 4, than to regulate fares where trips are wholly upon franchise lines. A principal ground upon which the bill was dismissed by the District Court was the view of the learned judge that the power to compel the company to remove its tracks from the streets involving the non-franchise roads included the right to fix terms of continued operation upon such lines, whether remunerative or not. We cannot agree with this view. In our opinion the case in this respect is ruled in principle by Denver v. Denver Union Water Co., \n246 U.S. 178\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 278. In that case the franchise of a water company had expired, and the city might have refused the further use of the streets to the company. Instead of doing this it passed an ordinance fixing rates and requiring certain duties of the company. We held that in that situation the company was entitled to make a reasonable return upon its investment. So here, the city might have required the company to cease its service and remove its tracks from the non-franchise lines within the city. Instead of taking this course the city enacted an ordinance for the continued operation of the company's system, with fares and transfers for continuous trips over lines composing the system whether the same had a franchise or not. This action contemplated the further operation of the system, and fixed penalties for violations of the ordinance. By its terms the ordinance is to continue in force for the period of one year, unless sooner amended or repealed. This was a clear recognition that until the city repealed the ordinance the public service should continue, with the use of the streets essential to carry on further service. Within the principles of the \n\n[248 U.S. 429, 436]\n\u00a0\n Denver Case this service could not be required without giving to the company, thus affording it, a reasonable return upon its investment. In the Denver Case we said:\n'The very act of regulating the company's rates was a recognition that its plant must continue, as before, to serve the public needs. The fact that no term was specified is, under the existing circumstances, as significant of an intent that the service should continue while the need existed as of an intent that it should not be perpetual.'\n\n In the present case the service upon the terms fixed in the ordinance is continued for a year, the city reserying the right to repeal the ordinance at any time.\n It is clear that the city might have taken a different course by requiring the company to remove its tracks from the non-franchise lines; it elected to require continued maintenance of the public service; doubtless because it was believed that it was necessary in the existing conditions in the city to continue for a time at least the right of the railway company to operate its lines. This amounted to a grant to the company for further operation of the system, during the life of the ordinance. For this public service it was entitled to a fair return upon its investment. Elements to be taken into consideration in valuing the property of the company in estimating a fair return are not involved in this case. If the allegations of the bill are true, and for present purposes they must be so regarded, the continued operation of the railroad system of the company upon the fares fixed in the ordinance will result in a deficit, and deny to the company due process of law within the meaning of the federal Constitution.\n As rates of fare are fixed on some of the existing franchise lines at five cents without transfers, it would follow as to continuous trips over such franchise and non-franchise lines, such trips comprehending much of the trans \n\n[248 U.S. 429, 437]\n\u00a0\n portation required, the latter lines would be without compensation for the service rendered. Furthermore, when a continuous trip begins on a non- franchise line and is over a franchise line and a non-franchise line, the former having the right to charge five cents for a trip over it, the effect would be to impair the obligation of the franchise contract. Detroit United Railway v. Michigan, \n242 U.S. 252\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 87.\n In our view the allegations of this bill for the purposes of the demurrer sufficiently alleged violations of the Constitution of the United States in the action of the city in passing and enforcing the ordinance in controversy. The District Court should have entertained the bill, heard the application for a temporary injunction, and proceeded to a hearing and determination of the case in due course.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE dissenting.\n The relation between the city and the railway company, when the ordinance which the court holds unconstitutional was passed, was this:\n The company owned three classes of tracks, viz.:\n\n\n (a)\n Those in the business and residence streets most productive of traffic, constituting the greater part of the lines of the company. Its authority to maintain these tracks expired in 1909-1910, and they are disignated in the record as 'non-franchise lines.' It will be convenient to refer to the streets in which these lines are located as 'non-franchise streets.'\n\n\n (b)\n Tracks designated as 'three-cent franchise lines' (Exhibit T), also largely in business and important residence streets. The company had franchises for these lines under which it was obliged to sell eight tickets for twenty-five cents good from 5:45 a. m. to 8 o'clock p. m. and six tickets for twenty-five cents good during the \n\n[248 U.S. 429, 438]\n\u00a0\n remainder of the twenty-four hours. Such tickets entitled the holders to transfer privileges only on all three-cent lines.\n\n\n (c)\n Disconnected sections of track, of small mileage, in streets remote from the business parts of the city. For these lines the company had unexpired franchises granted by villages and townships before the extension of the city limits included them, which allowed a fare of five cents, in some places, in others five cents with transportation to the City Hall. The mileage of these grants varied from five miles to 'six blocks' in length; they are described in the bill as lying, some to the north, others to the south, others to the east and others to the west of the city, as it was when the grants were made and, thus widely separated, they had no connection one with the other, except over non-franchise of three-cent franchise tracks. These are designated as 'five-cent franchise lines.'\n It was stated at the bar by counsel for the city, and not questioned, that there were about 150 miles of non-franchise lines, about 65 miles of the three-cent franchise lines, and only 55 miles of five-cent franchise lines.\n In their brief counsel for the company say that the larger part of the company's lines had been operated for several years prior to December, 1917, on what was known as the 'day-to-day agreement' (and see Detroit United Railway v. Detroit, \n229 U.S. 39\n, 42 33 Sup. Ct. 697), under which a rental was paid to the city for the use of the streets and the company was allowed to charge a cash fare of five cents or seven tickets for twenty-five cents, except during an hour and a half in the morning and one hour in the evening, when tickets sold eight for twenty-five cents were accepted. For these fares transfers were given over the entire lines of the company. Either party could withdraw from this arrangement at any time, and in December, \n\n[248 U.S. 429, 439]\n\u00a0\n 1917, the company did withdraw from it and thereafter was allowed to charge, on other than its three-cent franchise lines, a cash fare of five cents, but with eight tickets for twenty-five cents, good for one and a half hours in the morning and for one hour in the evening. Universal transfers were allowed for these fares.\n This arrangement continued until August 2, 1918, when, not satisfied, the company proposed to the city a five-cent fare with a charge of one cent for a transfer over all lines in the city one-fare zone, or, in the alternative, a six-cent fare with ten tickets for fifty-five cents and universal transfers, the franchise rates on the three-cent lines to continue, except that for the fares last named universal transfers would be given.\n This proposal the city rejected, and thereupon the company, without any authority from the city, put into operation the second proposal above stated, allowing transfers over any connecting or intersecting line within the city limits. In response to this action of the railway company the city passed the ordinance which, for two reasons, the court has held invalid, viz.:\n\n\n (1)\n Over certain of the franchise lines a five-cent rate of fare without transfers was provided for in the grants, and because section 4 of the ordinance required transportation 'where the trip is over two or more lines, whether franchise lines or not,' without transfer charge, it is held that, if this provision were enforced, the effect would be to impair such five-cent franchise contracts and that the ordinance is therefore void.\n\n\n (2)\n Interpreting the ordinance as a grant to the company of the right to operate its lines, franchise and non-franchise, at rates which the bill alleges to be non-compensatory, the court holds it invalid because it would deprive the company of its property without due process of law.\n The case must be considered on the allegations of the \n\n[248 U.S. 429, 440]\n\u00a0\n bill as if on demurrer and my reasons for dissenting from both of these conclusions of the court are as follows:\n As to the first. It is not anywhere alleged in the bill that the 'five-cent franchise lines' (no complaint is made as to the three-cent lines) can be operated separately and profitably or that less income would be realized from them if operated under the terms of section 4 in conjunction with the non-franchise lines than if they were operated as separate properties, if such thing be possible, charging the five-cent franchise rate without transfers. Without such an allegation it is pure conjecture to say that the company would suffer loss and that its contract would be impaired by giving effect to section 4. He who would strike down a law must show that the alleged unconstitutional feature injures him and operates to deprive him of rights protected by the federal Constitution. Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 531, 534\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 359.\n But the bill not only fails to allege that the railway company would suffer loss from giving effect to section 4, but it states facts which render it highly probable, if not entirely clear, that it would benefit by it.\n All five-cent franchise lines appear from the bill to be as we have said, outlying, of limited mileage, and so wholly disconnected one from the other that it would not be practicable to operate them profitably, if at all, except in connection with non-franchise lines. The record shows that in the past they have been so operated, with mutual transfers, and both of the proposals of the company made to the city on August 2, 1918, contemplated such operation. In the absence of allegation to the contrary, the reasonable inference from this description of the five-cent franchise lines and this practice with respect to them is, that it is not practicable to operate them profitably as separate properties and that whatever value there is in them must be realized by operating them jointly with the non-franchise lines, with mutual transfers, and that the \n\n[248 U.S. 429, 441]\n\u00a0\n company would be benefited, and not injured, by being permitted to so operate them under section 4.\n But, should this section 4 be construed to prescribe a rate for transfer over franchise lines?\n The first section, as printed in the margin of the court's opinion prescribes a charge 'for one continuous trip within the city over any line which is now operated or shall hereafter be operated, without a franchise fixing the rates of fare.'\n Clearly this is intended not to apply to the franchise lines.\n The second section declares that the charge over franchise lines shall not be greater than is fixed in the franchise.\n This plainly contemplates allowing the full franchise rate where one exists.\n Section 3 provides for the special or 'workingmen's' tickets, but carefully excepts from its application 'all lines ... where such sale would be contrary to the terms of the franchise contract.'\n Section 5 in terms declares:\n'The provisions of this ordinance shall not be construed as an attempt to impair the obligation of any valid contract, but shall apply to and govern all such street railway passenger traffic in the city, except where the same is governmed by the provisions of such contract.'\n\n Thus we have in the ordinance a declaration that the rate prescribed shall apply only to non-franchise lines, that the franchise rate shall apply on all franchise lines, that special ticket rates shall not apply where they conflict with franchise rates, and in addition there is the general declaration that the city council is intending to deal with non- franchise lines only, and that the ordinance shall not be so construed as to impair franchise contracts.\n To this we must add that, it is clear that, excluding the five-cent franchise lines, this section 4 would still have \n\n[248 U.S. 429, 442]\n\u00a0\n a large and indisputably valid application to both non-franchise and franchise lines. The ordinance was designed to apply to 150 miles of non- franchise lines, extending in all directions throught the city, and to regulate transfers between various parts of these lines. In addition to this, the three-cent franchise lines are greater in extent and much more important than the five-cent franchise lines. From December, 1917, to August 2, 1918, transfers were allowed over all of the non-franchise lines and between the five-cent and three-cent franchise lines and the non- franchise lines upon payment of the fare prescribed in section 4-five-cent fare, or six tickets for twenty-five cents-and it was plainly the primary purpose of the section to continue this rate and practice and not to permit the charge to be increased to six cents, as contemplated in the proposal of the company to the city of August 2, 1918. No complaint is made of the application of the section to the three-cent franchise lines.\n All of this is overlooked by the court, and, laying hold of the possible loss to the company (wholly improbable as we have seen) through the application of the section to the five-cent lines, the entire ordinance is struck down as unconstitutional.\n This judicial power of declaring laws unconstitutional is of so high and delicate a character that it has been often declared by this court that it would exercise it only in clear cases. Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch, 87, 128; Fairbank v. United States, \n181 U.S. 283\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 648. Every possible presumption is in favor of a statute, and this continues until the contrary is shown beyond a rational doubt. Sinking Fund Cases, \n99 U.S. 700\n, 718. The violation of the Constitution must be 'proved beyond all reasonable doubt.' Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 270; Nicol v. Ames, \n173 \nU.S. 509, 515\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 522.\n But if it be assumed that the application of section 4 would result in loss to the company and would impair \n\n[248 U.S. 429, 443]\n\u00a0\n its five-cent franchise contracts, even then it would seem that the section should be annulled only in so far as it might be applied to such grants and that the remainder, which is not assailed, should be permitted to stand, under the rule of this court applied from Bank of Hamilton v. Dudley, 2 Pet. 492, 526, to St. Louis & Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, \n235 U.S. 350\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 99, that if only part of an act be unconstitutional the provisions of that part may be disregarded and full effect given to the remainder, if severable from the unconstitutional part of the act, as it clearly is in this case.\n Coming now to the second and more fundamental ground, on which the court proceeds to its conclusion. It is held that the ordinance contemplates the continued operation of the non-franchise lines, and therefore, applying the novel doctrine of the Denver Union Water Company Case, \n246 U.S. 178\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 278, that it is a grant which, if given effect, would necessarily deprive the company of its property without due process of law, since the allegations of the bill are that it would be non-compensatory.\n We are now dealing, not with an alleged attempt on the part of the city to require the company to operate its five-cent and its three-cent franchise lines at a loss, but with an offer to it of a right to operate the lines in the non-franchise streets, in which it has no rights, in conjunction with its other lines at what is alleged to be a non- compensatory rate for the entire system. The right of the company to operate the five-cent and three-cent lines was complete without the ordinance and the operation of them, as separate properties, was quite unaffected by it.\n In defining the relation between the city and the company as it was before the ordinance, which is declared invalid, was passed, the court holds, as it must (\n229 U.S. 39\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 697), that the company had no rights in the non-franchise streets, and that the city had the right to order its tracks taken out of them. \n\n[248 U.S. 429, 444]\n\u00a0\n This being the legal relation between the two parties, the company, on August 2, 1918, made its proposal for increased fares, which was rejected by the city. This proposal, when followed by rejection, obviously did not change the relation of the parties from what they were before it was made.\n Thereupon the city made its counterproposal by tendering the ordinance rates to the company, which promptly rejected them. It seems equally clear that this proposal and the rejection of it did not change the relations of the parties and that they continued precisely as they were before and as they were defined in the opinion of the court-the railway company without any rights whatever in the non-franchise streets. But not so says the court, for the reason that the ordinance implies that the lines are to be operated and, under the Denver Case, it must therefore be interpreted as a grant (contary it would seem to Blair v. Chicago, \n201 \nU.S. 400, 463\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 427), and, since it is alleged that the rates prescribed are non-compensatory, it is an invalid grant.\n If it be conceded that the ordinance is in terms a grant, yet since every grant implies and requires a grantee, when the company refused to accept it the grant necessarily failed. It is obvious and elementary that no person or corporation can be made a grantee against his or its will. Kent, Commentaries (13th Ed.) vol. 4, p. 455, note(b). Thus, again, even on the assumption of the court, it would seem that the ordinance failed to change the relations of the parties from what they were before.\n The conclusion of the District Court that this case can be distinguished from the Denver Water Company Case, and therefore is not to be ruled by it, seems sound, but the distinction need not be discussed.\n The application of the principle of that case to this one must result in depriving the city of the power to treat with the company for terms for the operation of the tracks \n\n[248 U.S. 429, 445]\n\u00a0\n which it owns in the streets in which its franchises have expired and in which this court has decided it has no rights whatever, except upon terms as favorable to the company as it would be entitled to if it had a valid and continuing grant to operate in them. The utmost that can be claimed for the ordinance is that it suffers the company to use streets which it could not use at all without it-for the company to use them in any other way than as thus permitted would be unlawful. Yet this mere offer of this naked privilege, in terms revocable at will, and rejected by the company, is held to give a constitutional right and at the same time to so violate that right as to render the ordinance invalid. I cannot bring myself to understand how, except by sheer assertion of power, even the apparent justice of the result which it is hoped thus to obtain can be made the basis for creating a constitutional right where no right whatever existed before the passing of this rejected ordinance.\n If the management of the company was misinformed as to the effect of the expiring of its franchises, as seems probable (\n229 U.S. 39\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 697), or if it underestimated the difficulties in the way of securing an extension of them, the result, as declared by this court in the case just cited, was to deprive the company of all legal rights in the non-franchise streets, and while its misfortune may be regretted the apparent hardship of the situation is no valid ground for raising a constitutional right in favor of one of the parties, which will result in depriving the other party of an advantage which has lawfully come to it. Substantial justice is more likely to result from trusting to the sense of fairness of a community in dealing with such cases than from imposing upon a city a contract which a court shall make for them. The language used by Mr. Justice Holmes, when dissenting in the Denver Case, \n246 U.S. 196\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 284, is sharply applicable to this case, mutatis mutandis:\n'We must assume that the Water Company \n\n[248 U.S. 429, 446]\n\u00a0\n may be required, within a reasonable time, to remove its pipes from the streets. Detroit United Railway v. Detroit, \n229 U.S. 39\n, 46 [33 Sup. Ct. 697]. ... In view of that right of the city, which, if exercised, would make the company's whole plant valueless as such, the question recurs whether the fixing of any rate by the city could be said to confiscate property on the ground that the return was too low. ... The ordinance of the city could mean no more than that the company must accept the city's rates or stop-and as it could be stopped by the city out and out, the general principle is that it could be stopped unless a certain price should be paid.'\n\n For the reasons thus stated, I think that the ordinance is valid, and that the judgment of the District Court should be affirmed, and therefore I am compelled to dissent from the opinion and judgment of the court.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] An ordinance to fix and establish maximum rates of fares and charges which may be exacted and received by persons, corporations or portnerships operating street railways for the carriage of passengers within the city of Detroit, and to fix a penalty for the violation thereof.\n It is hereby ordained by the people of the city of Detroit:\n Section 1.

STATE OF ARIZONA(1919)\nNo. 178\nArgued: Decided: March 24, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. Harvey M. Friend, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.[ Dominion Hotel v. State of Arizona \n249 U.S. 265\n (1919) ]\n\n\n[249 U.S. 265, 267]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wiley E. Jones, Atty.

The statute provides as follows:\n'Provided further, that the said eight hour period of work shall be performed within a period of twelve hours, the period of twelve hours during which such labor must be performed not to be applicable to railroad restaurants or eating houses located upon railroad rights of way and operated by or under contract \n\n[249 U.S. 265, 268]\n\u00a0\n with any railroad company.' Penal Code of Arizona,  717.\n\n The defendant by demurrer and otherwise set up that the exceptions in the statute made it void under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States as depriving the defendant of the equal protection of the laws. There was a trial and judgment against the defendant which was sustained by the Supreme Court of the State, Arizona.\n The Fourteenth Amendment is not a pedagogical requirement of the impracticable. The equal protection of the laws does not mean that all occupations that are called by the same name must be treated in the same way. The power of the State 'may be determined by degrees of evil or exercised in cases where detriment is specially experienced.' Armour & Co. v. North Dakota, \n240 \nU.S. 510, 517\n, 36 S. Sup.

It may do what it can to prevent what is deemed an evil and stop short of those cases in which the harm to the few concerned is thought less important than the harm to the public that would ensue if the rule laid down were made mathematically exact. The only question is whether we can say on our judicial knowledge that the Legislature of Arizona could not have had any reasonable ground for believing that there were such public considerations for the distinction made by the present law. The deference due to the judgment of the Legislature on the matter has been emphasized again and again. Hebe Co. v. Shaw, \n248 \nU.S. 297, 303\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 125.

The work must be adjusted to the hours of the trains. This fact makes a practical and, it may be, an important \n\n[249 U.S. 265, 269]\n\u00a0\n distinction between such restaurants and others. If in its theory the distinction is justifiable, as for all that we know it is, the fact that some cases, including the plaintiff's, are very near to the line makes it none the worse. That is the inevitable result of drawing a line where the distrinctions are distinctions of degree; and the constant business of the law is to draw such lines.\n'Upholding the Act as embodying a principle generally fair and doing as nearly equal justice as can be expected seems to import that if a particular case of hardship arises under it in its natural and ordinary application, that hardship must be borne as one of the imperfections of human things.'

HAMILTON(1919)\nNo. 112\nArgued: December 19, 1918Decided: January 7, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. William C. Cannon, of New York City for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Herbert C. Smyth and Frederic C. Scofield, both of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Erie Railroad Company was sued in the state of New York by the defendant in error to recover damages \n\n[248 U.S. 369, 370]\n\u00a0\n for the claimed negligent causing of the death of Stephen Mistschook, who was a subject of the Emperor of Russia ans who left surviving him a wife and three children resident in Russia.\n After denying negligence and liability, the company averred that it had settled the claim with the Russian consul resident at New York, who, acting under authority or the treaties between the United States and the Emperor of Russia, and in behalf of the widow and next of kin of the deceased, had executed in due form of law and, for the consideration of $ 400, had delivered a release of all claims and demands arising from the death complained of.\n The claim at the trial was not, and it is not now, that the Russian treaty of 1832 (8 Stat. 444, 448, art. 8) in terms gave the consul the power to make the settlement relied upon, but that under the treaty of the United States with Spain, invoked through the 'favored nation' paragraph of the Russian treaty, he had power to make it.\n The trial court held that the Russian consul had no authority to make the settlement pleaded or to give a valid release and the judgment recovered by the plaintiff (the defendant in error), affirmed by the proper Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (Hamilton v. Erie R. Co., 170 App. Div. 901, 154 N. Y. Supp. 1125) and by the Court of Appeals (219 N. Y. 343, 114 N. E. 399, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 928) is argued as if properly before us for review on writ of error.\n Since the judgment which the plaintiff in error seeks to review was entered on December 12, 1916, the record presents the question whether writ of error or writ of certiorari was the appropriate remedy for bringing the case into this court under section 237 of the Judicial Code ( Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1087), as amended by act of Congress, approved September 6, 1916, c. 448,  2, 39 Stat. 726 (Comp. St. 1916,  1214).\n From the statement of the case which we have made it is clear that the railroad company has relied throughout the litigation upon the validity of the treaty of the United States with Russia and that it has claimed rights under a \n\n[248 U.S. 369, 371]\n\u00a0\n construction of that treaty which were denied by the defendant in error and by the New York courts. What the proper construction of the treaty is, is the only question argued in this court.\n The only provisions of the act of September 6, 1916, applicable to the review of such a case as we have here are these:\n'A final judgment ... in the highest court of a state in which a decision in the suit could be had, where is drawn in question the validity of a treaty ... of ... the United States, and the decision is against their (its) validity ... may be re-examined and reversed or affirmed in the Supreme Court upon a writ of error. ...\n\n'If shall be competent for the Supreme Court, by certiorari or otherwise, to require that there [shall] be certified to it for review and determination ... any cause wherein a final judgment or decree has been rendered or passed by the highest court of a state in which a decision could be had ... when any title, right, privilege, or immunity is claimed under ... any treaty ... and the decision is either in favor of or against the title, right, privilege, or immunity especially set up or claimed, by either party, under such ... treaty. ...'\n\n Since, as we have seen, the plaintiff in error has not assailed the validity of the Russian treaty but on the contrary has claimed under an asserted construction of it, which was denied, it is clear that the case cannot come into this court by writ of error, under the statute quoted. At most the railroad company asserted a right under the treaty which was denied to it by the state courts and this under the plain reading of the statute could give it a right to review here only by writ of certiorari.\n The distinction between assailing the validity of a treaty or of a statute and relying upon a specia construction \n\n[248 U.S. 369, 372]\n\u00a0\n of either is patent and has been the subject of such full discussion by this court that it should not now be considered either doubtful or obscure.

C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondents delivered to the Toledo, St. Louis & Western Railroad, at East St. Louis, Ill., a carload of horses for transportation, under a limited liability live stock contract or bill of lading via petitioner's road, to themselves at Suffern, N. Y., their home. Among other things the contract provided:\n'That the said shipper is at his own sole risk and expense to load and take care of and to feed and water said stock whilst being transported, whether delayed in transit or otherwise, and to unload the same; and neither said carrier nor any connecting carrier is to be under any liability or duty with reference thereto, except in h e actual transportation of the same. ... That no claim for damages which may accrue to the said shipper under this contract shall be allowed or paid by the said carrier, or sued for in any court by the said shipper, unless a claim for such loss or damage shall be made in writing, verified by the affidavit of the said shipper or his agent, and delivered to the general auditor of the said carrier at his office in the city of Chicago, Ill., within five days from the time said stock is removed from said car or cars, and that if any loss or damage occurs upon the line of a connecting carrier, then such carrier shall not be liable unless a claim shall be made in like manner, and delivered in like time, to some proper officer or agent of the carrier, on whose line the loss or injury occurs.'\n\n Immediately after the car arrived at Suffern, petitioner placed it on a switch track opposite a cattle chute and left it in charge of respondents for unloading. By letting \n\n[250 U.S. 465, 467]\n\u00a0\n down a bridge they at once connected the chute and car and were about to lead out four horses, when an engine pushed other cars against it and injured the animals therein. No written claim was made for the loss or damage as provided by the bill of lading; and when sued the carrier defended upon that ground. Respondents maintain that transportation had ended when the accident occurred and consequently no written claim was necessary. The courts below accepted this view.\n Under our former opinions, the clause requiring presentation of a written claim is clearly valid and controlling as to any liability arising from beginning to end of the transportation contracted for.

Prescott, \n240 U.S. 632\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 469.\n In Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Ry. Co. v. Dettlebach we pointed out that the Hepburn Act (Act June 29, 1906, c. 3591, 34 Stat. 584) enlarged the definition of 'transportation' so as to include 'cars and other vehicles and all instrumentalities and facilities of shipment or carriage, irrespective of ownership or of any contract, express or implied, for the use thereof and all services in connection with the receipt, delivery, elevation and transfer in transit, ventilation, refrigeration, or icing, storage and hauling of property transported,' and we said from this and other provisions of the act 'it is evident that Congress recognized that the duty of carriers to the public included the performance of a variety of services that, according to the theory of the common law, were separable from the carrier's service as carrier, and, in order to prevent overcharges and discriminations from being made under the pretext of performing such additional services, it enacted that so far as inter \n\n[250 U.S. 465, 468]\n\u00a0\n state carriers by rail were concerned the entire body of such services should be included together under the single term 'transportation' and subjected to the provisions of the act respecting reasonable rates and the like.'\n In the instant case, when injured, the animals were awaiting removal from the car through a cattle chute alleged to be owned, operated and controlled by the railroad. If its employes had then been doing the work of unloading there could be no doubt that transportation was still in progress; and we think that giving active charge of the removal to respondents, as agreed, was not enough to end the interstate movement. The animals were in the car; no adequate time for unloading had transpired. The carrier had not fully performed the services incident to final delivery imposed by law. These included the furnishing of fair opportunt y and proper facilities for safe unloading although the shippers had contracted to do the work of actual removal. See Hutchinson on Carriers,  711, 714, 715.\n Petitioner's request for an instructed verdict in its behalf should have been granted. The judgment below must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE dissenting.\n I greatly regret that I cannot concur in the opinion and judgment of the court in this case, but I cannot consent to share in what seems to me a very strained construction of a definition in the Hepburn Act (34 Stat. 584, c. 3591,  1 [Comp. St.  8563]) which will result in keeping alive a bill of lading, with the effect of excusing the carrier from liability for negligently damaging the live stock of a consignee, after it had been delivered, on the ground that a claim in writing for the damage, duly verified, had not been presented within five days. \n\n[250 U.S. 465, 469]\n\u00a0\n My reasons for dissenting, stated as briefly as may be, are as follows:\n It is shown by the opinion of the court that the consignee, a partnership of three members, was bound by the bill of lading to unload the horses at destination.\n The consignee, being notified by the carrier as to the probable time of the arrival of the car, on the day before it arrived, paid what was supposed to be the full amount of the freight charges, and two members of the partnership were at the station at 3 o'clock in the morning to receive and unload it.\n When the train came, the senior member of the consignee stood in the cattle chute with the conductor, while the latter was placing the car for unloading and approved as satisfactory the position in which it was placed. Thereupon a brakeman set the brake, the engine was cut off and the conductor went away and left the car in the sole custody of the consignee, after saying to its representative, 'You had better get them out as soon as you can as they have been on the road a good while and are tired and hungry.' Two members of the partnership, consignee, went to work at once to unload the horses, but it was necessary to get some boards to make the bridge from the car to the chute safe, and in about half an hour, when the two were in the act of leading two horses from the car, other cars were negligently thrown against it and caused the damage sued for.\n I dissent from the opinion of the court because I agree with the three New York courts that the undisputed facts thus stated show that the transportation was ended and the delivery of the stock was so completely made as to end all liability of the carrier under the bill of lading, before the negligence of the company occurred which caused the damage complained of.\n What constitutes delivery of goods or of live stock by a carrier is usually a mixed question of law and fact, but \n\n[250 U.S. 465, 470]\n\u00a0\n where, as here, the facts are not disputed, it is a question of law.\n What more was there for the carrier to do,-what more could it have done-to make more complete the delivery necessary to fulfill its obligation as a carrier? The journey was ended, the freight charges were paid, and the car was placed on a side track in an appropriate place and position for unloading, which was approved by the consignee. It had been accepted by two members of the partnership, consignee, and had passed into their exclusive custody a full half hour before the accident. No assistance was asked for or needed after the conductor delivered the car and went away and thereafter the carrier owed to the consignee only the duty which it owed to any property lawfully upon or near to its tracks-not to negligently or willfully injure it, and it was for violation of that duty, not for failure to discharge duties imposed by the bill of lading, that this suit was instituted. The case is one of side track delivery, the equivalent of the familiar delivery of a car to an 'industrial track' or 'team unloading track' of a railroad, with possession taken by the consige e before the damage was done.\n To the weighty authority of the New York courts which decided in this case that the delivery was complete before the damage was done, may be added, a few from many, the decisions of the Supreme Courts-of Michigan, in a strikingly similar case, but with not so complete a delivery, in Brown v. Pontiac, etc., R. R. Co., 133 Mich. 371, 94 N. W. 1050; of Illinois, in Gratiot Street Warehouse Co. v. St. Louis, etc., R. R. Co., 221 Ill. 418, 77 N. E. 675; of North Carolina, in Reid v. Southern Railway Co., 149 N. C. 423, 63 S. E. 112; of Georgia, in Kenny Co. v. Atlanta, etc ., R. R. Co., 122 Ga. 365, 50 S. E. 132; and see Hedges v. Railroad Co., 49 N. Y. 223.\n The definition of 'transportation' in the Hepburn Act (34 Stat. 584), relied upon in the court's opinion, seems \n\n[250 U.S. 465, 471]\n\u00a0\n to me quite irrelevant. That provision was incorporated into the act to prevent unjust discrimination by carriers in terminal delivery charges, as the context and the history of the act abundantly show. It defined 'transportation,' but did not define what should constitute delivery to a consignee; that was left untouched and is governed by the prior decisions of courts and by those which have been developed since.\n Equally beside the question involved seems to me the decision in Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Ry. Co. v. Dettlebach, \n239 \nU.S. 588, 593\n, 594 S., 36 Sup. Ct. 177, cited in the opinion of the court. The question there under consideration was, whether when goods carried to destination were lost, after they had been held more than a month uncalled for, the liability of the carrier was to be determined by the terms of the bill of lading or by the more limited liability of a warehouseman. Obviously there was no question in the case as to what constituted delivery, for there was no pretense of delivery, actual or constructive, and therefore the decision cannot be of service in determining this case.\n The opinion of the court in this case concludes:\n'The animals were in the car; no adequate time for unloading had transpired. The carrier had not fully performed the service incident to final delivery imposed by law. These included the furnishing of fair opportunity and proper facilities for safe unloading, although the shippers had contracted to do the work of actual removal. See Hutchinson on Carriers,  711, 714, 715.'\n\n I cannot find justification, in the sections cited, for such a statement of the law as is here made.\n Section 711 deals with the obligation to unload carload freight, and, after saying that it is 'the uniform rule and costom in this country' for the consignee to unload, the only other relevant statement of the writer is:\n'All, therefore, that can be required of the railroad \n\n[250 U.S. 465, 472]\n\u00a0\n company, is that it shall place the cars where they can be safely and conveniently unloaded.'\n\n This the carrier in the case before us had done to the satisfaction and acceptance or the consignee before the accident complained of.\n Section 714 deals with the liability of the carrier pending removal ( delivery) of the goods, and says:\n'During this reasonable time [for delivery] the liability of the carrier remains unchanged; but so soon as it has elapsed he no longer stands in the relation of carrier to the goods. but in that of an ordinary bailee for hire.'\n\n The 'reasonable time' here referred to is palpably that necessary for the carrier to wait before its obligation becomes that of a warehouseman when the consignee does not appear to claim the shipment; it is not applicable to the time for unloading after the property has been accepted by the consignee.\n Section 715 declares that:\n'If the consignee is bound to unload the goods himself from the car, it is the duty of the carrier to place the car where it can be unloaded with a reasonable degree of convenience and to furnish the consignee with safe and proper facilities for the purpose.'\n\n All of this the carrier in this case did, and the consignee not only approved as satisfactory, safe n d proper, the position in which the car was placed and the facilities furnished for unloading it, but the delivery of the car was accepted and was in the actual possession and custody of the consignee for a very considerable time before the accident complained of happened. It was not in any attempt or effort on the part of the carrier to improve the unloading facilities or to assist the consignee that the damage was done, but it was the result of a tort, pure and simple- of a negligent switching operation, entirely independent of the delivery of the shipment, occurring a half hour after it had been accepted. \n\n[250 U.S. 465, 473]\n\u00a0\n The delivery having been completed and accepted by the consignee, the five-day limitation, so unreasonable in itself that it has been prohibited by congressional enactment (Act March 4, 1915, 38 Stat. 1196, c. 176,  1 [ Comp. St.  8604a]), has, in my judgment, no applicability to this case, and to bottom the conclusion announced upon the definition of 'transportation' in the Hepburn Act is to convert what was intended for the protection of shippers of property in interstate commerce, into an instrument of injury and injustice.\n For the reasons thus stated I dissent from the opinion and judgment of the court.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concur in this dissent. Mr. Justice DAY also dissents. \n\n\n\n","77":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nERVIEN v. U S(1919)\nNo. 72\nArgued: Decided: December 8, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. A. B. Renehan, of Santa Fe, N. M., for appellant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for the United States.[ Ervien v. U S \n251 U.S. 41\n (1919) ]\n\n\n[251 U.S. 41, 45]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Suit to enjoin the expenditure by appellant, commissioner of public lands of the state of New Mexico, of any of the funds derived from the sale and lease of lands granted and confirmed to the state by the act admitting her into the Union. The right to sell or lease is asserted under a certain act of New Mexico entitled 'An act concerning the publicity and promotion of public resources and welfare.' Laws 1915, c. 60.\n The Enabling Act was passed June 20, 1910 (36 Stat. 557, c. 310), and on August 21, 1911, by a joint resolution of the Senate and House of Representatives, New Mexico and Arizona were admitted into the Union upon an equal footing with the original states.\n By the Enabling Act certain grants of public lands were made to New Mexico for purposes of which there was a specific enumeration.\n It is provided by section 10 of the act that the lands granted and transferred thereby--\n'shall be by the said state held in trust, to be disposed of in whole or in part only in manner as herein provided and for the several objects specified in the respective granting and confirmatory provisions, and that the natural products and money proceeds of any of said lands shall be subject to the same trusts as the lands producing the same.'\n\n And it is further provided that--\n'The disposition of any of said lands, or of any money or thing of value directly or indirectly derived therefrom, for any object other than that for which such particular lands, or the lands from which such money or thing of value shall have been derived, were granted or confirmed, or in any manner contrary to the provisions of this act, shall be deemed a breach of trust.'\n\n It is made the duty of the Attorney General of the \n\n[251 U.S. 41, 46]\n\u00a0\n United States to prosecute in the name of the United States such proceedings at law or in equity as may be necessary to enforce the provisions of the act 'relative to the application and disposition of the said lands and the products thereof and the funds derived therefrom.'\n The constitutional convention was required to provide, by an ordinance irrevocable without the consent of the United States and the people of the state, that the state and its people consent to the provisions of the act, and the Constitution of the state did so provide.\n The Legislature of the state on March 8, 1915, passed over the Governor's veto an act entitled as we have designated, the first section of which is as follows:\n'Section 1. It shall be unlawful for the commissioner of public lands to expend for making known the resources and advantages of this state generally and particularly to homeseekers and investors, more than three cents on the dollar of the annual income of his office from sales and leases of lands, but, up to such limit of money annually, he may give or cause to be given publicity to such resources and advantages, and do or cause to be done all incidental work, in his judgment advisable to be done.'\n\n The commissioner receives from sales and leases of the lands granted a large income annually, the income for the year ending December 31, 1914, being approximately $741,000, and he threatens to expend three cents on the dollar of the annual income derived from sales and leases to give publicity to the resources and advantages of the state generally in conformity with the act of the Legislature of March 8, 1915, and, unless restrained, will do so.\n The answer, though in form a denial of some of the averments of the bill and an admission of others, is really an objection to its sufficiency to authorize the relief prayed, and the ground of objection is that the bill taken as a whole--\n'is no more than an attempt to interfere with the due administration of a trust estate by the trustee, the \n\n[251 U.S. 41, 47]\n\u00a0\n State of New Mexico, which requires the payment of necessary and proper expenses out of the income or proceeds of the trust property, the grantor of the trust, the government of the United States, having made no other provision for the payment of such necessary and proper costs and expenses; and defendant avers that the expenditure of a small portion of such income and proceeds for the purpose of advertising the resources of the state and the value of its lands, with the hope of thereby increasing the demand for the purchase and leasing of such lands and in the enhancing of the prospective prices to be derived therefrom, is a proper and necessary expense of the administration of said trust estate.'\n\n A temporary injunction was applied for and denied and subsequently the case by stipulation was submitted upon bill and answer, upon which it was ordered that the bill be and it was dismissed.\n The decree was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals and the case remanded with direction to enter a decree for the United States. This appeal was then prosecuted.\n The case is not in broad range and does not demand much discussion. There is in the Enabling Act a specific enumeration of the purposes for which the lands were granted and the enumeration is necessarily exclusive of any other purpose; and to make assurance doubly sure it was provided that the natural products and money proceeds of such lands should be subject to the same trusts as the lands producing the same. To preclude any license of construction or liberties of inference it was declared that the disposition of any of the lands or of the money or anything of value directly or indirectly derived therefrom for any object other than the enumerated ones should 'be deemed a breach of trust.'\n The dedication, we repeat, was special and exact, precluding any supplementary or aiding sense, in prophetic realization, it may be, that the state might be tempted \n\n[251 U.S. 41, 48]\n\u00a0\n to do that which it has done, lured from patient methods to speculative advertising in the hope of a speedy prosperity.\n It must be admitted there was enticement to it and a prospect of realization, and such was the view of the District Court. The court was of opinion that a private proprietor of the lands would without hesitation use their revenues to advertise their advantage and that that which was a wise administration of the property in him could not reach the odious dereliction of a breach of trust in the state.\n The phrase, however, means no more in the present case than that the United States, being the grantor of the lands, could impose conditions upon their use, and have the right to exact the performance of the conditions. We need not extend the argument or multiply considerations. The careful opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals has made it unnecessary. We approve, therefore, its conclusion and affirm its decree.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","78":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEVANS v. NATIONAL BANK OF SAVANNAH(1919)\nNo. 67\nArgued: Decided: December 8, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. Frederick T. Saussy, of Savannah, Ga., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Edward S. Elliott and William Garrard, both of Savannah, Ga., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The court below rightly construed the pleadings as presenting only one substantial federal question: Did \n\n[251 U.S. 108, 109]\n\u00a0\n respondent subject itself to the penalties prescribed for taking usury by discounting short-time notes in the ordinary course of business and charging therefor at the rate of eight per centum per annum in advance? And we think it correctly answered that question in the negative.\n Respondent is a national bank. Its powers in respect of discounts, whether transactions by it are usurious and the consequent penalties therefor, must be ascertained upon a consideration of the National Bank Act. Act June 3, 1864, c. 106, 13 Stat. 99, 101, 108; R. S.  5133 et seq. ( Comp. St.  9658); Farmers' & Mechanics' Bank v. Dearing, \n91 U.S. 29\n; Barnet v. National Bank, \n98 U.S. 555\n, 558; Haseltine v. Central Bank of Springfield, \n183 \nU.S. 132, 134\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 50. Section 8 declares:\n'That every association formed pursuant to the provisions of this act ... may elect and appoint directors, ... and exercise under this act all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking by discounting and negotiating promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange, and other evidences of debt, by receiving deposits. ...'\n\n Section 30, printed in the margin,1 contains regulations \n\n[251 U.S. 108, 110]\n\u00a0\n presently important in respect of usury. Among other things, it provides:\n'That every association may take, receive, reserve, and charge on any loan or discount made, or upon any note, bill of exchange, or other evidences of debt, interest at the rate allowed by the laws of the state or territory where the bank is located, and no more. ...'\n\n All these provisions were carried into sections 5136, 5197, and 5198, Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  9661, 9758, 9759), set out below. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[251 U.S. 108, 111]\n\u00a0\n The National Bank Act establishes a system of general regulations. It adopts usury laws of the states only in so far as they severally fix the rate of interest. Farmers' & Mechanics' Bank v. Dearing, supra; National Bank v. Johnson, \n104 U.S. 271\n; Haseltine v. Central Bank of Springfield, supra.\n The Georgia Code (1910) contains the following:\n'Sec. 3426. What is Lawful Interest. The legal rate of interest shall remain seven per centum per annum, where the rate per cent. is not named in the contract, and any higher rate must be specified in writing, but in no event to exceed eight per cent. per annum.\n\n'Sec. 3427. What is Usury. Usury is the reserving and taking, or contracting to reserve and take, either directly or by indirection, a greater sum for the use of momey than the lawful interest.'\n\n'Sec. 3436. Beyond Eight Per Cent. Interest Forbidden. \n\n[251 U.S. 108, 112]\n\u00a0\n It shall not be lawful for any person, company, or corporation to reserve, charge, or take for any loan or advance of money, or forbearance to enforce the collection of any sum of money, any rate of interest greater than eight per centum per annum, either directly or indirectly by way of commission for advances, discount, exchange, or by any contract or contrivance or device whatever.'\n\n Construing these sections, in Loganville Banking Co. v. Forrester ( 1915) 143 Ga. 302, 305, 84 S. E. 961, 962 (L. R. A. 1915D, 1195), the Georgia Supreme Court held that charges reserved in advance by a state bank at the highest permitted rate of interest on a loan, whether short or long time, constitute usury, and said:\n'If the intent be to take only legal interest, a slight and trifling excess, due to mistake or inadvertence, will not taint the transaction with usury. ... But if the purpose be to take from the money advanced, at the time of the loan, the legal maximum rate of interest, the transaction is an usurious one.'\n\n Earlier opinions by the court express a different view of the same sections. In Mackenzie v. Flannery (1892) 90 Ga. 590, 599, 16 S. E. 710, 713, it is said:\n'Nor can we determine, without reference to the evidence, whether the taking of eight per cent. interest in advance by way of discount was usurious. Eight per cent. was legal if agreed upon in writing; ... and it is well settled that the taking of interest in advance on short loans in the usual and ordinary course of business is not usurious, if the interest reserved does not exceed the legal rate.'\n\n See, also, Union Savings Bank v. Dottenheim, 107 Ga. 606, 614, 34 S. E. 217; McCall v. Herring, 116 Ga. 235, 243, 42 S. E. 468.\n Petitioner maintains the loans in question would have been usurious if made in Georgia by an individual or a state bank and that the same rule applies notwithstanding the lender happened to be a national bank. Respondent insists that the federal act permits it to discount short-time notes, reserving interest in advance at the maximum \n\n[251 U.S. 108, 113]\n\u00a0\n interest rate allowed by the state law-in this instance, 8 per centum.\n In Fleckner v. Bank, 8 Wheat. 338, 349, 354 (5 L. Ed. 631) the charter of the Bank of the United States inhibited it from taking interest 'more than at the rate of six per centum' and plaintiff claimed that by deducting interest at the rate of 6 per centum from the amount of a discounted note, the bank received usury. Replying to that point, this court, through Mr. Justice Story, said:\n'If a transaction of this sort is to be deemed usurious, the same principle must apply with equal force to bank discounts, generally, for the practice is believed to be universal; and probably few, if any, charters contain an express provision authorizing, in terms, the deduction of the interest in advance upon making loans or discounts. It has always been supposed that an authority to discount, or make discounts, did, from the very force of the terms, necessarily include an authority to take the interest in advance. And this is not only the settled opinion among professional and commercial men, but stands approved by the soundest principles of legal construction. Indeed, we do not know in what other sense the word 'discount' is to be interpreted. Even in England, where no statute authorizes bankers to make discounts, it has been solemnly adjudged, that the taking of interest in advance by bankers, upon loans, in the ordinary course of business, is not usurious.'\n\n See, also, McCarthy v. First National Bank, \n223 \nU.S. 493, 499\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 240.\n This view has been generally adopted. Many supporting cases are collected in a note to Bank of Newport v. Cook, 60 Ark. 288, 30 S. W. 35, 29 L. R. A. 761, 46 Am. St. Rep. 171, and in 39 Cyclopedia of Law and Procedure, 948 et seq.\n'The taking of interest in advance, upon the discount of a note in the usual course of business by a banker, is not usury. This has long been settled, and is not now open for controversy.' Tyler on Usury ( 1872) p. 155.\n\n'That it is not \n\n[251 U.S. 108, 114]\n\u00a0\n usury to discount commercial paper in the ordinary course of business is absolutely settled. This rule of law arose out of custom and does not depend upon statute.' Webb on Usury (1898)  111.\n\n Associations organized under the National Bank Act are plainly empowered to discount promissory notes in the ordinary course of business. To discount, ex vi termini, implies reservation of interest in advance; and, under the ancient and commonly accepted doctrine, when dealing with short-time paper such a reservation at the highest interest rate allowed by law is not usurious. Recognizing prevailing practice in business and the above stated doctrine concerning usury, we think Congress intended to endow national banks with the power, which banks generally exercise, of discounting notes reserving charges at the highest rate permitted for interest. To carry out this purpose, the National Bank Act provides that associations organized under it may reserve on any discount interest at the rate allowed by the state, and only when there is reservation at a rate greater than the one specified does the transaction become usurious.\n The maximum interest rate allowed by the Georgia statute is 8 per centum. That marks the limit which a national bank there located may charge upon discounts; but its right to retain so much arises from federal law. The latter also completely defines what constitutes the taking of usury by a national bank, referring to the state law only to determine the maximum permitted rate.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY, with whom concurred Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice CLARKE, dissenting.\n I agree that in this case but one federal question is properly presented for our consideration, and that is whether the National Bank of Savannah took usury, \n\n[251 U.S. 108, 115]\n\u00a0\n in violation of sections 5197 and 5198, Rev. Stat. U. S. when, in discounting short-term notes in the ordinary course of business at its banking house in the state of Georgia, it knowingly reserved in advance a discount at the rate of 8 per centum per annum, computed upon the face of such notes, when by the laws of Georgia this was not allowed to be done by state banks of issue.\n I agree that this question is to be determined by the provisions of section 5197; but, so far as it depends upon ascertaining the local rate of interest, we must determine it according to the law of the state of Georgia, because the cited sections make that law the criterion. It is settled that although the consequences of acceptance of usurious interest by a national bank and the penalties to be enforced are to be determined by the provisions of the National Banking Act, the ascertainment of the rate of interest allowable is to be according to the state law. Farmers', etc., National Bank v. Dearing, \n91 U.S. 29\n, 32; Union National Bank v. Louisville, &c. Railway, \n163 \nU.S. 325, 331\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 1039; Haseltine v. Central Bank of Springfield, \n183 \nU.S. 132, 134\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 50.\n The language of section 5197 is explicit. It allows a national bank to--\n'take, receive, reserve, and charge on any loan or discount made, or upon any note, bill of exchange, or other evidences of debt, interest at the rate allowed by the laws of the state. ... where the bank is located, and no more, except that where by the laws of any state a different rate is limited for banks of issue organized under state laws, the rate so limited shall be allowed for associations organized or existing in any such state under this title. When no rate is fixed by the laws of the state, ... the bank may take, receive, reserve, or charge a rate not exceeding seven per centum, and such interest may be taken in advance, reckoning the days for which the note, bill, or other evidence of debt has to run. ...' \n\n[251 U.S. 108, 116]\n\u00a0\n I regard it as clear that by 'the laws of the state' is meant not merely acts of legislation, much less a particular act or section, or a particular phrase in a single section. In order to determine the point in controversy we must take all applicable provisions of the statutes as interpreted and construed by the decisions of the court of last resort, and from their combined effect determine what is 'interest at the rate allowed by the laws of the state.'\n\n The pertinent statute law of the state of Georgia is found in sections 3426, 3427, and 3436 of the Code. The first of these defines 'what is lawful interest,' and prescribes 7 per centum per annum as the legal rate where no rate is named in the contract, and permits a higher rate to be specified in writing, 'but in no event to exceed 8 per cent. per annum.' Section 3427 defines usury as:\n'Reserving and taking, or contracting to reserve and take, either directly or by indirection, a greater sum for the use of money than the lawful interest.'\n\n And section 3436 declares:\n'It shall not be lawful for any person, company, or corporation to reserve, charge, or take for any loan or advance of money, or forbearance to enforce the collection of any sum of money, and rate of interest greater than eight per centum per annum, either directly or indirectly by way of commission for advances, discount, exchange, or by any contract or contrivance or device whatever.'\n\n I agree that, under the decisions of this court and the general current of authority, the discounting of short-term notes with a reservation of interest in advance at the highest rate allowed by statute is permissible, in the absence of special restriction. Fleckner v. U. S. Bank, 8 Wheat. 338, 349, 354.\n And I understand it to have been permitted in Georgia prior to the recent decision by the Supreme Court of that state in Loganville Banking Co. v. Forrester, 143 \n\n[251 U.S. 108, 117]\n\u00a0\n Ga. 302, 84 S. E. 961, L. R. A. 1915D, 1195. See Mackenzie v. Flannery, 90 Ga. 590, 599, 16 S. E. 710; Union Savings Bank v. Dottenheim, 107 Ga. 606, 614, 34 S. E. 217; McCall v. Herring, 116 Ga. 235, 243, 42 S. E. 468.\n The Forrester Case was decided April 13, 1915. The claim involved in the present suit includes a series of transactions, the first of which was on November 2, 1914, the last on October 18, 1915. A majority of these were prior to the decision in the Forrester Case, and as to them I agree that there was no violation of the federal statute.\n With respect to the others, I have reached a different conclusion. The case was decided on a demurrer to plaintiff's petition, in which it was alleged that defendant (now respondent) knowingly received and charged interest in excess of the highest contractual rate allowed under the laws of the state, specifying the particular dates and amounts. This necessarily imports a knowledge at the time of each transaction as to what then constituted the law of the state, supposing such knowledge need be averred.\n As to these later transactions, with great respect for the views of my Brethren, I am constrained to dissent from the opinion and judgment of the court because convinced that there is error in holding without qualification that since the decision of the Forrester Case 8 per cent. is the rate of interest allowed and limited for state banks of issue by the laws of the state of Georgia. It seems to me erroneous to regard that decision as merely defining usury and thus settling what lawfully may be done by state banks in respect of taking interest in advance, and to ignore its effect, in combination with the quoted sections of the Code, as constituting the law of the State which fixes the maximum rate of interest for such banks and therefore, under section 5197, Rev. Stat. U. S., establishes the limit for national banks located in that state. Plainly, I think, the purpose of Congress was \n\n[251 U.S. 108, 118]\n\u00a0\n to place national banks upon a precise equality in this respect with banks of issue organized under state laws, and that where the local law places a higher or a lower limit upon such banks of issue than upon other lenders of money the same limit should be imposed upon the national banks.\n The section has regard to substance, not merely to form; and in determining what is in substance the local rate of interest it is fallacious, I submit, to regard the multiplier only (say, 8 per cent.), and ignore the multiplicand, since both factors have equal influence in producing the result. As in other cases of testing state laws by a federal standard, the question is: What is the effect and operation of those laws, as construed and applied by the state court of last resort?\n The difference between the effect of computing discount taken in advance according to the custom of bankers, by applying the allowed percentage to the face of the note, termed 'bank discount,' and the effect of deducting an amount equivalent to exact interest on the sum actually loaned, termed 'true discount,' is very substantial, and is recognized in the standard interest and discount tables, which contain computations on both bases. To illustrate by a comparison: If interest at the rate of 8 per centum per annum be reserved in advance and computed upon the face of a three months note, it amounts to 2.0408 per cent. for the period, or at the rate of 8.1632 per centum per annum upon the money loaned; upon a six months note it amounts to 4.1667 per cent. for the period, or at the rate of 8.3333 per centum per annum; upon a nine months note, to 6.383 per cent. for the period, or at the rate of 8.511 per centum per annum; upon a one year note it amounts to 8.695 per cent.\n The legal problem is precisely analogous to that involved in comparing respective burdens of taxation imposed upon different properties or classes of property; \n\n[251 U.S. 108, 119]\n\u00a0\n concerning which this court has more than once held that a law requiring that one class shall be taxed at the 'same rate of taxation' paid by another requires that not only the percentage of the rate but the basis of the valuation shall be the same. Cummings v. National Bank, \n101 \nU.S. 153, 158\n, 162 S.-163; Greene v. Louisville & Interurban R. R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 499, 515\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 673, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 88.\n The laws of Georgia do not prohibit the taking of interest in advance by a state bank; and they permit it to be charged according to the usual course of banking, with this qualification, that if reserved in advance at the highest percentage, or at any percentage that has the effect of yielding to the lender more than at the rate of 8 per centum per annum upon the amount actually loaned, it is usurious. This qualification, which since the decision of the Forrester Case must be deemed to be the law of Georgia, has precisely the same effect as if it had been inserted by way of an amending proviso to sec. 3426 of the Code. That it happens to arise from the construction and application of that section together with sections 3427 and 3436 by the state court of last resort can make no difference for present purposes.\n The case before us comes squarely within the principle of Citizens' National Bank v. Donnell, \n195 U.S. 369\n, 373-374, 25 Sup. Ct. 49. There the question was whether a national bank in Missouri had taken usury, contrary to sections 5197 and 5198, Rev. Stat. U. S., in taking interest computed at a percentage less than the highest rate allowed by the state law, if agreed upon in writing, but at the same time violating a state prohibition against compounding interest oftener than once a year. This court held that the prohibition against frequent compounding affected the 'rate of interest' within the meaning of those words in section 5198, and that this section was violated because the local prohibition was violated. I quote from the opinion (\n195 U.S. 374\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 50):\n'The rate of interest which a man receives is greater when \n\n[251 U.S. 108, 120]\n\u00a0\n he is allowed to compound than when he is not, the other elements in the case being the same. Even if the compounded interest is less than might be charged directly without compounding, a statute may forbid enlarging the rate in that way, whatever may be the rules of the common law. The Supreme Court of Missouri holds that that is what the Missouri statute has done. On that point, and on the question whether what was done amounted to compounding within the meaning of the Missouri statute, we follow the state court. Union National Bank v. Louisville, New Albany & Chicago Ry., \n163 U.S. 325\n, 331 [16 Sup. Ct. 1039]. Therefore, since the interest charged and received by the plaintiff was compounded more than once a year it was at a rate greater than was allowed by Rev. Stat. U.

Y., for petitioner.\n Mr. Alexander C. King, Sol. Gen., of Atlanta, Ga., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n After hearing and leave granted on a rule to show cause, this petition for habeas corpus seeking the discharge of the petitioner from custody under a commitment for contempt was filed. The grounds for discharge were that the court had exceeded its jurisdiction by punishing as a contempt an act which it had no power to so punish, and that even if the act punished was susceptible of being treated as a contempt the action of the court was arbitrary, beyond the limits of any discretion possessed, and violative of due process of law under the Fifth Amendment. Prior to submission and after return and the hearing which ensued an order admitting to bail was made.\n The duty to consider the case arises from the permission to file, and therefore prima facie implies that it is of such a character as to be an exception to the rule of procedure that other available sources of judicial power may not be passed by for the purpose of obtaining relief by resort to the original jurisdiction of this court.

Ct. 4. Whether, however, definitively the case is of such exceptional character must depend upon an analysis of the merits, which we now proceed to make upon the petition, the return, argument for the petitioner, suggestions by the United States, a statement by the judge, and a transcript of the stenographer's notes showing what transpired in the court below, made a part of the argument of the petitioner and in substance conceded by all parties to be the record.\n In a trial which was proceeding in the court below, presided over by the judge of the district of Vermont assigned to the Eastern district of New York, the petitioner was recalled as a witness by the government for the purpose of proving by his testimony the handwriting of MacMillan and Van Amburgh. On being shown the writings referred to, in answer to questions by the government, he said that he believed, from having often seen the writing of the persons named, that the writings shown him were theirs, but that he could not so state from having seen MacMillan and Van Amburgh write because he could not recollect ever having seen them do so. The court thereupon pointedly questioned the witness on the subject of his recollection and, in view of his persistency in declaring that he could not swear from knowledge derived from a recollection of having seen MacMillan and Van Amburgh write or sign that the writings were theirs, states to government counsel that because of the evident unwillingness of the witness the widest latitude would be allowed the government in its examination. This was availed of, and an inquiry followed covering a wide field as to the previous association of the witness with the parties in question, his employment in \n\n[249 U.S. 378, 381]\n\u00a0\n the business in which they were engaged, and other circumstances deemed to persuasively establish that his connection with them had been such that his statement that he could not remember having seen them write was untrue.\n The inquiries, however, made no change in the statements of the witness, who persisted in saying:\n'I cannot say that I can recall that I have ever seen him in the act of writing. I would not say I have not, but I would not say that I have.'\n\n Finally the court interrupted the examination by saying:\n'This witness in going to be committed for contempt of court. The court is thoroughly satisfied, Mr. Witness, that you are testifying falsely when you say that you cannot recall of ever seeing Mr. MacMillan write, and this has happened several times during this trial with other witness, especially with you wife. ...\n\n'And it becomes the plain duty of the court to commit you to jail, sir, for contempt, and before doing so, I think it is the duty of the court to explain to you that the answer, 'I do not remember of ever having seen him write,' is just as false, is just as much contempt of court if you have seen him write, as it would be for you to say that you had never seen him write, without using the expression, 'I do not remember.\"\n\n In the same direction the court said:\n'I am not going to allow you to obstruct the course of justice here, and if this nation has delegated power enough to this court, and I am very sure it has, to deal with you in the manner proposed, I am going to do it.'\n\n Before the discharge of the witness from the stand an order for contempt against him was made, and he was committed to the custody of the marshal. On the same day he pleaded not guilty to an indictment for perjury which the grand jury had just presented and obtained an order for release on bail which was inoperative because \n\n[249 U.S. 378, 382]\n\u00a0\n he continued to be held under the commitment for contempt.\n The record states that on July 8th following a nunc pro tunc order of commitment was spread upon the minutes in which the previous commitment was described as having been made for misbehaviour of the petitioner in the presence of the court when on the witness stand by willfully refusing 'to answer certain questions truthfully' concerning his having seen MacMillan and Van Amburgh write and sign. The new commitment directed that it should continue in force until the petitioner had purged himself of the contempt for which he was being punished.\n That the contumacious refusal of a witness to testify may so directly obstruct a court in the performance of its duty as to justify punishment for contempt is so well settled as to need only statement. Despite some confusion caused by certain ambiguous forms of expression used by the court below in dealing with the subject, it is indisputable that the punishment for contempt was imposed solely because of the opinion of the court that the witness was willfully refusing to testify truthfully, that is, was committing perjury.\n Whether, then, power to punish for contempt exists in every case where a court is of the opinion that a witness is committing perjury, is the test we must here apply. Because perjury is a crime defined by law and one committing it may be tried and punished does not necessarily establish that when committed in the presence of a court it may not, when exceptional conditions so justify, be the subject-matter of a punishment for contempt. For an application of this doctrine to perjury, see Berkson v. People, 154 Ill. 81, 39 N. E. 1079; In re Rosenberg, 90 Wis. 581, 63 N. W. 1065, 64 N. W. 299; Stockham v. French, 1 Bing. 365; and see In re Schulman, 177 Fed. 191, 101 C. C. A. 361; In re Steiner (D. C.) 195 Fed. 299; In re Ulmer (D. C.) 208 Fed. 461; United States v. Appel (D. C.) \n\n[249 U.S. 378, 383]\n\u00a0\n 211 Fed. 495. This being true, we must ascertain what is the essential ingredient in addition to the elements constituting perjury under the general law which must be found in perjury when committed in the presence of a court to bring about the exceptional conditions justifying punishment under both.\n Existing within the limits of and sanctioned by the Constitution, the power to punish for contempt committed in the presence of the court is not controlled by the limitations of the Constitution as to modes of accusation and methods of trial generally safeguarding the rights of the citizen. This, however, expresses no purpose to exempt judicial authority from constitutional limitations, since its great and only purpose is to secure judicial authority from obstruction in the performance of its duties to the end that means appropriate for the preservation and enforcement of the Constitution may be secured. Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, \n247 U.S. 402\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 560; Marshall v. Gordon, \n243 U.S. 521\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 448, L. R. A. 1917F, 279, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 371.\n An obstruction to the performance of judicial duty resulting from an act done in the presence of the court is, then, the characteristic upon which the power to punish for contempt must rest. This being true, it follows that the presence of that element must clearly be shown in every case wbere the power to punish for contempt is exerted-a must clearly be shown in every case where hand, exacts that in order to punish perjury in the presence of the court as a contempt there must be added to the essential elements of perjury under the general law the further element of obstruction to the court in the performance of its duty. As illustrative of this, see United States v. Appel (D. C.) 211 Fed. 495. It is true that there are decided cases which treat perjury, without any other element, as adequate to sustain a punishment for contempt. But the mistake is, we think, evident, since it either overlooks or misconceives the essential characteristic \n\n[249 U.S. 378, 384]\n\u00a0\n of the obstructive tendency underlying the contempt power, or mistakenly attributes a necessarily inherent obstructive effect to false swearing. If the conception were true, it would follow that when a court entertained the opinion that a witness was testifying untruthfully the power would result to impose a punishment for contempt with the object or purpose of exacting from the witness a character of testimony which the court would deem to be truthful; and thus it would come to pass that a potentiality of oppression and wrong would result and the freedom of the citizen when called as a witness in a court would be gravely imperiled.\n Testing the power to make the commitment which is under consideration in this case by the principles thus stated, we are of opinion that the commitment was void for excess of power-a conclusion irresistibly following from the fact that the punishment was imposed for the supposed perjury alone without reference to any circumstance or condition giving to it an obstructive effect. Indeed, when the provision of the commitment directing that the punishment should continue to be enforced until the contempt, that is, the perjury, was purged, the impression necessarily arises that it was assumed that the power existed to hold the witness in confinement under the punishment until he consented to give a character of testimony which in the opinion of the court would not be perjured.\n In view of the nature of the case, of the relation which the question which it involves bears generally to the power and duty of courts in the performance of their functions, of the dangerous effect on the liberty of the citizen when called upon as a witness in a court which might result if the erroneous doctrine upon which the order under review was based were not promptly corrected, we are of opinion that the case is an exception to the general rules of procedure to which we have at the outset \n\n[249 U.S. 378, 385]\n\u00a0\n referred, and therefore that our duty exacts that we finally dispose of the questions in the proceeding for habeas corpus which is before us. It is therefore\n Ordered that the petitioner be discharged.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY dissents. \n\n\n\n","80":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEX PARTE WAGNER(1919)\nNo. 29\nArgued: March 17, 1919Decided: April 14, 1919\n\n\n\n Messrs.\nH. A. Toulmin and H. A. Toulmin, Jr., both of Dayton, Ohio, for petitioners.\n Mr. Reeve Lewis, of Washington, D. C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioners pray that a writ of mandamus shall issue out of this court requiring the Circuit Court of Appeals \n\n[249 U.S. 465, 466]\n\u00a0\n for the Sixth Circuit and the judges thereof and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Western Division, and the judge thereof, to stay further proceedings in a suit pending in the District Court, and the execution of a judgment against petitioners rendered therein by that court (Meccano v. Wagner, 234 Fed. 912) and affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (Wagner v. Meccano, Limited, 246 Fed. 603, 158 C. C. A. 573). The answers of the courts and judges to the usual rule to show cause are before us.\n The facts upon which the prayer for this extraordinary remedy is based are as follows: The Meccano, Limited, a corporation, brought a suit, which we shall designate as the Ohio case, in the District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against F. A. Wagner, trading as the American Mechanical Toy Company, and the Strobel & Wilken Company, a corporation, charging: (1) The infringement of letters patent, which the plaintiff claimed to own, covering certain parts of a model builder or mechanical toy, known by the trade-name of 'Meccano'; (2) the infringement of two copyrights which the plaintiff claimed to own upon the manual or book of instructions, which was sold with the toy and which was essential to the use of it; and (3) unfair competition. An accounting and permanent injunction were prayed for. The defendants denied the allegations of the bill and asserted a counterclaim.\n Upon the trial on the merits the District Court found for the plaintiff on all of the issues, dismissed the counterclaim of defendants, and, granting an injunction, ordered an accounting.\n On appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the decree of the District Court except as to the infringement of the patent, which was held to be invalid for want of invention, and remanded the case for a decree not inconsistent with its opinion.\n Pursuant to this affirmance the District Court entered a decree, and appointed a master to take an account of \n\n[249 U.S. 465, 467]\n\u00a0\n gains, profits, and damages and to report his conclusions to that court.\n Thus was the Ohio case ripe for an accounting, which had been ordered, when the petition which we are considering was filed.\n After the decision by the District Court in the Ohio case, but before it was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, the Meccano, Limited, instituted a suit which we shall designate as the New York case, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against John Wanamaker, a corporation, charging that the defendant, a customer of the defendants in the Ohio case and a retail dealer engaged in selling the toy manufactured by Wagner, was guilty of the same violations of complainant's rights as were alleged in the Ohio case. Upon 'affidavits and exhibits' a motion for an injunction pendente lite was filed, which, upon hearing, was granted. From this order allowing a temporary injunction an appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and after the appeal was argued, but before it was decided, the decree of the District Court in the Ohio case was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Thereupon the Meccano Company filed a 'motion for a decision on the merits' in the New York case, then pending on appeal in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and in support of this motion were filed copies of the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and of the decree entered by the District Court pursuant thereto.\n This motion for a judgment on the merits was bottomed on the claim that the two cases involved the same issues, that Wagner had assumed the defense in the New York case, and that the decree rendered by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit constituted an estoppel by judgment when pleaded in the case in the Second circuit, but the motion was denied. \n\n[249 U.S. 465, 468]\n\u00a0\n Later on the appeal from the order granting a preliminary injunction, which was argued gued before the motion for judgment on the merits was filed, was decided, and the District Court was reversed, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit holding with the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit that the patent declared on was invalid for want of invention, but the court also held that a very clear case was necessary to justify a preliminary injunction for a claimed infringement of copyright or for unfair competition, the only remaining claims in the bill, and that the affidavits and exhibits before the District Court were not sufficient to warrant its conclusion. For these reasons the order of the District Court allowing a temporary injunction was reversed.\n Following this decision by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit the Meccano, Limited, filed a petition in this court for a writ of certiorari, giving as the reasons relied upon to secure the writ that there was a conflict of opinion between the Courts of Appeals of the Second and Sixth Circuits upon the questions involved in the case, and that the cause should be brought before this court for review to determine:\n\n\n (1)\n The legal effect to be given to a prior decree in the Sixth circuit against the manufacturer as against a customer in the Second circuit.\n\n\n (2)\n Whether the preliminary injunction could be legally denied by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit after the prior adjudication of the same issues by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.\n\n\n (3)\n Whether or not the prior decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit entitled the petitioner to a decision in its favor on the 'motion for a decision on the merits' filed in the later case in the Second circuit.\n\n\n (4)\n Whether or not an unsuccessful defendant in a suit in one circuit, in which his product has been adjudged \n\n[249 U.S. 465, 469]\n\u00a0\n unlawful, is to be permitted to relitigate the same issues with respect to the same product by assuming the defense of a subsequent suit in another circuit against one of his customers.\n Upon this petition a writ of certiorari was allowed and the case was brought to this court for review.\n Promptly upon the granting of the writ of certiorari by this court the petitioners herein moved the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit to stay the accounting proceeding in the Ohio case pending a decision by this court in the New York case.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit denied this motion, and, in the answer of that court and of the judges thereof to the rule of this court to show cause, they give as their reason for so deciding that the court was of the opinion that, as the case had theretofore been remanded to the District Court, it had no jurisdiction to order such a stay or to make an order directing the District Judge to do so, certainly not until a like application had been made to that court and had been refused. In its journal entry the court sufficiently advised the unsuccessful parties of the reason for its action. It reads as follows:\n'That the motion ... to stay all proceedings herein ... presents a question which at this stage of the case, No. 2977, must be determined by the court below.'\n\n And the court and judges add that no application had been made in any way to review the action taken by the District Judge on the motion to stay.\n Obviously it is a conclusive answer to the prayer of the petitioners for a writ of mandamus to the Circuit Court of Appeals and to the judges thereof directing the entry of a stay of proceedings that the case was not, when the stay was refused, and is not now, pending in that court. \n\n[249 U.S. 465, 470]\n\u00a0\n After this overruling of their motion for a stay by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, the petitioners herein made a similar application to the District Court for the Southern District of Ohio for a stay of proceedings until the New York case should be decided by this court, which motion was also denied.\n The District Court and the judge thereof in the return to the rule issued herein give as reasons for such denial:\n\n\n (1)\n That the defendants had permitted the time to expire in which to apply to this court for a review of the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on certiorari without making any application for such review, and therefore the court concluded that the rights of the parties as to unfair competition and copyright infringement, which remained after the holding that the patent was invalid, had become settled.\n\n\n (2)\n That the case before the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was an appeal from an order granting a preliminary injunction, and that to the court, not having the record in that suit before it, the New York case seemed to involve only the question as to the effect of the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upon the case in the Second circuit, and could not, therefore, be determinative of the rights of the parties in the Ohio case.\n\n\n (3)\n That there did not seem to the court to be any conflict between the decisions by the Sixth and Second Circuit Courts of Appeals because the facts of the two cases, as the court was advised, were so different that the decisions could not be the same upon their merits.\n\n\n (4)\n That from the statement of counsel for Wagner that a fire had occurred on the floor of the building in which the Wagner outfits, manuals, etc., and books had been stored, resulting in great injury to them, the court concluded it to be the part of prudence that the marshal should take possession of such property and \n\n[249 U.S. 465, 471]\n\u00a0\n books as soon as possible, and that there seemed to it no good reason for further delay in the accounting.\n This answer of the District Court and judge is also clearly sufficient and conclusive. It shows that the court was called upon to judicially determine the scope of the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, reversing the action of the District Court granting a temporary injunction, and whether or not that decision was in conflict with the decision by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit; to forecast, as best it might, what the scope and effect of the decision of this court in the New York case would be upon the rights of the parties as determined in the Ohio case, and, having regard to the rights of the plaintiff and the conduct of the defendants, whether, after four years of obviously very strenuous litigation, the accounting should be further delayed by the prospect that the decision of this court might render the results of it valueless.\n Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy, to be resorted to for the purpose of securing judicial action, not for determining in advance what that action shall be. In re Rice, \n155 U.S. 396\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 149. It may not be resorted to, as the petitioners seek to resort to it here, for the purpose of controlling minor orders made in the conduct of judicial proceedings, and the fact that the result of litigation may possibly be such that interlocutory proceedings taken may not prove of value is not a sufficient reason for calling the writ into use for the purpose of forbidding such proceedings, even though the cost of them cannot be recovered from the opposing party or even though the order cannot be reversed on error or appeal. Ex parte Newman, 14 Wall. 152, 165, 168. This from American Construction Co. v. Jacksonville, Tampa & Key West Railway Co., \n148 \nU.S. 372, 379\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 758, 761 (37 L.

U S(1919)\nNo. 67\nArgued: April 24, 1919Decided: June 9, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. Albert M. Yuzzolino, of New York City, for petitioners.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Hanson, for the United States. \n\n[250 U.S. 355, 356]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioners, Vitelli & Son during the years 1905-1907, made entry at the port of New York of 19 different lots of dutiable merchandise, that is, chestnuts and garlic, and these entries were liquidated and the duties paid. About five years after the last of these payments, the collector of the port of New York, declaring that evidence had been produced to his satisfaction showing that 14 of the 19 entries referred to were fraudulent, because of the incorrect weights upon which they were based, canceled the previous liquidations relating to them and directed a reliquidation to be made on the basis of the corrected weights. Vitelli & Son, denying the existence of fraud and disputing the power to make the reliquidation, protested against the claim of duty which resulted from the reliquidation, and, paying the same under protest, prosecuted an appeal to the Board of General Appraisers.\n Before the Board the collector made no affirmative proof of the commission of fraud, and submitted the validity of the reliquidation upon the basis of the official papers pertaining to it-that is, the certificates of weight, etc.-upon which he had acted. The petitioners, not taking upon themselves the u rden of showing that there was an absence of fraud, stood upon their protest as to the want of power to make the reliquidation. The Board sustained the protest. It held that as under the conditions disclosed the existence of power in the collector to make the reliquidation after one year depended upon the fact of fraud, that the burden was upon the collector to establish that which was necessary to sustain his authority to act, and having failed to do so the reliquidation was erroneous and the protest was well founded. Appeal was prosecuted to the Court of Customs Appeals, where the action of the Board was reversed. United States v. Vitelli & Son, 5 Ct. Cust. App. \n\n[250 U.S. 355, 357]\n\u00a0\n 151. The court held that although it was true that, as applied to the case before it, the existence of fraud was essential to confer upon the collector the power which he had exerted, as he had exercised the authority, the presumption of the correctness of official action was sufficient, without proof of fraud to sustain the reliquidation. In reaching this conclusion it was expressly decided that, in view of the presumption of power indulged in, the effect of section 21 of the Act of June 22, 1874, c. 391, 18 Stat. 190 (Comp. St.  5714), was to cast upon the importer the burden of establishing a negative, that is, that there had been no fraud. The case was remanded for reconsideration to the Board of General Appraisers.\n While the protest concerning the 14 entries was pending, the collector had, for like alleged fraud, ordered a reliquidation of the remaining 5 of the 19 entries, and by protest and payment of duties the action of the collector as to those entries was before the Board of General Appraisers for consideration. They were heard by the Board along with the entries which the Board had under consideration by virtue of the remanding order of the Court of Customs Appeals. The Board held, in view of the ruling of the Court of Customs Appeals as to the presumption of power and burden of proof, that the reliquidation in both cases was valid and that the protests were consequently without merit. Both cases were then appealed to the Court of Customs Appeals, which in an elaborate opinion reiterated and applied its previous ruling (7 Ct. Cust. App. 243), and the cases are here on the allowance of a certiorari.\n Obviously the whole case turns upon the significance of section 21 of the Act of 1874, the text of which is as follows (18 Stat. 186, 190):\n'Whenever any goods, wares, and merchandise shall have been entered and passed free of duty, and whenever duties upon any imported goods, wares, and merchandise shall have been liquidated and paid, and \n\n[250 U.S. 355, 358]\n\u00a0\n such goods, wares, and merchandise shall have been delivered to the owner, importer, agent, or consignee, such entry and passage free of duty and such settlement of duties shall, after the expiration of one year from the time of entry, in the absence of fraud and in the absence of protest by the owner, importer, agent, or consignee, be final and conclusive upon all parties.'\n\n Indisputable also is it, as stated by the Court of Customs Appeals and long previously pointed out in United States v. Phelps et al., 17 Blatchf. 312, Fed. Cas. No. 16039, that the remedy intended to be accomplished by the section in question was to prevent the right to reliquidate, which had previously been exerted without limit, from being exercised except in the particular conditions stated, and thus in the interest of the citizen to circumscribe the power to the instances specified in order that uncertainty as to the finality of customs entries might be removed and the security of commercial transactions be safeguarded. But from this premise we are of opinion that the error of the construction given to the statute below becomes at once apparent, since, in the first place, by a presumption of power it virtually removes the limitation as to the exercise of the power which the statute created, and further, as the necessary result of the onus of proof which the cont ruction sustained, the remedial purposes of the statute were either wholly negatived or in any event greatly perverted.\n It is indeed true that in the opinion on the first hearing below and in the argument at bar a suggestion was made that as in the particular instance the importer had become an actor seeking to question the reliquidation, he thereby, as an actor, assumed the burden of proof as to the absence of fraud which would not have rested upon him under the statute had he retused to pay the duty resulting from the reliquidation and awaited action taken against him by the United States to enforce it. But as the court below expressly declared that the proceeding taken \n\n[250 U.S. 355, 359]\n\u00a0\n was appropriate to resist the result of the reliquidation, if illegal, it cannot be that the right to correct the wrong was lost by resort to the remedy appropriate for its correction.\n Moreover the proposition can alone rest upon the assumption that the limitation on power which the statute imposed was ephemeral while from the text it is certain that fit was permanent and controlling. The cogency of this conclusion stands out in bold relief when it is considered that the remedial purpose of the statute was to protect the citizen from the unlimited power to reliquidate and the uncertainties affecting commercial transactions resulting from the existence of such power. The inevitable result of the argument is to cast upon the citizen the perpetual burden of showing that he had not been guilty of wrong as the only means of escaping the exercise against him of the unlimited power to reliquidate which it was the purpose of the statute to prevent.\n It is contended that although it be admitted that the statute was wrongly construed below, nevertheless the reliquidation should be now sustained because there was adequate proof in the record to show the existence of fraud which justified the reliquidation order without reference to the presumption upon which the court below based its conclusion. We do not, however, think this view can be sustained, since the erroneous ruling as to the statute dominates the entire situation and exacts that the question of the existence of the fraud necessary to give rise to the power to reliquidate should be disposed of by the tribunals peculiarly competent to consider such question, disembarrassed from any mistaken construction as to the presumption created by the statute.\n It follows that the judgment of the Court of Customs Appeals must be and it is reversed and the cases remanded to the Board of General Appraisers for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n And it is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","82":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFARSON, SON & CO. v. BIRD(1919)\nNo. 54\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. Giles William Lawrence Smith, of Brewton, Ala., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Ray Rushton, of Montgomery, Ala., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n But a single question is required to be decided. We state the case only to the extent essential to make this clear and to elucidate the issue to be considered.\n In 1905 and 1907 the county of Shelby contracted to build and furnish a courthouse. It was stipulated that the price for the work should be evidenced by interest-bearing warrants, maturing during a series of years. By the Constitution and laws of Alabama the power of taxation \n\n[248 U.S. 268, 269]\n\u00a0\n of the county for general purposes was limited, but, in addition, the Constitution and laws authorized counties to levy annually a special tax of one-fourth of 1 per cent. to be applied to the erection or repair of county buildings, the construction of roads, bridges, etc. The warrants under the contract were in terms secured by an agreement of the county to levy this one-fourth of 1 per cent. tax annually and apply it to the payment of the warrants. The state law contained a provision authorizing the registry of county warrants and making such registration operate as a lien on the proceeds of the taxes dedicated to the payment of the warrants. The courthouse was completed, furnished, and accepted, and the warrants were issued in conformity with the contract and according to law.\n In 1916 Farson, Son & Co., alleging themselves to be holders of warrants issued under the contract as above stated, filed their suit for mandamus against the county treasurer. The petition alleged the contract for the courthouse and averred that the board of revenue of the county, the governing body which had succeeded to the county commissioners previously in authority, while continuing the levy of the one-fourth of 1 per cent. tax, had in impairment of the obligation of the courthouse contract, dedicated the proceeds of that tax, as collected, to roads or bridges, thus depriving the warrant holders under the courthouse contract of the means of payment to which they were entitled. It was alleged that, in consequence of such action, the county treasurer had refused to pay any of the proceeds of the one-fourth of 1 per cent. tax to the courthouse warrant holders, and had, in further violation of his duty, credited the same to other funds and paid them out accordingly. It was moreover charged that the treasurer had in his hands, despite such wrongful payments to others, the sum of about $7,000, derived from the one-fourth of 1 per cent. tax collected in 1915, which it was \n\n[248 U.S. 268, 270]\n\u00a0\n his duty to apply as far as necessary to the discharge of a sum of $1,565, with interest, due on the courthouse warrants, and which he had refused to pay although demand had been made on him to do so. The petition expressly counted upon the protection of the contract rights which it asserted, not only by the Constitution of the state but also by the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States, alleging impairment thereof by action of the board of revenue, legislative in character; and the prayer was that the county treasurer be mandamused to pay out of the one-fourth of 1 per cent. tax for 1915 in his hands the sum of $1,565, with interest. A demurrer to the petition, as stating no cause for relief, was sustained, and the case is before us upon the ground of the deprivation of federal right which arose from the action of the court below in affirming the trial court.\n The court below conceded that under the state law mandamus was appropriate if the county treasurer had capacity to stand in judgment. It moreover conceded that, if the contract had been entered into as alleged, the attempt to violate it by dedicating the proceeds of the one-fourth of 1 per cent. tax to any purpose other than to the payment of courthouse warrants was, in so far as such proceeds were necessary to pay said warrants, void as an impairment of the obligation of a contract forbidden both by the state Constitution and that of the United States. But from these premises it nevertheless decided that there was no right to the mandamus against the county treasurer. It rested its conclusion on provisions of the state Constitution and laws, which it held defined the duty of that officer and absolutely deprived him of all power to apply or pay money coming into his hands by taxation levied for a particular purpose to another and different purpose. It decided, therefore, that if under the theory that the board of revenue had wrongly directed the appropriation of the one-fourth of 1 per cent. tax, action \n\n[248 U.S. 268, 271]\n\u00a0\n against that body and not merely against the county treasurer was appropriate and necessary under the state law. The court said:\n'If the facts alleged in this petition are true, they [the courthouse warrant holders] ought to have relief, and the county to be required to carry out its contract, or to answer in damages for the breach thereof, if the contract was valid and binding; but the relief must be had by different proceedings and against different officers, or the county itself, and not against the county treasurer. Mandamus may be petitioners' remedy, but under the facts alleged it must be against different officers than the county treasurer.' 197 Ala. 384, 72 South. 550.\n\n Thus resting its decision exclusively upon the question of procedure and the power of the particular officer against whom the mandamus was asked as limited and defined by the state law, we see no basis for the contention that the action of the state court gave effect to the impairment of the obligation of a contract in violation of the contract clause of the Constitution. On the contrary, we are of opinion that when correctly tested it becomes apparent that the action of the court below involved only a ruling upon a question of remedy resting upon considerations of state law broad enough to sustain the conclusion reached without any reference to the federal questions which were raised and relied upon.\n And any possible doubt on this subject, we are of opinion, is removed by the subsequent action of the court below in the case of Board of Revenue of Shelby County v. Farson, Son & Co., 197 Ala. 375, 72 South. 613, L. R. A. 1918B, 881, cited in the brief of the plaintiff in error. In that case, which was an action against the board of revenue of Shelby county to compel the levy of the one-fourth of 1 per cent. tax, as provided in the courthouse contract, for the purpose of paying, not only certain warrants which were past due in 1916, but to provide for the warrants falling due in 1917, the court \n\n[248 U.S. 268, 272]\n\u00a0\n awarded the mandamus sought. In doing so, it not only held that the courthouse contract was valid and that the agreement to levy the tax as therein stipulated was lawful, but, moreover, that the subsequent action of the board of revenue in diverting the fund to the detriment of the courthouse warrant holders was an impairment of the obligations of the contract and was void because of repugnancy to the Constitution of the state and to the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States.\n It is true, indeed, that in that case the court referred to its ruling in this case with approval, but the relief which was denied in the one and afforded in the other leaves no support upon which to rest the contention that contract rights secured by the Constitution were impaired by the ruling which was made in this case.\n As our conclusion is that the federal question relied upon as the basis for the writ of error had no foundation, it follows that our decree must be, and it is,\n Writ of error dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","83":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFILLIPPON v. ALBION VEIN SLATE CO.(1919)\nNo. 241\nArgued: March 18, 1919Decided: May 19, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 76, 77]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Calvin F. Smith and J. Willard Paff, both of Easton, Pa., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Ralph B. Evans and Frank P. Prichard, both of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves an important question of trial practice. It was an action brought by Fillippon, a citizen of Italy and a subject of the King of Italy, against the Slate Company, a Pennsylvania corporation doing business in that state, to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by plaintiff while in the employ of defendant, due as alleged to the negligence of defendant's foreman or superintendent under whom plaintiff was working. The grounds of negligence alleged were the failure to furnish a reasonably safe place for the work, failure to warn plaintiff of latent dangers of the work and the dangerous method of doing it, and specifically that plaintiff was directed to do the work in a particular manner under orders and \n\n[250 U.S. 76, 78]\n\u00a0\n instructions of defendant's foreman, to which plaintiff was bound to conform. There was a general plea of not guilty and a trial by jury. The evidence showed that the occurrence took place July 31, 1914, while plaintiff was at work in an open quarry under the direction of a foreman or superintendent and as one of a gang consisting of four quarrymen or blockmen besides plaintiff who assisted them as an ordinary laborer or 'rubbish hand.' It appeared that by the usual method of work, with which plaintiff was familiar, after a block of slate has been blasted out it is raised by crowbars and by wedges of wood or iron placed beneath it, in order that chains may be placed about it to which the hoisting tackle is made fast. In case the block is small the wedges are placed by the workman's hand; it not being necessary to insert them beyond the edge of the block. In case of large blocks, the wedges are put in by hand so far as this can be done without placing the hand beneath the block, and then a stick or the handle of a tool is employed in order to push the wedge farther in, the workman being thus protected from injury in case the stone should happen to slip or drop. Plaintiff's duty as rubbish hand was that of a general utility man, expected to do whatever the foreman or superintendent might direct. On the occasion in question a large block had been blasted out and was being raised in order that chains might be put about it. Plaintiff was assisting, and had inserted a wedge as far as he could push it without putting his hand beneath the stone, but it was necessary that the wedge should be pushed further in, and he, being afraid that if he did this with his hand the block might fall upon his arm, told the foreman or superintendent that he wanted to get something with which to push the wedge. Instead of consenting, the foreman ordered him to 'go ahead, go ahead,' and in obedience to this he put his right hand beneath the block, when with a sudden movement the block came down on \n\n[250 U.S. 76, 79]\n\u00a0\n his arm and crushed it so that amputation was necessary.\n The trial judge submitted the question of defendant's negligence and of plaintiff's contributory negligence to the jury, saying in his principal charge, among other things:\n'When a man accepts employment, he assumes with it the ordinary risk incident to such employment, and if you find the circumstances or situation in which the plaintiff found himself at the time of the accident, or that his performance leading up to the injury was of ordinary occurrence, then you may conclude that he had assumed the risk of the accident that has befallen him, and he cannot recover; but on his part it is contended that the situation in which he found himself at the time when the slate block was suspended or lifted by the men was of an extraordinary character, that the plaintiff when about to place the iron wedge found the stone or block large, and threatening danger, as he believed, whereupon he was suddenly and hastily summoned and directed to act by the foreman, whereupon he had but little or no time to judge of his own safety, and yielding to the judgment of his superior he acted. Now, if you find the facts as contended for by the plaintiff, I will ask you to say whether he was guilty of contributory negligence under the circumstances. Could he have protected or saved himself by the use or exercise of ordinary care? If he is to blame in part, or has in any manner contributed to his injury, he is not entitled to your verdict. The rule in negligence cases is that, while the defendant is held to exercise due and reasonable care under the circumstances, the plaintiff is also held to exercise the same degree of care, and if he does not do so, he cannot recover. Of course, if the master gives positive orders to go on with the work, under perilous circumstances, the servant may recover for an injury thus incurred, if the work was not inevitably or imminently dangerous. If the danger was \n\n[250 U.S. 76, 80]\n\u00a0\n imminent that faced the plaintiff, and he in the face of it did the thing that he knew, as a reasonably careful man, under the circumstances, was dangerous, he is guilty of contributory negligence and cannot recover.'\n\n The bill of exceptions shows that after the trial judge had completed his instructions and the jury had retired for deliberation, and while they were deliberating, the jury sent to the judge the following written inquiry:\n'Whether the plaintiff in pushing the wedge beneath the block of slate with his hand, having full knowledge of the risk involved, thereby became guilty of contributory negligence, even though told by Foreman Davis to 'push it under.\"\n\n To which the trial judge replied by sending the following written instruction to the jury room, in the absence of the parties and their counsel, without their consent, and without calling the jury in open court:\n'If he was told to put it under as stated by the plaintiff and he did so, fully appreciating at the time the danger attending and having sufficient time to consider, when he was face to face with a situation that would have made a reasonably prudent man to disobey the orders of the foreman, notwithstanding, and he went ahead in spite of the dangers known to him and apparent, he is guilty of contributory negligence.'\n\n To this action of the court plaintiff excepted at the first opportunity upon grounds that raise two questions: (a) Whether it was erroneous to give this supplementary instruction in the absence of the parties and without calling the jury in open court; and (b) whether the instruction so given was erroneous.\n The jury having returned a verdict in favor of defendant, and a motion for a new trial having been denied, the resulting judgment was brought under the review of the Circuit Court of Appeals and there affirmed. Fillipon v. Albion Vein Slate Co., 242 Fed. 258, 155 C. C. A. 98. Thereupon this writ of certiorari was allowed. \n\n[250 U.S. 76, 81]\n\u00a0\n We entertain no doubt that the orderly conduct of a trial by jury, essential to the proper protection of the right to be heard, entitles the parties who attend for the purpose to be present in person or by counsel at all proceedings from the time the jury is impaneled until it is discharged after rendering the verdict. Where a jury has retired to consider of their verdict, and supplementary instructions are required, either because asked for by the jury or for other reasons, they ought to be given either in the presence of counsel or after notice and an opportunity to be present; and written instructions ought not to be sent to the jury without notice to counsel and an opportunity to object. Under ordinary circumstances, and wherever practicable, the jury ought to be recalled to the courtroom, where counsel are entitled to anticipate, and bound to presume, in the absence of notice to the contrary, that all proceedings in the trial will be had. In this case the trial court erred in giving a supplementary instruction to the jury in the absence of the parties and without affording them an opportunity either to be present or to make timely objection to the instruction. See Stewart v. Wyoming Ranche Co., \n128 \nU.S. 389, 390\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 101; Aerheart v. St. Louis, I. M. & S. Ry. Co., 99 Fed. 907, 910, 40 C. C. A. 171; Yates v. Whyel Coke Co., 221 Fed. 603, 608, 137 C. C. A. 327; and many decisions of the state courts collated in 17 L. R. A. (N. S.) 609; note to State of North Dakota v. Murphy, 17 N. D. 48, 115 N. W. 84, 16 Ann. Cas. 1133\n\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals considered that the jury had asked a plain question in writing concerning a matter of law, and the judge had answered it in writing plainly and accurately, and were of the opinion that since nothing else had occurred-the question and answer having been preserved of record and counsel having been promptly notified of what had taken place and given the opportunity of excepting to the substance of the instruction and to the manner of giving it-no harm had been done, and none \n\n[250 U.S. 76, 82]\n\u00a0\n was probable to arise under like circumstances, and hence affirmed the judgment.\n It is not correct, however, to regard the opportunity of afterwards excepting to the instruction and to the manner of giving it as equivalent to an opportunity to be present during the proceedings. To so hold would be to overlook the primary and essential function of an exception, which is to direct the mind of the trial judge to the point in which it is supposed that he has erred in law, so that he may reconsider it and change his ruling if convinced of error, and that injustice and mistrials due to inadvertent errors may thus be obviated. United States v. U. S. Fidelity Co., \n236 \nU.S. 512, 529\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 298; Guerini Stone Co. v. Carlin Construction Co., \n248 \nU.S. 334, 348\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 102.\n And of course in jury trials erroneous rulings are presumptively injurious, especially those embodied in instructions to the jury; and they furnish ground for reversal unless it affirmatively appears that they were harmless.\n In this case, so far from the supplementary instruction being harmless, in our opinion it was erroneous and calculated to mislead the jury in that it excluded a material element that needed to be considered in determining whether plaintiff should be held guilty of contributory negligence under the particular hypothesis referred to in the jury's question.\n The case was governed by the law of Pennsylvania, where the injury was received and the trial took place. Rev. Stat.  721 (Comp. St.  1538). The law of that state, as it stood when the cause of action arose,1 is expressed in repeated decisions of its court of last resort to the following effect:\n'Where the servant, in obedience to the requirement of the master, incurs the risk of machinery, which though dangerous, is not so much so as to threaten immediate injury, or where it is reasonably probable it may be safely \n\n[250 U.S. 76, 83]\n\u00a0\n USED BY EXTRAORDINARY CAUTION OR SKILL, the rule is different. in such case the master is liable for a resulting accident.'\n\n And with reference to the particular circumstances of the case there under consideration:\n'If the defect was so great that obviously, with the use of the utmost skill and care, the danger was imminent, so much so that none but a reckless man would incur it, the employer would not be liable.' Patterson v. Pittsburg & Connellsville R. R. Co., 76 Pa. 389, 394 (18 Am. Rep. 412).\n\n'If the master gives the servant to understand that he does not consider the risk one which a prudent person should refuse to undertake, the servant has a right to rely upon his master's judgment, unless his own is so clearly opposed thereto that, in fact, he does not rely upon his master's opinion. A servant is not called upon to set up his own unaided judgment against that of his superiors, and he may rely upon their advice and still more upon their orders, notwithstanding many misgivings of his own. The servant's dependent and inferior position is to be taken into consideration; and if the master gives him positive orders to go on with the work, under perilous circumstances, the servant may recover for an injury thus incurred, if the work was not inevitably and imminently dangerous.' Williams v. Clark, 204 Pa. 416, 418, 54 Atl. 315, 316.\n\n To the same effect, Glew v. Railways Co., 234 Pa. 238, 242, 243, 83 Atl. 101; Moleskey v. South Fork Coal Mining Co., 247 Pa. 434, 437, 438, 93 Atl. 485.\n In the present case the trial judge recognized this to be the applicable rule of law when originally instructing the jury, for he said:\n'Of course, if the master gives positive orders to go on with the work, under perilous circumstances, the servant may recover for an injury thus in curred, if the work was not inevitably or imminently dangerous.'\n\n But this was neutralized, and the jury probably led astray, when in the supplementary instruction they were told, in effect, that if, when plaintiff obeyed the foreman's order by putting the wedge beneath the heavy \n\n[250 U.S. 76, 84]\n\u00a0\n block of slate with his hand, he fully appreciated the attendant danger and had sufficient time to consider, and if the situation was such as would have made a reasonably prudent man disobey the order, and he went ahead in spite of the dangers known to him and apparent, he was guilty of contributory negligence. The effect of this was to bar a recovery if the plaintiff knew of the attendant danger, although he did not know or have reason to suppose that the danger was inevitable or imminent, that is, immediately threatening. We suppose it hardly could have been a point in dispute that plaintiff knew that the operation of pushing the wedge beneath a large block of slate with his hand was dangerous, for he was familiar with the work, knew what safeguard was customarily taken against this danger, expressed a fear of it upon the particular occasion, and requested time to get an implement to be used for his safety according to the custom. It was at this precise moment, according to the testimony, that the foreman or superintendent told him to 'go ahead, go ahead'; and under the Pennsylvania decisions he was entitled to rely upon the judgment and order of his superior if the work was not inevitably and imminently dangerous; that is, threatening immediate injury upon the particular occasion. The jury very reasonably might conclude that neither plaintiff nor the foreman believed or had reason to believe that the work was inevitably and imminently dangerous; but if it was not, he was entitled, under the Pennsylvania decisions, to hold his employer responsible for the consequences of what he did under peremptory orders of the foreman, although he (the plaintiff) fully appreciated THE GENERAL DANGERS, HAD TIME TO CONSIDER, and went ahead notwithstanding.\n The judgment under review will be reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Workmen's Compensation Act of 1915, Pa.

Rogers, of Tulsa, Okl., W. O. Cromwell and George W. Buckner, both of Enid, Okl., and J. D. Simms, of Muskogee, Okl., for plaintiffs in error. \n\n[248 U.S. 399, 400]\n\u00a0\n Mr. S. P. Freeling, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question in the case is whether land allotted to an Indian of the Creek Tribe exempt from taxation in the hands of the Indian is exempt in the hands of a purchaser from the Indian.\n Considering that the land was so exempt, in other words, that the exemption went with the land, in subsequent hands, the suit was commenced by plaintiffs in error, here called plaintiffs, to restrain the collection of taxes upon part of the land which had become lots in the town of Muskogee. There was a demurrer to the petition by defendant in error, here called defendant, which by stipulation of counsel was submitted solely on the question of exemption, other questions being reserved.\n The stipulation recited that plaintiffs sought an injunction against the taxes assessed or hereafter assessed against the lots for the reason that they had been a part of the homestead of Eliza J. Murphy, a Creek Indian allottee and a citizen and member of the Creek Tribe or Nation and for that reason the lots were exempt from taxation for the period of 21 years from the date of the deed or patent.\n The District Court overruled the demurrer and enjoined the collection of the taxes. The judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court (Board of County Com'rs of Muskogee County v. Fink, 159 Pac. 470), and the plaintiffs then \n\n[248 U.S. 399, 401]\n\u00a0\n dismissed their petition as to all other grounds of relief than that the taxes 'were illegal and void because prohibited by the contract, Constitution, laws and treaties of the United States.'\n A petition for rehearing was denied and a judgment entered sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the petition.\n The elements of decision are certain acts of Congress, the deed to Eliza J. Murphy, her deed to plaintiffs, and certain provisions in the Constitution of the state of Oklahoma.\n The lands of which the lots involved were a part were allotted to Eliza J. Murphy by virtue of the act of Congress of March 1, 1901, and that of June 30, 1902 (31 Stat. 861, c. 676; 32 Stat. 500, c. 1323). The latter act is known as the Creek Supplemental Agreement and provides ( section 16) that an allotment shall not be incumbered or subject to forced the for 5 years, except with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. And the section requires that each citizen of the tribe 'shall select from his allotment forty acres of land, or a quarter of a quarter section, as a homestead, which shall be and remain nontaxable, inalienable, and free from any incumbrance whatever for twenty-one years from the date of the deed therefor, and a separate deed shall be issued to each allottee for his homestead, in which this condition shall appear.'\n A deed was made to Eliza J. Murphy on April 20, 1903, and, following the statute, expressed the nontaxability and inalienability and freedom from incumbrance for the designated period of exemption.\n There were provisions in the Enabling Act of the state under which its Constitution was drawn which preserved the rights of persons and property of the Indians so long as such rights should remain unextinguished and provided that nothing in the Constitution should be construed to limit or affect the authority of the United States respecting \n\n[248 U.S. 399, 402]\n\u00a0\n the Indians, their lands, their property or their rights. And the Constitution exempted from taxation such property as might be exempt by reason of treaty stipulations existing between the Indians and the United States or by federal laws during the force and effect of such treaties and laws. Plaintiffs rely on these provisions and the deed to Eliza J. Murphy for their contentions, fortified, they assert, by decisions of this court.\n To the contentions defendant opposes the Act of Congress of May 27, 1908 (35 Stat. 312, c. 199,  4), which removed the existing restrictions on the homestead allotment, thereby enabling the allottee to sell the land, and which provides '... that all land from which restrictions have been or shall be removed shall be subject to taxation and all other civil burdens as though it were property of other citizens than allottees of the Five Civilized Tribes.'\n The contention based on this act is that by the Creek Supplemental Agreement, supra, the nontaxability and inalienability and freedom from incumbrance of the land were correlatives and to a certain extent, therefore, interdependent, a combination of limitations and rights, and as they existed together they disappeared together. And their coexistence depended upon the Indian and because it did there was no limitation or infringement of rights or impairment of contract. Plaintiffs, it is further contended, are in no better situation, as they only got title by virtue of the act of May 27, 1908, removing the restriction upon alienation and they cannot avail themselves of it and repudiate it at the same time.\n The Supreme Court of the state yielded to these contentions and gave special effect to the Act of 1908 which it considered 'a comprehensive revision of the laws relating to the Five Civilized Tribes and their lands,' that by it 'the free right of alienation was granted,' and as the plaintiffs 'took their title to the lots they are \n\n[248 U.S. 399, 403]\n\u00a0\n seeking to exempt from taxation by virtue of the terms of this act, they cannot go behind it. But for that act, they could not have purchased the lands in question. They took subject to all the conditions of that act, and they cannot now claim the benefits of the exemption from taxation granted to the allottee by the Creek Supplemental Agreement. Goudy v. Meath, \n203 U.S. 146\n [27 Sup. Ct. 48].'\n In resistance to the contentions of the defendant and the conclusions of the court, plaintiffs adduce Choate v. Trapp, \n224 U.S. 665\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 565, and certain cases decided upon its authority, that is, Gleason v. Wood, \n224 U.S. 679\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 571; English v. Richardson, \n224 U.S. 680\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 571.\n Choate v. Trapp has not the extent assigned to it. In that case the state of Oklahoma undertook to tax lands which were yet in the hands of the Indians, asserting the right simply because of the removal of the restrictions upon alienation by the Act of May 27, 1908, supra. The reply of this court was that the law (Curtis Act of June 28, 1898, 30 Stat. 505, c. 517), as modified by the Act of July 1, 1902 (32 Stat. 641, c. 1362), provided that all of the lands allotted should 'be nontaxable while the title remained in the original allottee.' There was no question in the case, and could not be, of the effect of alienation-an exercise of the right conferred by the Act of May 27, 1908, and the consequence of such exercise. It is true it was said that 'exemption and nonalienability were two separate and distinct subjects' and that 'one conferred a right and the other imposed a limitation.' The distinction was apt for that case. The state contended that there was no tax exemption but that that provision was only directed against the absolute alienation of the land. This was, in effect, a contention that the power of alienation unexercised, was the same as the power exercised, and to correct this confusion it was declared that the provision exempting from taxation was a property right. But it was a property right in the Indian, preserved to him not only \n\n[248 U.S. 399, 404]\n\u00a0\n for his own interest but in the interest of the policy of the United States regarding him. Kansas Indians, 5 Wall. 737; United States v. Rickert, \n188 U.S. 432\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 478; cases cited in Choate v. Trapp. At first his interest was put beyond his control; by the act of May 27, 1908, it was committed to his control, this also satisfying the policy of the United States under the changed conditions. It invades no right of the Indian, therefore, to make the alienation of the land a surrender of the exemption from taxation, and we concur in the conclusion of the Supreme Court of the state that plaintiffs, having taken title under the act, cannot repudiate its conditions and its manifest policy. New Jersey v. Wilson, 7 Cranch, 164, is not in point. We are not dealing with rights in the abstract; we are dealing with rights under special conditions and as determined by acts of the parties under a law of Congress which was availed of by the Indian and a grantee of the Indian, and which, therefore, bound them by its conditions and subjected the land in the hands of the grantee to the usual burdens of government. It is an error to suppose that this takes anything of value from the Indian. We may here invoke the commonplace, for it is commonplace to say that we only know the value of a thing by that which makes its worth. Under the restriction against the alienation the land had no worth but in its uses; the restriction removed, it had the added worth of exchangeability for other things-a power of sale was conferred. To say there was no value in that power is to contradict the examples and estimations of the world. It may be that if exemption from taxation went with the land it might become an element in the price (worth in money) which the Indian might ask and receive, but that was not of concern to the purpose of the law, which was to give to the Indian all of the attributes of ownership, to give him a mastery of his property equal to that of other owners of property, and nothing more, and this consummated the new policy of Congress. \n\n[248 U.S. 399, 405]\n\u00a0\n Further discussion we deem unnecessary, but we may observe that in Tiger v. Western Investment Co., \n221 \nU.S. 286, 310\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 578, and in Williams v. Johnson, \n239 \nU.S. 414, 420\n, 421 S., 36 Sup. Ct. 150, a question was intimated whether a grantee of an Indian could avail himself of the Indian's right, if he had any, to assert the unconstitutionality of an act of Congress. Opinion, however, was reserved, and we reserve it here, and rest the case on the grounds we have discussed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","85":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFISHER v. RULE(1919)\nNo. 78\nArgued: November 22, 1918Decided: January 7, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[248 U.S. 314, 315]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Homer Guerry, of Washington, D. C., and Allen G. Fisher, of Chadron, Neb., for appellant.\n Mr. Samuel Herrick, of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by Fisher to have Rule declared a trustee for him of the title to certain land in Nebraska, for which Rule holds a patent under the homestead law of the United States. Fisher lost in the District Court and its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 232 Fed. 861, 147 C. C. A. 55.\n The case presented by the record is as follows:\n In 1904, when the land was public land, a son of Rule applied for and secured a preliminary homestead entry thereof at the local land office. Under the ruling then and for many years prevailing in the land department he had six months within which to establish residence on the land. During the early part of that period he died intestate without establishing such residence. The father was the only heir and as such, according to the ruling then and theretofore prevailing in the land department, \n\n[248 U.S. 314, 316]\n\u00a0\n could acquire title under the son's entry without himself residing on the land. Shortly after the son's death he took possession under the entry, fenced the land, erected substantial buildings thereon, cultivated forty acres or more and pastured live stock on the remainder, but resided on an adjoining tract. In due course, after continuing his cultivation and improvements for five years, he submitted final proof at the local land office showing what he had done and made the payments required by law. In that connection his right to a patent was contested by one who, although making no claim to the land, insisted that the entry was extinguished ipso facto when the son died without establishing residence on the land, and that, if the entry was not thus extinguished, the father forfeited his rights thereunder by failing to make the land his own place of residence. The local officers held against the contestant and with the father, and that decision was affirmed by the Commissioner of the General Land Office. But when the matter came before the Secretary of the Interior that officer, conceiving that the settled rulings of the land department before noticed were not well grounded, sustained the insistence of the contestant, reversed the decisions of the local officers and the Commissioner and directed that the entry be cancelled. 42 L. D. 62, 64. The father sought to have the matter reconsidered and, while at first his efforts were unavailing, a rehearing ultimately was granted. On the rehearing, of which the contestant had timely notice, the Secretary recalled his first decision, adhered to the prior settled rulings, dismissed the contest and directed that the entry be reinstated. 43 L. D. 217. It was under that decision that the patent was issued.\n On receiving the usual notice of the Secretary's first decision the local officers complied therewith by cancelling the entry on their records. Fisher, who knew of the entry and the contest, then presented an application to \n\n[248 U.S. 314, 317]\n\u00a0\n enter the land as a homestead. The application, while disclosing that he was a minor and unmarried, asserted in a general way that he was the head of a family, and therefore a qualified applicant, by reason of having adopted a minor child. \n1\n The local officers called for a further showing respecting the asserted adoption and for the time being withheld action on the application. Before a further showing was made the Secretary of the Interior, who was being asked to reconsider his first decision, ordered a suspension of all action under that decision;2 and of this Fisher was advised by the local officers. Subsequently Fisher produced a court order purporting to show his adoption of a younger brother eighteen days after his homestead application was presented, but, by reason of the Secretary's suspending order, no further action was had on the application until after the Secretary's last decision, when the application was rejected. During the continuance of the suspending order, and without the consent of Rule, Fisher went on the land, erected improvements and attempted to establish a residence there.\n In no admissible view of these facts can this suit be sustained. Even if under a right construction of the homestead law Rule was not entitled to the patent-which we do not at all intimate-Fisher is not in a position to take advantage of the error. He cannot be heard to complain on behalf of the United States; and he has no such personal interest in the land as entitles him to complain on his own account. He acquired no right \n\n[248 U.S. 314, 318]\n\u00a0\n by his homestead application. It never was allowed; nor could it reasonably have been allowed. As originally presented it did not sufficiently show that he was a qualified applicant, and his additional showing-whatever else might be though of it-came after the suspending order had superseded the cancellation of the Rule entry and become an obstacle to the initiation of any adverse claim. Neither did he acquire any right by his attempted settlement after that order was made. The order was no less effective against that mode of initiating a claim than against the other. Its purpose was to preserve the status quo pending final action on the Rule entry. A settlement in opposition to such an order is nothing short of a trespass and confers no right under the public land laws. Lyle v. Patterson, \n228 \nU.S. 211, 216\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 480.\n It is a familiar rule that to succeed in such a suit the plaintiff 'must show a better right to the land than the patentee, such as in law should have been respected by the officers of the land department, and being respected, would have given him the patent.' It is not sufficient to show that the patentee ought not to have received the patent.' Sparks v. Pierce, \n115 \nU.S. 408, 413\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 102, 105 (29 L. Ed. 428); Smelting Co. v.

COLEMAN(1919)\nNo. 419\nArgued: Decided: June 2, 1919\n\n\n\n Messrs. Frederick T. Saussy, of Savannah, Ga., and A. S. Bradley, of Swainsboro, Ga., for appellant.\n Mr. F. H. Saffold, of Swainsboro, Ga., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the court.\n This case is here (Judicial Code,  238, Act March 3, 1911, c. 231 [ Comp. St.  1215]) solely upon a question of the jurisdiction of the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of Georgia to entertain the suit brought by R. A. Flanders, as trustee in bankruptcy of M. C. Coleman, against E. J. Coleman. \n\n[250 U.S. 223, 224]\n\u00a0\n Omitting unnecessary parts, the bill avers: That the jurisdiction of the court is invoked under sections 60b, 67e and 70e of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended. That in 1902 the said E. J. Coleman, the father of M. C. Coleman, owned a tract of land containing 377 acres in the state of Georgia, and placed his son, M. C. Coleman, the bankrupt, in possession thereof, expressing the intention to give the land to his son. M. C. Coleman cleared the land, moved on the same and lived thereon for a period of at least twelve years, and placed valuable improvements thereon. That M. C. Coleman rented as landlord said 377 acres to Dan Davis, rent notes of $ 1,000 each for the same being taken in the name of M. C. Coleman, payable on October 1, 1914, 1915, 1916, 1917, 1918, respectively. That M. C. Coleman collected the note maturing October 1, 1914, and that he became insolvent on December 1, 1914, and ever since that date, up to the time petition was filed, a  insolvent within the meaning and intent of the Bankruptcy Act. That while so insolvent, in January or February, 1915, M. C. Coleman turned over to E. J. Coleman four of said rent notes of the value of $4,000 with the intent to hinder, delay, and defraud his creditors. That if the conveyance of the said rent notes was not made with the purpose to hinder, delay and defraud creditors, the transfer had the effect to create a preference in favor of E. J. Coleman in that when the same was made M. C. Coleman was insolvent, and the collection thereof would enable E. J. Coleman to obtain a greater percentage of any indebtedness claimed to be owing to him by M. C. Coleman, than any other of such creditors of M. C. Coleman, of the same class. That said transfer was within four months from the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, the bankrupt was insolvent, and the transfer operated as a preference, and E. J. Coleman at the time of receiving the same had reasonable cause to believe that the same would effect a preference. That M. C. Coleman, up to December 1, \n\n[250 U.S. 223, 225]\n\u00a0\n 1914, had a good title to the said 377 acres of land, although it does not appear that a deed had ever been delivered from E. J. Coleman to M. C. Coleman. That E. J. Coleman placed M. C. Coleman in possession of the said land with the intention to give it to him, and the latter held possession of it as his own, and made improvements on it of great value, and dealt with the land as his own for the purpose of obtaining credit, and from said long possession the title to the land became vessted in M. C. Coleman. That at the time of the transfer of the rent notes to E. J. Coleman the legal title or right to the land was completely vested in M. C. Coleman as if he had obtained a deed from E. J. Coleman. The complaint adds a description of the improvements, a house, etc., adding, it is averred, $6, 400 to the value of the premises. That M. C. Coleman, by agreeing with E. J. Coleman to relinquish his rights and title to the real estate and improvements, in the year 1915, did so with intent to hinder, delay and defraud his creditors. The petition prays that the transfer of the four rent notes be declared void as being made with the intent to hinder, delay and defraud the creditors of M. C. Coleman. That the transfer of the notes be declared to be a preference, should the court hold or find that there is any indebtedness owing to E. J. Coleman by M. C. Coleman. That the notes collected by E. J. Coleman be accounted for. That any of said notes which may not have been collected, be decreed to be surrendered to petitioner. That the 377 acres of land be declared to be the property of the petitioner as trustee in bankruptcy for the purpose of applying the same to the credit of the creditors of the bankrupt. That in the event that the court should hold that the complainant should not have and receive the relief prayed for because of any defect in claimants' claim of title, that he be declared as such trustee to have an equitable lien or charge on the said land, at least to the extent of the value of the improvements. That the said \n\n[250 U.S. 223, 226]\n\u00a0\n E. J. Coleman be required to specifically perform his promise and agreement to convey title to the land to M. C. Coleman, and the title be made in the petitioner's name as trustee for the benefit of the creditors of the bankrupt. Afterwards the complainant filed an amendment to the bill in which it was alleged: That within the period of four months immediately preceding the filing of the bankruptcy proceedings by M. C. Coleman, to wit, in January, 1915, while insolvent, and with intent to hinder, delay and defraud his creditors, the said M. C. Coleman, who then held the title to the above-described real estate, fraudulently disclaimed such title, and surrendered possession thereof to E. J. Coleman, and thereby fraudulently transferred his rights, title, interests and equity in said real estate to E. J. Coleman, and transferred said rent notes with the purpose and intent to make the tenant the tenant of the respondent, and as such he has attorned.\n An answer was filed taking issue upon the allegations of the bill as to fraudulent transfers and conveyance, and making other allegations unnecessary to set out in detail. The cause was referred to a master, who took the evidence, and found that the District Court had jurisdiction, and that there was a fraudulent transfer, and advised a judgment in favor of the trustee. After considering the report of the master, the District Court made a final decree, finding: That, assuming for the purpose of the consideration of the question of jurisdiction, the testimony submitted by the complainant to be true, the court was without jurisdiction to make a decision on the merits of the controversy. And it was ordered and directed that the bill of complaint be dismissed without prejudice of the petitioner's right to maintain his action in a state court. The District Court also made a certificate stating: That the decree of dismissal was based solely upon the ground that the court was of opinion that it had no jurisdiction to \n\n[250 U.S. 223, 227]\n\u00a0\n grant any relief to the complainant, that, in reaching this determination, the court had considered the evidence of the complainant, assuming it to be true for that purpose, only, and that it did not show such a transfer within the meaning of the laws of Congress relating to bankruptcy as would give the court jurisdiction of the proceedings.\n Whether the District Court has jurisdiction to grant any relief must be determined upon a consideration of the allegations of the bill and the amendment thereto. If there be enough of substance in them to require the court to hear and determine the cause, then jurisdiction should have been entertained. Looking to the allegation of the bill and the amendment, as we have stated them, it appears that the trustee invoked the aid of section 60b of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended by Act Feb. 5, 1903, c. 487, 32 Stat. 799 (Comp. St.  9644), relating to preferential transfers made within four months before the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, also section 67e, 30 Stat. 564 (Comp. St.  9651) making fraudulent transfers within four months null and void, except as to persons acting in good faith, or for a present, fair consideration, and of section 70e of the act, 30 Stat. 566 (Comp. St.  9654) providing that the trustee may avoid any transfer of the bankrupt's property that any creditor might have avoided, and may recover the property, so transferred, or its value, from the person to whom it was transferred, unless he was a bona fide holder prior to the adjudication\n Since the amendments to the Bankruptcy Act of 1903 and June 25, 1910 ( 32 Stat. 797; 36 Stat. 838, c. 412) the District Courts of the United States are given concurrent jurisdiction with the state courts to set aside preferences under section 60b of the act, and fraudulent transfers within four months prior to the filing of the petition, under section 67e of the act, and transfers under section 70e, making void any transfer by the bankrupt of his property which any creditor might have avoided, and giving the trustee the right to recover the same. See Stellwagen v. Clum, \n245 \nU.S. 605, 614\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 215; Collett v. Adams, \n249 U.S. 545\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 372, decided April 28, 1919. \n\n[250 U.S. 223, 228]\n\u00a0\n The opinion of the District Court, as set forth in the record, shows that its conclusion that there was no jurisdiction was based upon a consideration of the evidence, from which it was found that no preference was shown under section 60b, nor any fraudulent transfer under sections 67e or 70e. To jutify its conclusion that it was without jurisdiction the District Judge cites certain decisions of this court. Bardes v. Hawarden Bank, \n178 U.S. 524\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 1000, in which this court held that under section 23 of the Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St.  9607) the District Court could by the consent of the defendant, and not otherwise, entertain suits by the trustee against third persons to recover property conveyed by the bankrupt before the institution of the bankruptcy proceedings. It is sufficient to say of that case that it was decided under the terms of the act before the amendments of 1903 and 1910, respectively, to which we have referred, and which give concurrent jurisdiction to the state and federal courts. The District Court also cited Harris, Trustee, v. Bank of Mt. Pleasant, \n216 U.S. 382\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 296, wherein no transfer of the bankrupt's property was alleged in the petition. The suit was one by the trustee to recover securities of the bankrupt, alleged to be held by the bank for the security of an overdraft which, it was averred, had been paid; and also to recover certain notes alleged to have been paid by the bankrupt.\n The opinion of the District Court shows that it really considered the merits of the case in reaching the conclusion that it was without jurisdiction. As this court has not infrequently said, jurisdiction must be determined not upon the conclusion on the merits of the action, but upon consideration of the grounds upon which federal jurisdiction is invoked.\n Much of the brief of counsel is taken up with a discussion as to whether the alleged transfers amount to a conveyance under the Georgia statutes and decisions. This discussion is pertinent to the merits, our sole inquiry \n\n[250 U.S. 223, 229]\n\u00a0\n concerns the jurisdiction of the court. We are of opinion that there was enough alleged to properly invoke jurisdiction, and that the charges of fraudulent transfers of the rent notes, and of interests in real estate, were sufficiently made to bring the action within the jurisdiction of the District Court under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act. In this view the judgment of the District Court dismissing the action for want of jurisdiction is\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","87":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFLEXNER v. FARSON(1919)\nNo. 101\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. J. S. Laurent, of Louisville, Ky., for plaintiff in error.[ Flexner v. Farson \n248 U.S. 289\n (1919) ]\n\n\n[248 U.S. 289, 292]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Harry P. Weber and George W. Miller, both of Chicago, Ill., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action brought by the plaintiff in error upon a judgment for money rendered by a Kentucky Court. The declaration alleges that the transaction in respect of which the judgment was rendered took place at Louisville, Kentucky, and that at that time the defendants were doing business there as partners through Washington Flexner, who was and continued to be their agent until the time of this suit. It further alleges that the defendants were non-residents and that the service of summons of the Kentucky suit was made upon Washington Flexner in accordance with a Kentucky statute (Civ. Code Prac.  51) authorizing it to be made in that way. The defendant William Farson was the only one served with process in the present action and he pleaded that the defendants in the former suit did not reside in Kentucky, were not served with process and did not appear; that Washington Flexner was not their agent at the time of service upon him; that the Kentucky statute relied upon was unconstitutional; that the Kentucky Court had no jurisdiction, and that its judgment was void under the Constitution of the United States. The plaintiff demurred to the pleas, and stood upon his demurrer when it was overruled, whereupon judgment was entered for the defendants. There was an appeal to the Supreme Court of the State on the ground that the Court below did not give full faith and credit to the Kentucky judgment and erred in holding the Kentucky statute as to service unconstitutional. The Supreme Court affirmed the judg \n\n[248 U.S. 289, 293]\n\u00a0\n ment below. 268 Ill. 435, 109 N. E. 327, Ann. Cas. 1916D, 810. The same errors are alleged here.\n It is argued that the pleas tacitly admit that Washington Flexner was agent of the firms at the time of the transaction sued upon in Kentucky, and the Kentucky statute is construed as purporting to make him agent to receive service in suits arising out of the business done in that State. On this construction it is said that the defendants by doing business in the State consented to be bound by the service prescribed. The analogy of suits against insurance companies based upon such service is invoked. Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association v. Phelps, \n190 U.S. 147\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 707. But the consent that is said to be implied in such cases is a mere fiction, founded upon the accepted doctrine that the States could exclude foreign corporations altogether, and therefore could establish this obligation as a condition to letting them in. Lafayette Ins. Co. v. French, 18 How. 404; Pennsylvania Fire Ins. Co. v. Gold Issue Mining & Milling Co., \n243 \nU.S. 93, 96\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 344. The State had no power to exclude the defendants and on that ground without going farther the Supreme Court of Illinois rightly held that the analogy failed, and that the Kentucky judgment was void. If the Kentucky statute purports to have the effect attributed to it, it cannot have that effect in the present case. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Dunlevy, \n241 \nU.S. 518, 522\n, 523 S., 36 Sup.

Lindquist, of Kansas City, Mo., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. John Lord O'Brian, of Buffalo, N. Y., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an indictment in thirteen counts. The first alleges a conspiracy between the plaintiff in error and one Carl Gleeser, they then being engaged in the preparation and publication of a newspaper, the Missouri Staats Zeitung, to violate the Espionage Act of June 15, 1917, c. 30,  3, 40 Stat. 217, 219 (Comp. St. 1918,  10212c). It alleges as overt acts the preparation and circulation of twelve articles &c. in the said newspaper at different dates from July 6, 1917, to December 7 of the same year. The other counts allege attempts to cause disloyalty, mutiny and refusal of duty in the military and naval forces of the United States, by the same publications, each count being confined to the publication of a single date. Motion to dismiss and a demurrer on constitutional and other grounds, especially that of the First Amendment as to free speech, were overruled, subject to exception, and the defendant refusing to plead the Court ordered a plea of not guilty to be filed. There was a trial and Frohwerk was found guilty on all \n\n[249 U.S. 204, 206]\n\u00a0\n the counts except the seventh, which needs no further mention. He was sentenced to a fine and to ten years imprisonment on each count, the imprisonment on the later counts to run concurrently with that on the first.\n Owing to unfortunate differences no bill of exceptions is before us. Frohwerk applied to this Court for leave to file a petition for a writ of mandamus requiring the judge to sign a proper bill of exceptions, but a case was not stated that would warrant the issuing of the writ and leave was denied. United States ex rel. Frohwerk v. Youmans (December 16, 1918) \n248 U.S. 540\n, 39 Sup. Ct 132, 63 L. Ed. --. The absence of a bill of exceptions and the suggestions in the application for mandamus have caused us to consider the case with more anxiety than if it presented only the constitutional question which was the theme of the principal argument here. With regard to that argument we think it necessary to add to what has been said in Schenck v. United States, \n249 U.S. 47\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 247, only that the First Amendment while prohibiting legislation against free speech as such cannot have been, and obviously was not, intended to give immunity for every possible use of language. Robertson v. Baldwin, \n165 \nU.S. 275, 281\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 326. We venture to believe that neither Hamilton nor Madison, nor any other competent person then or later, ever supposed that to make criminal the counselling of a murder within the jurisdiction of Congress would be an unconstitutional interference with free speech.\n Whatever might be thought of the other counts on the evidence, if it were before us, we have decided in Schenck v. United States, that a person may be convicted of a conspiracy to obstruct recruiting by words of persuasion. The Government argues that on the record the question is narrowed simply to the power of Congress to punish such a conspiracy to obstruct, but we shall take it in favor of the defendant that the publications set forth as overt acts were the only means and, when coupled with the joint activity in producing them, the only evidence of \n\n[249 U.S. 204, 207]\n\u00a0\n the conspiracy alleged. Taking it that way, however, so far as the language of the article goes there is not much to choose between expressions to be found in them and those before us in Schenck v. United States.\n The first begins by declaring it a monumental and inexcusable mistake to send our soldiers to France, says that it comes no doubt from the great trusts, and later that it appears to be outright murder without serving anything practical; speaks of the unconquerable spirit and undiminished strength of the German nation, and characterizes its own discourse as words of warning to the American people. Then comes a letter from one of the counsel who argued here, stating that the present force is a part of the regular army raised illegally; a matter discussed at length in his voluminous brief, on the ground that before its decision to the contrary the Solicitor General misled this Court as to the law. Later, on August 3, came discussion of the causes of the war, laying it to the administration and saying 'that a few men and corporations might amass unprecedented fortunes we sold our honor, our very soul' with the usual repetition that we went to war to protect the loans of Wall Street. Later, after more similar discourse, comes 'We say therefore, cease firing.'\n Next, on August 10, after deploring 'the draft riots in Oklahoma and elsewhere' in language that might be taken to convey an innuendo of a different sort, it is said that the previous talk about legal remedies is all very well for those who are past the draft age and have no boys to be drafted, and the paper goes on to give a picture, made as moving as the writer was able to make it, of the sufferings of a drafted man, of his then recognizing that his country is not in danger and that he is being sent to a foreign land to fight in a cause that neither he nor any one else knows anything of, and reaching the conviction that this is but a war to protect some rich men's money. \n\n[249 U.S. 204, 208]\n\u00a0\n Who then, it is asked, will pronounce a verdict of guilty upon him if he stops reasoning and follows the first impulse of nature: self-preservation; and further, whether, while technically he is wrong in his resistance, he is not more sinned against than sinning; and yet again whether the guilt of those who voted the unnatural sacrifice is not greater than the wrong of those who now seek to escape by illadvised resistance. On August 17 there is quoted and applied to our own situation a remark to the effect that when rulers scheme to use it for their own aggrandizement loyalty serves to perpetuate wrong. On August 31 with more of the usual discourse, it is said that the sooner the public wakes up to the fact that we are led and ruled by England, the better; that our sons, our taxes and our sacrifices are only in the interest of England. On September 28 there is a sneering contrast between Lord Northcliffe and other Englishmen spending many hundreds of thousands of dollars here to drag us into the war and Count Bernstorff spending a few thousand to maintain peace between his own country and us. Later follow some compliments to Germany and a statement that the Central powers are carrying on a defensive war. There is much more to the general effect that we are in the wrong and are giving false and hypocritical reasons for our course, but the foregoing is enough to indicate the kind of matter with which we have to deal.\n It may be that all this might be said or written even in time of war in circumstances that would not make it a crime. We do not lose our right to condemn either measures or men because the country is at war. It does not appear that there was any special effort to reach men who were subject to the draft; and if the evidence should show that the defendant was a poor man, turning out copy for Gleeser, his employer, at less than a day laborer's pay, for Gleeser to use or reject as he saw fit, in a newspaper of small circulation, there would be a natural in \n\n[249 U.S. 204, 209]\n\u00a0\n clination to test every question of law to be found in the record very thoroughly before upholding the very severe penalty imposed. But we must take the case on the record as it is, and on that record it is impossible to say that it might not have been found that the circulation of the paper was in quarters where a little breath would be enough to kindle a flame and that the fact was known and relied upon by those who sent the paper out. Small compensation would not exonerate the defendant if it were found that he expected the result, even if pay were his chief desire. When we consider that we do not know how strong the Government's evidence may have been we find ourselves unable to say that the articles could not furnish a basis for a conviction upon the first count at least. We pass therefore to the other points that are raised.\n It is said that the first count is bad because it does not allege the means by which the conspiracy was to be carried out. But a conspiracy to obstruct recruiting would be criminal even if no means were agreed upon specifically by which to accomplish the intent. It is enough if the parties agreed to set to work for that common purpose. That purpose could be accomplished or aided by persuasion as well as by false statements, and there was no need to allege that false reports were intended to be made or made. It is argued that there is no sufficient allegation of intent, but intent to accomplish an object cannot be alleged more clearly than by stating that parties conspired to accomplish it. The overt acts are alleged to have been done to effect the object of the conspiracy and that is sufficient under section 4 of the Act of 1917 (Comp. St. 1918,  10212d ). Countenance we believe has been given by some Courts to the notion that a single count in an indictment for conspiring to commit two offences is bad for duplicity. This Court has given it none. Buckeye Powder Co. v. E. I. Dupont de Nemours Powder Co., \n248 \nU.S. 55, 60\n, 61 S., 39 Sup. Ct. 38; Joplin Mercantile Co. v. United \n\n[249 U.S. 204, 210]\n\u00a0\n States, \n236 \nU.S. 531, 548\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 291. The conspiracy is the crime, and that is one, however diverse its objects. Some reference was made in the proceedings and in argument to the provision in the Constitution concerning treason, and it was suggested on the one hand that some of the matters dealt with in the Act of 1917 were treasonable and punishable as treason or not at all, and on the other that the acts complained of not being treason could not be punished. These suggestions seem to us to need no more than to be stated. The amendment of the Act of 1917 in 1918 (Act May 16, 1918, c. 75) did not affect the present indictment. Schenck v. United States. Without pursuing the matter further we are of opinion that the indictment must stand.\n Before the demurrer was disposed of the Court had ordered jurymen to be summoned to serve for the April term of the Court and to report for service on June 25, 1918, as of course it might. The demurrer was overruled on June 24, and on the following day the plea of not guilty was ordered to be entered, a continuance was refused, a jury was empannelled and the trial set to begin the next morning. There is nothing before us that makes it possible to say that the judge's discretion was wrongly exercised. Upon the whole case we are driven to the conclusion that the record shows no ground upon which the judgment can be reversed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","89":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFULLINWIDER v. SOUTHERN PAC R. CO. OF CALIFORNIA(1919)\nNo. 121\nArgued: Decided: January 13, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. Fred Beall, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Messrs. Charles R. Lewers and William F. Herrin, both of San Francisco, Cal., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals affirming a decree of the District Court in and for the Southern District of California dismissing bill upon demurrer brought by appellant (we shall refer to him as complainant) against the railroad company to compel the \n\n[248 U.S. 409, 410]\n\u00a0\n company to convey to him a certain one-half section of land within the limits of the congressional grant to the company made by the Act of March 3, 1871, c. 122, 16 Stat. 573.\n The bill alleged the incorporation of the company and that of various corporations impleaded with it, and the following facts: March 3, 1871, Congress made a grant to the Texas Pacific Railroad Company of certain sections of the public lands and provided that the lands which should not be sold or otherwise disposed of within three years after the completion of the entire road should be subject to settlement and pre-emption like other lands at a price to be fixed by and paid to the company at not exceeding an average of $2.50 per acre for all of the lands granted.\n Section 23 of the act made a further grant of certain sections of the public lands in the State of California to the Southern Pacific Railroad and contained the provision that the company should construct a line of railroad from and to certain named points, 'with the same rights, grants, and privileges and subject to the same limitations, restrictions, and conditions as were granted to said Southern Pacific Railroad Company of California by the Act of July 27, 1866.'\n The road was completed between the designated points more than ten years prior to the 1st of December, 1913\n\n\n Among the lands which have not been sold or disposed of that are within the limits of the grant are those described in the bill, and on October 29, 1913, complainant (appellant) tendered the company $800 and demanded of it and the other defendants (appellees) a conveyance of the land, which demand was refused, to the injury and damage of complainant. The land is of the value of $3,000 and complainant has the qualifications entitling him to purchase the land.\n Complainant offers to pay the $800 in court and alleges \n\n[248 U.S. 409, 411]\n\u00a0\n that the suit was brought, among other things, for the purpose of having the court interpret and construe the acts of Congress referred to. The other defendants are alleged to have an interest in the land and a construction of the acts of Congress is prayed and of all other acts that have any relation to them; that defendants be decreed to convey to complainant the land and that he have general relief.\n Sections 9 and 23 of the Act of March 3, 1871, are directly involved; the other sections of the act and other acts only as illustrating sections 9 and 23.\n By section 9 a land grant is made to the Texas Pacific Railroad of public land in California in the terms and qualifications which are quite familiar and contains the provision set out in the bill which subjects the land unsold within three years after the completion of the road to settlement and preemption at a price not exceeding an average of $2.50 an acre.\n By section 23 the Southern Pacific Railroad Company of California was authorized to construct a line of railroad from a point at or near Tehachapi Pass, by way of Los Angeles, to the Texas Pacific Railroad at or near the Colorado River, 'with the same rights, grants, and privileges, and subject to the same limitations, restrictions, and conditions, as were granted' to the Southern Pacific Railroad Company by the Act of July 27, 1866, c. 278, 14 Stat. 292, with reservations of rights to other railroad companies.\n Based on this provision complainant puts three questions as involved in the case, but says it is only necessary for this court to answer the following one:\n'Was this grant of lands to the Southern Pacific Railroad Company under the Act of March 3, 1871, made subject to the rights, grants and privileges of said act, or under the rights, grants and privileges of the Act of July 27, 1866, and subject only to its terms?'\n\n Complainant's answer to the question is that the grant to the Southern Pacific was \n\n[248 U.S. 409, 412]\n\u00a0\n made under the act of 1871 and not under the act of 1866 and deduces from that that the provision in section 9 requiring under certain circumstances a sale to pre-emptors is applicable to the Southern Pacific.\n Complainant's argument in support of the answer does not submit easily to succinct statement. Its postulate is that the policy of Congress in regard to the public lands came to have its chief solicitude in the disposition of them to actual settlers at reasonable prices and that this policy was not overlooked even in the grants to railroads. And the policy dictated, it is said, the provision of section 9 of the grants to the Texas Pacific Railroad Company, and determines the insertion of a like provision in section 23 which concerns the grant to the Southern Pacific Company, though it is not inserted therein. We may grant, if a policy exists, that it may be used to resolve the uncertainty of a law, but it cannot be a substitute for a law. However, we do not find the uncertainty in sections 9 or 23 that complainant does, whether jointly or separately considered. Section 23 is complete in itself. The restrictions upon the grant it made that were deemed appropriate were expressed, and their expression excludes any other by a well known rule of construction.\n Let us repeat: The Southern Pacific Company is authorized to construct a line of railroad in California with the same rights, grants, privileges and subject to the same limitations, restrictions and conditions as were granted to the company by the Act of July 27, 1866. And there could not have been oversight, nor the inadvertence of expressing one thing when another was meant. Yet this is practically the contention of complainant. Not the conditions of the act of 1866 are imposed on the grant, but the conditions imposed by section 9, conditions upon a different grant and a different company, is the contention, though complainant admits that--\n'There is no question but that the language of section 23 segregated from \n\n[248 U.S. 409, 413]\n\u00a0\n the act, of which it is a part, and construed alone, supports the contention of the appellees.'\n\n The language gains, we think, not loses in strength from its location. It makes evident that there was a conscious contrast of provision between the grants and the companies.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","90":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nG. S. NICHOLAS & CO. v.

Cust. Appeals, 97.\n Paragraph E of section 4 of the Tariff Act of 1913 (38 Stat. 114 [ Comp. St.  5296]) reads as follows:\n'E. That whenever any country, dependency, colony, province or other political subdivision of government shall pay or bestow, directly or indirectly, any bounty or grant upon the exportation of any article or merchandise from such country, dependency, colony, province or other political subdivision of government, and such article of merchandise is dutiable under the provisions of this act, then upon the importation of any such article or merchandise into the United States, whether the same shall be imported directly from the country of production or otherwise, and whether such article or merchandise is imported in the same condition as when exported from the country of production or has been changed in condition by manufacture or otherwise, there shall be levied and paid, in all such cases, in addition to the duties otherwise imposed by this act, an additional duty equal to the net amount of such bounty or grant, however the same be paid or bestowed. The net amount of all such bounties or grants shall be from time to time ascertained, determined, and declared by the Secretary of the Treasury, who shall make all needful regulations for the identification of such articles and merchandise and for the assessment and collection of such additional duties.'\n\n The question in the case is the legality of the counter \n\n[249 U.S. 34, 36]\n\u00a0\n vailing duty. It was determined and declared to be necessary under paragraph E by reason of the allowance under the British legislation of three pence upon plain British spirits and five pence upon British compounded spirits. 23 & 24 Vict. c. 129.\n The case is not of broad compass. The act of Parliament referred to above levies a duty upon every gallon of spirits of a certain strength which after certain designated dates were or should be distilled within the United Kingdom, or which, having been distilled therein, were on the designated dates in the stock or possession of any distiller or in any duty-free warehouse, and which after the named dates should be taken out for consumption within the United Kingdom.\n It is provided that 'in consideration of the loss and hindrance caused by excise regulation in the distillation and rectification of spirits in the United Kingdom' there shall be paid 'to any distiller or proprietor of such spirits on the exportation thereof from a duty-free warehouse or on depositing the same in a customs warehouse ... the allowance of two pence per gallon ... and to any licensed rectifier who ... has or shall have deposited in a customs warehouse spirits distilled and rectified in the United Kingdom the following allowances : ... Three pence per gallon, and on spirits of the nature of spirits of wine an allowance of two pence per gallon. ...'\n Subsequent acts of Parliament repeat the provisions for allowance upon exported spirits, adding some details, and are replete with the regulations and provisions which the legislators thought or experience had demonstrated were necessary. And there is quite an enumeration of warehouses and their purposes which, however necessary from the standpoint of the law, happily is not necessary to our consideration of the questions in the case, although counsel describe them and use them in display of the options which \n\n[249 U.S. 34, 37]\n\u00a0\n it is contended the law gives to a distiller-that is, to export, warehouse, or sell the spirits or use them under conditions which would or would not result in an allowance. We do not find it necessary to go into such confusing considerations. The question in the case is more direct, and is whether the three pence and five pence paid no account of export from the United Kingdom is the bestowal 'directly or indirectly' of a 'bounty or grant upon the exportation of any article or merchandise from such country,' to use the words of paragraph E.\n Looking only at the paragraph and judging from the first impressions of its words, the problem presented would seem to be without difficulty. There is paid to an exporter of spirits from the United Kingdom the sum of three or five pence a gallon, as the case may be, and the instant conclusion is that the sale of spirits to other countries is relieved from a burden that their sale in the United Kingdom must bear. There is a benefit, therefore, in exportation, an inducement to seek the foreign market. And thus it would seem, if we regard the substance of things, that the condition of the application of paragraph E obtains.\n Counsel, however, resist this view in somewhat lengthy and minute arguments, only the basic propositions of which we can give. They dwell especially upon the purpose of the British act and the differences, not only actual, as they contend, but recognized in the administrative and legislative parlance of this country, between the words 'allowance,' 'bounty,' 'drawback' and 'grant.' In support of the first contention-that is, the purpose of the British act-it is urged that the allowance provided for is not a 'bounty' upon exportation, but 'compensation' to the distiller and rectifier for costs due to excise restrictions. In other words, that the allowance is not a premium on exportation, but the remission or reimbursement of the expense of manufacture to accommodate the 'peculiar \n\n[249 U.S. 34, 38]\n\u00a0\n conditions and necessities' of the British fiscal policy. In confirmation of this view it is said that not all British spirits when exported get the allowance, but only those that are warehoused in a certain specified way, and that, besides, the allowance is also paid when certain spirits go into domestic consumption. And the British ambassador is quoted as saying of the allowances that they 'do not even compensate the loss they are intended to reimburse, as is abundantly proved.'\n It is hence asserted that the condition of the application of paragraph E-that is, a premium bestowed on an exportation from another country-is absent and that, besides, the paragraph is of limited scope, the word bounty not being used in its most comprehensive sense, and that there is a wide difference between an 'indirect bounty' and 'indirectly paying a bounty,' and that for an indirect bounty the paragraph does not provide. Counsel attempt to justify the distinction and illustrate it by the citation of the example of many acts of Congress by which 'indirect' bounties were legislated and also by the comments of legislators in discussion of the purpose and effect of the use of the words 'allowances,' and 'rebates,' and 'drawbacks.' And United States v. Passavant, \n169 \nU.S. 16, 23\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 219, is quoted for a distinction between 'the word 'bounty' as differentiated from the word 'drawback' in tariff parlance' and 'the shades of meaning which Congress had in mind when enacting paragraph E and provisions in pari materia.' In further support of their distinctions counsel cite the executive practice of this country, and adduce the decisions of this and other courts to show that such practice is a useful resolvent of the meaning of words and of legislative intention.\n We appreciate the strength of the argument, but the circumstances are but aids to persuasion; they do not compel it. Every new statute is individual and presents its own problem. That before us does, and, as we have \n\n[249 U.S. 34, 39]\n\u00a0\n said, looking at its words alone, has no uncertainty of purpose. Whenever any country 'shall pay or bestow, directly or indirectly, any bounty or grant upon the exportation of any article or merchandise,' there shall be levied and paid upon it, upon importation, in addition to the regular duty, an additional one 'equal to the net amount of such bounty or grant, however the same be paid or bestowed.' The statute was addressed to a condition and its words must be considered as intending to define it, and all of them-'grant' as well as 'bounty'-must be given effect. If the word 'bounty' has a limited sense the word 'grant' has not. A word of broader significance than 'grant' could not have been used. Like its synonyms 'give' and 'bestow,' it expresses a concession, the conferring of something by one person upon another. And if the 'something' be conferred by a country 'upon the exportation of any article or merchandise' a countervailing duty is required by paragraph E.\n There can be, therefore, but one inquiry: Was something-bounty or grant-paid or bestowed upon the exportation of spirits? Counsel's answer we have given; ours is different. They dwell upon the meaning of one word and the necessary adjustments of the British revenue legislation; we regard all of the words, the fact of payment and the event-the fact that the grant is made at the time of exportation and only upon exportation (of course, we mean of the spirits destined for the United States)-the event, that the spirits may be sold cheaper in the United States than in the United Kingdom, and necessarily there may be that aid to their competitive power. We do not think that it is a repelling answer to say that they are sold here at the same price that they would be sold for in the United Kingdom if the latter imposed no tax, that is, sold here as if they had not been taxed at all, and therefore sold not below their natural cost. This is mere speculation of the effects of a different situation. We have the \n\n[249 U.S. 34, 40]\n\u00a0\n fact of spirits able to be sold cheaper in the United States than in the place of their production, and this the result of an act of government because of the destination of the spirits being a foreign market. For that situation paragraph E was intended to provide. What legislation some other situation might require or receive we are not called upon to conjecture.\n Our conclusion is supported, we think, by United States v. Passavant, supra, a case from which counsel have adduced some argument. An importation of goods from Germany was the subject of the decision. That country imposed a tax upon merchandise when sold by the manufacturer thereof for consumption or sale in the markets of Germany. Upon exportation of the merchandise the tax was remitted. The remission was called 'bonification of tax' as distinguished from being refunded as a rebate. The merchandise could be purchased in bond for exportation in the principal markets of Germany at the net invoice price and without paying the so-called German duty. The merchandise with which the case was concerned was so purchased.\n Upon importation of the merchandise it was determined by the collector and customs appraiser that its value was the net invoice value with the German duty added. This ruling was contested by the importer and the Board of General Appraisers reversed it. The Circuit Court, to which the case had been carried, affirmed the decision of the Board of General Appraisers. Upon appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals that court asked of this court whether the German duty had been lawfully included by the collector and customs appraiser in their estimate of the dutiable value. We answered in the affirmative, and said, through Mr. Chief Justice Fuller:\n That 'the laws of this country in the assessment of duties proceed upon the market value in the exporting country and not upon the market value less such remission or amelioration \n\n[249 U.S. 34, 41]\n\u00a0\n as that country chooses to allow in accordance with its own views of public policy.'\n And this conclusion was reached upon the effect of the remitted tax and not upon the word used to designate it. In other words, the decision was not determined by a consideration of costs of manufacture or their reimbursement nor by the requirements of the policies of the exporting country. It regarded the fact and effect of the remitted excise.\n Downs v. United States, \n187 U.S. 496\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 222, is a like example, and direct and indirect bounties are illustrated. As an instance of the former the amount paid upon the production of sugar under the act of Congress of October 1, 1890 (26 Stat. 617, c. 1244) is adduced, and also the 'drawback' (the word of the statute is used) upon certain articles exported; as instances of the latter, that is, of indirect bounties, the remission of taxes upon the exportation of articles which are subject to a tax when sold or consumed in the country of their production is given, and, as another example, the laws permitting distillers of spirits to export the same without payment of an internal revenue tax or other burden.\n We consider further discussion unnecessary and the judgment of the Court of Customs Appeals is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","91":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGILCREASE v.

Diggs, of Tulsa, Okl., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Thomas Gilcrease, a Creek Indian of one-eighth blood, received under date of December 15, 1902, an allotment of surplus land under Act of Congress March 1, 1901, c. 676 (31 Stat. 861), as amended by Act of June 30, 1902, c. 1323 (32 Stat. 500). On February 8, 1911, his twenty-first birthday, he executed to McCullough and Martin an oil and gas lease thereof. Later he brought suit in a state court of Oklahoma to set it aside insisting that, under the applicable enrollment record of Creek citizenship, he must be assumed to have been under age at the time the lease was executed, although he had in fact \n\n[249 U.S. 178, 179]\n\u00a0\n attained his majority. The trial court entered judgment for the defendants which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state (162 Pac. 178), and a rehearing was denied, January 9, 1917. The case comes here on writ of certiorari. \n243 U.S. 653\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 480.\n The only substantial question submitted is this: Did the entry concerning Gilcrease's age made in the enrollment record of Creek citizenship preclude defendant from showing that he was actually of age when the lease was executed? The decision of that question depends wholly upon the construction to be given section 3 of the Act of May 27, 1908, c. 199 (35 Stat. 312, 313), as applied to the record.\n Section 3 provides:\n'That the rolls of citizenship and of freedmen of the Five Civilized Tribes approved by the Secretary of the Interior shall be conclusive evidence as to the quantum of Indian blood of any enrolled citizen or freedman of said tribes and of no other persons to determine questions arising under this act and the enrollment records of the Commissioner to the Five Civilized Tribes shall hereafter be conclusive evidence as to the age of said citizen or freedman.'\n\n The enrollment record introduced in evidence, so far as material, is as follows:\n Residence: Leonard. Creek Nation. Creek Roll. Post Office: Mounds, Ind. Ter. []\n Relationship Dawes' to person Roll No. Name first named Age Sex Blood []\n 1504 1 Gilcrease, Lizzie 25 F. 1\/4 1505 2 Gilcrease, Thomas Son 9 M. 1\/8 1506 3 Gilcrease, Eddie \" 7 \" 1\/8 1507 4 Gilcrease, Ben \" 5 \" 1\/8 1508 5 Gilcrease, Lena Daughter 3 F. 1\/8 1509 6 Gilcrease, Florence \" 1 \" 1\/8 Citizenship certificate issued- June 9th, 1899. June 9\/99. [] \n\n[249 U.S. 178, 180]\n\u00a0\n Gilcrease insists that the entry 'June 9\/99,' near the lower right- hand corner of the enrollment card, signifies that the application for his enrollment was made on June 9, 1899; that in giving his age as '9,' the roll declared him to be exactly 9 years old on June 9, 1899; and that, consequently, in the absence of other evidence to the contrary in the enrollment record, he must be deemed to have been under age on February 8, 1911\n\n\n But there was no declaration or finding of fact by the Commission that Gilcrease was exactly 9 years old on June 9, 1899. The declaration that a person is 9 years of age signifies, in the absence of conditions requiring exact specification, merely that he has reached or passed the ninth anniversary of his birth and is still less than 10 years old. There was neither a statute nor a regulation of the Commission which required an exact specification of age. Nor did the printed blank used for the enrollment provide a space either for entering the date of applicant's birthday or for entering the number of months and days by which his age exceeded a full year. Furthermore, the enrollment card itself bears positive evidence that it did not purport to represent the applicant as being exactly 9 years old on the day of application. For this same card records, in like manner, on the assumed date of application, also the ages of his mother, of three brothers, and a sister. Is the court expected to believe that the Commission found, that the six members of the family were all born on the 9th day of June?\n Gilcrease insists, however, that the act makes the enrollment record not merely 'conclusive,' but the exclusive 'evidence as to the age' of the citizen; or, in other words, that Congress has provided, not a rule of evidence, but the following rule of substantive law: Whenever a member of the Five Civilized Tribes is stated in the enrollment record to be a certain number of years old and the day of his enrollment is stated therein, he shall be unable \n\n[249 U.S. 178, 181]\n\u00a0\n to convey his lands so long as the rolls do not show affirmatively that he is 21 years old. For this contention there is no support in the words of the statute; nor is there any in reason. As well might it be contended that where the record states the number of the applicant's years, but gives only the year and not the day or the month of the application of enrollment, evidence could not be introduced to show that the application was made before December 31st of the year given, or that if no age whatever appeared in the enrollment record the citizen must for 21 years after the date of enrollment be conclusively presumed to be a minor. The enrollment record is, of course, conclusive as to that which it in terms recites or which is necessarily implied from the words and figures used. But there is no indication of an intention on the part of Congress that facts not inconsistent with the recitals of the record shall not be proved, whenever relevant. The roll had already been held to be practically conclusive as to facts, the determination of which was a condition precedent to enrollment. Compare United States v. Wildcat, \n244 U.S. 111\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 561. The purpose of section 3 of the Act of May 27, 1908, seems to have been simply to make the record conclusive as to age in so far as it purports to state age. The cases in the lower federal courts, the recent decisions in the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, and the great weight of all the authorities support the proposition that, when the age is stated simply in years or whenever the age is not stated definitely by the addition of the months or days, other evidence may be introduced to supplement the record by proving these and thus establish the exact date of birth. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Etchen v.

Plaintiff in error's intestate, on March 3, 1912, while in the railroad company's service in interstate commerce, was killed, through the negligence, in whole or in part, it is charged, of one of the company's officers, agents or employes.\n The defenses of the company were denial of the declaration and averments that the intestate's injuries and death were due to and caused by his own negligence and besides 'were the result of acts, conditions and circumstances the happening of which was assumed' by him.\n The case was tried to a jury. At the conclusion of the testimony, upon motion of defendant and over the objection and exception of plaintiff, the court ruled that upon all of the evidence the plaintiff was not entitled to recover and directed a verdict for defendant. It was stipulated that the case was to be reported for the determination of the full court and that if the ruling and direction should be held to be right, then judgment was to be entered for defendant. 'If the case ought to have been submitted to the jury, then judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff in the sum of forty-five hundred ($4,500) dollars.' The case was so reported. The full court reviewed the testimony quite elaborately and concluded from that review that 'the only person who was negligent was the deceased, and the judge was right in directing a verdict for the defendant' and cited Great Northern Ry. v. Wiles, \n240 U.S. 444\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 406.\n That case repeated the established principle that when the evidence justifies it it is competent for a court to direct a verdict for a defendant. The principle is not \n\n[249 U.S. 515, 517]\n\u00a0\n attacked by plaintiff. The contention, however, is that the courts below, one of which tried the case, were wrong in their estimate of the evidence, and that plaintiff was entitled to the judgment of the jury upon it. We are unable to yield to the contention. Nor do we think it necessary to give a review of the evidence. It will be found in the opinion of the court, and we have verified its correctness. The case turns, therefore, upon an appreciation of the testimony and admissible inferences therefrom, and even if the conclusions of the courts were more disputable we should have to defer to them.

Invalidity of the tax was alleged upon the ground that no statute of Louisiana authorized it and also because its enforcement would produce practical confiscation and take property without due process of law contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. Answering, defendant in error asked dismissal of the petition, claiming the tax was properly assessed and also that an amendment to article 281 of the Louisiana Constitution, adopted November, 1914, deprived the court of jurisdiction to entertain the contest. The trial court exercised jurisdiction, sustained the tax and dismissed the petition. Upon a broad appeal the Supreme Court, after declaring that the constitutional amendment deprived the courts of the state of jurisdiction over the controversy, affirmed the judgment of the trial court. 142 La. 812, 77 South. 640.\n The record fails to disclose that plaintiff in error at any time or in any way challenged the validity of the state constitutional amendment because of conflict with the federal Constitution until it applied for a rehearing in the Supreme Court. That application was refused, without more. Here the sole error assigned is predicated upon such supposed conflict; and, unless that point was properly raised below, a writ of error cannot bring the cause before us.\n Such a writ only lies to review 'a final judgment or decree in any suit in the highest court of a state in which a decision in the suit could be had, where is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under the United States, and the decision is against their validity, or where is drawn in \n\n[251 U.S. 179, 181]\n\u00a0\n question the validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised under any state, on the ground of their being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of their validity.'

JOHNSON(1919)\nNo. 148\nArgued: Decided: March 17, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[249 U.S. 246, 247]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William L. Carpenter and Elliott G. Stevenson, both of Detroit, Mich., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Edward J. Moinet, of St. Johns, Mich., and William A. Bahlke, of Alma, Mich., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The trustee in bankruptcy of the St. Louis Chemical Company brought suit in a state court of Michigan against the Gratiot County State Bank to recover, as illegal preferences, payments made to it within four months before the filing of the involuntary petition. The bank denied the allegation that the Chemical Company was insolvent when the payments were made. To establish that fact, the trustee offered in evidence the adjudication together with the petition on which it was based and the special master's report which it confirmed. The latter found \n\n[249 U.S. 246, 248]\n\u00a0\n that the debtor had been insolvent for four months or more before the filing of the petition and had made, while so insolvent, certain preferences. The bank was not actually a party to the bankruptcy proceedings and had taken no part therein. The trial court held that this evidence was not only admissible but established conclusively that the debtor was insolvent throughout the four months; and it entered judgment for the trustee which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Michigan. Johnson v. Gratiot County State Bank, 193 Mich. 452, 160 N. W. 544. The case comes here on writ of certiorari. \n243 U.S. 645\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 406. The only question presented is whether the state courts erred in holding that the record of the adjudication made the fact of insolvency at the time of the payments res judicata as against the bank.\n First. The trustee contends that adjudication in bankruptcy, being in the nature of a judgment in rem, establishes not only the status of the debtor as a bankrupt, but also the essential findings of fact on which that judgment was based. The adjudication is, for the purpose of administering the debtor's property, that is, in its legislative effect, conclusive upon all the world. Compare Shawham v. Wherritt, 7 How. 627, 643. So far as is declares the status of the debtor, even strangers to the decree may not attack it collaterally. Michaels v. Post, 21 Wall. 398, 428; New Lamp Chimney Co. v. Ansonia Brass & Copper Co., \n91 \nU.S. 656, 661\n, 662 S.. Compare Hebert v. Crawford, \n228 \nU.S. 204, 208\n, 209 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 484. But an adjudication in bankruptcy, like other judgments in rem, is not res judicata as to the facts or as to the subsidiary questions of law on which it is based, except as between parties to the proceeding or privies thereto. Manson v. Williams, \n213 \nU.S. 453, 455\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 519.1 This court applied the \n\n[249 U.S. 246, 249]\n\u00a0\n principle in Wood v. Davis, 7 Cranch, 271, where a judgment that a mulatto woman was born free was held, as between strangers, not conclusive that her children were free. The rule finds abundant illustration in cases dealing with decedents' estates, Tilt v. Kelsey, \n207 \nU.S. 43, 52\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 1; Brigham v. Fayerweather, 140 Mass. 411, 5 N. E. 265; and in cases involving the marriage status, Luke v. Hill, 137 Ga. 159, 73 S. E. 345, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 559; Burlen v. Shannon, 3 Gray (Mass.) 387; Wilson v. Mitchell, 48 Colo. 454, 469, 111 Pac. 21, 30 L. R. A. (N. S.) 507; Corry v. Lackey, 105 Mich. 363, 63 N. W. 418; Belknap v. Stewart, 38 Neb. 304, 56 N. W. 881, 41 Am. St. Rep. 729; Gill v. Read, 5 R. I. 343, 73 Am. Dec. 73.\n Second. The trustee contends, however, that since by sections 18b and 59f2 of the Bankruptcy Act any creditor is entitled to intervene in the bankruptcy proceedings, the bank should be considered a party thereto. These sections are permissive, not mandatory. They give to a creditor, who fears that he will be prejudiced by an adjudication of bankruptcy, the right to contest the petition. Whether he does so or not, he will be bound, like the rest of the world, by the judgment, so far as it is strictly an adjudication of bankruptcy. But he is under no obligation to intervene, and the existence of the right is not equivalent to actual intervention. Unless he exercises the right to become a party, he remains a stranger to the litigation and, as such, unaffected by the decision of even essential subsidiary issues. In re McCrum, 214 Fed. 207, 213, 130 C. C. A. 555; Cullinane v. Bank, 123 Iowa, 340, 342, 98 N. W. 887. The rule is general that persons who might have \n\n[249 U.S. 246, 250]\n\u00a0\n made themselves parties to a litigation between strangers, but did not, are not bound by the judgment. \n3\n Compare Western Union Tel. Co. v. Foster, \n247 \nU.S. 105, 115\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 438. No good reason exists for making an exception in the case of bankruptcy proceedings.\n The purpose of Congress in expressly authorizing creditors, as well as the debtor, to answer an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was to guard against an improvident adjudication and to protect those whose peculiar interests might be prejudiced by establishing the status of bankruptcy. See Blackstone v. Everybody's Store, 207 Fed. 752, 756, 125 C. C. A. 290; Jackson v. Wauchula Mfg. & Timber Co., 203 Fed. 409, 411, 144 C. C. A. 551. The grant of this right of intervention was harmonized with the general purpose of Congress to secure a prompt adjudication, by requiring that the appearance and answers of creditors be made within five days after the return day on the petition. Had the adjudication been made determinative also of claims of the several creditors against the estate or of claims of the estate against individual creditors, such expedition in proceedings would be impossible, if each of the many widely scattered creditors is to be afforded a fair opportunity to be heard. Furthermore, to require every creditor to acquaint himself with the issues raised in every proceeding in bankruptcy against his debtors, in order to determine whether a decision on any such issue might conceivably affect his interests; and, if so, either to participate in the litigation, or, at his peril, suffer the decision of every question therein litigated to become res judicata as against him, would be an intolerable hardship upon creditors. And the resulting volume of litigation would often so delay the adjudication as to defeat the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act. \n\n[249 U.S. 246, 251]\n\u00a0\n The unreasonableness of the rule contended for by the trustee is well illustrated in cases of alleged fraudulent preference. The claim may be made in respect to any creditor paid off within four months of the filing of an involuntary petition, that he received a fraudulent preference. Is every such former creditor to be deemed an existing creditor within the meaning of sections 18b and 59f and a party to the bankruptcy proceeding? Compare Keppel v. Tiffin Savings Bank, \n197 U.S. 356\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 443. And shall the decision of the bank ruptcy court be binding on all these former creditors in respect to individual claims, although that court could not (without consent) obtain jurisdiction of any creditor who is not a resident of the district in which it sits, Acme Harvester Co. v. Beekman Lumber Co., \n222 \nU.S. 300, 311\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 96; and would not (prior to the Act of February 5, 1903, c. 487,  8, 13, 32 Stat. 797, 798, 800 [Comp. St.  9607, 9644]) have had jurisdiction, even as against a resident creditor, of a claim to recover a fraudulent preference; such claim being enforceable (without consent) only in courts of general jurisdiction, Bardes v. Hawarden Bank, \n178 U.S. 524\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 1000; Wall v. Cox, \n181 U.S. 244\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 642; Jaquith v. Rowley, \n188 U.S. 620\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 369; and, even now, only by plenary suit, Louisville Trust Co. v. Comingor, \n184 U.S. 18\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 293; Babbitt v. Dutcher, \n216 \nU.S. 102, 113\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 372, 17 Ann. Cas. 969.\n The decisions of the lower federal courts upon which the state court relied4 in holding that sections 18b and 59f made all creditors parties to the proceeding so as to render \n\n[249 U.S. 246, 252]\n\u00a0\n the adjudication binding on them as to all essential issues clearly misconceived the intention of Congress. The allegation in the involuntary petition that the bank was among those who had received preferences did not impose upon it the duty to appear and answer; and, since it did not do so, even a finding to that effect by the bankruptcy court would not have bound it. The Supreme Court of Michigan erred in holding that the adjudication in bankruptcy established conclusively as against the bank that the debtor was insolvent at the time the payments were made. We have no occasion to consider whether the record introduced was admissible merely as evidence of insolvency.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See, also, In re Henry Ulfelder Clothing Co.

CO.(1919)\nNo. 254\nArgued: October 15, 1919Decided: November 10, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 607, 608]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Leland W. Carr, of Lansing, Mich., Roger I. Wytes, of Grand Rapids, Mich., and Alexander J. Groesbeck, of Detroit, Mich., for appellants.\n Messrs. John E. Tracy, of Milwaukee, Wis., and W. D. McHugh, of Omaha, Neb., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Constitution of Michigan (article 12,  7) authorizes the Legislature to pass laws establishing 'reasonable maximum rates or charges for the transportation of passengers and freight.' In 1907 it fixed two cents a mile as the maximum intrastate passenger fare on railroads operating in the Lower Peninsula and three cents for those in the upper. By act approved May 2, 1911 (Public Laws No. 276), the two-cent rate was made applicable to all the railroads of the state whose gross earnings on passenger trains equal or exceed $1,200 per mile of line operated. Before the statute took effect, the Duluth, South Shore & Atlantic Railway Company, an interstate carrier operating in the Upper Peninsula, brought this suit in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of \n\n[250 U.S. 607, 609]\n\u00a0\n Michigan to enjoin the enforcement of the act. The bill alleged that the reduced rate would deprive plaintiff of its property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Attorney General and the railroad commissioners of the state, being charged by the law with its enforcement, were made defendants. They denied that the rate was confiscatory; and on this issue the District Court found for the railway. A final decree granting the relief sought was filed February 14, 1918, and an appeal to this court was promptly applied for by the defendants and allowed. Meanwhile, on January 1, 1918, the federal government had taken over the operation of this and other railroads, and is still operating the same. The two-cent rate was never put into effect on this railroad, as a restraining order issued upon the filing of the bill was continued until entry of the final decree. In 1919 the statute attacked here was repealed ( Michigan Public Laws No. 382). But the case has not become moot for the following reason: On continuing the restraining order the railway was required to issue to all intrastate passengers receipts by which it agreed to refund, if the act should be held valid, the amount paid in excess of a two-cent fare. Later the railway was required to deposit, subject to the order of the court, such amounts thereafter collected. The fund now on deposit exceeds $800,000, and the refund coupons are still outstanding. In order to determine the rights of coupon holders and to dispose of this fund it is necessary to decide whether the act of 1911 was, as respects this railroad, confiscatory.\n The issues of fact were tried below with great thoroughness. The case was referred to a special master to hear the proofs and to report the evidence together with his findings to the court. The report fills 503 pages of the printed record. The transcript of the testimony introduced before him covered more than 12,000 typewritten pages; and there were besides many exhibits. The evidence before the \n\n[250 U.S. 607, 610]\n\u00a0\n master related largely to the results of the operation of the railroad for the four years ending June 30, 1913. When the case came on for hearing before the District Judge in 1917, supplemental evidence was taken in open court covering the operations of the four additional years ending June 30, 1917. The evidence disclosed the usual diversity of opinion as to the value of the property and as to the proper method of dividing between the passenger and freight services the common expenses and the charges for property used in common. Upon the whole evidence the court found that the two-cent fare would have resulted in a return on intrastate passenger business of less than 2 per cent. during the six years ending June 30, 1917\n\n\n Between the commencement of this suit and the entry of the final decree many of the questions in controversy below have been settled by the decisions of this Court in other cases. \n1\n The state officials do not deny that there was legal evidence to justify the findings of fact made by the lower court; nor do they request that this court should undertake a general review of the evidence. But they insist that the finding of the district judge of the low return is erroneous, and that the error is due partly to his having included in his calculations property and operations which \n\n[250 U.S. 607, 611]\n\u00a0\n should have been excluded, and partly to his having adopted improper formulas for the division of common charges and expenses as between the freight and the passenger services; and that if these specific errors are corrected it will appear that the two-cent fare would have been highly remunerative. These alleged errors must be considered separately.\n First. It is contended that the Western Division should be excluded from the calculation. The Duluth, South Shore & Atlantic Railway extends from Sault Ste. Marie to Duluth and has, including branches, 584 miles of line, 475 of which are in Michigan. The Eastern Division serves mainly the iron region; the Central, the copper country; the Western, extending through sparsely settled country from Nestoria, Mich., 101 miles to the Wisconsin state line, and thence to Duluth, serves mainly interstate business. This division is said to have been built not in a desire to serve local needs, but for the purpose of establishing a through line from Duluth to Sault Ste. Marie. The statement, if true, furnishes no reason for excluding it from the calculation. The cost per mile of transporting passengers varies greatly on different parts of the same railroad system according to circumstances, being dependent, among other things, upon the cost of the roadbed and terminals, the grade, the number and character of the trains, the density of traffic and the length of the haul. The justification for a uniform fare per mile is furnished by the doctrine of averages; and the Legislature of Michigan made clear its purpose to apply the doctrine of averages in order to give to travelers the benefit of the two-cent fare on those portions of a railroad on which travel was light and the cost of carrying each passenger necessarily far in excess of two cents a mile. For this act declares:\n'That in computing the passenger earnings per mile of any company the earnings and mileage of all branch roads owned, leased, controlled or occupied or that may hereafter \n\n[250 U.S. 607, 612]\n\u00a0\n be owned, leased, controlled or occupied by such company ... shall be included in the computation [i. e., determining whether the year's gross passenger earnings equal $1,200 per mile], and the rate of fare shall be the same on all lines owned, leased, controlled or occupied by such company.'\n\n In other words, the Legislature has declared that for the purpose of determining the right of an intrastate passenger to travel on any part of the company's lines at the rate of two cents a mile, all of the lines within the state must be treated as one; that those on which travel is light must be averaged with those on which it is dense; and obviously also that those parts of the system which are unprofitable must be taken with those which are profitable. Every part of the railroad system over which the passenger is entitled by the act to ride for a two-cent fare must be included in the computation undertaken to determine whether the prescribed rate is confiscatory. This is true, at least, in the absence of illegality or mismanagement in the acquisition or operation of the division in question; and of such there is not even a suggestion in the record. There is nothing in San Diego Land & Town Co. v. National City, \n174 \nU.S. 739, 758\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 804, or in San Diego Land & Town Co. v. Jasper, \n189 \nU.S. 439, 446\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 571, upon which the state officials rely, which is inconsistent with this conclusion.\n Second. It is likewise contended that the so-called South Line between Marquette and Ishpeming should be excluded from the calculation. This line which for miles substantially parallels the main line, was originally built as an independent road and was purchased by plaintiff's predecessor in 1884 probably to avoid ruinous competition. It is used mainly for heavy freight, and the intrastate passenger travel over it is light. It is asserted that the construction of this road was not required to supply the transportation needs, and that it would still be possible to carry all existing traffic between Marquette and \n\n[250 U.S. 607, 613]\n\u00a0\n Ishpeming over the main line. What has been said above in regard to the Western Division applies equally to the South Line.\n Third. It is contended also that a loss was incurred in operating through passenger trains from Houghton over the Mineral Range Railroad to Calumet and that such loss should be excluded from this calculation. This extension of plaintiff's service was clearly reasonable in view of the importance of Calumet, which lies only fourteen miles from its own lines. It was admitted by the state officials that passengers on the route were, under the act, entitled to travel at the two-cent rate. The fact that the service was furnished by acquiring traffic rights instead of by building an independent line, clearly affords no reason for excluding the results of the operation from the calculation.\n Fourth. The further contention is made that the sleeping car, parlor car and dining car services should be treated as separate operations; that they should be charged with their proportion of specific and general expenses but credited only with the amounts received from charges for the specific service; and that no part of the apparent loss on these services should be taken into consideration in determining whether the two-cent fare is confiscatory. In support of this contention it is urged that these services were voluntary; that the law (Michigan Public Acts of 1875, No. 38) permits railroads to make special charges for these services 'in addition to the regular passenger fares allowed by law,' and that travelers in day coaches must not be allowed to suffer because a railroad fails to make these services compensatory. On American railroads of importance these services have been well-nigh universal for more than a generation; and the charges for them are substantially uniform throughout the country. It would be practically impossible, as it would be obviously unwise, for a railroad like the plaintiff's either to discontinue the \n\n[250 U.S. 607, 614]\n\u00a0\n services or to increase the charges to cover the cost of the particular service on its line. It is inconceivable that the Legislature of Michigan should have intended in enacting the two-cent fare law to deny to its citizens these customary facilities; and for the purpose of determining whether the act is confiscatory the passenger service including these facilities must be treated as a whole. The fact alleged that these facilities are used mainly by interstate travelers is immaterial.\n Fifth. The remaining objection relates to the formula adopted by the lower court for dividing charges and expenses common to freight and passenger services, and not capable of direct allocation. What method should be pursued in making such division is a very difficult problem to which railroad accountants, the Interstate Commerce Commission and state Railroad Commissions have for years given serious attention. \n2\n Despite much patient study and the exhibition of great ingenuity no wholly satisfactory method has yet been devised. The variables due to local conditions are numerous; and experience teaches us that it is much easier to reject formulas presented as being misleading than to find one apparently \n\n[250 U.S. 607, 615]\n\u00a0\n adequate. The science of railroad accounting is in this respect in process of development; and it may be long before a formula is devised which can be accepted as satisfactory. For the present, at least, the question what formula the trial court should adopt presents a question, not of law, but of fact; and we are clearly unable to say that the lower court erred in adopting the method there pursued. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The decree of the District Court is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Interstate Commerce Commission v.

By the use of a formula more favorable to the defendant he found it to be 2.52 per cent. The modified revenue train mile ratio used by the plaintiff showed a loss of over $100,000 a year; while the gross ton mile ratio proposed by the defendant indicated an average return of at most 5.82 per cent. Of these methods employed by the parties it may be noted that the Interstate Commerce Commission has said:\n'The representatives of the state commissions advocated the use of 'gross ton miles' as a basis, while the representatives of the railways favored 'engine ton miles.' The discussion seemed to be somewhat influenced by the possible effect of these respective bases on statistical evidence which might be introduced in passenger rate cases. It may fairly be said that the facts and arguments presented do not warrant the final approval by the Commission of either the gross ton mile or the locomotive ton mile at this time.'

CO.(1919)\nNo. 218\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1919\n\n\n\n\n\n[248 U.S. 334, 336]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward S. Paine, of San Juan, P. R., for petitioner.\n Mr. John C. Wait, of New York City, and Charles Hartzell, of San Juan, P. R., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is before us for the second time, our former decision being reported in \n240 U.S. 264\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 300. It was an action for damages, brought by the present petitioner as plaintiff against the present respondent as defendant in the District Court of the United States for Porto Rico. Our first review was upon a direct writ of error sued out by plaintiff under section 244, Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1087, 1157 [Comp. St.  1215]), prior to the amendment of January 28, 1915 (38 Stat. 804, c. 22,  3, 6 [Comp. St.  1704a]). Judgment was reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings. Upon the going down of the mandate a new trial was had, resulting in a verdict in plaintiff's favor \n\n[248 U.S. 334, 337]\n\u00a0\n for substantial damages. To review the judgment entered thereon, defendant, under the act of 1915, prosecuted a writ of error from the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, setting up assignments of error based upon rulings of the trial court in admitting and excluding evidence and in giving and refusing instructions to the jury. The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment and ordered the cause to be remanded for further proceedings (241 Fed. 545, 154 C. C. A. 321); and to review this judgment the present writ of certiorari was allowed (\n245 U.S. 643\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 9, 62 L. ed. 528).\n The controversy arose in the course of the construction of a federal post office and court building at San Juan, Porto Rico. Plaintiff had a subcontract for a part of the work under defendant, which was the general contractor under the government of the United States. Pertinent clauses of the contract and a general history of the case were set forth in out former opinion and need not be repeated at length.\n The evidence at the second trial followed the general lines of the first. Defendant was to construct the foundation complete to the basement floor. Upon this, plaintiff was to construct the principal part of the building, including exterior and interior walls, floors, and roof, to be built of concrete. For this work and the necessary materials defendant agreed to pay to plaintiff the sum of $64,750 in certain monthly installmenst on account and the balance on completion. The plans called for certain granite work, for which defendant was to send the cut blocks from the United States; and under an option set forth in paragraph 25, afterwards accepted by defendant, plaintiff was to set this granite for 40 cents per square foot of surface.\n It appeared that after the work had been in progress for some time a disagreement arose between the parties about payments on account. Paragraph 12 of the contract provided that there should be 'monthly payments on \n\n[248 U.S. 334, 338]\n\u00a0\n account, not to exceed in amount 85 per cent. of the cost of the work actually erected in the building, provided that the subcontractor furnishes to the general contractors a written requisition, on a form to be supplied by the general contractors, not less than twelve days before payment is required,' etc. The contract, however, did not provide how such cost of the work, other than the granite setting, should be ascertained. In December, 1911, and January, 1912, plaintiff made written requisitions which were not complied with; and, according to plaintiff's evidence, it was agreed between the parties on or about February 2, 1912, that future applications and payments should be made upon the basis of a schedule which specified, inter alia, 'Exterior and interior concrete walls, arches, and cement work $1.07 per cubic foot.' On March 9, 1912, plaintiff made a requisition for payment computed on this basis, and showing a balance due of $11,735.95. This requisition was in effect refused, and no further payment was made except the sum of $674, which was paid a few days later.\n In the month of February, 1912, the government superintendent of construction found a serious settlement in the foundation, as a result of which work upon the building was ordered to be stopped. This order was communicated verbally by defendant's representative to plaintiff's agent at San Juan on the 9th of March, and was confirmed two days later by letter, in which, however, a request made by plaintiff's agent for instructions as to what should be done with plaintiff's force of men pending the suspension of the work was evaded. Plaintiff stopped work pursuant to defendant's notice, and did nothing more upon the building.\n Thus matters remained until May 22, 1912, plaintiff in the meantime having received no payment pursuant to its requisition of March 9 beyond the small sum mentioned above, nor any instructions or permission to pro \n\n[248 U.S. 334, 339]\n\u00a0\n ceed with the work upon the building; and, according to plaintiff's evidence, it was impossible to tell when the work could proceed. On May 22 plaintiff wrote to the defendant, referring to the stoppage of the work and to 'the very considerable cost and damage to us caused by your breach of contract,' to the inability to get payments from defendant in accordance with the terms of the contract, and to defendant's refusal of an offer of arbitration and refusal of 'an assurance that even now we would have an opportunity within any reasonable time to proceed with our work,' and concluding with this notification:\n'Under these circumstances and owing to your entire failure to comply with the terms of the contract, we hereby notify you that we now terminate the contract and shall proceed no further with the work, and that we shall hold you liable for the damages we have sustained by reason of your breach of contract, including your failure to provide labor and materials not included in the contract with us in such manner as not to delay the material progress of our work and your failure to make payments in accordance with the terms of the contract, and all other breaches of contract on your part.'\n\n The principal ground of action was based upon the contention that in refusing to respond to plaintiff's requisitions for payments on account, and in the complete and indefinite stoppage of plaintiff's work under the circumstances mentioned, defendant had committed breaches of the contract so material as to amount to a total breach, justifying plaintiff in declining to proceed further and in suing at once for its damages. See Anvil Mining Co. v. Humble, \n153 \nU.S. 540, 552\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 876. But as we pointed out in \n240 U.S. 283\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 300, plaintiff counted also upon a quantum meruit for work and labor performed and materials furnished in and about the construction of the building.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals attributed error to the trial court in the following respects: \n\n[248 U.S. 334, 340]\n\u00a0\n 1. The trial court refused defendant's request to instruct the jury that plaintiff was not justified in terminating the contract because of delays, and in instructing them on the contrary, as the court did in substance, that if it was evident to the parties on May 22, 1912, that there would be a long delay or an indefinite delay, or if it was evidently impossible to tell when the work could be begun again, plaintiff had a right to terminate the contract and was not obliged to await indefinitely the pleasure of the government as to the resumption of work. It should be noted that when plaintiff took action to terminate the contract, more than two months already had elapsed since the work was stopped. This was undisputed, and of course must be considered in dealing with the instruction referred to.\n It is sufficiently obvious that a contract for the construction of a building, even in the absence of an express stipulation upon the subject, implies as an essential condition that a site shall be funished upon which the structure may be erected. In this case the matter was not allowed to rest upon an implication, for, as we held in our former opinion, the eleventh paragraph of the subcontract, providing:\n'The general contractors will provide all labor and materials not included in this contract in such manner as not to delay the material progress of the work, and in the event of failure so to do, thereby causing loss to the subcontractor, agree that they will reimburse the subcontractor for such loss'\n\n -as applied to the facts of the case, imported an agreement by defendant to furnish the foundation in such manner that plaintiff might build upon it without delay, and was inconsistent with an implication that the parties intended that delays attributable to the action of the owner should leave plaintiff remediless; and defendant's obligation to furnish a suitable foundation was not dependent on whether it was at fault or whether the delay was attributable to a stoppage of work by the owner in the exercise of a right conferred \n\n[248 U.S. 334, 341]\n\u00a0\n upon it by a provision of the principal contract which was not brought into the subcontract.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, however, held (241 Fed. 549, 154 C. C. A. 321) that although under paragraph 11 defendant would be liable to respond in damages for such delays if plaintiff completed or stood ready to complete its contract, yet it did not follow that if plaintiff was delayed in completing its work within the 300 days specified in paragraph 6 it could decline to go on, since by paragraph 7 it was provided that should the subcontractor be obstructed or delayed in the prosecution or completion of the work by neglect, delay, or default of the owner (among other causes), the time fixed for the completion of the work should be extended for a period equivalent to the time lost from such causes. The court held that this rendered it clear that delays occasioned to the plaintiff by the owner, the general contractor, etc., were not to excuse plaintiff from proceeding to complete the contract, but were to operate merely as an extension of the time within which by the terms of the contract plaintiff was required to perform its work. In our opinion there was error in holding that the provisions of the sixth and seventh paragraphs limited, thus, the provisions of the eleventh. From the fact that by paragraph 6 plaintiff was obliged to finish the work in 300 days, and by paragraph 7 this time was extended for plaintiff's benefit in the case of delays caused by the owner, the general contractor, or otherwise as specified, it does not follow that plaintiff was not entitled to finish the work more speedily if it could do so; or that a breach of paragraph 11 by defendant, so serious as to result in a total suspension of the work, with no reasonable prospect that it could be resumed within any reasonable time, left plaintiff still under an obligation to hold itself in readiness to proceed, and without remedy except an action for damages under that paragraph. \n\n[248 U.S. 334, 342]\n\u00a0\n 2. The court found error in the admission of evidence tending to show that at the time plaintiff ceased work it had on hand and left upon the premises certain materials, machinery and tools of the value of $3,500, which defendant took and appropriated to its own use. As pointed out above, the complaint contained a general claim in the nature of a quantum meruit for labor performed and materials furnished. The particular item in question was specified in the bill of particulars. This clearly justified the trial court in admitting the evidence over the only substantial objection made, which was that it was immaterial and not within the pleadings. There is nothing to show that it was admitted only for its bearing upon the question of damages for breach of the special contract. It is true that in answer to the objection of immateriality plaintiff's counsel said:\n'I will show you a case where it says that the rule is that plaintiff's expenditure minus any materials which he may have on hand and plus any profits which he might have made'\n\n -evidently referring to United States v. Behan, \n110 \nU.S. 338, 344\n, 346 S., 4 Sup. Ct. 81; but in responding to a further objection that the material could not be charged to defendant, plaintiff's counsel insisted, 'I propose to show that the defendant took it and has it,' and followed it up with proof to this effect.\n The opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals (241 Fed. 550, 154 C. C. A. 321) shows that counsel for plaintiff in that court stated that the quantum meruit had been disregarded, and that the trial proceeded solely upon the ground of a breach of the special contract; but the bill of exceptions fails to bear this out, and error cannot be attributed to the trial court on that theory. There was no waiver of the general claim for materials, and the evidence referred to furnished a ground of recovery upon that claim, irrespective of plaintiff's right to recover damages for breach of the special contract.\n But upon the latter question also it was admissible, \n\n[248 U.S. 334, 343]\n\u00a0\n upon the assumption that the rule of damages laid down in United States v. Behan, supra, was applicable, which is not disputed. That rule would give the plaintiff a right to recover what it had expended toward performance of the contract, subject to a deduction for the value of the materials remaining on hand at the time performance was stopped. But of course the deduction is based upon the theory that those materials remained the property of plaintiff and subject to its disposal. If they were appropriated by defendant to its use-and this is what the evidence tended to show-it is plain that their value should not be deducted from, but should be treated as a part of, plaintiff's contribution to the performance of the contract, in addition to its other outlay in respect of work performed.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals considered that the furnishing of the materials in question was a matter so entirely outside of the contract that it could not properly be considered as an element of damage for its breach, and that plaintiff's remedy to recover their value must be by action of tort for conversion. But the evidence showed no tortious conversion; it tended to show that the articles were appropriated by defendant with plaintiff's consent; and it hardly is necessary to say that, if tort there were, plaintiff could waive it and sue upon the implied assumpsit. Great Falls Mfg. Co. v. Atty. Gen., \n124 \nU.S. 581, 598\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 631; Hirsch v. C. W. Leatherbee Lumber Co., 69 N. J. Law, 509, 513, 55 Atl. 645.\n Nor was this a matter entirely outside of the contract. The materials in question consisted in the main of tools and appliances that had been brought to the building by plaintiff for use in the performance of the contract, were so used, presumably were fitted for further use on the building, and upon the interruption of the work were left in position in the control of defendant and ready to be employed by it whenever it should proceed with the \n\n[248 U.S. 334, 344]\n\u00a0\n work that plaintiff had been prevented from doing. If they were accepted and retained by defendant, as the evidence tended to show was the fact, it was proper to take them into account as a part of plaintiff's expenditures upon which the damages caused by defendant's breach of the contract were to be computed.\n\n 3. \nThe next ground of error upon which the Circuit Court of Appeals based its decision was an instruction given to the jury, in substance, that if defendant failed to make payments on account as called for by the contract-'a substantial failure, amounting substantially to the withholding of the whole payment, not necessarily the whole payment, but the bulk of the payment'-such failure constituted a breach on the part of defendant justifying plaintiff in stopping work and entitling it to recover damages from defendant; and the refusal of a requested instruction to the effect that 'the delay of defendant to make payments on estimates, in the absence of a positive refusal to pay anything, was not ground for rescission of termination of the contract by plaintiff,' and that plaintiff's remedy was to recover interest on the deferred payments.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals very properly held that in a building or construction contract like the one in question, calling for the performing of labor and furnishing of materials covering a long period of time and involving large expenditures, a stipulation for payments on account to be made from time to time during the progress of the work must be deemed so material that a substantial failure to pay would justify the contractor in declining to proceed. In addition to the provisions of paragraph 12, already referred to, the concluding paragraph of the contract was as follows:\n'And the said general contractors hereby promise and agree with the said subcontractor to employ, and do hereby employ him to provide the materials and to do the said work according to the terms \n\n[248 U.S. 334, 345]\n\u00a0\n and conditions herein contained and referred to for the price aforesaid, and hereby contract to pay the same at the time, in the manner and upon the conditions avove set forth.'\n\n As is usually the case with building contracts, it evidently was in the contemplation of the parties that the contractor could not be expected to finance the operation to completion without receiving the stipulated payments on account as the work progressed. In such cases a substantial compliance as to advance payments is a condition precedent to the contractor's obligation to proceed. Canal Co. v. Gordon, 6 Wall. 561, 569; Phillips & C. Construction Co. v. Seymour, \n91 U.S. 646\n, 649.\n But it was held that defendant's refusal to pay was justified because plaintiff's requisitions were not made out in accordance with the provisions of the contract. There were but two requisitions in evidence, one dated December 30, 1911, the other March 9, 1912. Both were held defective, in that they included not only 85 per cent. of the estimated amount of the concrete construction, which was the principal subject- matter of plaintiff's contract, but also a like percentage of the amount earned in setting granite under the accepted option in paragraph 25. The court held that the provision for monthly installments related only to the former, and that as to the granite work plaintiff was not entitled to payments on account in advance of its completion. In our opinion, however, defendant's acceptance of the option to call upon plaintiff to set the granite blocks did not make a separate contract, but merely added something to the work that plaintiff was to do under the contract previously made; and by necessary inference it subjected the granite setting to the appropriate general provisions respecting the method of performance and the time when the work was to be paid for.\n Were it otherwise, the requisition of March 9 could not be rejected merely on the ground that it called for a pay \n\n[248 U.S. 334, 346]\n\u00a0\n ment for granite work. We say this because there was clear evidence- apparently uncontradicted, and at least sufficient to go to the jury- tending to show that the granite setting was substantially completed by the early part of February, and that because the few blocks remaining to be set were arriving intermittently and could be set only at unreasonable cost, it was then at plaintiff's request agreed by defendant that plaintiff should set no more granite. This part of the work was thus brought to a close, or so the jury might find; in which event, if it constituted a separate contract, payable at completion, as the Circuit Court of Appeals held, plaintiff on March 9 was entitled to demand not only 85 per cent., but the entire amount due for granite setting.\n\n 4. \nThe court held the requisition of March 9 to be defective upon the further ground that it was based upon the unit price of $1.07 per cubic foot, pursuant to the understanding said to have been arrived at between the parties on February 2, instead of the actual cost of the work erected in the building as required by paragraph 12 of the contract. It was held that since the complaint alleged that plaintiff's demands for payment were made 'in accordance with the contract,' evidence to show the agreement made on February 2 about unit prices was not admissible without an amendment of the complaint setting up a modification of the contract.\n This view cannot be upheld. The allegation quoted from the complaint did but touch upon the performance of a condition precedent, concerning which the former niceties of pleading no longer obtain. And besides, evidence of the agreement of February 2 about unit prices was introduced at the first trial, and was particularly referred to in our opinion reviewing it (\n240 \nU.S. 273, 274\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 300); and the requisition of March 9, then as now relied upon by plaintiff, was excluded from consideration by us only because such details as were then furnished did not appear \n\n[248 U.S. 334, 347]\n\u00a0\n to bear out the estimate contained in it as to the amount of work that had been completed (\n240 U.S. 282\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 300), an omission that was supplied at the second trial. As the case went back for further proceedings in conformity with that opinion, the trial court doubtless considered that compliance with our mandate required the admission of the testimony as to the agreement of February 2, which furnished the basis of the requisition of March 9, and that no amendment of the pleadings was necessary. Were there doubt about this, we should deem it proper that the complaint be amended, or treated as if amended, even in the appellate court, rather than that the judgment should be reversed for so unimportant a variance, not in the least prejudicial to defendant.\n\n 5. \nThe final ground upon which the reversal was rested was an instruction given by the trial court to the jury upon the question of damages in the following terms:\n'If you find he [meaning plaintiff] was justified in terminating the contract as he did on May 22 upon the principles above given you, you can consider the reasonable expenditures incurred by the plaintiff, the unavoidable losses incident to stoppage, the amount of work actually performed, the amount plaintiff was actually entitled to by reason of such work at the contract price, and the profits which plaintiff could have made if allowed to complete the work under the contract. So the different items that you may, if you come to the question, take into account, are the outlays less the material on hand, the amount of work actually performed, and the profits, if you find there were any which were not speculative. The measure of profits is the contract price less what is shown to you as the expense of carrying out contract, if that is shown to you to your satisfaction.'\n\n The appellate court held this instruction to be misleading because it embodied a duplication of elements. Respecting this a difficult question would be presented if defendant were \n\n[248 U.S. 334, 348]\n\u00a0\n in a position to raise it. When the case was here before we assumed (\n240 \nU.S. 282, 283\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 300) that an instruction similarly phrased ought to have been granted at plaintiff's request had it been confined in its application to a recovery based upon a finding that the contract was rightfully terminated by the notice of May 22, 1912; but this was an assumption arguendo, and not a part of the matter decided.\n At the second trial this part of the charge was given by the court of its own motion, not at plaintiff's request; nor was it excepted to by defendant. The statement of the Circuit Court of Appeals to the contrary ( 241 Fed. 555, 154 C. C. A. 321) is not borne out by the record. The proposition criticized is not contained in any of the instructions requested by plaintiff; and, even had it been requested, there is no exception touching it, unless it be the following:\n'I will ask on behalf of the defendant an exception ... to the action of his honor ... in giving all instructions requested by plaintiff.'\n\n This is altogether too general to be regarded as directing the mind of the trial court to any single and precise point of alleged error so as to call for a reconsideration of the ruling, and hence could not furnish a basis for reversing the judgment. That an exception must be specific need not be emphasized. McDermott v. Severe, \n202 \nU.S. 600, 610\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 709; United States v. U. S. Fidelity Co., \n236 \nU.S. 512, 529\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 298.\n There was another exception, couched in these terms:\n'To that part of the charge to the effect that if the plaintiff had the right to terminate the contract under the authority of the Behan Case, the measure of damages would be not only the expenses incurred by the plaintiff, but also reasonable profits.'\n\n This, however, refers to another passage in which the trial court quoted from the headnote in \n110 U.S. 338\n, 4 Sup. Ct. 81. This clause contained no reference to the amount of work performed or what plaintiff was entitled to by reason of this work at the contract \n\n[248 U.S. 334, 349]\n\u00a0\n price; it mentioned only (a) plaintiff's outlay, and (b) the lost profits, embodied no duplication of elements, and was not erroneous.\n Having found that none of the grounds relied upon by the Circuit Court of Appeals for reversal of the judgment of the trial court is tenable, it remains to consider what judgment ought to have been rendered upon the record and bill of exceptions, in view of the assignments of error other than those we have thus far considered. United States v. U. S. Fidelity Co., \n236 \nU.S. 512, 528\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 298. There were 101 assignments in all, and these have been examined with the aid of respondent's brief, which extends to 250 pages, in addition to the oral argument; but we have found no ground for reversing the judgment of the trial court.\n Judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, and that of the District Court affirmed. \n\n\n\n","97":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHAMILTON v.

Thereafter Congress passed, and on November 21, 1918, the President approved the War- Time Prohibition Act (40 Stat. 1045, 1046, c. 212), which provides as follows:\n'That after June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and nineteen, until the conclusion of the present war and thereafter until the termination of demobilization, the date of which shall be determined and proclaimed by the President of the United States, for the purpose of conserving the man power of the Nation, and to increase efficiency in the production of arms, munitions, ships, food, and clothing for the army and navy, it shall be unlawful to sell for beverage purposes any distilled spirits, and during said time no distilled spirits held in bond shall be removed therefrom for beverage purposes except for export. ...'\n\n On October 10, 1919, the Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Company, owner of distillery warehouses and of whisky therein, brought in the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Kentucky a suit against Hamilton, collector of internal revenue for that district, alleging that the above act was void or had become inoperative, and praying that he be enjoined from interfering, by reason of that act, with the usual process of \n\n[251 U.S. 146, 154]\n\u00a0\n withdrawal, distribution and sale of the whisky in bond. The case was heard before the District Judge on plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction and defendant's motion to dismiss. A decision without opinion was rendered for the plaintiff; and, the defendant declining to plead further, a final decree was entered granting a permanent injunction in accordance with the prayer of the bill. A similar suit seeking like relief was brought on October 29, 1919, by Dryfoos, Blum & Co., in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York, against Edwards, collector for that district. That case was heard on November 5 before the District Judge on like motions for a preliminary injunction and to dismiss. An opinion was filed November 14, 1919, holding the act in force, and on the following day a final decree was entered dismissing the bill.\n The essential facts in the two cases differ in this: In the Kentucky case the whisky was stored in a distillery warehouse; the plaintiff was the maker of the whisky, had owned it prior to the passage of the act, and had, since June 30, 1919, paid the revenue tax on part of it. In the New York case the liquors were in general and special bonded warehouses, the plaintiffs were jobbers, and it does not appear when they became the owners of the liquors. Both cases come here by direct appeal under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1157 [Comp. St.  1215]), were argued on the same day, and may be disposed of together. Four contentions are made in support of the relief prayed for: (1) That the act was void when enacted because it violated the Fifth Amendment; (2) that it became void before these suits were brought by reason of the passing of the war emergency; (3) that it was abrogated or repealed by the Eighteenth Amendment; (4) that by its own terms it expired before the commencement of these suits. These contentions will be considered in their order.\n First. Is the act void because it takes private property \n\n[251 U.S. 146, 155]\n\u00a0\n for public purposes without compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment? The contention is this: The Constitution did not confer police power upon Congress. Its power to regulate the liquor traffic must therefore be sought for in the implied war powers; that is, the power 'to make all laws ... necessary and proper for carrying into execution' the war powers expressly granted. Article 1,  8, cl. 18. Congress might under this implied power temporarily regulate the sale of liquor and, if reasonably necessary, forbid its sale in order to guard and promote the efficiency of the men composing the army and the navy and of the workers engaged in supplying them with arms, munitions, transportation and supplies. McKinley v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 397, 399\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 324. But the exercise of the war powers is (except in respect to property destroyed by military operations, United States v. Pacific Railroad, \n120 \nU.S. 227, 239\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 490, and supervision, the council may United States v. Russell, 13 Wall. 623, 627. The severe restriction imposed by the act upon the disposition of liquors amounts to a taking of property, and, being uncompensated, would, at least as applied to liquors acquired before the passage of the act, exceed even the restriction held to be admissible under the broad police powers possessed by the states. Therefore, since it fails to make provision for compensation, which in every other instance Congress made when authorizing the taking or use of property for war purposes,1 it is void. Such is the argument of the plaintiffs below. \n\n[251 U.S. 146, 156]\n\u00a0\n That the United States lacks the police power, and that this was reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment, is true. But it is none the less true that when the United States exerts any of the powers conferred upon it by the Constitution, no valid objection can be based upon the fact that such exercise may be attended by the same incidents which attend the exercise by a state of its police power, or that it may tend to accomplish a similar purpose. Lottery Case, \n188 \nU.S. 321, 357\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 321; McCray v. United States, \n195 U.S. 27\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 769, 1 Ann. Cas. 561; Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, \n220 \nU.S. 45, 58\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 364; Hoke v. United States, \n227 U.S. 308\n, 323; 33 Sup. Ct. 281, 43 L. R. A. (N. S.) 906, Ann. Cas. 1913E, 905; Seven Cases v. United States, \n239 \nU.S. 510, 515\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 190, L. R. A. 1916D, 164; United States v. Doremus, \n249 \nU.S. 86, 93\n, 94 S., 39 Sup. Ct. 214. The war power of the United States, like its other powers and like the police power of the states, is subject to applicable constitutional limitations. (Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, 121-127; Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 312, 336\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 622; United States v. Joint Traffic Assoc., \n171 \nU.S. 505, 571\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 25; McCray v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 27, 61\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 769, 1 Ann. Cas. 561; United States v. Cress, \n243 \nU.S. 316, 326\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 380); but the Fifth Amendment imposes in this respect no greater limitation upon the national power than does the Fourteenth Amendment upon state power (In Re Kemmler, \n136 \nU.S. 436, 448\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 930; Carroll v. Greenwich Ins. Co., \n199 \nU.S. 401, 410\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 66). If the nature and conditions of a restriction \n\n[251 U.S. 146, 157]\n\u00a0\n upon the use or disposition of property is such that a state could, under the police power, impose it consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment without making compensation, then the United States may for a permitted purpose impose a like restriction consistently with the Fifth Amendment without making compensation; for prohibition of the liquor traffic is conceded to be an appropriate means of increasing out war efficiency.\n There was no appropriation of the liquor for public purposes. The War- Time Prohibition Act fixed a period of seven months and nine days from its passage during which liquors could be disposed of free from any restriction imposed by the federal government. Thereafter, until the end of the war and the termination of mobilization, it permits an unrestricted sale for export and, within the United States, sales for other than beverage purposes. The uncompensated restriction upon the disposition of liquors imposed by this act is of a nature far less severe than the restrictions upon the use of property acquired before the enactment of the prohibitory law which were held to be permissible in cases arising under the Fourteenth Amendment. Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623, 668\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 273; Kidd v. Pearson, \n128 \nU.S. 1, 23\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 6. The question whether an absolute prohibition of sale could be applied by a state to liquor acquired before the enactment of the prohibitory law has been raised by this court, but not answered, because unnecessary to a decision. Bartemeyer v. Iowa, 18 Wall. 129, 133; Beer Co. v. Massachusetts, \n97 \nU.S. 25, 32\n, 33 S.; Eberle v. Michigan, \n232 \nU.S. 700, 706\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 464; Barbour v. Georgia, \n249 \nU.S. 454, 459\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 316. See, however, Mugler v. Kansas, supra, \n123 \nU.S. 623, 625\n, 657 S., 8 Sup. Ct. 273. But no reason appears why a state statute, which postpones its effective date long enough to enable those engaged in the business to dispose of stocks on hand at the date of its enactment, should be obnoxious to the Fourteenth Amendment, or why such a federal law should be obnoxious \n\n[251 U.S. 146, 158]\n\u00a0\n to the Fifth Amendment. We cannot say that seven months and nine days was not a reasonable time within which to dispose of all liquors in bonded warehouses on November 21, 1918. The amount then in storage was materially less than was usually carried,2 because no such liquor could be lawfully made in America under the Lever Food and Fuel Control Act (Act Aug. 10, 1917, c. 53,  15, 40 Stat. 276, 282 [Comp. St. 1918,  3115 1\/8 l]) after September 9, 1917. And if, as is suggested, the liquors remaining in bond November 21, 1918, were not yet sufficiently ripened or aged to permit them to be advantageously disposed of within the limited period of seven months and nine days thereafter, the resulting inconvenience to the owner, attributable to the inherent qualities of the property itself, cannot be regarded as a taking of property in the constitutional sense. Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland Ry. Co., \n242 \nU.S. 311, 332\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 180, L. R. A. 1917B, 1218, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 845.\n Second. Did the Act become void by the passing of the war emergency before the commencement of these suits? It is conceded that the mere cessation of hostilities under the armistice did not abridge or suspend the power of Congress to resort to prohibition of the liquor traffic \n\n[251 U.S. 146, 159]\n\u00a0\n as a means of increasing our war efficiency, that the support and care of the army and navy during demobilization was within the war emergency, and that, hence, the act was valid when passed. The contention is that between the date of its enactment and the commencement of these suits it had become evident that hostilities would not be resumed, that demobilization had been effected, that thereby the war emergency was removed, and that when the emergency ceased the statute became void.\n To establish that the emergency has passed, statements and acts of the President and of other executive officers are adduced; some of them antedating the enactment of the statute here in question. There are statements of the President to the effect that the war has ended3 and peace has come,4 that certain war agencies and activities should be discontinued,5 that our enemies are impotent to renew hostilities6 and that the objects of the act here in question have been satisfied in the demobilization of the army and navy. \n7\n It is shown that many war-time activities have been suspended, that vast quantities of war materials have been disposed of, that trade with Germany has been resumed, and that the censorship of postal, telegraphic and wire communications has been removed. 8 But we have also the fact that since these statements were made and these acts \n\n[251 U.S. 146, 160]\n\u00a0\n were done, Congress, on October 28, 1919, passed over the President's veto the National Prohibition Act, which, in making further provision for the administration of the War-Time Prohibition Act, treats the war as continuing and demobilization as incomplete; that the Senate, on November 19, 1919, refused to ratify the Treaty of Peace with Germany;9 that under the provisions of the Lever Act the President resumed, on October 30, 1919, the control of the fuel supply which he had relinquished partly on January 31, 1919, and partly on February 20, 1919;10 that he is still operating the railroads, of which control had been taken as a war measure; and that on November 18, 1919, he vetoed Senate Bill 641, because it diminished that control,11 that pursuant to the Act of March 4, 1919, c. 125, 40 Stat. 1348, he continues to control, by means of the Food Administration Grain Corporation, the supply of grain and wheat flour; that through the United States Sugar Equalization Board, Incorporated, he still regulates the price of sugar; that in his message to Congress on December 2, 1919, he urgently recommended the further extension for six months of the powers of the Food Administration; that as commander-in-chief he stills keeps a part of the army in enemy occupied territory and another part in Siberia; and that he has refrained from issuing the proclamation declaring the termination of demobilization for which this act provides.\n The present contention may be stated thus: That notwithstanding the act was a proper exercise of the war power of Congress at the date of its approval and contains its own period of limitation-'until the conclusion of the present war and thereafter until the termination of demob \n\n[251 U.S. 146, 161]\n\u00a0\n ilization'-the progress of events since that time had produced so great a change of conditions and there now is so clearly a want of necessity for conserving the man power of the nation, for increased efficiency in the production of arms, munitions, and supplies, that the prohibition of the sale of distilled spirits for beverage purposes can no longer be enforced, because it would be beyond the constitutional authority of Congress in the exercise of the war power to impose such a prohibition under present circumstances. Assuming that the implied power to enact such a prohibition must depend, not upon the existence of a technical state of war, terminable only with the ratification of a treaty of peace or a proclamation of peace (United States v. Anderson, 9 Wall. 56, 70; The Protector, 12 Wall. 700, 702; Hijo v. United States, \n194 \nU.S. 315, 323\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 727), but upon some actual emergency or necessity arising out of the war or incident to it, still, as was said in Stewart v. Kahn, 11 Wall. 493, 507:\n'The power is not limited to victories in the field and the dispersion of the insurgent forces. It carries with it inherently the power to guard against the immediate renewal of the conflict, and to remedy the evils which have arisen from its rise and progress.'\n\n No principle of our constitutional law is more firmly established than that this court may not, in passing upon the validity of a statute, inquire into the motives of Congress. United States v. Des Moines Navigation Co., \n142 \nU.S. 510, 544\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 308; McCray v. United States, \n195 U.S. 27\n, 53-59, 24 Sup. Ct. 769, 1 Ann. Cas. 561; Weber v. Freed, \n239 \nU.S. 325, 330\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 131, Ann. Cas. 1916C, 317; Dakota Central Telephone Co. v. South Dakota, \n250 \nU.S. 163, 184\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 507. Nor may the court inquire into the wisdom of the legislation. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421; Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 197; Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., \n240 \nU.S. 1, 25\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 236, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713, L. R. A. 1917D, 414; Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis, \n240 \nU.S. 342, 357\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 370, L. R. A. 1917A, 421, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 455. Nor may it pass upon the necessity for the exercise of a power possessed, since the possible abuse of a \n\n[251 U.S. 146, 162]\n\u00a0\n power is not an argument against its existence. Lottery Case, \n188 \nU.S. 321, 363\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 321.\n That a statute valid when enacted may cease to have validity owing to a change of circumstances has been recognized, with respect to state laws, in several rate cases. Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 473\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 729, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18; Missouri Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 474, 508\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 976; Lincoln Gas Co. v. Lincoln, \n250 \nU.S. 256, 268\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 454. That the doctrine is applicable to acts of Congress was conceded arguendo in Perrin v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 478, 486\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 387, and Johnson v. Gearlds, \n234 \nU.S. 422, 446\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 794. In each of these cases Congress had prohibited the introduction of liquor into lands inhabited by Indians without specified limit of time; in one case, the prohibition was in terms perpetual; in the other, it was to continue 'until otherwise provided by Congress.' In both cases it was contended that the constitutional power of Congress over the subject-matter necessarily was limited to what was reasonably essential to the protection of the Indians. In the Perrin Case it was contended (\n232 U.S. 482\n, 34 Sup Ct. 387) that the power was transcended because the prohibition embraced territory greatly in excess of what the situation reasonably required, and because its operation was not confined to a designated period reasonable in duration but apparently was intended to be perpetual. In Johnson v. Gearlds the contention was (\n234 U.S. 442\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 794) that a prohibition originally valid had become obsolete by reason of changes in the character of the territory included in it and the status of the Indians therein. In both cases the court, while assuming that since the power to impose a prohibition of this character was incident to the presence of the Indians and their status as wards of the government and did not extend beyond what was reasonably essential to their protection it followed that a prohibition valid in the beginning would become inoperative when in regular course the Indians affected were completely emancipated from federal guardianship and control, \n\n[251 U.S. 146, 163]\n\u00a0\n nevertheless held that the courts would not be justified in declaring that the restriction either was originally invalid or had become obsolete if any considerable number of Indians remained wards of the government within the prohibited territory. In each case the decision rested upon the ground that the question what was reasonably essential to the protection of the Indians was one primarily for the consideration of the lawmaking body, that Congress was invested with a wide discretion, and that its action, unless purely arbitrary, must be accepted and given full effect by the courts.\n Conceding, then, for the purposes of the present case, that the question of the continued validity of the War-Time Prohibition Act under the changed circumstances depends upon whether it appears that there is no longer any necessity for the prohibition of the sale of distilled spirits for beverage purposes, it remains to be said that on obvious grounds every reasonable intendment must be made in favor of its continuing validity, the prescribed period of limitation not having arrived; that to Congress in the exercise of its powers, not least the war power, upon which the very life of the nation depends, a wide latitude of discretion must be accorded; and that it would required a clear case to justify a court in declaring that such an act, passed for such a purpose, had ceased to have force because the power of Congress no longer continued. In view of facts of public knowledge, some of which have been referred to, that the treaty of peace had not yet been concluded, that the railways are still under national control by virtue of the war powers, that other war activities have not been brought to a close, and that it cannot even be said that the man power of the nation has been restored to a peace footing, we are unable to conclude that the act has ceased to be valid.\n Third. Was the act repealed by the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment? By the express terms of the \n\n[251 U.S. 146, 164]\n\u00a0\n amendment the prohibition thereby imposed becomes effective after one year from its ratification. Ratification was proclaimed on January 29, 1919 (40 Stat., part 2, appendix p. 1942). The contention is that, as the amendment became on its adoption an integral part of the Constitution, its implications are as binding as its language; that in postponing the effective date of the prohibition the amendment impliedly guaranteed to manufacturers and dealers in intoxicating liquors a year of grace; and that not only was Congress prohibited thereby from enacting meanwhile new prohibitory legislation, but also that the then existing restriction imposed by the War-Time Prohibition Act was removed. See Narragansett Brewing Co. v. Baker & O'Shaunessy (U. S. D. Ct. R. I., November 12, 1919).\n The Eighteenth Amendment, with its implications, if any, is binding, not only in times of peace, but in war. If there be found by implication a denial to Congress of the right to forbid before its effective date any prohibition of the liquor traffic, that denial must have been operative immediately upon the adoption of the amendment, although at that time demobilization of the army and the navy was far from complete. If the amendment effected such a denial of power, then it would have done so equally, had hostilities continued flagrant or been renewed. Furthermore, the amendment is binding alike upon the United States and the individual states. If it guarantees a year of immunity from interference by the federal government with the liquor traffic, even to the extent of abrogating restrictions existing at the time of its adoption, it is difficult to see why the guaranty does not extend also to immunity from interference by the individual states, with like results also as to then existing state legislation. The contention is clearly unsound.\n Fourth. Did the prohibition imposed by the act expire by limitation before the commencement of these suits? The period therein prescribed is 'until the conclusion of \n\n[251 U.S. 146, 165]\n\u00a0\n the present war and thereafter until the termination of demobilization, the date of which shall be determined and proclaimed by the President of the United States.' It is contended both that the war has been concluded and that the demobilization has terminated.\n In the absence of specific provisions to the contrary the period of war has been held to extend to the ratification of the treaty of peace or the proclamation of peace. Hijo v. United States, \n194 \nU.S. 315, 323\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 727; The Protector, 12 Wall. 700, 702, 20 Ed. 463; United States v. Anderson, 9 Wall. 56, 70. From the fact that other statutes concerning war activities contain each a specific provision for determining when it shall cease to be operative,12 and from the alleged absence of \n\n[251 U.S. 146, 166]\n\u00a0\n such a provision here, it is argued that the term 'conclusion of the war' should not be given its ordinary legal meaning; that instead it should be construed as the time when actual hostilities ceased; or when the treaty of peace was signed at Versailles, on June 28, 1919, by the American and German representatives; or, more generally, when the actual war emergencies ceased by reason of our complete victory and the disarmament of the enemy, coupled with the demobilization of our army and the closing of war activities; or when the declared purpose of the act of 'conserving the man power of the nation, and to increase \n\n[251 U.S. 146, 167]\n\u00a0\n efficiency in the production of arms, munitions, ships, food, and clothing for the army and navy' shall have been fully satisfied. But there is nothing in the words used to justify such a construction. 'Conclusion of the war' clearly did not mean cessation of hostilities, because the act was approved 10 days after hostilities had ceased upon the signing of the armistice. Nor may we assume that Congress intended by the phrase to designate the date when the Treaty of Peace should be signed at Versailles or elsewhere by German and American representatives, since by the Constitution a treaty is only a proposal until approved by the Senate. Furthermore, to construe 'conclusion of the war' as meaning the actual termination of war activities, would leave wholly uncertain the date when the act would cease to be operative; whereas Congress evinced here, as in other war statutes, a clear purpose that the date of expiration should be definitely fixed. The reason why this was not directed to be done by a proclamation of peace is made clear by the use of the word 'thereafter.' It was expected that the 'conclusion of the war' would precede the termination of demobilization. Congress, therefore, provided that the time when the act ceased to be operative should be fixed by the President's ascertaining and proclaiming the date when demobilization had terminated.\n It is insisted that he has done so. The contention does violence to both the language and the evident purpose of the provision. The 'date of which shall be determined and proclaimed by the President' is a phrase so definite as to leave no room for construction. This requirement cannot be satisfied by passing references in messages to Congress, nor by newspaper interviews with high officers of the army or with officials of the War Department. When the President mentioned in his veto message the 'demobilization of the army and navy,' the words were doubtless used in a popular sense, \n\n[251 U.S. 146, 168]\n\u00a0\n just as he had declared to Congress, on the occasion of the signing of the armistice: 'The war thus comes to an end.' If he had believed on October 28, 1919, that demobilization had, in an exact sense, terminated, he would doubtless have issued then a proclamation to that effect; for he had manifested a strong conviction that restriction upon the sale of liquor should end. Only by such proclamation could the purpose of Congress be attained, and the serious consequences attending uncertainty be obviated. But in fact demobilization had not terminated at the time of the veto of the act of October 28, 1919, or at the time these suits were begun, and, for aught that appears, it has not yet terminated. The report of the Secretary or War made to the President under date of November 11, 1919 ( and transmitted to Congress on December 1), in describing the progress of demobilization, shows (p. 17) that during the preceding ten days (November 1-10) 2,018 officers and 10,266 enlisted men had been discharged; the rate of discharge being substantially the same as during the month of October, in which 8,690 officers and 33,000 enlisted men were discharged.\n The War-Time Prohibition Act being thus valid and still in force, the decree in No. 589 is reversed, and the case is remanded to the District Court, with directions to dismiss the bill; and the decree in No. 602 is affirmed.\n No. 589. Reversed.\n No. 602. Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] War Acts authorizing the seizure or requisition of property:\n March 4, 1917, c. 180, 39 Stat. 1168, 1193 (Comp.

CITY OF MUSKOGEE, OKL.(1919)\nNo. 360\nArgued: Decided: June 9, 1919\n\n\n\n Messrs. B. B. Blakeney and James H. Maxey, both of Tulsa, Okl., and Grant Foreman and James D. Simms, both of Muskogee, Okl., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Nathan A. Gibson and Joseph L. Hull, both of Muskogee, Okl., for defendants in error. \n\n[250 U.S. 454, 455]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiffs in error, owners of real estate in the cityo f Muskogee, brought suit in an Oklahoma state court seeking an injunction to restrain the city and its officials from encumbering their lands with a special assessment to pay for the construction of a sewer in sewer district No. 12 of that city, contending that the statutes of the state and the ordinances of the city under which the district was created and the cost of the sewers therein assessed against the property within the district were in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, in that they deprived plaintiffs of their property without due process of law. The trial court refused relief, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma affirmed its judgment (168 Pac. 445), and the case comes here by writ of error.\n The statutes, as they existed at the time the proceedings in question were had, are to be found in Snyder's Comp. Laws Okl. 1909,  984-993. They authorize the mayor and councilmen in any municipal corporation having a population of not less than 1,000 to establish a general sewer system composed of public, district, and private sewers, and also to cause district sewers to be constructed within districts having limits prescribed by ordinance; the cost of district sewers to be apportioned against all lots and pieces of ground in the district in proportion to area, disregarding improvements and excluding the public highways.\n It is contended that the statute is void because it gives no notice to property owners and makes no provision for hearing them as to the formation of the district or its boundaries, the proposed plan or method of building the sewer, or the amount to be assessed upon property in the district. While it is conceded to have been established by previous decisions of this court that, where the Legislature \n\n[250 U.S. 454, 456]\n\u00a0\n fixes by law the area of a sewer district or the property which is to be assessed, no advance notice to the property owner of such legislative action is necessary in order to constitute due process of law, it is insisted that in the present case the Legislature has not done this, and hence it is essential to the protection of the fundamental rights of the property owner that at some stage of the proceeding he have notice and an opportunity to be heard upon the question whether his property is erroneously included in the sewer district because it cannot be benefited by the sewer, or for any other reason is improperly subjected to assessment.\n But we find it to be settled by decisions of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, which as to this are conclusive upon us, that in respect to the establishment and construction of local sewer systems and the exercise of the power of taxation in aid of this purpose, the entire legislative power of the state has been delegated to the municipalities. In City of Perry v. Davis, 18 Okl. 427, p. 445, 90 Pac. 865, p. 870, referring to this same legislation the court held:\n'When the Legislature delegated the power to the mayor and councilmen of municipal corporations in this territory, having a bona fide population of not less than 1,000 persons, to establish a general sewer system, that delegation of power carried with it all the incidental powers necessary to carry its object into effect within the law. Of what utility would such a grant of power be if unaccompanied with sufficient power to carry it into effect? Under our system the power of taxation is vested exclusively in the legislative branch of the government but it is a power that may be delegated by the Legislature to municipal corporations, which are mere instrumentalities of the state for the better administration of public affairs. When such a corporation is created it becomes vested with the power of taxation to sustain itself with all necessary public improvements, unless the exercise of that \n\n[250 U.S. 454, 457]\n\u00a0\n power be expressly prohibited. That the mayor and council of the city of Perry was authorized to establish and construct a necessary sewer system for the city, in the absence of prohibitive statutes, should not be questioned. The power to establish and construct a sewer systm carried with it the power to create indebtedness and taxation for its payment.'\n\n The court further held that the act constituted due process, and that the passage and publication of an ordinance establishing a sewer district constituted sufficient notice and conferred jurisdiction upon the city authorities to perform the work and provide payment therefor. This was followed in City of Muskogee v. Rambo, 40 Okl. 672, 680, 138 Pac. 567, and also in the present case.\n So far, therefore, as the present ordinance determined that a district sewer should be constructed, and established the bounds of the district for the purpose of determining what property should be subjected to the special cost of constructing it, there was an authorized exercise of the legislative power of the state, which, according to repeated decisions of this court, was not wanting in due process of law because of the mere fact that there was no previous notice to the property owners or opportunity to be heard. The question of distributing or apportioning the burden of the cost among the particular property owners is another matter. Spencer v. Merchant, \n125 \nU.S. 345, 355\n, 357 S., 8 Sup. Ct. 921; Paulsen v. Portland, \n149 \nU.S. 30, 40\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 750; French v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co., \n181 \nU.S. 324, 343\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 625; Shumate v. Heman, \n181 U.S. 402\n, 21 Sup.

Ct. 200.\n We do not mean to say that if in fact it were made to appear that there was an arbitrary and unwarranted exercise of the legislative power, or some denial of the equal protection of the laws in the method of exercising it, \n\n[250 U.S. 454, 458]\n\u00a0\n judicial relief would not be accorded to parties aggrieved. The facts of this case raise no such question. See Wagner v. Baltimore, \n239 \nU.S. 207, 220\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 66; Houck v. Little River District, \n239 \nU.S. 254, 265\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 58; Myles Salt Co. v. Iberia Drainage District, \n239 \nU.S. 478, 485\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 204, L. R. A. 1918E, 190; Gast Realty Co. v. Schneider Granite Co., \n240 \nU.S. 55, 59\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 254.\n The chief reliance of plaintiff in error is upon those decisions which have held that where the Legislature, instead of determining for itself what lands shall be included in a district or what lands will be benefited by the construction of a sewer, submits the question to some board or other inferior tribunal with administrative or quasi judicial authority, the inquiry becomes in its nature judicial in such a sense that property owners are entitled to a hearing or an opportunity to be heard before their lands are included. Fallbrook Irrigation District v. Bradley, \n164 \nU.S. 112, 166\n, 167 S., 174, 175, 17 Sup. Ct. 56; Parsons v. District of Columbia, \n170 \nU.S. 45, 52\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 521; Embree v. Kansas City Road District, \n240 \nU.S. 242, 247\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 317. But they have no application to a case where, as in the case before us, full legislative power over the subject-matter has been conferred by the state upon a municipal corporation. Where that has been done, a legislative determination by the local legislative body is of the same effect as though made by the general Legislature. Withnell v. Ruecking Construction Co., \n249 \nU.S. 63, 70\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 200.\n It is suggested further that the statutes and ordinances in question were wanting in due process, in that they afforded the property owner no opportunity to be heard as to the distribution of the cost of the sewer among the different properties in the district or the ascertainment of the amount of the assessment to be imposed upon the lands of plaintiffs in error. Respecting this it is sufficient to say that as the Legislature itself has prescribed that the entire costo f a district sewer shall be apportioned against the lots in the district in proportion to area ( excluding \n\n[250 U.S. 454, 459]\n\u00a0\n the highways), there is no occasion for a hearing with respect to the mode in which the assessment shall be apportioned, since this is resolved into a mere mathematical calculation. And it is settled by the cases above cited that whether the entire amount or a part only of the cost of a local improvement shall be imposed as a special tax upon the property benefited, and whether the tax shall be distributed upon a consideration of the particular benefit to particular lots or apportioned according to their frontage upon the streets, their values, or their area, is a matter of legislative discretion, subject, of course, to judicial relief in cases of actual abuse of power or of substantial error in executing it, neither of which is here asserted.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","99":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHARDIN-WYANDOT LIGHTING CO. v. VILLAGE OF UPPER SANDUSKY(1919)\nNo. 10\nArgued: October 13, 1919Decided: December 15, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[251 U.S. 173, 174]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. H. T. Mathers and Andrew Squire, both of Cleveland, Ohio, for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. W. R. Hare, of Upper Sandusky, Ohio, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1889 the council of the village of Upper Sandusky, Ohio, enacted an ordinance, authorizing an electric light and power company, and its assigns, to use the streets of the village for the purpose of erecting and operating electric light wires for the distribution of electric light and power. The ordinance declared that: 'The privilege hereby granted' shall entitle the company 'to manufacture, sell and distribute light and power by means of electricity to the citizens of the village for public and private uses.'\n The grantee, accepting the franchise, constructed a generating plant, erected poles, wires and lamps, and until the year 1912 lighted the streets of the village and sold current to private consumers. In that year the plant and franchise were purchased by the plaintiff in error, hereinafter referred to as the company, which continued to light the streets until the contract which its predecessor had with the village expired. Upon the expiration of that contract the parties entered upon negotiations for a new one, but, failing to agree, the company in October, 1913, removed all of its street lights and took down its poles and \n\n[251 U.S. 173, 175]\n\u00a0\n wires used for such lighting, but continued its commercial business.\n In about a year after the company ceased to light the village streets this action was commenced by the filing of a petition by the village which, averring the facts we have stated, further alleged that prior to the removal of the street lighting appliances the village had submitted to the company a schedule of fair prices which it was able and willing to pay for street lighting and which it was willing to authorize the company to charge for commercial lighting and for power, but this was rejected; that by dismantling its street lighting system the company had rendered itself wholly unable to furnish any light whatever for the purpose of public lighting; that, without the consent of the village, it was threatening to place new poles and wires in the streets 'to further advance its private interests'; that it had forfeited all rights in the streets, and that it was not possible for the village and company to agree upon terms for future lighting.\n The prayer was that the company be enjoined from erecting additional poles, that its franchise be declared forfeited and that it be required to remove all of its equipment from the public streets.\n The trial court dismissed the petition, but on appeal the Court of Appeals enjoined the company from erecting poles, wires or lamps in the streets 'until the consent of said village shall have been obtained.' This decree was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Ohio in the judgment we are reviewing.\n In its opinion the Supreme Court held that there was no bill of exceptions or properly authenticated finding of facts before it and that therefore the case must be decided upon the assumption that all of the allegations of the petition were sustained by the evidence; that at the time the ordinance of 1889 was passed and accepted, the applicable state statute provided that the 'mode' of use of \n\n[251 U.S. 173, 176]\n\u00a0\n the streets 'shall be such as shall be agreed upon between the municipal authorities of the ... village and the company, but, if they cannot agree, the probate court of the county shall direct what the mode of use shall be' (R. S. 1880)  3471a, as added by 84 O. L. 7, and R. S.  3461; and that by an act of the Legislature passed in 1896, seven years after the date of the village ordinance, the state law was amended into the form which continued to the time of trial, providing that 'in order to subject the same to municipal control alone, no person or company shall place, string, construct or maintain any line, wire fixture or appliance of any kind for conducting electricity for lighting, heating or power purposes through any street,' etc., 'without the consent of such municipality.' 92 O. L. 204.\n This amended law of 1896 is made the basis of the only contention in the case which is sufficiently substantial for special notice, viz., that by it the obligation was impaired of the contract which the company had with the state and village, arising from its acceptance of the ordinance of 1889, and that it was thereby deprived of its property without due process of law.\n As we have seen, when the ordinance of 1889 was passed the statute then in force, provided that the 'mode' in which the streets could be used for electric lighting and power appliances must be agreed upon between the village and the company, but that if they failed to agree it must be determined by the probate court, and the amendment, now claimed to be unconstitutional, consisted simply in giving to the municipality the exclusive control over the erection of any such appliances in the streets instead of the prior qualified control. In this case the original 'mode' of use was determined by agreement without action by the probate court.\n The prayer of the petition was that because of the dismantling of the street lighting plant and of its refusal to \n\n[251 U.S. 173, 177]\n\u00a0\n agree to reasonable rates for the future, all rights of the company in the streets should be declared forfeited and that it should be ordered to remove from them all of its constructions, but the decree of the Court of Appeals, affirmed by the Supreme Court, went to the extent, only, of restraining the company from erecting any poles and wires in the streets 'until the consent of the village shall have been obtained.' There was nothing in the decree affecting the maintenance or renewal of such poles and wires as were in use for private lighting, when the case was commenced, and that this omission was of deliberate purpose appears from the fact that both courts held that the state statutes in force at the time the grant became effective and the form of the proceeding, were such, that a decree annulling such rights as the company had then retained in the streets could not properly be entered in the cause. On this point the Supreme Court said:\n'In this posture of the case, while in view of the statutory provisions which were in force at the inception of the enterprise the village would not be entitled to annul the company's rights, still, by reason of the facts stated above and the voluntary abandonment by the company of its rights and privileges to the extent set forth, it cannot now return and repossess itself of such rights as it abandoned without the consent of the village in accordance with existing law.'\n\n From this state of the record we conclude that the state Supreme Court did not intend to deal with the right of the company to maintain repair or replace such poles and wires as it was using for commercial lighting when the case was commenced, but that its injunction was intended to prohibit restoring of the street lighting poles and wires which had been taken down and all new additional construction 'until the consent of said village shall have been obtained,' and so restrained its judgment will be affirmed, based, as it is, upon the statute of 1896, which the court \n\n[251 U.S. 173, 178]\n\u00a0\n holds, upon abundant reason and authority, was passed in a reasonable exercise of the police power of the state.\n This act was a general one, applicable to all electric lighting companies then operating, or which might thereafter operate, in the state, and all that it did was to give to the municipal authorities complete control over the placing in the streets of poles and wires for conducting electricity for lighting and power purposes, instead of the like control which they had when the franchise was granted, but subject to resort to the probate court in case of disagreement with the company as to the 'mode' of using the streets.\n We cannot doubt that the danger to life and property from wires carrying high tension electric current through village streets is so great that the subject is a proper one for regulation by the exercise of the police power and very certainly the authorities of the municipality immediately interested in the safety and welfare of its citizens are a proper agency to have charge of such regulation. Any modification of its rights which the company may suffer from this law passed in a reasonable exercise of the police power does not constitute an impairing of the obligation of its contract with the state or village and is not a taking of its property without due process of law within the meaning of the constitutional prohibition. Northern Pacific Railway Co. et al. v. Puget Sound & Willapa Harbor Railway Co., \n250 U.S. 332\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 474, and cases cited.\n Of the contention that if an ordinance passed in 1915 by the village, repealing the ordinance of 1889, were given effect it would result in impairing the obligation of the contract, it is enough to say that it first appears in a supplemental answer filed in the court of appeals, and the case, as we have seen, was disposed of on the assumption that all of the allegations of the petition were sustained by the evidence. No effect whatever was given to that ordinance, either by the Court of Appeals or by the Supreme \n\n[251 U.S. 173, 179]\n\u00a0\n Court, but each reached the conclusion we are reviewing independently of, and without reference to it.

SELDOMRIDGE(1919)\nNo. 173\nArgued: January 31, 1919Decided: March 3, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[249 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles E. Hughes and Henry B. Wesselman, both of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[249 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Stuart G. Gibboney and William A. Barber, both of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n\n[249 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Following the failure in March, 1915, of the Mercantile National Bank of Pueblo, Colo., the receive appointed by the comptroller commenced this suit to recover from the Harriman National Bank of New York City $30,000 alleged to be due to the Mercantile Bank. On issue joined before a jury, the court, after refusing a request of the Harriman National Bank for a peremptory instruction directing a verdict in its favor, granted a request of like character made by the receiver, and a judgment on the resulting verdict for the amount claimed was entered.\n The case is before us on error to the judgment of the court below affirming that of the trial court, our jurisdiction to review resulting because the case from its inception involved the enforcement of the National Banking Act, and therefore, was not dependent in the trial court solely upon diversity of citizenship. Auten v. \n\n[249 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n United States National Bank, \n174 \nU.S. 125, 141\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 628; International Trust Co. v. Weeks, \n203 \nU.S. 364, 366\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 69.\n The case is this: W. B. Slaughter, through stock ownership, controlled the Mercantile National Bank of Pueblo, Colo. He was president and his son, C. C. Slaughter, was cashier. Prior to 1915, Slaughter, the president, removed his residence from Pueblo to Texas, engaging there in the cattle business and leaving his son, the cashier, in complete control of the Mercantile Bank and of all its affairs. W. B. Slaughter was also the president of the Silverton National Bank of Silverton, Colo., and controlled the affairs of that bank by the ownership of a majority of its stock. At Silverton there was another national bank carrying on business, the First National, the majority of whose stock was owned by one Thatcher.\n The correspondent of the Mercantile Bank in New York City was the Harriman National, with which it had a checking account. On January 28, 1915, C. C. Slaughter, the cashier of the Mercantile, dictated a letter to the Harriman which was dated at Pueblo and written on the letter head of the Mercantile Bank, purporting to be from W. B. Slaughter, whose signature was affixed by a rubber stamp. By this letter its assumed writer, after referring to his ownership and control of the Silverton National, stated his purpose to buy out the interest of Thatcher in the First National Bank of Silverton and after doing so to consolidate the two banks, and requested a loan of $30,000 to enable him to accomplish the purpose. It was stated that it was proposed to evidence the loan by a note at 60 days, to be signed by the writer, W. B. Slaughter, and by his son C. C. Slaughter, if the bank so desired, and to secure the note by the pledge of 500 shares of the Mercantile and 400 shares of the First National of Silverton. The Harriman Bank received this letter on the 1st of February and at once telegraphed W. B. Slaughter, president of the Mercantile Bank at Pueblo, \n\n[249 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n that, whenever desired, the Harriman would be willing to make the loan, as requested. On the same day the bank wrote a letter to W. B. Slaughter, president at Pueblo, but marked it personal, repeating and confirming the telegram, and inclosing a blank form of collateral note to be executed and sent to the bank with the collateral when the money was desired.\n The telegram of the 1st of February announcing the willingness of the Harriman Bank to make the loan having come into the hands C. C. Slaughter on the day it was sent, he ordered a seal to be made which he said was intended as the seal of the First National Bank of Silverton, and on the 5th of February bought from a printer blank forms of certificates of stock. On the next day, Saturday, the 6th, purporting to act as agent of W. B. Slaughter, C. C. Slaughter bought from Thatcher his interest in the First National of Silverton, and gave a check in the name of W. B. Slaughter and as his representative, on the Mercantile National, for $35,000 in part payment. On Sunday, February 7th, C. C. Slaughter caused a letter to be prepared falsely purporting to be written and signed by W. B. Slaughter, acknowledging the receipt of the telegram sent by the Harriman Bank on the 1st and asking that the loan be consummated. In this letter there was returned the collateral note which the bank and sent for execution, along with the promised collateral, that is, certificates for 400 shares of the First National of Silverton and 500 shares of the Mercantile at Pueblo. The signature of W. B. Slaughter to the note was forged and the collaterials were also forged, the first, the certificates of the Silverton Bank stock, because they were fabricated by the use of the printed certificates and seal which had been acquired a few days before and described shares which had no existence, and the second, the Mercantile Bank stock, because, although the certificates represented stock standing in the name of W. B. Slaughter on the \n\n[249 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n books of that bank, the powers of attorney purporting to have been given by W. B. Slaughter to enable them to be transferred to the Harriman Bank were forged.\n To meet the check for $35,000 given on Saturday for the Thactcher purchase, on Monday morning, February 8th, C. C. Slaughter made out a deposit slip to show the deposit by W. B. Slaughter of a check on the Harriman National for $30,000, although no such check was in fact deposited; and on that day the check on favor of Thatcher for $35,000 was paid and debited by the Mercantile to W. B. Slaughter's account. The letter of the 7th sending to note to the Harriman reached that bank on the 10th, and, complying with the request it contained, a credit in favor of W. B. Slaughter for $30,000, the amount covered by the loan, was entered by the Harriman on its books.\n On the 17th of February the Mercantile Bank overdrew its account in the Harriman to the extent of $8,000, which that bank honored. It, however, telegraphed the Mercantile, calling attention to the overdraft and asked whether a remittance to cover it had been made. The telegram, moreover, referred to the $30,000 credit in favor of W. B. Slaughter and asked whether possibly it was intended that the amount of the loan credit should be placed to the account of the bank. In reply, C. C. Slaughter dictated a telegram in the name of the Mercantile Bank instructing that the amount of the credit of W. B. Slaughter be transferred to the credit of the Mercantile. On the receipt of this telegram the Harriman made the necessary bookkeeping entries to transfer the credit of $30,000 from the account of W. B. Slaughter to that of the Mercantile National Bank. On the next day, the 18th, however, the Harriman worte W. B. Slaughter, Mercantile National Bank, Pueblo, informing him of the instructions they had received from C. C. Slaughter and what they had done under them, and asking \n\n[249 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n the former's approval. This letter was replied to on February 22d by C. C. Slaughter confirming his previous telegram and saying that the original intention was that the money borrowed should go to the credit of the Mercantile Bank for the use of W. B. Slaughter.\n Thus things stood until the 23d of March, when the Harriman received a telegram from W. B. Slaughter, president of the Mercantile Bank, telling them to cancel all authority of C. C. Slaughter to act as an officer of the Mercantile because he had resigned. The Harriman thereupon telegraphed and wrote W. B. Slaughter, informing him of what had transpired on the subject of the credit for the loan under the note and its transfer, and saying that, as he had given no personal instructions on the subject, they had made bookkeeping entries taking the $30,000 out of the account of the Mercantile so as to hold it for a full understanding of the situation; and when, a few days later, the Harriman learned of the failure of the Mercantile, such entries were made as to cancel the loan without diminishing or changing the credits which otherwise existed in favor of the Mercantile.\n Subsequently W. B. Slaughter notified the Harriman that he had never applied for the loan in question, or signed the note which evidenced it, and denied all liability. The appointment of the receiver and the bringing of the suit which we have stated at the outset followed in due season.\n Passing the fact that both parties to the loan agreement, the Harriman Bank on the one side and W. B. Slaughter on the other, insist, although for different reasons, that the loan agreement has no existence, there nevertheless can be no room for dispute that such contract, by the failure to comply with its conditions and by the fraud and forgery committed concerning the collaterals as between the parties to it and those in privity, was rightly canceled and can be the source of no obligation against \n\n[249 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n the Harriman Bank. The right of the Mercantile Bank as here asserted, if it has any existence, must rest, therefore, not in the loan agreement, but on some condition or consideration extraneous to that contract creating as against the Harriman and in favor of the Mercantile the duty to pay the amount which both the courts below awarded.\n No semblance of ground, however, supporting that view results from the undisputed facts which we have stated unless it can be sustained from two considerations: (1) The payment which was made by the Mercantile on February 8th of the check purporting to be drawn by W. B. Slaughter in favor of Thatcher and the making by C. C. Slaughter on the 8th of the fraudulent and false deposit slip purporting to show the deposit on that day by W. B. Slaughter of a check drawn by him on the Harriman for $30,000; and (2) the bookkeeping entries which were made by the Harriman on the 18th transferring the credit for the amount of the agreed loan from the account of W. B. Slaughter to that of the Mercantile Bank. But a moment's thought demonstrates that the circumstances referred to cannot possibly sustain the conclusions stated. This is true as to the first because both the payment of the check by the Mercantile and the making of the false deposit slip took place before the Harriman had even received the collateral note or made any entry on its books concerning the same; and the second because the mere bookkeeping entry made by the Harriman of credit to the Mercantile, in the very nature of things, was incapable alone of conferring rights on the Mercantile to which it was not otherwise entitled, especially in the absence of all consideration moving from the Mercantile to the Harriman and the nonexistence of any condition upon which to base even the pretext of estoppel in favor of the Mercantile as against the Harriman resulting from action taken by the former upon the faith of the book \n\n[249 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n keeping credit. Indeed, when the reasoning upon which the relief below was awarded is considered, and the arguments pressed at bar sustaining that result are weighed, they all at last come to the assumption that by some undisclosed process the Mercantile Bank was entitled to enforce as against the Harriman the contract for the loan agreement made with W. B. Slaughter, without the duty to comply with the obligations of that contract, and therefore became possessed of the power to enforce the contract against the Harriman despite the fraud and forgery practiced upon the Harriman in the attempt which was made to procure the benefits of the loan agreement.\n It follows that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals (240 Fed. 111, 153 C. C. A. 147) and that of the District Court must be and they are reversed, and the case be remanded to the District Court with instructions, that after setting aside its judgment, it take such further proceedings as may be in conformity with this opinion.\n And it is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","101":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHARTFORD LIFE INS CO. v.

German, both of Kansas City, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit, on a life insurance policy or certificate, in which judgment was rendered against the company, petitioner, successively, by three courts of the state of Missouri. The case is in this court on writ of certiorari granted on the asserted ground that the state Supreme Court failed and refused to give full faith and credit to the judgment and decree of a superior court of the state of Connecticut, and also to the petitioner's charter, 'a public record and act of the state of Connecticut,' in violation of the rights secured to it by article 4, section 1, of the Constitution of the United States.\n Respondent moves to dismiss the writ for want of jurisdiction.\n The decree of the superior court of Connecticut, to which it is claimed full faith and credit was denied, was rendered in the case of Charles H. Dresser et al. v. Hartford Life Insurance Company, of Hartford, Conn., the petitioner. The character of this decree and \n\n[249 U.S. 490, 492]\n\u00a0\n the effect which must be given to it when properly pleaded and introduced in evidence in courts of other states are both sufficiently stated in Hartford Life Insurance Co. v. Ibs, \n237 U.S. 662\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 692, L. R. A. 1916A, 765, and in Hartford Life Insurance Co. v. Barber, \n245 U.S. 146\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 54.\n The respondent, on this motion to dismiss, does not seek to have the decisions in the cases cited modified, but asserts that the claim of right now made was not so 'set up or claimed' in the state courts that full faith and credit could be or was denied to the Dresser decree.\n The judgment in this case in the trial court was rendered against the petitioner in September, 1909, and the decree in the Dresser Case was not rendered until six months later, in March, 1910. The latter decree was not set up in any pleading and was not introduced in evidence in this case. The only way in which it came to the notice of the Missouri courts was in argument and as an exhibit to a brief filed in the appellate courts and the Supreme Court of Missouri dealt with it in this single paragraph:\n'The case at bar was tried below on May 12, 1909, which was prior in time to the entering of the decree in the Dresser Case, and the record in the Dresser Case was therefore not offered or presented in the trial of this case. Since the record of the Dresser Case is in no manner properly raised or lodged in this case, we do not deem it to be within the scope of our review, and likewise the federal question based thereon. Under such circumstances the rule announced by the Supreme Court of the United States in Hartford Life Insurance Co. v. Ibs, supra [\n237 U.S. 662\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 692, L. R. A. 1916A, 765], should not be applied to this case.'\n\n The jurisdiction of this court to review the final judgment or decree of the highest court of a state, in such a case as we have here, is defined in section 237 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1156), as amended September 6, 1916 (39 Stat. 726, c. 448,  2 [Comp. St.  1214]), which provides that it shall be competent for this court, by certiorari to require any such cause to be certified to \n\n[249 U.S. 490, 493]\n\u00a0\n it for review when there is claimed in it any title, right, privilege or immunity under the Constitution of the United States and 'the decision is either in favor of or against the title right, privilege or immunity especially set up or claimed, by either party, under such Constitution.' It is the settled law that this provision means:\n'That the claim must be asserted at the proper time and in the proper manner by pleading, motion or other appropriate action under the state system of pleading and practice, ... and upon the question whether or not such a claim has been so asserted the decision of the state court is binding upon this court, when it is clear, as it is in this case, that such decision is not rendered in a spirit of evasion for the purpose of defeating the claim of federal right.' Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. Mims, \n242 \nU.S. 532, 535\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 188, 189 (61 Ed. 476); Gasquet v. Lapeyre, \n242 \nU.S. 367, 371\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 165, and cases cited.\n\n No suggestion is or could be made that the Missouri state Supreme Court's holding in this case was framed to evade the consideration of the federal right now asserted, for it had long been the established law of that state that under its system of practice the construction of either the federal or state Constitution would not be treated as involved in a case, in a jurisdictional sense, unless it appeared that such question was raised and ruled on in the trial court, and also that constitutional questions could not be injected into a case for the first time in an appellate court by argument or brief of counsel for the purpose of giving jurisdiction. Miller v. Connor, 250 Mo. 677, 684, 157 S. W. 81. It has further been uniformly held by that court since 1836 that it will not take judicial notice of the laws of other states, but that they must be proved, as other facts, by evidence introduced at the trial. Southern Illinois & Missouri Bridge Co. v. Stone et al., 174 Mo. 1, 33, 73 S. W. 453, 63 L. R. A. 301.\n On the authorities thus cited we are obliged to conclude \n\n[249 U.S. 490, 494]\n\u00a0\n that the question as to the faith and credit which should be given to the Dresser decree was not so presented to or ruled upon by the Supreme Court of Missouri as to present a federal question for review by this court.\n But, as if anticipating the result we have just reached, the petitioner contends that full faith and credit were denied to its charter, 'a public record and act of the state of Connecticut,' which was introduced in evidence, for the reason that the Supreme Court of Missouri, interpreting that charter, erroneously approved the charge to the jury by the trial court 'that it devolved upon the defendant to prove that the assessment,' the nonpayment of which was relied upon as forfeiting the policy sued upon, was made by the directors of the defendant. The petitioner introduced evidence tending to prove that the assessment under discussion was made, not by formal action of the board of directors, but by executive officers of the company, 'the president and secretary ... or the vice president and secretary, or possibly the vice president and assistant secretary,' and it contended that this was sufficient in law because it had long been the practice of the company and was recognized by the directors as action taken in their behalf under authority delegated by them.\n Even if this charter, which was granted by a resolution of the Assembly of Connecticut, be regarded as a public act or record of that state within the scope of the constitutional provision (article 4, section 1), which is not decided, nevertheless since no statute of Connecticut or decision of any court of that state was pleaded or introduced in evidence in this case, giving a construction to the provision of the charter which the Missouri courts, treating as valid, interpreted, the exercise by those courts of an independent judgment in placing a construction upon it cannot present a federal question under the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution.

Pretzman, of Columbus, Ohio, for appellees.\n\n\n[248 U.S. 297, 301]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity brought to restrain prosecutions threatened against the plaintiffs and their customers for selling a food product of the plaintiffs called Hebe, the bill being based upon the destruction of the plaintiffs' business which it is alleged will ensue. The prosecutions are threatened mainly or wholly under certain statutes of Ohio which, the plaintiffs argue, do not bear the construction put upon them by the defendants, or, if they do, are bad under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and the Commerce Clause. Article 1,  8. A similar case was heard before three judges. Hebe Co. v. Calvert (D. C.) 246 Fed. 711. By agreement the evidence in that case was made the evidence in this. The District Judge adopted the opinion of the three and dismissed the bill.\n Hebe is skimmed milk condensed by evaporation to which six per cent. of cocoa nut oil is added by a process that combines the two. It is sold in tin cans containing \n\n[248 U.S. 297, 302]\n\u00a0\n one pound or six ounces of the product and labelled 'Hebe A Compound of Evaporated Skimmed Milk and Vegetable Fat Contains 6% Vegetable Fat, 24% Total Solids,' with the place of manufacture and address of the Hebe Company. On the side of the label are the words 'For Coffee and Cereals For Baking and Cooking.' By section 12725 of the General Code of Ohio 'whoever manufactures, sells, exchanges, exposes of offers for sale or exchange, condensed milk unless it has been made from ... unadulterated ... milk, from which the cream has not been removed and in which the proportion of milk solids shall be the equivalent of twelve per cent. of milk solids in crude milk, twenty-five per cent. of such solids being fat, and unless the package, can or vessel containing it is distinctly labelled, stamped or marked with its true name, brand, and by whom and under what name made,' is subject to a fine, and for each subsequent offense to a fine and imprisonment. The first question is whether Hebe falls within these words.\n It is argued that, as Hebe is a wholesome or not unwholesome product, the statutes should not be construed to prohibit it if such a construction can be avoided, and that it can be avoided by confining the prohibition to sales of condensed milk as such, under the name of condensed milk, as was held with regard to ice cream in Hutchinson Ice Cream Company v. Iowa, \n242 U.S. 153\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 28, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 643. But the statute could not direct itself to the product as distinguished from the name more clearly than it does. You are not to make a certain article, whatever you call it except from certain materials-the object plainly being to secure the presence of the nutritious elements mentioned in the act, and to save the public from the fraudulent substitution of an inferior product that would be hard to detect. Savage v. Jones, \n225 \nU.S. 501, 524\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 715. By section 5778 a food is adulterated if a valuable ingredient has been wholly or in part abstracted from it, and the effect of this provision vision upon \n\n[248 U.S. 297, 303]\n\u00a0\n skimmed milk is qualified only by section 12720 which states the stringent terms upon which alone that substance can be sold. It seems entirely clear that condensed skimmed milk is forbidden outand only out. But if so the statute cannot be avoided by adding a small amount of cocoa nut oil. We may assume that the product is improved by the addition, but the body of it still is condensed skimmed milk, and this improvement consists merely in making the cheaper and forbidden substance more like the dearer and better one and thus at the same time more available for a fraudulent substitute. It is true that so far as the question of fraud is concerned the label on the plaintiffs' cans tells the truth-but the consumer in many cases never sees it. Moreover when the label tells the public to use Hebe for purposes to which condensed milk is applied and states of what Hebe is made, it more than half recognizes the plain fact that Hebe is nothing but condensed milk of a cheaper sort.\n We are satisfied that the statute as construed by us is not invalidated by the Fourteenth Amendment. The purposes to secure a certain minimum of nutritive elements and to prevent fraud may be carried out in this way even though condensed skimmed milk and Hebe both should be admitted to be wholesome. The power of the legislature 'is not to be denied simply because some innocent articles or transactions may be found within the proscribed class. The inquiry must be whether, considering the end in view, the statute passes the bounds of reason and assumes the character of a merely arbitrary fiat.' Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v. Lynch, \n226 \nU.S. 192, 204\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 44, 47 (57 L. Ed. 84). If the character or effect of the article as intended to be used 'be debatable, the legislature is entitled to its own judgment, and that judgment is not to be superseded by the verdict of a jury,' or, we may add, by the personal opinion of judges, 'upon the issue which the legislature has decided.' Price v. Illinois, 238 U. S. \n\n[248 U.S. 297, 304]\n\u00a0\n 446, 452, 35 Sup. Ct. 892, 894 (59 L. Ed. 1400); Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co., \n240 \nU.S. 342, 357\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 370, L. R.

The answer to the inquiry is that the provisions are of a kind familiar to legislation and often sustained and that it is impossible for this Court to say that they might not be believed to be necessary in order to accomplish the desired ends.

Savage v. Jones, \n225 \nU.S. 501, 524\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 715. The defendants disclaim any intention to interfere with the sale of the godds in the original packages by the consignee, and if the record is thought to raise a doubt with regard to that it may be met by a modification of the decree so as to leave it without prejudice in case prosecutions should be threatened or attempted for such sales. Some question was raised as to whether the individual can was not to be regarded as the original package. But it appears that the cans are brought from Wisconsin, where Hebe is manufactured, into Ohio in fiber cases containing forty-eight one-pound cans or ninety-six six-ounce cans. The cases are the original packages so far as the present question is concerned, Austin v. Tennessee, \n179 U.S. 343\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 132, although no doubt, as shown by McDermott v. Wisconsin, \n228 \nU.S. 115, 136\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 431, 47 L. R. A. (N. S.) 984, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 39, the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce would extend for some purposes to the cans. The Food and Drugs Act of June 30, 1906, c. 3915, 34 Stat. 768 (Comp. St .  8717-8728) dealt with in McDermott v. Wisconsin, does not prevent state regulation of domestic retail sales.

Ct. 715.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n[248 U.S. 297, 305]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY, with whom concurred Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, dissenting.\n The right to prohibit the sale of plaintiffs' product in the state of Ohio is mainly rested upon section 12725 of the General Code of that state. In the absence of a construction by the Supreme Court of Ohio, we must interpret the statute ourselves. We have been unable to come to the conclusion, reached by the majority of the court, as to the meaning of the law. As the result of this decision is to exclude from sale in the state of Ohio, a food product not of itself harmful, but shown to be wholesome, we shall briefly state the reasons which impel the dissent.\n Section 12725 of the General Code of Ohio reads:\n'Whoever manufactures, sells, exchanges, exposes or offers for sale or exchange, condensed milk unless it has been made from pure, clean, fresh, healthy, unadulterated and wholesome milk, from which the cream has not been removed and in which the proportion of milk solids shall be the equivalent of twelve per cent. of milk solids in crude milk twenty-five per cent. of such solids being fat, and unless the package, can or vessel containing it is distinctly labeled, stamped or marked with its true name, brand, and by whom and under what name made, shall be fined not less than fifty dollars nor more than two hundred dollars, and, for each subsequent offense, shall be fined not less than one hundred dollars nor more than five hundred dollars and imprisoned not less than ten days nor more than ninety days.'\n\n The statute defines a crime, and the question is not different than it would be it the plaintiffs were indicted for its violation. While all statutes are to receive a reasonable interpretation, those of a criminal nature are not to be extended by implication. Condensed milk when this statute was passed was well known to be milk from which a considerable portion of water had been evaporated. \n\n[248 U.S. 297, 306]\n\u00a0\n Condensed milk to be what its name imports must be made from whole milk. If not so manufactured, the legislature has the right to provide that the public shall be advised of the treatment to which it has been subjected. Skimmed milk, conspicuously labeled as such, may be sold in the State of Ohio. Section 12720, Gen. Code Ohio. The legislature has shown no intention to condemn it as an unwholesome article of food. It is not less so when condensed.\n We are unable to find in these statutes anything which prohibits the sale of condensed, skimmed milk when it is a part of a wholesome compound sold for what it really is, and distinctly labeled as such. In the section under consideration, 12725, the Ohio legislature was not dealing with compounds. It was undertaking to assure the purity of a well-known article of food-condensed milk. The statute provides that such condensed milk so offered for sale shall be made of pure, clean, fresh, unadulterated and wholesome milk from which the cream has not been removed, and that the can containing it shall be distinctly labeled with its true name. With deference to the contrary view, it seems to us that reading the statute in the light of its purpose to require condensed milk to be made from whole milk and sold for what it is, the necessary result is to exclude the plaintiffs' compound from the words and meaning of the act. It is not evaporated milk, and makes no pretense of being such. It is a food compound consisting in part of condensed skimmed milk. It is so labeled in unmistakable words in large print on the can containing it. The label states with all the emphasis which large type can give that it is a compound made of 'evaporated skimmed milk and vegetable fat.' The proportions of the ingredients are stated. The striking label does not describe condensed milk, and he who reads it cannot be misled to the belief that he is buying that article. It is shown to be wholesome and clean and free from impurities. \n\n[248 U.S. 297, 307]\n\u00a0\n It seems to us that the case is within the principle stated by this court in Hutchinson Ice Cream Co. v. Iowa, \n242 U.S. 153\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 28, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 643, in which a statute forbidding the sale as ice cream of an article not containing a certain portion of butter fat was sustained as within the police power of the state. The statute was construed by the highest court of the state where it was produced to include articles sold as ice cream; thus interpreted, we held it to be a constitutional exercise of the police power of the state. So here, we think the legislature of Ohio intended to deal with condensed milk when sold as such, and to make it an offense to sell it when of less than the required purity.\n It may be conceded that the statute would include such an article when not up to the standard, but sold for the real thing. The public is entitled to protection from deception as well as from impurity. This principle seems to have controlled the decision of the District Court. The record discloses that in one or more instances dealers had supplied this article as condensed milk. But an act or two of this sort by fraudulent dealers ought not to be the test of the plaintiffs' right, or control the meaning of this statute. If such were the case, very few food compounds would escape condemnation. The few instances of deception shown had not the sanction of plaintiffs' authority. Such acts did violence to the plain terms in which the plaintiffs' printed label disclosed that its product was a compound and defined its parts. The label so truly expresses just what the substance is, that it is difficult to believe that any purchaser could be deceived into buying the article for something other than it is.\n The interdiction of the State Board is not against the sale of this article as condensed milk, but of all sales of this compound in the state of Ohio. In our view this criminal statute, rightly interpreted, does not embrace the plaintiffs' product, and that reason alone should be sufficient to warrant a reversal of the decree. \n\n\n\n","104":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOUSTON v. ST LOUIS INDEPENDENT PACKING CO.(1919)\nNo. 264\nArgued: March 20, 1919Decided: April 14, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for appellants.\n Mr. Alexander F. Reichmann, of Chicago, Ill., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Secretary of Agriculture, assuming to exercise authority under the Meat Inspection Act, approved \n\n[249 U.S. 479, 480]\n\u00a0\n June 30, 1906 (34 Stat. 669, 676, 678, c. 3913), promulgated a regulation, effective April 1, 1913, in part as follows, viz.:\n'Washington, D. C., Feb. 28, 1913\n\n\n\n'For the purpose of preventing the use in interstate or foreign commerce of meat or meat food products under any false or deceptive name, under the authority conferred on the Secretary of Agriculture by the provisions of the act of Congress, approved June 30, 1906 (34 Stat. 674), regulation 18 is hereby amended by the addition of sections 15 and 16, to read as hereinafter set out.\n\n'James Wilson, Secretary of Agriculture.\n\n'(Section 16, paragraph 1.) Sausage shall not contain cereal in excess of two per cent.; when cereal is added its presence shall be stated on the label or on the product.\n\n'(Paragraph 2.) Water or ice shall not be added to sausage, except for the purpose of facilitating grinding, chopping and mixing, in which case the added water or ice shall not exceed three per cent., except as provided in the following paragraph.'\n\n Immediately after the effective date of this regulation the appellee, an extensive manufacturer of sausage correctly interpreting it as prohibiting the marking, stamping or labeling as 'sausage' any compound of chopped or minced meats containing cereal in excess of 2 per cent. and water or ice in excess of 3 per cent. (except as otherwise provided), filed the bill in this case in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern Division of the Eastern District of Missouri, averring that 'sausage' made by it with cereal and water in excess of the requirements of the regulation was wholesome and fit for human food and that the effect of the order would be to exclude its product from interstate commerce, to its great and irreparable damage. The prayer was that \n\n[249 U.S. 479, 481]\n\u00a0\n the defendants, the Secretary of Agriculture and the officers subordinate to him, be enjoined from refusing to mark as 'Inspected and passed' all 'sausage' manufactured by the petitioner found to be sound, healthful, and wholesome, and which contained no dyes, chemicals, preservatives or ingredients which would render such 'sausage' unsound, unwholesome or unfit for human food; that they be required by mandatory injunction to mark such 'sausage' as 'Inspected and passed,' and that the regulation be declared to be unauthorized by law, null and void.\n The District Court denied the application, on the bill, for an injunction (St. Louis Independent Packing Co. v. Houston, 204 Fed. 120), but on appeal that holding was reversed and the case was remanded by the Circuit Court of Appeals (St. Louis Independent Packing Co. v. Houston, 215 Fed. 553, 132 C. C. A. 65).\n The Secretary of Agriculture then answered admitting that it was the purpose of the Department to refuse, and that it had refused, to mark as 'Inspected and passed' as 'sausage' the product of the appellee unless manufactured in compliance with the regulations complained of, and, as warrant therefor, he quoted in his answer from the act of Congress the following:\n'No such meat or meat food products shall be sold or offered for sale by any person, firm, or corporation in interstate or foreign commerce under any false or deceptive name; but established trade-name or names which are usual to such products and which are not false and deceptive and which shall be approved by the Secretary of Agriculture are permitted, and that said Secretary of Agriculture shall, from time to time make such rules and regulations as are necessary for the effecient execution of the provisions of this act, and all inspections and examinations made under this act shall be such and made in such manner as described in the rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Agriculture not inconsistent with the provisions of this act.' \n\n[249 U.S. 479, 482]\n\u00a0\n Answering the allegation of the bill that the appellee's trade in 'sausage' would be ruined by the enforcement of the regulation, the Secretary of Agriculture averred that the appellee manufactured and sold large quantities of sausage which did not contain any cereal or added water, and added:\n\n'That the manufacture and sale of a product as sausage which product contains added cereal and water in quantities as described in plaintiff's bill, or in any quantities in excess of the amount designated in said regulation, effective April 1, 1913, is false and deceptive; that the ordinary consumer of sausage manufactured by the plaintiff has no knowledge or information that sausage contains cereal and added water, that such information is not conveyed to persons who purchase plaintiff's sausage at retail by any method of marking or branding now or heretofore in use by plaintiff, and that it is impracticable and impossible in the ordinary course of manufacture and distribution of sausage to mark or brand the same so that the purchaser at retail or the consumer will be informed as to the amount of cereal and water added thereto.'\n\n An elaborate trial on the merits resulted in the dismissal of the bill by the District Court (231 Fed. 779), but this judgment was reversed by a divided Circuit Court of Appeals (242 Fed. 337, 155 C. C. A. 113) and the case was remanded with directions to award the appellee injunctions substantially as prayed for. The case is here for review on appeal.\n The claim made by the government in the lower courts that the compound of meats, cereal and water, which the appellee claimed the right to sell as 'sausage' was unwholesome is abandoned in this court and the only question argued and submitted is whether it was within the power of the Secretary of Agriculture to prohibit the use of the word 'sausage' as false and deceptive, within the meaning of the act, when applied to the appellee's product. \n\n[249 U.S. 479, 483]\n\u00a0\n The foregoing statement shows that the question for decision in this court is: Whether, in promulgating the regulation assailed, the Secretary of Agriculture acted arbitrarily and in excess of the authority given him by the act of Congress, to make, from time to time, such rules and regulations as are necessary for the efficient enforcement of the act, or whether he acted in good faith and upon substantial grounds in deciding that the sale of appellee's product as 'sausage' resulted in deception of purchasers and consumers, so that his determination of such question of fact was within the power conferred upon him as the head of an executive department of the government and is not subject to review by the courts.\n The contention of the government is that the product of the appellee being a meat food product, put up in containers-casings or canvas coverings-it falls within the prohibition of the act that such product shall not be sold or offered for sale by any corporation in interstate commerce 'under any false or deceptive name,' and that the regulation being for the purpose of preventing its sale under the false or deceptive name of 'sausage,' it is plainly within the authority given to the Secretary of Agriculture to make rules and regulations for the efficient execution of the act.\n On the other hand, the contention of the appellee is that the product being wholesome and containing no dyes or chemicals, which render it unfit for human food, an earlier provision of the act applies, which it is asserted deprives the Secretary of all discretion in such a case and requires that he shall cause the product to be marked 'Inspected and passed,' and also, it is claimed, that the word 'sausage,' when qualified as was required by prior regulations by including in the label such expressions as 'Cereal added,' or 'Sausage and cereal,' was not a false or deceptive name.\n The contention of the appellee that if its product is \n\n[249 U.S. 479, 484]\n\u00a0\n wholesome, and if it does not contain dyes and chemicals, the act imperatively requires the Secretary to mark its product as 'Inspected and passed' is clearly unsound if the word 'sausage' as applied to it is false and deceptive, for plainly the provision of the act requiring the marking of the product must be harmonized with the subsequent provision that no such meat or meat food product shall be sold or offered for sale under any false or deceptive name.\n Whether or not the term 'sausage,' when applied to the product of the appellee, in which more than the permitted amount of cereal and water is used, is false and deceptive is a question of fact, the determination of which is committed to the decision of the Secretary of Agriculture by the authority given him to make rules and regulations for giving effect to the act, and the law is that the conclusion of the head of an executive department on such a question will not be reviewed by the courts, where it is fairly arrived at with substantial evidence to support it.\n This rule has been most frequently applied in Land Department cases, but often also to decisions by heads of other departments.\n Thus, to the action of the Secretary of the Navy in Decatur v. Paulding, 14 Pet. 497, 599 Appx., 609, to the action of the Secretary of the Interior, on full consideration of the subject, in Gaines v. Thompson, 7 Wall. 347, and in Burfenning v. Chicago, etc., Ry. Co., \n163 U.S. 321\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 1018, and to decisions of the Postmaster General in Bates & Guild Co. v. Payne, \n194 U.S. 106\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 595, and Smith v. Hitchcock, \n226 U.S. 53\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 6. The doctrine has been extended by act of Congress to decisions by the Secretary of Commerce and Labor. Tang Tun v. Edsell, \n223 U.S. 673\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 359; Zakonaite v. Wolf, \n226 U.S. 272\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 31; Lewis v. Frick, \n233 U.S. 291\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 488.\n The scope of the rule is illustrated by this court, saying in Johnson v. Drew, \n171 \nU.S. 93, 99\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 800, 802 (43 L. Ed. 88):\n'If there is any one thing respecting the administration \n\n[249 U.S. 479, 485]\n\u00a0\n of the public lands which must be considered as settled by repeated adjudications of this court, it is that the decision of the land department upon mere questions of fact is, in the absence of fraud or deceit, conclusive, and such questions cannot thereafter be relitigated in the courts.'\n\n And in New Orleans v. Paine, \n147 \nU.S. 261, 264\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 303, 305 ( 37 L. Ed. 162):\n'In Noble v. Union River Logging Railroad, decided at the present term [\n147 U.S. 165\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 271], we had occasion to examine the question as to when a court was authorized to interfere by injunction with the action of the head of a department, and came to the conclusion that it was only where, in any view of the facts that could be taken, such action was beyond the scope of his authority. If he were engaged in the performance of a duty which involved the exercise of discretion or judgment, he was entitled to protection from any interference by the judicial power.' db\n\n[249 U.S. 479, 3]\n\u00a0\n That the case before us is one for the application of this rule is shown by the record, which contains an interesting history of what large manufacturers have come, in a more or less gradual progress, to regard as the proper ingredients of the product which they have sold as sausage, and which also shows, without conflict, that the ultimate purchaser and consumer of the product is not informed and in general does not know of the presence of cereal and added water in it. The evidence shows that the poorer classes of beef and pork are used in making sausage, such as trimmings, hearts, ears, cheeks, liver, snouts and tripe, 'and all that kind of things,' but the preferred material is bull meat; that such meat, other than bull meat, is dry and has not the cohesive properties which will unite it when ground or minced into the mass popularly known as 'sausage' and that, for this reason, cornmeal, potato flour and other like substances have come to be used by the trade as 'binders' to give it the desired cohesiveness and appearance. \n\n[249 U.S. 479, 486]\n\u00a0\n The president of the appellee testified that when he first began making sausage 25 years ago he used anywhere from 5 per cent. to 12 per cent. of cereal and that when the regulation was promulgated he was using 2 or 3 per cent. to 10 per cent., when he used any at all, but that in a part of his product he did not use any, notably in that which was sent into Pennsylvania, where the use of cereal was prohibited by statute; that when he used 10 per cent. of cereal he added from 15 to 20 per cent. of water, and that in general water was added in double the percentage of cereal used; and that the cereal, usually corn meal or corn flour, was resorted to to cheapen the product and cost about 2 cents a pound, while the meat used cost from 6 to 15 cents a pound.\n\n Before the regulation assailed was promulgated cereal and water were generally used by large manufacturers of sausage, but all of the representatives of manufacturers, other than those of the appellee, who were called as witnesses, testified that they were obeying the regulation, and the agreement of such witnesses was general that retail purchasers and consumers did not know of the presence of cereal in what they were buying as sausage.\n There is conflict in the evidence as to whether the use of cereal in excess of the prescribed amounts renders the product less digestible and wholesome, whether it reduces its food value, and whether the sausage will ferment in a shorter time than when cereal is not used at all, or when used in smaller quantities.\n The result, thus stated, of the examination of the record before us shows beyond controversy, that the Secretary of Agriculture in promulgating the regulation complained of acted on substantial evidence and with sufficient reason in concluding that persons purchasing or using as 'sausage' the appellee's compound of various meats, cereal and water would be deceived as to its composition and \n\n[249 U.S. 479, 487]\n\u00a0\n as to its value as a food product, and we cannot say that it was an abuse of discretion to prohibit the use of the word 'sausage' as applied to it, rather than to prescribe qualifying terms explanatory of it. Few purchasers read long labels, many cannot read them at all, and the act of Congress having committed to the head of the department, constantly dealing with such matters, the discretion to determine as to whether the use of the word 'sausage' in a label would be false and deceptive or not, under such circumstances as we have here this court will not review, and the Circuit Court of Appeals should not have reviewed and reversed the decision of the Secretary of Agriculture.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","105":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN RE TRACY(1919)\n\nArgued: Decided: April 28, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. C.

Matters v. Ryan, \n249 U.S. 375\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 315, decided April 14, 1919\n\n\n When leave to file the petition for habeas corpus was previously denied (\n249 U.S. 588\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 385, 63 L. Ed. --), without a suggestion as to the existence of any exceptional condition which would have justified a contrary view, such refusal presumably was based on the existence of the right to seek, if desired, other and appropriate sources of relief.

Bacon, of New York City, for petitioner. \n\n[249 U.S. 115, 116]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Peter S. Carter, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, a corporation of the state of New York, is the owner of the Steamship H. M. Whitney, her engines, etc., which vessel, on April 18, 1918, while in petitioner's possession, was attached by the United States marshal for the Eastern district of New York in an action in rem brought by the Patent Vulcanite Roofing Company in the District Court of the United States for that district. On April 27, 1918, while the vessel was in the possession of the deputy marshal under the process in that action, the United States Shipping Board established by act of September 7, 1916 ( 39 Stat. 728, c. 451), acting under authority of the act of June 15, 1917 ( 40 Stat. 182, c. 29), and the President's Executive Order of July 11, 1917, 1 in structed \n\n[249 U.S. 115, 117]\n\u00a0\n one Smith as its agent to take possession of the steamer in behalf of the United States. This Smith did pro forma on April 29, but without dispossessing the marshal or his deputy. On May 16, Theodore A. Crane's Sons Company filed its libel in rem against the steamer in the same court, and under process in this suit the marshal, who already had her in custody, again attached the vessel. Afterwards, and on May 29, the Shipping Board, by its counsel, appeared before the court, stated that the use of the vessel was needed by the government for war purposes, that the marshal was still in custody by virtue of the writs of attachment in the two suits referred to, and that the board did not desire to raise an issue over the possession of the property as between two departments of the government, and moved the court to direct the marshal to release her. No appearance having been entered in behalf of the ship, the court heard proctors for the libelants and counsel for the Shipping Board, and on motion of the latter, with consent of the former, made an order entitled in the two causes directing that the marshal be permitted to appoint the master of the ship as a special deputy United States marshal, that this deputy remain in possession of the vessel in behalf of the marshal, that the vessel, in his custody, be turned over to the Shipping Board for purposes connected with the war, the special deputy marshal or his substitutes to remain always in possession, and that the vessel be returned to the custody of the marshal upon being released from requisition by the Shipping Board. \n\n[249 U.S. 115, 118]\n\u00a0\n Thereafter the present petitioner, claimant of the vessel, appeared specially by counsel and moved the District Court to quash the attachment in the Crane suit and dismiss the libel on the ground of want of jurisdiction. These motions, after argument, were overruled; and at a subsequent date motions for a rehearing and for a certificate of jurisdiction as the basis of a direct appeal to this court were denied upon the ground that the claimant had no standing to attack the validity of the attachment.\n Thereafter this court granted leave for the filing of a petition for a writ of prohibition, and made an order upon the judges of the district court to show cause why such writ should not issue. Return was made by the judge who had acted in the proceedings above mentioned, and, the matter having been argued here by counsel for the petitioner and by counsel for the Crane Company, the question for decision is whether the prohibition ought to be issued, or the order to show cause discharged.\n The validity of the attachment in the suit of the Vulcanite Company and the continued possession of the marshal or his deputy under that process are not in controversy. No bond was given or deposit made for release of the vessel pursuant to section 941, Rev. St. (Comp. St.  1567), or the admiralty rules of this court or of the District Court. Hence the vessel remained, for all purposes of the action in the custody of the court. The requisition of the Shipping Board extended merely to the use of the ship for war purposes, and did not in fact take her out of the custody of the court. So far as any interest of the petitioner was concerned, there was nothing to prevent the vessel from being subjected to attachment under process in the Crane Company suit; and as she actually was subjected to that process by the action of the marshal, the jurisdiction of the court in that suit was complete, and the owner's only recourse was to enter appearance therein, with or without giving a bond or making a deposit. \n\n[249 U.S. 115, 119]\n\u00a0\n If the custody of the ship by the officer of the court was inconsistent with the purposes of the Executive, acting through the Shipping Board, this was not a matter of which petitioner could take advantage. The application of the board through its counsel for an order permitting the vessel to be put at the service of the government for war purposes while still remaining in the custody of the marshal for the purposes of the court's jurisdiction, consented to by the only other parties who had a standing in court, was a sufficient warrant for the order made.\n Order to show cause discharged and petition dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] EXECUTIVE ORDER.\n By virtue of authority vested in me in the section entitled 'Emergency Shipping Fund' of an act of Congress entitled 'An act making appropriations to supply urgent deficiencies in appropriations for the military and naval establishments on account of war expenses for the fiscal year ending June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and seventeen, and for other purposes,' approved June 15, 1917, I hereby direct that the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation shall have and exercise all power and authority vested in me in said section of said act, in so far as applicable to and in furtherance of the construction of vessels, the purchase or requisitioning of vessels in process of construction, whether on the ways or already launched, or of contracts for the construction of such vessels, and the completion thereof, and all power and authority applicable to and in furtherance of the production, purchase, and requisitioning of materials for ship construction.\n And I do further direct that the United States Shipping Board shall have and exercise all power and authority vested in me in said section of said act, in so far as applicable to and in furtherance of the taking over of title or possession, by purchase or requisition, of constructed vessels, or parts thereof, or charters therein; and the operation, management and disposition of such vessels, and of all other vessels heretofore or hereafter acquired by the United States.

U S(1919)\nNo. 255\nArgued: Decided: April 14, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[249 U.S. 460, 461]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George A. King, of Washington, D. C., for appellants.\n\n\n[249 U.S. 460, 462]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The United States solicited sealed proposals for the repair of a revetment in Michigan; and J. E. Hathaway & Co. became the successful bidders. Under a contract, dated May 11, 1910, they agreed to complete the work by December 1, 1910. It was not completed until 68 days later. Of this delay the government conceded that 29 days were attributable to extra work required by it, and 10 more days were not counted against the contractor, being Sundays and holidays. For the remaining 29 days' delay the government deducted from the contract price $3,082, claiming that amount under the provisions for liquidated and other damages. To recover the amount disallowed, J. E. Hathaway & Co. brought suit in the Court of \n\n[249 U.S. 460, 463]\n\u00a0\n Claims, which denied them relief (52 Ct. Cl. 267); and the case comes here on appeal.\n First. Claimants contend that they were entitled to an extension of more than these 29 days' time for completing the work, because the contract and bond were delivered by them to the government May 18, duly executed, but were not approved by the Chief of Engineers until June 9, and notice of approval was not given them until June 13. The origin of this delay was the failure of the surety company to file with the War Department a copy of the vote of its directors giving him who signed the bond as attorney in fact authority so to do. But claimants insist that this omission could have been quickly supplied, if the government had telegraphed for a copy of the vote, and that practically all the delay was due to its unreasonable failure so to do.\n The Court of Claims found:\n'There was no unreasonable delay on the part of the government in approving the contract.'\n\n This finding, like one of reasonable value (Talbert v. United States, \n155 \nU.S. 45, 46\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 4), is a finding of an ultimate fact by which this court is bound, unless it appears that the finding was made without supporting evidence (Cramp v. United States, \n239 \nU.S. 221, 232\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 70; Stone v. United States, \n164 U.S. 380\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 71; United States v. Clark, \n96 U.S. 37\n), or is inconsistent with other facts found (United States v. Berdan Fire-Arms Co., \n156 \nU.S. 552, 573\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 420). There is no such lack of supporting evidence or inconsistency here. We have consequently no occasion to determine whether, as was held in American Dredging Co. v. United States, 49 Ct. Cl. 350, unreasonable delay on the part of the government in approving a contract for an accepted bid can entitle the contractor to a corresponding extension of time, where a definite date is fixed by the contract for completion of the work. Compare Monroe v. United States, \n184 U.S. 524\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 444. The case of District of Columbia \n\n[249 U.S. 460, 464]\n\u00a0\n v. Camden Iron Works, \n181 \nU.S. 453, 461\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 680, strongly relied upon by claimants, is clearly distinguishable. There the contract, as interpreted by the court, provided that the work should be completed, not (as here) by a date fixed, but within a certain number of days; and the number of days was to be measured, not from the date of the contract, but from 'the date of the execution of the contract.' What was there decided is merely, that under such circumstances it may be 'shown that a deed, bond or other instrument was in fact made, executed and delivered at a date subsequent to that stated on its face.'\n Second. Claimants contend also that the Court of Claims erred in allowing, in addition to the sum of $100 a day as liquidated damages, the sum of $182 for the expense of superintendence and inspection. But the contract expressly provided that time should be deemed of the essence and that in case of failure to complete within the time specified 'the contractor shall pay, in addition to the liquidated damages hereinbefore specified, all expenses for inspection and superintendence.' There is no reason why parties competent to contract may not agree that certain elements of damage difficult to estimate shall be covered by a provision for liquidated damages and that other elements shall be ascertained in the usual manner. Provisions of a contract clearly expressed do not cease to be binding upon the parties, because they relate to the measure of damages. Henry A. Wise, Trustee, v. United States (No. 214, decided March 31, 1919) \n249 U.S. 361\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 303.\n Third. Claimants further contend that the credit of time allowed by the government on account of the extra work should have been greater. On this matter no issue appears to have been raised below; and it is obviously not open for review here.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","108":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJ HOMER FRITCH, INC. v. U S(1919)\nNo. 64\nArgued: Decided: January 20, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[248 U.S. 458, 459]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for the United states.\n Messrs. Edward J. McCutchen, Ira A. Campbell, and A. Crawford Greene, all of San Francisco, for plaintiff in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Liability of the United States for the hire of a ship for two charter periods was asserted. The trial court allowed recovery for one period and rejected it for the other and the court below affirmed its action. The case is here because of alleged error committed in not allowing for both. The government insists that we have no jurisdiction because the judgment of the trial court was exclusively susceptible of being reviewed directly by this court; hence, that the court below had no jurisdiction and we must reverse and remand with directions to dismiss for want of jurisdiction. The contention is well founded, and we might content ourselves with referring to the authorities by which its correctness is conclusively established. As, however, some contrariety of opinion on the question is manifested in the decisions of the lower federal courts resulting either from a misconception of the governing principle upon which the right of direct review rests, or, it may be, caused by previous decisions of this court which if unexplained may continue to be the source of misconception, we briefly review and dispose of the subject from an original point of view. \n\n[248 U.S. 458, 460]\n\u00a0\n When the United States made claims against it justiciable by conferring authority upon the Court of Claims to entertain and decide them, the grant was accompanied by a provision giving this court direct and exclusive jurisdiction to review the judgments of the Court of Claims rendered in the exercise of the new power given. When by the Tucker Act ( Act March 3, 1887, c. 359, 24 Stat. 505) authority was conferred upon the Circuit and District Courts of the United States to exert, concurrently with the Court of Claims, the power to decide claims against the United States, the question arose whether the judgments of those courts rendered in the exercise of such jurisdiction were reviewable exclusively and directly by this court.\n Determining the principle by which the question was to be solved, it was decided that in the absence of express provision or necessary implication to the contrary, the judgments of courts of the United States rendered as the result of the new power would be subject to be reviewed only by the exclusive method theretofore provided for the Court of Claims. Applying the principle of interpretation thus announced to the Tucker Act, it was held that judgments of the courts of the United States in suits against the United States under that act were reviewable only directly by this court. United States v. Davis, \n131 U.S. 36\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 657.\n Early after the adoption of the Judiciary Act of 1891 (Act March 3, 1891, c. 517, 26 Stat. 826) it was settled that the purpose of that act was to generally provide for and distribute the appellate power of the courts of the United States. McLish v. Roff, \n141 U.S. 661\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 118; Lau Ow Bew v. United States, \n144 U.S. 47\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 517; Bank v. Peters, \n144 U.S. 570\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 767; Hubbard v. Soby, \n146 U.S. 56\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 13. Subsequent to such decisions there was pending in this court a case brought by the plaintiff below by direct appellate proceedings to review the judgment of a Circuit Court of \n\n[248 U.S. 458, 461]\n\u00a0\n the United States, rejecting a claim against the United States sued upon in that court as a court of claims. On submission of a motion to dismiss or affirm, made by the United States without brief or argument by the appellant, the case was dismissed for want of jurisdiction, based upon authorities which were cited, establishing that the purpose of the act of 1891 was to distribute the appellate power of the courts of the United States-a ruling which implied that direct review by this court of judgments in suits against the United States rendered by the courts of the United States as courts of claims was taken away by the Act of 1891. Ogden v. United States, \n148 U.S. 390\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 602.\n In the next year the case of Chase v. United States, \n155 U.S. 489\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 174, was decided. It came to this court on a direct writ of error to a Circuit Court of the United States, acting as a court of claims, to review a judgment rendered against the United States. Jurisdiction was disputed, not upon the ground that the power to review such a judgment by direct appeal no longer existed because of the act of 1891, but upon the sole ground that procedure by writ of error instead of appeal had been mistakably resorted to. The contention was held unsound, jurisdiction was taken, and the case was decided.\n It is to be conceded that, either because of the implication resulting from the ruling in Ogden v. United States, supra, or because of what was deemed to be the controlling force of the accepted doctrine of the distribution of appellate power made by the act of 1891, the opinion obtained in some of the lower federal courts that the direct review by this court of judgments of courts of the United States acting as courts of claims, which prevailed under the Tucker Act, no longer existed, and that possibly these impressions continued to make themselves manifest until the error upon which they rested was demonstrated by the decision of this court in Reid v. United States, \n211 U.S. 529\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 171. \n\n[248 U.S. 458, 462]\n\u00a0\n In that case, acting upon the theory that the effect of the distribution of appellate power made by the act of 1891 controlled the previously existing right to review judgments of the courts of the United States acting as courts of claims, a case was brought directly to this court under the assumed authority of the act of 1891, which case, because of its amount, would not have been susceptible of being brought here under the right to review as existing prior to the act of 1891. The case therefore rendered it necessary to decide whether the general distribution of appellate power made by the act of 1891 had replaced the right to review previously existing as to judgments of the courts of the United States rendered under the power to dispose of claims against the United States. It was decided that it had not, and that the exceptional remedy by direct and exclusive review as to the exceptional jurisdiction to entertain claims against the United States remained unaffected by the general distribution of appellate power made by the act of 1891\n\n\n It is ture, indeed, that in the Reid Case, as it was also true in the Chase Case, no reference was made to the previous ruling in Ogden v. United States, virtually holding to the contrary; but, as we have previously pointed out, there was nothing on the face of the opinion in that case to direct attention to the fact that it concerned the continued existence of the exceptional jurisdiction to review judgments resulting from the exercise of the exceptional power to entertain claims against the United States, since on the face of the opinion and the authorities which were referred to, that case dealt only with the operation of the act of 1891 upon the general distribution of appellate power. And when the subject is scrutinized, there can be no room whatever for difference of opinion that the effect of the ruling in Reid v. United States was to overrule the Ogden Case. That result is made, if possible, more clearly manifest by the application of the ruling in \n\n[248 U.S. 458, 463]\n\u00a0\n the Reid Case made by this court in subsequent cases. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. United States, \n225 U.S. 640\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 702; United States v. Hvoslef, \n237 U.S. 1\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 459, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 286; Thames & Mersey M. I.

Cress, \n243 U.S. 316\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 380; United States v. Achilles Kelly, \n243 U.S. 316\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 380; Tweedie Trading Co. v. United States, \n245 U.S. 645\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 9.\n But it is true to say that in the case of United States v. Buffalo Pitts Co., \n234 U.S. 228\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 840, decided subsequent to the dicision of the Reid Case, the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Appeals to review the action of a District Court when sitting as a court of claims was recognized by entertaining and deciding appellate proceedings to review the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals in such case. It is to be observed, however, that in that case no question whatever was raised as to the jurisdiction, and in view of the ruling in the Reid Case, to which no reference was made, the action of this court in the Buffalo Pitts Case must be regarded as a mere inadvertent assumption of jurisdiction rather than as a decision that such jurisdiction existed.\n It is now insisted however that, granting the conclusive effect of the Reid Case, it is here inapplicable because decided before the adoption of the Judicial Code by which, it is contended, a change was made taking away the exceptional power to directly review which is here in question. The contention disregards the necessary result of the rulings in the cases just referred to, decided since the Reid Case, some of which disposed of controversies governed by the Judicial Code, and where the proposition now relied upon as to the assumed operation of that act was directly pressed in argument.\n Aside from this view, however, the porposition disregards the plain context of sections 294 and 295 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1167 [Comp. St.  1271, 1272]), which were clearly intended to prevent implications \n\n[248 U.S. 458, 464]\n\u00a0\n of repeal, or change of legislative intent, like the one here relied upon. United States v. Cress, \n243 \nU.S. 316, 331\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 380. But it is said that the contention as to the change made by the Code is not based upon implication but upon the fact that section 9 of the Tucker Act (Comp. St.  1172) was expressly repealed by the Judicial Code, this removing the very groundwork upon which the continued right in this court to exclusively review judgments of the courts of the United States when sitting as courts of claims was held to continue after the Tucker Act. The assumption however is fallacious, since it overlooks the fact that section 4 of the Tucker Act (Comp. St.  1574) was excepted from the repealing clause and that its provisions are wholly incompatible with the proposition now relied upon. And this again brings the proposition back to the mere assertion that the ruling as to the Tucker Act made in United States v. Davis, and that as to the act of 1891 made in the Reid Case, must now be disregarded.\n As it results that the contention of the United States as to the want of jurisdiction in the court below was well founded, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be and it is\n Reversed and the cause remanded to that court with directions to dismiss for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","109":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJOSEPH SCHLITZ BREWING CO. v.

Garwood, of Houston, Tex., for respondents. \n\n[250 U.S. 28, 29]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity brought to restrain the use of a trade-mark alleged to infringe the plaintiff's or at least to be used in a way that is calculated to deceive and unfairly to interfere with the plaintiff's good will. Both courts have found for the defendant (241 Fed. 817, 154 C. C. A. 519), so that the only question that we shall consider is whether upon inspection it can be said as matter of law that the admitted acts of the defendant are a wrong of which the plaintiff can complain.\n Both parties sell beer in brown bottles with brown labels and the plaintiff conceded below and still with some unwillingness seems to concede that, although perhaps it first introduced them in this connection and this place, it cannot claim the brown bottle, the brown label, or the two combined. These could be used without a warning, such as sometimes is required, that the beer was not the plaintiff's. The only question is how the additional element, the form of the inscription, should be treated. It often is said that the plaintiff must show a deception arising from some feature of its own not common to the public. United States Tobacco Co. v. McGreenery (C. C.) 144 Fed. 531, 532, cited by the court below. But so stated the proposition may be misleading. It is not necessary that the imitation of the plaintiff's feature taken alone should be sufficient to deceive. It is a fallacy to break the fagot stick by stick. It would be enough if taken with the elements common to the public the inscription accomplished a result that neither would alone. New England Awl & Needle Co. v. Marlborough Awl & Needle Co., 168 Mass. 154, 156, 46 N. E. 386, 60 Am. St. Rep. 377.\n But it is true that the unlawful imitation must be what achieves the deception, even though it could do so only on the special background lawfully used. The question again narrowed is whether that is the case here. The \n\n[250 U.S. 28, 30]\n\u00a0\n shape of the defendant's label is different from the plaintiff's; the script upon it not only is wholly different from the other in meaning, to one who reads the two, but hardly can be said to resemble it as a picture. The two labels are attached to the bottles in quite unlike modes. The Schlitz is applied in a spiral around the length of the bottle so as to make the ends of the label parallel to the sides of the glass. The defendant's is pasted around the bottom of the bottle in the usual way. This diversity of itself renders mistake unlikely. If there were deception it seems to us that it would arise from beer and brown color and that it could not be said that the configuration appreciably helped. Coats v. Merrick Thread Co., \n149 \nU.S. 562, 573\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 966.

MILES(1919)\nNo. 179\nArgued: January 24, 1919Decided: May 19, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 58, 59]\n\u00a0\n Messrs.Solicitor General King, and Charles J. Kappler, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. H. P. White, of Pawhuska, Okl., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In concluding a proceeding in the county court of Osage county, Oklahoma, for the settlement of the estate of Lah-tah-sah, a deceased Indian woman, it became necessary to determine who were her heirs. Two claimants appeared and sought to establish such a relation. One, John Kenny, claimed to be a son and the sole heir; and the other, Laban Miles, claimed to be the surviving husband and an equal heir with Kenny. It was conceded that Kenny was a son, but it was disputed that Miles ever was the deceased's husband. If he was such when she died, he and Kenny were equal heirs; otherwise Kenny was the sole heir.\n At the hearing in that proceeding Miles produced and relied on a judgment in a partition suit, which he had brought against Kenny in the district court of the same county, wherein it was found that he and the deceased were married about a year before her death, and that he remained her husband until she died. Over Kenny's protest, based on congressional enactments presently to be noticed, the county court treated that judgment as a conclusive determination of the matters so found, and rejected evidence produced by Kenny to show that there had been no such marriage. It was accordingly adjudged that Miles and Kenny were equal heirs, and that decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state. 162 Pac. 775. The case is here on writ of certiorari. \n\n[250 U.S. 58, 60]\n\u00a0\n Whether, consistently with the congressional enactments on which Kenny's protest was based, the judgment in the partition suit could be treated as conclusive of the matters therein found is the ultimate federal question in the case.\n Lah-tah-sah was an Indian of the Osage Tribe, duly enrolled as such. This entitled her to share in the division and allotment of the lands and funds of the tribe under the Act of June 28, 1906, c. 3572, 34 Stat. 539. She died intestate August 19, 1908. Thereafter two tribal deeds naming her as grantee,1 and approved by the Secretary of the Interior, were issued under that act. The deeds were for lands allotted to her or in her right out of the tribal lands. One was for 160 acres designated as a homestead, and the other was for 500.12 acres designated as surplus lands. Both purported to pass a title in fee simple, subject to the conditions, limitations, and provisions of the act. It was to these lands that the judgment in the partition suit related. That judgment treated the lands as inherited from Lah-tah-sah, and ordered that they be partitioned equally between Miles and Kenny as her heirs, or if not susceptible of partition in kind, that they be sold with a view to an equal division of the proceeds.\n By section 6 of the Act of April 18, 1912, c. 83, 37 Stat. 86, which is supplementary to and amendatory of the Act of 1906, it is provided that-\n'The lands of deceased Osage allottees, unless the heirs agree to partition the same, may be partitioned or sold upon proper order of any court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the laws of the state of Oklahoma: Provided, that no partition or sale of the restricted lands of a deceased Osage allottee shall be valid until approved by the Secretary of the Interior.'\n\n It was after this enactment that the partition suit was \n\n[250 U.S. 58, 61]\n\u00a0\n begun, and there was here no approval by the Secretary of the Interior.\n Kenny's protest was based on the Acts of 1906 and 1912, and was to the effect that the lands to which the partition suit related were restricted lands, and that in consequence the judgment for their partition or sale was of no effect in the absence of the prescribed approval by the Secretary of the Interior.\n The term 'restricted lands' in section 6 of the Act of 1912 means lands the alienation of which is subject to restrictions imposed by Congress to protect the Indians from their own incompetency. This is shown by a later sentence in the same section and by various provisions in the Act of 1906\n\n\n To determine whether the lands ordered to be partitioned or sold were restricted requires some consideration of the Act of 1906, for it was under that act that they were allotted and the tribal deeds issued. By its first section the act makes the tribal roll as existing January 1, 1906, with eliminations and additions not material here, the authentic roll of the members for the purposes of the act. By its second section it provides that the tribal lands, with stated exceptions, shall be divided among the members in such way as to give each a fair share in acres; that every member 'shown by the roll' shall be permitted to select three tracts of 160 acres each; that after all have made the three selections the remaining lands, with some exceptions, shall be divided as equally as practicable by a designated commission, and that-\n'Fourth. ... Each member of said tribe shall be permitted to designate which of his three selections shall be a homestead,2 and his certificate of allotment and deed shall designate the same as a homestead, and the same \n\n[250 U.S. 58, 62]\n\u00a0\n shall be inalienable and nontaxable until otherwise provided by Act of Congress. The other two selections of each member, together with his share of the remaining lands allotted to the member, shall be known as surplus land, and shall be inalienable for twenty-five years, except as hereinafter provided.'\n\n The second section further provides (paragraph 7) that when any adult member is found fully competent to care for his own affairs the Secretary of the Interior may issue to him a certificate of competency, authorizing him to sell and convey any of the lands deeded to him under the act other than his homestead, which where the certificate issues3 is to remain inalienable for twenty-five years, or during the life of the homestead allottee. Other sections reserve to the tribe for twenty-five years the oil, gas, coal and other minerals in the allotted lands and provide that the tribal funds and moneys, with specified exceptions, shall be placed to the credit of the several members 'shown by the authorized roll' or their heirs, on the basis of a pro rata division and shall be held in trust by the United States for twenty-five years. The sixth section is as follows:\n'Sec. 6. That the lands, moneys, and mineral interests, herein provided for, of any deceased member of the Osage Tribe shall descend to his or her legal heirs, according to the laws of the territory of Oklahoma, or of the state in which said reservation may be hereafter incorporated, except where the decedent leaves no issue, nor husband nor wife, in which case said lands, moneys, and mineral interests must go to the mother and father equally.'\n\n The seventh section shows that the allotted lands are for the sole use of the individual members, or their heirs, and that the same may be leased, subject to the restriction that to be effective 'all leases,' whether for the benefit of the individual members or their heirs, must have the \n\n[250 U.S. 58, 63]\n\u00a0\n approval of the Secretary of the Interior; and the eighth section provides that the deeds to allottees shall be executed by the principal chief of the tribe, but shall not be valid until the Secretary of the Interior approves them.\n The Act of 1912, in its sixth section, treats the restraints applicable to living allottees as also applicable to such of the heirs of deceased allottees as are members of the tribe, and expressly provides that-\n'When the heirs of such deceased allottees have certificates of competency ... the restrictions on alienation are hereby removed.'\n\n Lah-tah-sah died without receiving a certificate of competency. Kenny and Miles, who claim to be her heirs, are of Osage blood and members of the tribe, and neither has received such a certificate. Thus the case differs materially from Levindale Lead, etc., Co. v. Coleman, \n241 U.S. 432\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 644, where it was held to be obvious from an examination of the entire Act of 1906 that the restrictions on alienation were imposed to secure the welfare of Indians-wards of the United States- and were not intended to apply to lands, or undivided interests therein inherited by white men who were not members of the tribe. There a white man, who as heir of a deceased Osage wife and child took an undivided interest in lands allotted in their behalf after their death, was held to have an unrestricted right to alienate his interest; but the court was careful to indicate that it was not dealing with the interests of Indian heirs.\n The Act of 1906 makes it plain that all whose names were on the authentic roll were to share in the division of the tribal property. They were the 'members' among whom the lands were to be allotted in stated portions. Lah-tah-sah, being one of them, was entitled to such an allotment. It was made in her name, but whether before or after her death is left uncertain by the record. The court below treated it as made after her death and held that the lands were not restricted, its decision being put \n\n[250 U.S. 58, 64]\n\u00a0\n on the ground that the restrictions on alienation are not applicable to lands allotted in the right of deceased members, but only to such as are allotted to members living at that time. We cannot assent to that conclusion.\n Under the Act of 1906 the death of a member entitled to an allotment does not extinguish his right. According to the implication of the act and the administrative rulings, the allotment still may be made in his name. Where this is done he is regarded as the allottee and his heirs as taking by descent from him. Such allotments and all others are made under one comprehensive provision, in which there is no distinctive mention of either living or deceased members. The restrictions are imposed by another provision equally comprehensive, and it makes no distinction between lands allotted to living members and those allotted in the right of deceased members. Nor is any such distinction made in the section dealing with descent. The heirs are generally Indians, and seldom white men. When they are Indians they are equally within the occasion for the restrictions, whether the allotment be to a living member or in the right of one deceased, Talley v. Burgess, \n246 \nU.S. 104, 108\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 287; and in either case some may be without any allotment of their own, because born after the time for closing the roll. Thus those who take under allotments made in the right of deceased members are no less within the letter and spirit of the restrictions than are other heirs. That all are intended to be protected is shown by the leasing provision, which requires that 'all leases' on the part of heirs shall have the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.\n We, therefore, are of opinion that the lands allotted in the Lah-tah- sah's name were restricted lands, whether allotted before or after her death.\n The Act of 1906 is quite unlike the earlier acts considered in the cases of Mullen v. United States, \n224 U.S. 448\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 494, and Skelton v. Dill, \n235 U.S. 206\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 60, which are cited \n\n[250 U.S. 58, 65]\n\u00a0\n in support of the conclusion below. Those acts, as was pointed out in our opinions, contained separate provisions for two classes of allotments-one to members living at the time, and the other in the right of deceased members. In the provisions dealing with the first class there were express restrictions on the right of alienation, and in those dealing with the second class there was an entire absence of such restrictions. Because of this difference in terms, we held that Congress intended that allotments of the second class should be unrestricted. The differences between those earlier acts and that of 1906 are pronounced and reasonably can be explained on no other theory than that Congress intended that all allotments under the Act of 1906 should be restricted, subject of course to the issue of certificates of competency. And that this is what was intended becomes even more manifest when it is considered that in the meantime Congress had imposed other restrictions in respect of allotments under the earlier acts and in doing so had discarded the distinction before made between the two classes of allotments so far as full-blood Indian heirs were concerned. Talley v. Burgess, supra.\n We have seen that the provision in the act of 1912 under which the partition suit was brought and entertained declares that where the lands are restricted, as was the case here, no partition or sale shall be valid until approved by the Secretary of the Interior. No approval was given in this instance. In consequence the judgment ordering a partition or sale-it had no other purpose-was inoperative. It could not be executed and was not binding on any one. The findings were part of it and were of no force apart from it.\n It results that Kenny's protest against the use made of that judgment was well grounded.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] As to the legal effect of the deeds issued to her after her death, see besides section 6 of the Act of 1906, Rev.

CO.(1919)\nNo. 485\nArgued: April 15, 1919Decided: May 19, 1919\n\n\n\n Messrs.\nJames A. Wayne, of Wallace, Idaho, and John P. Gray, of Coeur D'Alene, Idaho, for petitioner.\n Mr. George W. Korte, of Seattle, Wash., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case comes into this court on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the state of Idaho and all of the facts essential to its decision are admitted or are not controverted, and are as follows:\n When the accident complained of in the case occurred, the railway company, respondent, was engaged in filling with earth a wooden trestle- work bridge, 1,200 feet in length, by which its track was carried across a dry gulch \n\n[250 U.S. 130, 131]\n\u00a0\n or coulee, the purpose being to continue the track upon the solid embankment when it should be completed.\n It was admitted that the railway company was engaged in interstate commerce, and that during the progress of the filling the bridge was used for interstate trains. Pursuant to an order of court, the petitioner, an employe of the respondent, elected to rely on the federal Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65 (Comp. St.  8657- 8665) for his right to recover.\n Several weeks prior to the accident to the petitioner Kinzell, the work of filling the bridge had progressed to such a stage that when earth was dumped from cars it would be heaped up beside the track higher than the tops of the ties and rails so that it became necessary to spread it by pushing it away from the track toward the edge of the fill, in order to prevent its falling back upon the rails and to widen the embankment. To thus spread the earth an appliance called in the record a 'dozer,' and sometimes a 'bull dozer,' was used. It consisted substantially of a flat car body with adjustable wings or scrapers, so designed as to remove any earth which might fall upon the rails and also to press or push that heaped up at the side of the track out to the edge of the embankment.\n When a trainload of earth would arrive at the bridge the practice was to couple the 'dozer' to the forward end of the cars and then they and the 'dozer' would be pushed to the place at which it was desired to unload the earth. After the cars were dumped the pulling of the 'dozer' back with them would scrape the earth from the tops of the rails and would push it away from the track, thus contributing to keep the track clear and to widen the embankment.\n For several weeks prior to the accident complained of, Kinzell, with an assistant, had been in charge of this 'dozer,' using it as described, and in addition to this they were required to remove, with shovels, earth or stones which fell upon the track, so, the superintendent of the \n\n[250 U.S. 130, 132]\n\u00a0\n railway testified, as to make it safe for the operation of trains. The rails and ties had not been transferred to the embankment, but were still sustained by the bridge substructure when the accident occurred.\n Kinzell was injured by what he claimed was negligence of the company in the manner of coupling a train of cars to the 'dozer' as an immediate preliminary to such an unloading and cleaning movement as we have described.\n Much is made in argument of the contention that the fill in progress was not the repairing of, nor the furnishing of support to, the bridge, which, by the testimony of the engineer in charge of bridges, had about a year 'of life' remaining when the accident occurred. For this reason it is contended that the principles of the Pedersen decision, \n229 U.S. 146\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 648, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 153, do not apply. But in the view we take of the case this is not important.\n With these facts before it, the Supreme Court of Idaho, in its judgment which we are reviewing, reversed the judgment of the lower court in Kinzell's favor, solely upon the ground that he was not employed in interstate commerce at the time he was injured, and gave this as the reason for its conclusion:\n'We are of the opinion that constructing a fill to take the place of a trestle which is being used in interstate commerce is new construction, and that the fill does not become a part of the railroad until it is completed and the track is placed upon it instead of upon the trestle.'\n\n Such conclusion, of course, is not derived from any construction of the act of Congress, but rests wholly upon the interpretation which the court placed upon the undisputed facts, as we have stated them.\n The federal Employers' Liability Act provides that:\n'Every common carrier by railroad while engaging in commerce between any of the several states ... shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while \n\n[250 U.S. 130, 133]\n\u00a0\n he is employed by such carrier in such commerce.' 35 Stat. 65, c. 149.\n\n It being admitted that the railway company was engaged in interstate commerce, the only question for decision is whether the petitioner was employed in such commerce, within the meaning of the act as construed by this court.\n In Pedersen v. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R. R. Co., \n229 U.S. 146\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 648, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 153, it is stated that a guide to a decision of such a case as we have here may be found in the questions: Was the work being done independently of the interstate commerce in which the company was engaged, or was it so closely connected therewith as to be a part of it? Was its performance a matter of indifference so far as that commerce was concerned, or was it in the nature of a duty resting upon the carrier? And in other cases it is said, in substance, that in such inquiries may be found the true test of employment in such commerce in the sense intended by the act. Shanks v. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R. R. Co., \n239 \nU.S. 556, 558\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 188, L. R. A. 1916C, 797; New York Central R. R. Co. v. White, \n243 \nU.S. 188, 192\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1 Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629. It is also settled that the doing of work which has for its immediate purpose the furthering of the conduct of interstate commerce constitutes an employment in such commerce within the meaning of the act. New York Central, etc., R. R. Co. v. Carr, \n238 U.S. 260\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 780; Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Parker, \n242 U.S. 13\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 4; Pecos & Northern Texas Ry. Co. v. Rosenbloom, \n240 U.S. 439\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 390; Southern Railway Co. v. Puckett, \n244 \nU.S. 571, 573\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 703, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 69.\n It is in evidence in this case, indeed, it is obvious, that the 'dozer' was not called into use until the fill had reached the level of the tops of the ties and had become of such width that the earth when dumped would pile up near the track so as to fall back upon it, if not removed, and that it was used for the double purpose of keeping the rails clear for the interstate commerce passing over them and \n\n[250 U.S. 130, 134]\n\u00a0\n for pushing the material to the edge of the embankment to widen it. When to this it is added that a part of Kinzell's duty was, with a shovel, to keep the track between the rails clear of earth and stones, which might fall upon it in the progress of the work, clearly it cannot be soundly said that when he was in the act of preparing to make the required use of the 'dozer' he was acting independently of the interstate commerce in which the railway company was engaged, or that the performance of his duties was a matter of indifference to the conduct of that commerce. He was 'employed' in keeping the interstate track, which was in daily use, clear and safe for interstate trains, or, as the superintendent of the railway company stated it, he was engaged with the 'dozer' and shovel in making the track safe for the operation of trains and in avoiding delay to the commerce passing over it. Thus the case falls plainly within the scope of the decisions which we have cited, supra, and, regardless of what might have been said of the fill before, it had clearly become a part of the interstate railway when the petitioner was injured, for it had reached the stage where it required the work of men and machinery to keep the interstate tracks clear during further construction, and the work of such men was thereafter not only concerned with, it was an intimate and integral part of, the conducting of interstate transportation over the bridge.\n We cannot doubt that the Supreme Court of Idaho fell into error in regarding the fill as new construction so unrelated to the conduct of interstate commerce over the bridge at the time the accident to the petitioner occurred that the work being done by him should be regarded as not related to or necessary to the safe conduct of that commerce, and the judgment of that court is therefore reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","113":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nL. A. WESTERMANN CO. v. DISPATCH PRINTING CO.(1919)\nNo. 50\nArgued: Decided: March 3, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[249 U.S. 100, 101]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Curtis C. Williams, of Columbus, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Smith W. Bennett, of Columbus, Ohio, and Luther Day, of Cleveland, Ohio, for respondent.\n\n\n[249 U.S. 100, 102]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a bill for an injunction against future infringement of certain copyrights and to recover damages for past infringement. The injunction was granted and in this both parties acquiesced. In addition, the District Court found that there were seven cases of infringement and awarded $10 as nominal damages for each case-$70 in all. The plaintiff appealed, insisting that for each case it was entitled under the copyright law to an award of not less than $250. The Circuit Court of Appeals sustained that contention, but held that what the District Court regarded as seven cases was only one, and directed that the decree be modified by awarding $250, instead of $70, as damages. 233 Fed. 609, 147 C. C. A. 417. A writ of certiorari granted on the plaintiff's petition brings the matter here.\n Whether there were seven cases of infringement or only one, and whether the damages should have been assessed at not less than $250 for each case, are the questions to be considered. The facts bearing on the solution of these questions are as follows:\n The plaintiff designs and produces pictorial illustrations of styles in women's apparel and supplies the same to dealers in such apparel for use in advertising their \n\n[249 U.S. 100, 103]\n\u00a0\n goods. All the illustrations are separately copyrighted and all authorized copies carry the required copyright notice. The plaintiff grants exclusive licenses to use the illustrations for limited periods, each license being restricted to a particular locality. The dealer obtaining the license pays a fixed charge for it. Ordinarily the fact that the license is exclusive makes it attractive, serves as an incentive for paying the charge and is a helpful feature of the plaintiff's business. But when infringers use the illustrations the strength of that feature diminishes and the plaintiff's business suffers accordingly.\n At the time of the infringing acts in question the Moorehouse-Martens Company, a dealer at Columbus, Ohio, had an exclusive license from the plaintiff covering the use of the illustrations in that locality.\n The defendant publishes at Columbus a daily newspaper, each issue comprising as many as 30,000 copies widely circulated. Without the consent or authority of the plaintiff or its licensee the defendant reproduced and published in its newspaper six of the plaintiff's copyrighted illustrations. They were published separately, each in a distinct issue and in all the copies. Five were published once and the other one twice, the illustrations being used in each instance as part of an advertisement by some competitor in trade of the plaintiff's licensee. These two advertisements having the same illustration were by different advertisers and were separated by an interval of 26 days.\n The record, while showing that the plaintiff was damaged by the infringing publications, does not show the amount of the damages, a matter which is explained by undisputed testimony to the effect that the damages could not be estimated or stated 'in dollars and cents, or in money.' On this point the Circuit Court of Appeals aptly said:\n'The plaintiff's damages rested in the injury to his Moorehouse contract, and in the discouragement of \n\n[249 U.S. 100, 104]\n\u00a0\n and the tendency to destroy his system of business. To make any accurate proof of actual damages was obviously impossible.'\n\n Whether the defendant made any profit from the publications does not appear. In its bill the plaintiff asked for what are termed statutory damages in lieu of actual damages and profits.\n The copyright statute, Act March 4, 1909, c. 320, 35 Stat. 1075 (Comp. St.  9517-9524, 9530-9584), gives to one who copyrights a pictorial illustration the exclusive right to print, reprint, publish, copy and vend the same (sections 1 and 5), and provides (section 251) that one who infringes 'the copyright in any work' so protected shall be liable, among other things--\n'(b) To pay to the copyright proprietor such damages as the copyright proprietor may have suffered due to the infringement, as well as all the profits which the infringer shall have made from such infringement, ... or in lieu of actual damages and profits such damages as to the court shall appear to be just, and in assessing such damages the court may, in its discretion, allow the amounts as hereinafter stated, but in the case of a newspaper reproduction of a copyrighted photograph such damages shall not exceed the sum of two hundred dollars nor be less than the sum of fifty dollars, ... and such damages shall in no other case exceed the sum of five thousand dollars nor be less than the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars, and shall not be regarded as a penalty. ...\n\n'First. In the case of a painting, statue, or sculpture, ten dollars, for every infringing copy made or sold by or found in the possession of the infringer or his agents or employes;\n\n'Second. In the case of any work enumerated in section five of this act2 except a painting, statute, or sculp ture, \n\n[249 U.S. 100, 105]\n\u00a0\n one dollar for every infringing copy made or sold by or found in the possession of the infringer or his agents or employees;\n\n'Third. In the case of a lecture, sermon, or address, fifty dollars for every infringing delivery;\n\n'Fourth. In the case of a dramatic or dramatico-musical or choral or orchestral composition, one hundred dollars for the first and fifty dollars for every subsequent infringing performance; in the case of other musical compositions, ten dollars for every infringing performance.'\n\n The statute says that the liability thus defined is imposed for infringing 'the copyright in any' copyrighted 'work.' The words are in the singular, not the plural. Each copyright is treated as a distinct entity, and the infringement of it as a distinct wrong to be redressed through the enforcement of this liability. Infringement of several copyrights is not put on the same level with infringement of one. One the contrary, the plain import of the statute is that this liability attaches in respect of each copyright that is infringed. Here six were infringed, each covering a different illustration. Thus there were at least six cases of infringment in the sense of the statute. Was there also another? The illustration covered by one of the copyrights was published on two separate occasions, each time in a different advertisement. There was no connection between the two advertisements other than the inclusion of the same illustration in both. Each was by a different advertiser and was published at his instance and for his benefit. The advertisers were not joint, but independent, infringers, neither having any connection with what was done by the other. By publishing their advertisements, the defendant participated in their independent infringements. In these circumstances, we think the second publication of the illustration must be regarded as another and distinct case of infringement. Whether it would be otherwise if that publication had \n\n[249 U.S. 100, 106]\n\u00a0\n been merely a continuation or repetition of the first, and what bearing the 'third' and 'fourth' subdivisions of section 25, before quoted, would have on the solution of that question, are matters which we have no occasion to consider now. They are mentioned only to show that no ruling thereon is intended.\n We conclude, as did the District Court, that there were seven cases of infringement in the sense of the statute.\n On the question of the amount of damages to be awarded for each case we are in accord with the Circuit Court of Appeals. Both parties recognize that under the proofs the damages must be assessed under the alternative provision requiring the infringer, in lieu of actual damages and profits, to pay such damages as to the court shall appear to be just, etc. The fact that these damages are to be 'in lieu of actual damages' shows that something other than actual damages is intended-that another measure is to be applied in making the assessment. There is no uncertainty as to what that measure is or as to its limitations. The statute says, first, that the damages are to be such as to the court shall appear to be just; next, that the court may, in its discretion, allow the amounts named in the appended schedule, and finally, that in no case shall they be more than $5, 000 nor less than $250, except that for a newspaper reproduction of a copyrighted photograph they shall not be more than $200 nor less than $50. In other words, the court's conception of what is just in the particular case, considering the nature of the copyright, the circumstances of the infringement and the like, is made the measure of the damages to be paid, but with the express qualification that in every case the assessment must be within the prescribed limitations, that is to say, neither more than the maximum nor less than the minimum. Within these limitations the court's discretion and sense of justice are controlling, but it has \n\n[249 U.S. 100, 107]\n\u00a0\n no discretion when proceeding under this provision to go outside of them.\n Apart from the natural import of its words, the history of the provision makes strongly for this view. An early statute required the infringer of a copyright in a dramatic composition to pay such damages 'as to the court shall appear to be just,' but 'not less than' a prescribed amount. Act Aug. 18, 1856, c. 169, 11 Stat. 138; Act July 8, 1870, c. 230 ,  101, 16 Stat. 214. This statute became section 4966 of the Revised Statutes. A later statute provided that the recovery for infringing a copyright in an engraving should not be less than $250 nor more than $10, 000, and for infringing a copyright in a photograph of an object other than a work of art should not be less than $100 nor more than $5,000. Act March 2, 1895, c. 194, 28 Stat. 965. In 1909, when the copyright statutes were revised, these provisions, and others without present bearing, were brought together in the 'in lieu' provision now under consideration. True, they were broadened so as to include other copyrights and the limitations were changed in amount, but the principle on which they proceeded-that of committing the amount of damages to be recovered to the court's discretion and sense of justice, subject to prescribed limitations-was retained. The new provision, like one of the old, says the damages shall be such 'as to the court shall appear to be just.' Like both the old, it prescribes a minimum limitation and, like one, a maximum limitation.\n In Brady v. Daly, \n175 U.S. 148\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 62, which was an action to recover for the infringement of a copyright in a dramatic composition, the first of the earlier provisions-that in section 4966, Rev. Stat.-was much considered. The trial court was of opinion that, while the damages were to be such as appeared to it to be just, it could not go below the prescribed minimum; and it made the assessment accordingly. In this court it was contended that in this view \n\n[249 U.S. 100, 108]\n\u00a0\n the provision was penal and the action was one to recover a penalty. But the contention was overruled and the judgment affirmed, the court saying ( \n175 \nU.S. 154, 157\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 64, 65 [44 L. Ed. 109]):\n'It is evident that in many cases it would be quite difficult to prove the exact amount of damages which the proprietor of a copyrighted dramatic composition suffered by reason of its unlawful production by another, and yet it is also evident that the statute seeks to provide a remedy for such a wrong and to grant to the proprietor the right to recover the damages which he has sustained therefrom.\n\n'The idea of the punishment of the wrongdoer is not so much suggested by the language used in the statute as is a desire to provide for the recovery by the proprietor of full compensation from the wrongdoer for the damages such proprietor has sustained from the wrongful act of the latter. In the face of the difficulty of determining the amount of such damages in all cases, the statute provides a minimum sum for a recovery in any case, leaving it open for a larger recovery upon proof of greater damage in those cases where such proof can be made. The statute itself does not speak of punishment or penalties, but refers entirely to damages suffered by the wrongful act. The person wrongfully performing or representing a dramatic composition is, in the words of the statute, 'liable for damages therefor.' This means all the damages that are the direct result of his wrongful act. The further provision in the statute, that those damages shall be at least a certain sum named in the statute itself, does not change the character of the statute and render it a penal instead of a remedial one. ...\n\n'Although punishment, in a certain and very limited sense, may be the result of the statute before us so far as the wrongdoer is concerned, yet we think it clear such is not its chief purpose, which is the award of damages to the party who had sustained them, and the minimum \n\n[249 U.S. 100, 109]\n\u00a0\n amount appears to us to have been fixed because of the inherent difficulty of always proving by satisfactory evidence what the amount is which has been actually sustained.'\n\n It was after the minimum limitation was thus recognized as of controlling force in the assessment of the damages that the terms of the provision then under consideration were substantially repeated in the 'in lieu' provision of the revised act. This hardly would have been done had it not been intended that the limitation should be as controlling there as in the earlier statute. That it was intended to be thus controlling is shown by the reports of the committees on whose recommendation the act was passed. House Report No. 2222 and Senate Report No. 1108, 60th Cong., 2d Sess.\n In our opinion the District Court erred in awarding less than $250 damages in each of the seven cases, and the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in holding there was only one case instead of seven.\n Decree reversed.\n Mr. Justice DAY did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] For a subsequent amendment of this section see Act Aug. 24, 1912, c. 356, 37 Stat. 488 (Comp.

Barker, of New York City, for plaintiff in error. \n\n[248 U.S. 465, 466]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Thomas H. Peeples and C. N. Sapp, both of Columbia, S. C., and Fred H. Dominick, of Newberry, S. C., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n An act of South Carolina approved March 2, 1916 (29 St. at Large, p. 676), entitled 'An act to provide for the licensing of insurance brokers,' defines in its first section an insurance broker 'to be such person as shall be licensed by the insurance commissioner to represent citizens' of the state in placing insurance with insurers in the 'state or in any other state or country.' And it is provided in section 2 of the act, among other conditions, that only such persons may be licensed as are residents of the state and have been licensed insurance agents of the state for at least two years.\n La Tourette offered to comply with all of the provisions of the act, but could not comply with the requirement of section 2, he being, as he alleged, a resident and citizen of New York; and he attacked the requirement by a petition in the Supreme Court of the state by which he charged it to be a violation of the Constitution of the state and of section 2 of article 4 and the Fourteenth Amendment of \n\n[248 U.S. 465, 467]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution of the United States in that he, a citizen of New York, was denied the privileges and immunities granted to citizens of the state of South Carolina and deprived of liberty and property without due process of law. He further alleged that the commissioner had refused to issue a license to him and prayed that he be required to do so.\n The insurance commissioner, by the Attorney General of the state and other counsel, demurred to the petition, asserting as the ground thereof that the requirement of the act was a legal exercise of the police power of the state and that La Tourette was not deprived of any privilege or immunity secured to citizens of other states by the Constitution of the United States. The court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the petition, and to that action this writ of error is directed.\n The pleadings and the action of the court indicate the question in the case, and, it would seem, the elements of it, but they are not clearly segregated in the argument of counsel. They seem to be (1) That La Tourette is deprived of his liberty and a property right by the act of the state in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. ( 2) That the act discriminates against citizens of other states in favor of citizens of the state of South Carolina in violation of section 2, article 4, of the Constitution of the United States.\n\n 1. \nThis contention depends upon the character of the business of insurance, and it was decided in German Alliance Insurance Co. v. Kansas, \n233 U.S. 389\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 612, L. R. A. 1915C, 1189, to be clothed with a public interest and subject, therefore, to the regulating power of the state. And it necessarily follows that, as insurance is affected with a public interest, those engaged in it or who bring about its consummation are affected with the same interest and subject to regulation as it is. A broker is so engaged-is an instrument of such consummation. The statute makes him the representative \n\n[248 U.S. 465, 468]\n\u00a0\n of the insured. He is also the representative of the insurer (Hooper v. California, \n155 \nU.S. 648, 657\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 207), and his fidelity to both may be the concern of the state to secure. As said by the Supreme Court of the state (104 S. C. 501, 89 S. E. 398):\n'It is important for the protection of the interests of the people of the state that the business should be in the hands of competent and trustworthy persons.'\n\n And we may say that this result can be more confidently and completely secured through resident brokers, they being immediately under the inspection of the commissioner of insurance. \n1\n The motive of the statute, therefore, is benefit to insurer and insured and the means it provides seem to be appropriate.\n'But we need not cast about for reasons for the legislative judgment. We are not required to be sure of the precise reasons for its exercise or be convinced of the wisdom of its exercise.' It is enough if the legislation be passed in the exercise of a power of government and has relation to that power. Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis, \n240 \nU.S. 342, 365\n, 366 S., 36 Sup. Ct. 370, L. R. A. 1917A, 421, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 455, and cases cited; also Bunting v. Oregon, \n243 \nU.S. 426, 437\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 435, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 1043\n\n\n\n 2. This contention, that is, that the act discriminates against citizens of other states and thereby offends the \n\n[248 U.S. 465, 469]\n\u00a0\n Constitution of the United States, is La Tourette's ultimate reliance, and to it his counsel devote their entire argument. The state replies its power over insurance and that the legislation it justifies extends to its agents and is best executed when they are residents of the state. This view we have sustained, and manifestly to declare the legislation illegal is to put a restraint upon a power that has practical justifications.\n The illegality of the act is, however, earnestly urged and that it is a 'trade regulation' and recognizes 'the business, trade or occupation of an insurance broker as proper and legitimate,' and yet denies to La Tourette, a citizen of New York, the right to engage in it and thereby abridges the privileges and immunities that he has as a citizen. The contention is expressed and illustrated in a number of ways, and the privilege of a citizen is defined to be 'the right to pursue and obtain happiness and safety' and 'to pursue any lawful business or vocation, in any manner not inconsistent with the equal rights of others,' and that whatever rights a state grants to its own citizens are the measure within its jurisdiction of the rights of the citizens of other states, and for these propositions the Slaughterhouse Cases, 16 Wall. 36, and Butchers' Union v. Crescent City Co., \n111 U.S. 746\n, 4 Sup. Ct. 652, are cited. Other cases are also cited in illustration. We do not dispute the propositions, and to see if they determine against the act under review we must turn to its words, as did the Supreme Court of the state, whose interpretation of them we must accept. It said, speaking by Mr. Justice Hydrick:\n'A citizen of any state of the Union who is a resident of this state and has been a licensed insurance agent of this state for at least two years may obtain a broker's license; on the other hand, a citizen of this state, who is not a resident of the state and has not been a licensed insurance agent of this state for two years, may not be licensed. No discrimination is made \n\n[248 U.S. 465, 470]\n\u00a0\n on account of citizenship. It rests alone on residence in the state and experience in the business.'\n\n And the court further said:\n'Citizenship and residence are not the same thing, nor does one include the other. Cummings v. Wingo, 31 S. C. 427, 435, 10 S. E. 107, and authorities cited. But our conclusion is not rested upon the mere use of the word 'residents'; for no doubt it might appear from the purpose and scope of an act that 'residents' was used in the sense of 'citizens.' If so, the court would so construe it; and in no event would the court sanction an evasion of the purpose and intent of this wise and wholesome provision of the Constitution based on mere verbiage. But there is nothing in the act to suggest any such intention. On the contrary, the words 'residents' and 'citizens' are both used, and each apparently in its ordinary legal sense, which is well defined and understood, making a distinction which is substantial in its purpose and one that is sanctioned by the highest judicial authority.'\n\n The court thus distinguishes between citizens and residents and decides that it is the purpose of the statute to do so and, by doing so, it avoids discrimination. In other words, it is the effect of the statute that its requirement applies as well to citizens of the state of South Carolina as to citizens of other states, residence and citizenship being different things.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 3.

Schneider, of Northwood Park, Ill., and Edward J. Brundage, of Chicago, Ill., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n For 25 years the Lake Erie & Western Railroad Company maintained and operated on its right of way at Elliott, Ill., a side track passing a grain elevator and coal yard operated by one Cameron. The elevator stood partly on the right of way and partly on ground owned by Cameron, his occupancy of the former being under a lease. In May, 1915, the elevator was destroyed by fire, whereupon the company exercised a reserved option to cancel the lease and also took up the side track. Cameron protested against the latter, proceeded to rebuild the elevator at its former location, but wholly on his own ground, and in June, 1915, filed with the Public Utilities Commission a petition praying that a restoration of the track be ordered. After notice and hearing the commission granted such an order and it was upheld by the circuit and supreme courts of the state. State Public Utilities Commission ex rel. v. Lake Erie & W. R. Co., 277 Ill. 574, 115 N. E. 519. \n\n[249 U.S. 422, 424]\n\u00a0\n It is contended here, as it was in the state courts, that the order contravenes the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, in that it takes property of the railroad company for private use, or for public use without compensation.\n Such an order, being legislative in its nature and made by an instrumentality of the state, is a state law within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States and the laws of Congress regulating our jurisdiction. Grand Trunk Western Ry. Co. v. Railroad Commission of Indiana, \n221 \nU.S. 400, 403\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 537; Ross v. Oregon, \n227 \nU.S. 150, 162\n, 163 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 220, Ann.

Ct. 237.\n Under the laws of the state the side track before its removal, although used principally in moving freight from and to Cameron's elevator and coal yard, was open to use by the public and subject to public control like other parts of the company's road; in other words, it was a track which the state impressed with a public character. Truesdale v. Grape Sugar Co., 101 Ill. 561, 567; Chicago Dock & Canal Co. v. Garrity, 115 Ill. 155, 167, 171, 3 N. E. 448; Chicago & Alton R. R. Co. v. Suffern, 129 Ill. 274, 286, 21 N. E. 824. Not only so, but the statute under which its restoration was ordered contains express provisions whereby it will retain that character and be open to use by other shippers as well as by Cameron. Hurd's Stat. 1916, c. 111a,  45.\n The shipments for which the track has been used have yielded the company a revenue of about $20,000 each year for several years. What the cost of restoration will be the record does not disclose, but the commission, with knowledge of such matters, has found that it is justified by the business reasonably to be expected; and the Su- \n\n[249 U.S. 422, 425]\n\u00a0\n preme Court of the state, besides sustaining that and other findings of the commission, aptly points out that but for the hasty and improper removal of the track the company 'would not be at the expense of replacing it.' When the track is restored the company will own it and be entitled to make a reasonable charge for its use, just as is the case with other property employed in the company's transportation service.\n Applying the decision just announced in Chicago & Northwestern Ry. Co. v. Ochs Brick & Tile Co., \n249 U.S. 416\n, 39 Sup.

DARLINGTON(1919)\nNo. 219\nArgued: March 12, 1919Decided: March 31, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[249 U.S. 331, 332]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Kearful, for appellant.\n Mr. Francis W. Clements, of Washington, D. C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity brought by the appellees to restrain the Secretary of the Interior from carrying out a resurvey of a part of the boundary of a Mexican grant. The plaintiffs hold the legal title to the grant and the adjoining land belongs to the United States. The boundary was surveyed by one Hancock and on June 22, 1872, the grant was patented. A bill to set aside the patent was dismissed in United States v. Hancock, \n133 U.S. 193\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 264 (1890). Doubts having arisen as to where a portion of the Hancock line on the northern boundary ran, the Land Department employed one Perrin to make a resurvey. It found and reestablished the original monuments except between Hancock's stations 20 and 25, and attempted to fix the line between these also. In 1901 the resurvey was approved by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, but in 1902 on an appeal, the Secretary of the Interior reversed the approval and ordered a new survey of the line between stations 20 and 25. This was made by one Sickler and was approved by the Secretary of the Interior on February 28, 1907. On September 5, 1913, the Secretary vacated the Sickler survey and ordered the reestablishment of the Perrin line. The present bill to restrain the carrying out of this order was dismissed on motion by the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia but the decree was reversed and an injunction ordered by the Court of Appeals.\n The bill, of course, is not a bill against the United States brought on the ground that it is claiming land \n\n[249 U.S. 331, 333]\n\u00a0\n belonging to the plaintiffs. The bill does not seek to try the title. It is brought on the ground that the power of the Secretary is exhausted, and it may be doubted Whether that is a matter with which the plaintiffs have anything to do. But however that may be, the whole proceeding on behalf of the United States is simply an effort to fix the boundaries of its own land. It is recognized, it was recognized when the Perrin survey was set aside, that the United States has no authority to change the Hancock line; but it has a right for its own purposes to try to find out where that line runs and the fact that its conclusions may differ from that of the owners of the Hancock grant does not diminish that right. So long as the United States has not conveyed its land it is entitled to survey and resurvey what it owns and to establish and reestablish boundaries, as well one boundary as another, the only limit being that what it thus does for its own information cannot affect the rights of owners on the other side of the line already existing in theory of law. If, as the result of the survey adopted, the United States should give patents for land thought by the plaintiffs to belong to them, 'the courts can then in the appropriate proceeding determine who has the better title or right. To interfere now, is to take from the officers of the Land Department the functions which the law confides to them and exercise them by the court.' Litchfield v. Register and Receiver, 9 Wall. 575, 578 (19 L. Ed. 681); Minnesota v. Lane, \n247 \nU.S. 243, 250\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 508\n\n\n We know of no warrant for the notion that the power is exhausted by a single exercise of it. Repeated retracement of lines, although, of course, exceptions, are well known, we believe, to the Land Department, as, with the limitation that we have expressed, there is no reason why they should not be. The case is different when the act of the Secretary is directed to a third person, as for instance, the approval of a map of the location of a railroad over public lands, where the approval operates as a \n\n[249 U.S. 331, 334]\n\u00a0\n grant. Noble v. Union River Logging R. R. Co., \n147 U.S. 165\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 271. See New Orleans v. Paine, \n147 \nU.S. 261, 267\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 303. But this retracing of the Hancock line is not directed to the plaintiffs, but, as we have said, is an investigation by the United States on its own account. The plaintiffs gained no rights by the approval of the Sickler line; they lose none by the substitution of the Perrin line. These acts were neither adjudications nor agreements. The plaintiffs' rights were fixed before. Even after land had been sold with reference to a survey and plat that had been approved, this Court refused to restrain the Secretary from making a new survey in Kirwan v.

Edward Wright, of Washington, D. C., for appellants.\n Messrs. Ralph S. Rounds, of New York City, Alton M. Cates, of Los Angeles, Cal., and Henry P. Blair, of Washington, D. C., for appellee. \n\n[249 U.S. 110, 111]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to enjoin the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of the General Land Office from offering, listing, or disposing of certain lands in southern Arizona as public lands of the United States. The lands include the site of the pueblo of Santa Rosa and the surrounding territory, comprise some 460,000 acres, and are within the region acquired from Mexico under what is known as the Gadsden Treaty of December 30, 1853. 10 Stat. 1031. The suit is brought by the pueblo of Santa Rosa, and its right to the relief sought is based on two allegations, which are elaborated in the bill: One that under the laws of Spain and Mexico it had, when that region was acquired by the United States, and under the provisions of the treaty it now has, a complete and perfect title to the lands in question; and the other, that in disregard of its title the defendants are threatening and proceeding to offer, list and dispose of these lands as public lands of the United States. In the court of first instance the bill was challenged by a motion to dismiss in the nature of a demurrer, and the motion was sustained. In the Court of Appeals the case made by the allegations in the bill was held to be one entitling the plaintiff to the relief sought, and the decree of dismissal was reversed with a direction that a permanent injunction be awarded. Pueblo of Santa Rosa v. Lane, 46 App. D. C. 411. The latter decision is challenged here on two grounds: One, that the plaintiff is not a legal entity and has no capacity to maintain the suit; and the other, that in any event, the defendant should not be subjected to a permanent injunction without according them an opportunity to answer the bill.\n The plaintiff is an Indian town whose inhabitants are a simple and uninformed people, measurably civilized and industrious, living in substantial houses and engaged in agricultural and pastoral pursuits. Its existence, practically \n\n[249 U.S. 110, 112]\n\u00a0\n as it is to-day, can be traced back through the period of Mexican rule into that of the Spanish kings. It was known then, as now, as the pueblo of Santa Rosa, and its inhabitants were known then, as now, as Pueblo Indians. During the Spanish, as also the Mexican, dominion it enjoyed a large measure of local self-government and was recognized as having capacity to acquire and hold lands and other property. With much reason this might be regarded as enabling and entitling it to became a suitor for the purpose of enforcing or defending its property interests. See School District v. Wood, 13 Mass. 193, 198; Cooley's Const. Lim. (7th Ed.) p. 276; 1 Dillon, Munic. Corp. (5th Ed.)  50, 64, 65. But our decision need not be put on that ground for there is another which arises out of our own laws and is in itself sufficient. After the Gadsden Treaty Congress made that region part of the territory of New Mexico and subjected it to 'all the laws' of that territory. Act Aug. 4, 1854, c. 245, 10 Stat. 575. One of those laws provided that the inhabitants of any Indian pueblo having a grant or concession of lands from Spain or Mexico, such as is here claimed, should be a body corporate and as such capable of suing or defending in respect of such lands. Laws New Mex. 1851-52, pp. 176, 418. If the plaintiff was not a legal entity and juristic person before, it became such under that law; and it retained that status after Congress included it in the territory of Arizona, for the act by which this was done extended to that territory all legislative enactments of the territory of New Mexico. Act Feb. 24, 1863, c. 56, 12 Stat. 664. The fact that Arizona has since become a state does not affect the plaintiff's corporate status or its power to sue. See Kansas Pacific R. R. Co. v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R. R. Co., \n112 U.S. 414\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 208.\n The case of Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, on which the defendants place some reliance, is not in point. \n\n[249 U.S. 110, 113]\n\u00a0\n The question there was not whether the Cherokee Tribe had the requisite capacity to sue in a court of general jurisdiction, but whether it was a 'foreign state' in the sense of the judiciary article of the Constitution, and therefore entitled to maintain an original suit in this court against the state of Georgia. The court held that the tribe, although uniformly treated as a distinct political society capable of engaging in treaty stipulations, was not a 'foreign state' in the sense intended, and so could not maintain such a suit. This is all that was decided.\n The defendants assert with much earnestness that the Indians of this pueblo are wards of the United States-recognized as such by the legislative and executive departments-and that in consequence the disposal of their lands is not within their own control, but subject to such regulations as Congress may prescribe for their benefit and protection. Assuming, without so deciding, that this is all true,1 we think it has no real bearing on the point we are considering. Certainly it would not justify the defendants in treating the lands of these Indians-to which, according to the bill, they have a complete and perfect title-as public lands of the United States and disposing of the same under the public land laws. That would not be an exercise of guardianship, but an act of confiscation. Besides, the Indians are not here seeking to establish any power or capacity in themselves to dispose of the lands, but only to prevent a threatened disposal by administrative officers in disregard of their full ownership. Of their capacity to maintain such a suit we entertain no doubt. The existing wardship is not an obstacle, as is shown by repeated decisions of this court, \n\n[249 U.S. 110, 114]\n\u00a0\n of which Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, \n187 U.S. 553\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 216, is an illustration.\n In view of the very broad allegations of the bill, the accuracy of which has not been challenged as yet, we have assumed in what has been said that the plaintiff's claim was valid in its entirety under the Spanish and Mexican laws, and that it encounters no obstaclein the concluding provision of the sixth article of the Gadsden Treaty, but no decision on either point is intended. Both involve questions not covered by the briefs or the discussion at the bar and are left open to investigation and decision in the further progress of the cause.\n Of course, the Court of Appeals ought not to have directed the entry of a final decree awarding a permanent injunction against the defendants. They were entitled to an opportunity to answer to the merits just as if their motion to dismiss had been overruled in the court of first instance. By the direction given they were denied such an opportunity, and this was a plain and prejudicial error.\n Our conclusion is that the decrees of both courts below should be reversed and the cause remanded to the court of first instance, with directions to overrule the motion to dismiss, to afford the defendants an opportunity to answer the bill, to grant an order restraining them from in any wise offering, listing or disposing of any of the lands in question pending the final decree, and to take such further proceedings as may be appropriate and not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Decree reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Chouteau v.

The Circuit Court dismissed the bill (189 Fed. 419), the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed its decree ( 208 Fed. 854, 126 C. C. A. 12), and an appeal to this court was allowed.\n The lands in question were granted or leased April 30, 1881, by the state of New Jersey, acting by its riparian commissioners appointed under an Act of March 31, 1869 (P.

L. p. 149 ), and its supplements, caused an adjustment of the taxes to be made, which was confirmed by a circuit judge, pursuant to the act. The assessment resulted in a large reduction in the amount of the taxes, fixing the aggregate burden upon appellant's land at about $108,000, including the taxes for the years 1904, 1905, 1906, and 1907, which were included in the adjustment. The adjusted taxes were made the basis of a supplemental bill herein. At the same time they were reviewed by the Supreme Court of the state upon a writ of certiorari prosecuted by the city, and were sustained by that court and by the Court of Errors and Appeals. Jersey City v. Speer, 78 N. J. Law, 34, 72 Atl. 448; Id., 79 N. J. Law, 598, 76 Atl. 1037. That review, however, did not involve the questions now raised.\n In the present suit the validity of the taxes was assailed principally upon four grounds: First, that the lands were not owned by the Morris & Cumings Dredging company or by appellant in such a sense as to make them taxable in their hands under the state laws, but on the contrary remained the property of the state; second, that the lands, although within the territorial limits of the state of New Jersey, were, by the compact made in the year 1833 between that state and the state of New York, approved by Act of Congress of June 28, 1834 (4 Stat. 708, c. 126), made subject to the governmental jurisdiction of the state of New York, and that the imposition of a tax upon \n\n[248 U.S. 328, 331]\n\u00a0\n them under the authority of the state of New Jersey would deprive appellant of his property without due process of law in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; third, that the lands were not within the taxing district of Jersey City; and, fourth, that the lien of the taxes had expired.\n Since the suit was commenced the second contention, which raised the only substantial federal question, has been decided adversely to appellant by this court in Central R. R. Co. v. Jersey City, \n209 U.S. 473\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 592.\n The third and fourth points are satisfactorily dealt with in the opinions of the Circuit Court and Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The first point-whether the interest of appellant and of his predecessor in title were taxable under the laws of the state-is the one chiefly relied on in this court. It is insisted, and for the purposes of the decision we assume, that the state laws provide for taxing lands only against the owner, and not against a lessee. Hence, the crucial question on this branch of the case is whether the riparian grant under which appellant derives his title is a mere lease, as contended by him, or confers such an ownership as is taxable under the state laws; in short, whether the state or the grantee is the owner.\n The legislation by which the powers of the riparian commissioners are defined is set forth in the opinion of the Circuit Court (189 Fed. 422-425 ), and need not be here repeated. Suffice it to say that it authorizes the making, in the name and behalf of the state, of such a grant or lease as that which was made to the Morris & Cumings Dredging Company, and which that company assigned to appellant. The instrument recites that the company, being the owner of lands fronting on New York Bay, and desirous of obtaining a lease for the lands under water lying in front of them, had applied to the riparian commissioners and the governor for such a lease, and in compliance, \n\n[248 U.S. 328, 332]\n\u00a0\n with the application the commissioners had agreed to lease the submerged lands in question, and had fixed the sum of $4,233.60 as the annual rental to be paid for them, and the sum of $60,480 as the price on payment of which a conveyance of the lands free from rent would be made; the instrument proceeds in the name of the state to 'bargain, sell, lease, and convey unto the said the Morris & Cumings Dredging Company and to its successors and assigns forever' the submerged lands in question ( describing them), 'and also the right, liberty, privilege, and franchise to exclude the tide water from so much of the lands above described as lie under tide water by filling in or otherwise inproving the same and to appropriate the land above described to their exclusive private use.' There follows an habendum clause to the effect that the lands granted and all rights and privileges exercisable within and over or with reference to the same in manner and form as granted are to be held by the company and its successors and assigns forever, subject to the payment of the rent specified in semi-annual instalments. There is an express covenant for the payment of the rent at the times appointed, with the right on the part of the state to reenter for nonpayment; and there is a covenant by the state to convey the lands or any part thereof to the company, its successors or assigns, free and discharged of the rent, upon payment to the state of the sum of $60,480, or an equitable portion thereof.\n With respect to a similar grant, made under the same statutory authority and containing like provisions, the court of last resort of New Jersey has held that it transmitted the entire estate of the grantor to the grantee; that the interest remaining in the state was not an actual estate but a right of entry for nonpayment of rent, and the mere possibility of a reverter for condition broken did not amount to an estate in reversion; and that the lands covered by the grant were not lands belonging to the \n\n[248 U.S. 328, 333]\n\u00a0\n state within the meaning of a section of the general railroad act which limited the power of corporations created thereunder to condemn lands for the uses contemplated by the act. Hudson Tunnel Co. v. Attorney General, 27 N. J. Eq. 573, 578. In Cook v. Bayonne, 80 N. J. Law, 596, 77 Atl. 1048, the Supreme Court of the state held that a riparian grant of the same character amounted to a conveyance in fee subject to a rent charge, and that the lands were taxable in the hands of the grantee. A similar view as to the nature of the estate which passes under a 'riparian lease' was taken by Vice Chancellor Leaming in the recent case of Ocean Front Imp. Co. v. Ocean City Gardens Co. (N. J. Ch.) 103 Atl. 419. The last two cases do not appear to have been reviewed by the court of last resort.\n Appellant refers to that part of the lease which grants the right to exclude the tide water from the lands described by filling in or otherwise improving the same and to appropriate the lands described to private use, and upon the strength of this insists that the instrument, whether by way of lease or in fee, confers a mere license to reclaim, and does not constitute the licensee the owner of the land or extinguish public rights therein unless and until the license is executed by actual reclamation. Polhemus v. Bateman, 60 N. J. Law, 163, 37 Atl. 1015, a decision by the Court of Errors and Appeals, is relied upon to support this contention. But the authority of that case has been much restricted by the subsequent decision of the same court in Burkhard v. Heinz Co., 71 N. J. Law, 562, 564, 60 Atl. 191, where it was pointed out that the judgment in the Polhemus Case was not as far-reaching as the opinion; that its legal effect was simply that such common rights as the right to fish in the sea were not annulled by a riparian grant until the grantee made some appropriation of the property inconsistent with them. We do not regard this as conclusive upon the present question.\n The other cases particularly relied upon, Long Dock Co. \n\n[248 U.S. 328, 334]\n\u00a0\n v. Board of Equalization of Taxes, 87 N. J. Law, 22, 93 Atl. 111, and Long Dock Co. v. State Board of Assessors, 89 N. J. Law, 108, 97 Atl. 900, and 90 N. J. Law, 701, 101 Atl. 367, so far as they touch the point at all, are based upon the language of the charter of the Long Dock Company (P. L. 1856, p. 67), and are not inconsistent with Hudson Tunnel Co. v. Attorney General, Cook v. Bayonne, and Ocean Front Imp. Co. v. Ocean City Gardens Co., supra. Under the doctrine of these cases, which we accept as well founded in reason, to say nothing of authority, appellant's estate is taxable under the New Jersey laws.\n Other points are raised, but none that seems to require mention.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","119":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEHIGH COAL & NAVIGATION CO. v. U S(1919)\nNo. 38\nArgued: October 14, 1919Decided: November 10, 1919\n\n\n\n Messrs. Henry S. Drinker, Jr., William Jay Turner, and Abraham M. Beitler, all of Philadelphia, Pa., for Lehigh Coal & Navigation Co. \n\n[250 U.S. 556, 557]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry S. Mitchell, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n\n[250 U.S. 556, 559]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The case is here on certificate, an outline of which it is necessary to give.\n The Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company, herein called the Company, is a miner and shipper of anthracite coal, and was indicted, convicted and fined in the District Court of New Jersey for accepting rebates and concessions from the Central Railroad of New Jersey in violation of the Elkins Act (Act Feb. 19, 1903, c. 708, 32 Stat. 847, Comp. St.  8597- 8599), as amended June 29, 1906 (34 Stat. 584, c. 3591).\n It was charged in the indictment that the Central Railroad Company was an interstate carrier of coal and as such filed tariffs and schedules with the Interstate Commerce Commission showing its rates and charges from the coal fields in Pennsylvania to points in New Jersey.\n During 1912, 1913, 1914, and a part of 1915, the tariffs were in force and under them the Company shipped a carload (described in the indictment) from its colliery in Pennsylvania to a specified point in New Jersey and accepted from the railroad a portion of the rate due and payable so that the coal was carried at less than the rate and the Company thus received the advantage of an illegal rebate. Discrimination was not charged.\n In accordance with circumstances, which are detailed at length in the certificate, among which was the fact that the Company at one time operated a railroad of its own (the Lehigh & Susquehanna), the Company decided to lease its railroad properties to the Central Railroad, a connecting carrier. Accordingly, March 31, 1871, it, the Company, made a lease to the Railroad, the 10th covenant of which provided as follows:\n'... On coal delivered for transportation by the Company on sidings at the northern end of the Nesquehoning tunnel, the rates of transportation shall not exceed \n\n[250 U.S. 556, 560]\n\u00a0\n the rates charged at the same time from Penn Haven to the same points on coal from the Lehigh region, either by the Central Railroad or by the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company.'\n\n In making the lease naturally the Company took into account the advantageous nearness of its mines to tide and sought to insure favorable rates for the coal from its collieries\n About 1878 the method of fixing rates was changed but the rate to be charged the Company was fixed at 86 per cent. of the rate charged to other mines in the Lehigh region, the reason being that there was that difference in distance. While this arrangement was in force the Company paid a net rate calculated on the basis of 86 per cent. After 1887, the date of the first act to regulate commerce, this method of settlement was changed and the Company was charged the full tariff rate, but was rebated or credited with 14 per cent. thereof, this being done under the obligation or supposed obligation of the tenth covenant. And between 1887 and August, 1906, when the Hepburn Act went into effect, this arrangement for repayment did not appear in the tariffs filed by the Railroad with the Commission. But in August, 1906, and thereafter the tariffs contained a footnote in the following form:\n'(4) In compliance with the Tenth Covenant of the lease from the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company under which the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey operates the Lehigh & Susquehanna Railroad, a lateral allowance is made out of herein-named rates to the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company on all anthracite coal originating on the latter's tracks in the Panther Creek, Nesquehoning, and Hacklebarnie districts, mined and shipped by it, when coming via the Hauto, Nesquehoning, and Mauch Chunk gateways.'\n\n All of the tariffs of the Railroad filed with the Commission after 1906 (262 in number) contained the footnote. \n\n[250 U.S. 556, 561]\n\u00a0\n The allowance was 19.18 cents per ton and this was credited in the monthly settlement of the Company's account with the Railroad, the credit being the point of the government's attack.\n'The verdict covers 27 shipments of coal in prepared sizes from Nesquehoning colliery for reshipment at Elizabeth. The foregoing facts were either proved or stipulated, and it appeared also without dispute that during the years in question the Company's officers were familiar with the contents of the Central Railroad's tariffs, and knew that the allowance was being made and accepted. One of the Company's defenses was that it had not 'knowingly' accepted a rebate within the meaning of the act-its contention being, that the allowance had been accepted in good faith, in the honest belief that the payment was justified by the tenth covenant, and also in the honest belief that the allowance was properly and legally noted and provided for in the filed and published tariffs.'\n\n The Company offered evidence that would support the following findings:\n\n\n (1)\n At the time the note was made, it, the Company, was informed of it, but was advised that the note had been made part of the tariff in full compliance with the act of 1906 and that being so the payment and receipt of the allowance would comply with the tariff and the law and the officers of the Company relied on this judgment.\n\n\n (2)\n Between 1906 and the date of the indictment 262 tariffs, all containing the note, had been filed and accepted by the Commission.\n\n\n (3)\n In 1908 the Company had been informed by the Railroad that the Commission (acting through one of the Commission's important officers who was in charge of the tariffs) had specifically approved the form of the tariff containing the note, in spite of the fact that the amount of the allowance had not been specified therein, the Commission at the time having the question under consideration. \n\n[250 U.S. 556, 562]\n\u00a0\n By reason of such information the Company honestly believed that the receipt of the allowance was not in violation of the tariff or the act, but was in compliance therewith.\n\n\n (4)\n The Company's books, records and accounts were examined by the Commission's investigators in 1909 and the Commission was thereby informed that the Company had received and was receiving the allowance, but the Commission did not object either to the form or the substance of the practice.\n'The Company's evidence concerning good faith was received under the government's objection, and the government offered evidence in contradiction thereof. At the close of the trial the court struck out all the evidence on this subject from the record, and refused to submit the question of good faith to the jury, holding that the Company's honest belief that the allowance was permitted by the tariffs and the footnote thereto could not affect the issue, for the reason that the Company knew the contents of the tariffs, and knew also that the allowance was actually made and received.'\n\n The certificate asks the following questions:\n'1. In the criminal prosecution of a shipper for knowingly accepting transportation at less than the duly established rate by receiving an allowance that was referred to in the tariff, but was not specified in figures therein, has the defendant a right to offer in evidence that the allowance was received under the honest belief that it was lawfully established by the tariff, and under the honest belief that in receiving it he was not disregarding what he believed to be the provisions of the tariff but was complying therewith?\n\n'2. Upon the foregoing facts, and in view of the kind and amount of evidence offered upon the subject of good faith, did the district court err in the present case by refusing to submit the question to the jury?'\n\n The questions asked depend upon the construction of the Elkins Act, as enacted in 1903 (32 Stat. 847), the relevant \n\n[250 U.S. 556, 563]\n\u00a0\n part of which is as follow:\n'... It shall be unlawful for any person, or persons, or corporation to offer, grant, or give or to solicit, accept, or receive any rebate, concession, or discrimination in respect to the transportation of any property in interstate or foreign commerce by any common carrier subject to said act to regulate commerce and the acts amendatory thereto whereby any such property shall by any device whatever be transported at a less rate than that named in the tariffs published and filed by such carrier [italics ours]. ...'\n\n And under an amendment in 1906 (34 Stat. 584) an offender, 'whether carrier or shipper, who shall, knowingly, offer, grant, or give, or solicit, accept or receive any such rebates, concession, or discrimination shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.'\n The way to a correct construction of the act was to an extent cleared by the case of Armour Packing Co. v. United States, \n209 U.S. 56\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 428. Its evolution was there detailed. It was said that carrier and shipper are charged with an equal responsibility and liability and that the act 'proceeded upon broad lines to accomplish' this equality, and 'that the only rate charged to a shipper for the same service under the same conditions should be the one established, published, and posted as required by law.' And this was declared in various ways to be the test of obligation and liability and the 'form by which or the motive for which' its evasion or disregard is accomplished is not of modifying or determining consideration. It was in effect decided that the purpose of the statute took emphasis and meaning from the use of the word 'device,' and 'device' was defined to be 'anything which is a plan or contrivance' and is 'disassociated' from qualification and 'need not be necessarily fraudulent,' and by it the act 'sought to reach all means and methods by which the unlawful preference of rebate, or concession or discrimination is offered, granted, given or received.'\n It is in effect the contention of the government that the \n\n[250 U.S. 556, 564]\n\u00a0\n language of the case exhausts definition and excludes the supposition of the questions of the Circuit Court of Appeals. We are unable to concur. The language of the case is easily explained by the question that was presented for decision. The Armour Packing Company contended that the act was directed only at fraudulent conduct, the obtaining of a rebate by some dishonest or underhand method, concession or discrimination. The language of the court was addressed to this contention and its selection and adequacy are manifest.\n No such contention is made in the case at bar and there are other distinguishing elements. It will be observed that by the statute and the decision the test of equality is the tariff rate. It was said in the opinion that it is the purpose of the act to punish those who give or receive transportation, in the sense of actual carriage, at a concession from the published rates. N. Y. Central & H. R. R. v. United States, \n212 \nU.S. 500, 505\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 309, 311 (53 L. Ed. 624). And such was the offense of the Armour Packing Company. There was no evasion of the tariff rate in the case at bar. The filed tariff indicated the existence and obligation of the tenth covenant of the lease from the Company to the Railroad, that is, the fact of the allowance was declared, though it did not have specification in figures. The tariff, of course, would have been more definite and complete with such specification, but its sufficiency was certainly believed in for between 1906 and the date of the indictment it had 262 repetitions. the Company was given besides the assurance that it had the sanction of the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n There was no attempt at deception. The Commission knew by examination of the Company's books of the allowance and the amount of the allowance. Such, then, is the situation, and distinguishes the case from the Armour Packing Company Case. There there was an omission to comply with the statute and the omission was attempted to \n\n[250 U.S. 556, 565]\n\u00a0\n be justified by honesty of motive and purpose; here there was compliance or attempted compliance with the statute-a tariff filed-and if a question could be raised upon its legal sufficiency the belief of the Company in its legality was supported by high authority and those circumstances can bring into action and exculpating effect the provision of the statute which requires the acceptance of a rebate to be 'knowingly' done to incur the guilt of a misdemeanor. This conclusion gives no detrimental example against the efficacy of the law.\n We think this comment and conclusion enough to dispose of the questions asked and that there is no necessity to review the cases cited by the Company or the government.\n Some of the contentions of the government we may notice. It is contended that the 'lateral allowance' provided for in the tenth covenant and footnote to the tariff was not for transportation services and besides that there was no testimony whatsoever that the meaning of any provision of the tariff was misunderstood. The mistake, if any, it is hence insisted, was a mistake of law, not of fact. Two deductions are hence made by the government: (1) That the allowances were not made for transportation services; (2) Mistake of law is irrelevant to the question of the guilt or innocence of the Company.\n To the first we may reply it is not involved as an element in the question asked of this court and if it have any justification, as to which we express no opinion, it no doubt will be considered by the Circuit Court of Appeals upon the return of the case. The other expresses a refinement. Indeed, the contention of the government is somewhat elusive and we are not sure that we exactly estimate it. It is said:\n'The sole misunderstanding which the excluded testimony tended to show would consist in supposing that the 'allowances' could be justified by the footnote in the tariff, and that, as we have seen, would be a \n\n[250 U.S. 556, 566]\n\u00a0\n misunderstanding of the Elkins Act and not of the tariff.'\n\n We are unable to concur. There was no misunderstanding of the Elkins Act or what it required. The misunderstanding was induced by practice and the opinion of those in authority that the act was complied with and the word 'knowingly' therefore, as we have already indicated, must be considered and given exculpating effect if error there was.\n We therefore answer the first question in the affirmative, but as explained by reference to the certificate of facts above. We do not think it is necessary to answer the second question.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the decision. \n\n\n\n","120":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLINCOLN GAS & ELECTRIC LIGHT CO. v. CITY OF LINCOLN(1919)\nNo. 52\nArgued: Decided: June 2, 1919\n\n\n Lincoln \n250 U.S. 256\n (1919) ]\n\n\n[250 U.S. 256, 258]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert Burns, of New York City, E. C. Strode, of Lincoln, Neb ., and Charles A. Frueauff, of New York City, for appellant.\n Messrs. W. M. Morning, C. Petrus Peterson, and G. W. Berge, all of Lincoln, Neb., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from the final decree of the District Court dismissing the bill of complaint in a suit brought by the Lincoln Gas & Electric Light Company, a Nebraska corporation, against the city of Lincoln and \n\n[250 U.S. 256, 259]\n\u00a0\n its officials, praying for an injunction to restrain enforcement of an ordinance of the city adopted November 19, 1906, which had the effect of reducing complainant's charges for gas from $1.20 to $1 per 1,000 cubic feet, and an ordinance adopted December 10, 1906, assessing an annual occupation tax upon gas companies in the city.\n The action was instituted in December, 1906, without previous test of the $1 rate, in the then Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Nebraska. Besides grounds not pressed, the rate ordinance was attacked upon the ground that its enforcement would deprive complainant of its property without due process of law, in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment. The tax ordinance was attacked upon grounds of state law, and also upon the ground that it was violative of the 'due process' and 'equal protection' clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Upon final hearing the court, by decree entered April 6, 1909, dismissed the bill as to the rate ordinance, without prejudice to the commencement of a new action, but decreed that the ordinance levying an occupation tax violated the Constitution of Nebraska and was for this reason illegal, and granted a permanent injunction against its enforcement. 182 Fed. 926.\n Upon appeal by complainant to this court it was found that there was a great mass of conflicting evidence relating to the value of complainant's plant, the cost of operation, and the gross and net income; that the case had not been referred to a master, nor had specific findings of fact been made by the court below, but only general conclusions which were found not to be sufficient in view of errors assigned which opened up substantially the entire case. For this reason the decree was reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court, with directions to refer it to a master with leave to both parties to take additional evidence. A temporary injunction \n\n[250 U.S. 256, 260]\n\u00a0\n which had been granted in the court below and continued in force until final decree and afterwards pending the appeal, under a bond conditioned to account for overcharges if the rate ordinance should be sustained, was by the decree of reversal continued in force until final decree in the court below, upon condition that a new bond with sureties was given to account for overcharges to consumers since the original restraining order, in the event the ordinance should be sustained. \n223 U.S. 349\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 271.\n Upon the going down of the mandate, the District Court referred the case (July, 1912) to a master, to take the proofs and report his findings of fact and of law. After a full hearing he made an elaborate report ( September, 1914), to which complainant filed about 125 exceptions, with a motion to recommit the case to the master for additional findings, which motion was denied. The master found the rate ordinance was not confiscatory, and (differing from the former decision of the Circuit Court) held that the occupation tax ordinance was valid, and included the tax as an operating expense. Upon the hearing of the exceptions the report of the master was confirmed by the District Court, and the bill dismissed as to the rate ordinance, by decree entered September 23, 1915; the judge filing a memorandum to the effect that he did not agree with the master as to the validity of the occupation tax ordinance, but deemed it unnecessary to pass upon this in the decree, since the result reached by the master would only be strengthened by adjudging the tax invalid, while, if the judge should agree with the master upon that question, he still would confirm the report. In other words, assuming the occupation tax ordinance to be valid, the addition of this tax to the annual outgoes of complainant would still leave the $1 rate compensatory.\n Complainant brings the case to this court by appeal, with about 120 assignments of error, one of which is that \n\n[250 U.S. 256, 261]\n\u00a0\n the District Court erred in not decreeing that the occupation tax ordinance was in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment in that it amounted to a denial of the equal protection of the laws.\n Pending the hearing upon the master's report, and on or about May 1, 1915, complainant, notwithstanding the injunction pendente lite, put into effect a net rate of $1 per thousand feet for gas, and has maintained it since.\n Upon the strength of this test, and before the argument of this, the second appeal, complainant presented to us a petition for leave to file a bill of review in the court below upon the ground that, according to the master's findings, complainant, in the year 1907, earned so small a return that the rate ordinance would have been confiscatory upon the valuation as found by him, but for this additional finding:\n'All human experience has shown that increased consumption follows quickly a reduction in the price of commodities, and the evidence in this case satisfactorily shows that gas is no exception to the rule.'\n\n The petition averred that the experience of complainant in an actual test of the reduced rate during a considerable period since May 1, 1915, showed that the view of the master was erroneous, and in fact under actual operating conditions there was no increase of consumption.\n The application for leave to file a bill of review will be denied, for the following reasons:\n First, because the $1 rate was put into effect pursuant to a written stipulation made between the parties in the cause to the effect that the action of the company in so doing should not be construed as an acceptance of or compliance with the ordinance in controversy, and should not be 'shown in evidence or presented to the court in the aboveentitled cause, or used in any way by either party to influence the action of the court in the disposition of the case.' Hence defendant was not called upon \n\n[250 U.S. 256, 262]\n\u00a0\n to observe the effect of the reduced rate, or prepare to meet inferences drawn therefrom.\n Secondly, because complainant might have made a practical test of the ordinance rate before bringing this suit for an injunction, and certainly ought to have resorted to the test long before it did so. As early as the month of January, 1909, this court, in two notable rate cases, indicated its view of the importance, in any but a very clear case, of subjecting prescribed rates to the test of practical experience before attacking them in the courts. Knoxville v. Water Co., \n212 \nU.S. 1, 16\n, 18 S., 29 Sup. Ct. 148; Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n212 \nU.S. 19, 54\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 192, 15 Ann. Cas. 1034, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1134. When those decisions were announced this case was pending in the Circuit Court, and shortly thereafter it was decided adversely to complainant upon the question of the validity of the rate, the Knoxville and Willcox Cases being cited. 182 Fed. 926, 929. Then, if not before, complainant might have made a practical test of the sufficiency of the rate, instead of waiting six years longer before doing so. The litigation has been extremely tedious and burdensome to both sides, and it ought now to be brought to a conclusion upon the record as it stands.\n And, thirdly, the argument based upon the master's finding as to the return that complainant would have earned in the year 1907 under the prescribed rates is vitiated by the fact that he included as an operating expense $4,466, the amount of the estimated occupation tax, which was not paid and (as we shall see) has been conclusively adjudged in this suit to be unenforceable. Eliminating this would increase the net return for the year approximately 1 per cent. upon the investment.\n Coming to the merits, we will deal first with the occupation tax ordinance. This is important not only because considerable sums of unpaid taxes have accumulated pending the litigation, but because of the effect of the tax, if sustained, upon the question of the adequacy of the rate. \n\n[250 U.S. 256, 263]\n\u00a0\n The ordinance imposes an occupation tax upon all gas companies manufacturing and furnishing gas to the inhabitants of the city of Lincoln equivalent to 2 1\/2 per cent. of their gross receipts derived from that business. It was attacked in the bill as being 'partial, discriminatory, unreasonable, and oppressive in this, it imposes upon your orator an onerous tax burden to which the business and occupations of other persons within said city are not subjected'; and the bill alleged, among other things, that the Lincoln Traction Company held a franchise for furnishing electricity to the public in said city, under which it was supplying light, heat, and power in competition with complainant's gas business, and that the city had not subjected this business of the traction company to any occupation tax; wherefore the ordinance 'operates to deprive your orator of the equal protection of the laws, imposes a discriminatory burden upon your orator, ... and deprives your orator of its franchise rights and privileges and of its properties without due process of law,' thus being violative of the due process and equal protection provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Circuit Court deemed that this raised the question of the invalidity of the ordinance under the uniformity provision of the state Constitution, and held it was invalid as being in contravention thereof. 182 Fed. 926, 927, 929. The city requested a modification of the opinion and decree in this respect, on the ground that the invalidity of the ordinance under the state laws and Constitution was not charged in the bill. This application was denied.\n Neither the city nor any other defendant appealed from that part of the decree which adjudged the occupation tax ordinance void and granted an injunction against its enforcement. Complainant appealed only from that part which was adverse to it upon the question of the validity of the rate ordinance. None of its assignments \n\n[250 U.S. 256, 264]\n\u00a0\n of error touched upon the tax ordinance; but in its brief in this court upon the first appeal complainant declared that its bill had assailed the tax ordinance only upon the ground that it was in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; that the bill was drawn upon the theory that this ordinance, like the rate ordinance, could only be assailed in a court of the United States upon the ground 'that it was violative of the Constitution of the United States,' apparently overlooking that, even without diversity of citizenship (and there was none), if the bill presented a substantial controversy under the Constitution of the United States, and the requisite amount was involved, the jurisdiction extended to the determination of all questions, including questions of state law, and irrespective of the disposition made of the federal questions. Greene v. Louisville & Interurban R. R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 499, 508\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 673, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 88. It was said in the brief that the decree of the Circuit Court against the validity of the occupation tax ordinance was a nullity because the subject- matter was not cognizable in a court of the United States and the issue decided was not tendered by the bill. Upon the ground that the decree might constitute no bar to the collection of the occupation taxes, and the amount of these, if collected, would reduce complainant's returns and render the rate ordinance, if sustained, still more burdensome, appellant asked this court to pass upon the validity of the tax ordinance upon the federal grounds asserted in the bill.\n Naturally this court ignored the suggestion, its jurisdiction over the question not having been invoked by an appeal, and so it happened that the occupation tax ordinance was not mentioned in the opinion or in the mandate.\n There is nothing before us to show what decree, if any, was made by the District Court upon the going down of the mandate, beyond a mere order of reference to the \n\n[250 U.S. 256, 265]\n\u00a0\n master. The final decree made upon the confirmation of his report says nothing upon the subject of the occupation tax ordinance. Its language is:\n'That the bill of complaint herein, so far as the same relates to the ordinance of the city of Lincoln establishing a rate of charges for gas in said city, be and the same is hereby dismissed, and the restraining order heretofore granted against the enforcement of said ordinance is hereby dissolved.'\n\n Upon this record, it is very clear that so much of the decree of the Circuit Court entered April 6, 1909, as held the occupation tax ordinance void and restrained its enforcement was untouched by the former appeal and unaffected by the subsequent proceedings. The decree now under review does not modify the effect of the former decree upon this subject; hence the adjudication of the invalidity of the occupation tax ordinance and the award of an injunction to restrain its enforcement are to be taken as a part of the final decree in the cause. We deem it entirely clear also that the issue of the validity of that ordinance upon grounds of state law was fairly within the pleadings, and that this part of the decree is impregnable against collateral attack, in this court or elsewhere. This being so, the assignment that the District Court erred in its decree of September 23, 1915, in not decreeing that the occupation tax ordinance was in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment because amounting to a denial of the equal protection of the laws is groundless; there was no occasion for the court to make any decree to that effect, since the matter had been conclusively determined against the validity of this ordinance by the final decree of April 6, 1909, which remained in this respect unappealed from. In order to render the matter free from doubt the decree of September 23, 1915, will now be modified by embodying in it a reiteration of that part of the decree of April 6, 1909, which held the occupation tax ordinance void and restrained its enforcement. \n\n[250 U.S. 256, 266]\n\u00a0\n Parenthetically, it may be stated that on March 16, 1908, the city council passed an ordinance imposing a like occupation tax upon corporations selling electricity for light or power purposes, but at the rate of only 2 per cent. of their gross receipts; that on December 13, 1909, both occupation taxes were repealed, and gas and electric companies alike were subjected thereafter to an occupation tax equal to 3 per cent. of their gross receipts; and that in July, 1916, the Supreme Court of Nebraska adjudged the occupation tax ordinance of December 10, 1906, to be invalid, following the decision of the Circuit Court in this case, and on the same day held that the enforcement against complainant of an occupation tax under the ordinance of December, 1909, must be stayed pending the final determination of the present case. City of Lincoln v. Lincoln Gas & Electric Light Co. (two cases) 100 Neb. 182, 188, 158 N. W. 962, 964.\n The attack upon the rate ordinance brings under consideration questions of the valuation of the plant, the proper method of estimating and applying depreciation charges, questions of working capital, going concern value, the propriety of various items of operating expense, the rate of return that reasonably ought to be allowed upon capital invested in a plant and business of this character in Nebraska, and the other questions usual in such cases. The special master conducted a patient and elaborate investigation. An enormous mass of evidence was produced before him, and analyzed in his report. In abridged form, it occupies nearly 2, 000 pages of printed transcript in this court, besides numerous tabular exhibits. It would be impossible, within reasonable limits, to recite the substance of the evidence or review the master's findings. We do not feel called upon to do this. Knoxville v. Water Co., \n212 \nU.S. 1, 17\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 148. The findings are subjected to numerous and minute criticisms, and some of these seem to possess \n\n[250 U.S. 256, 267]\n\u00a0\n force. We cannot approve the finding that no rate yielding as much as 6 per cent. upon the invested capital could be regarded as confiscatory, in view of the undisputed evidence, accepted by the master, that 8 per cent. was the lowest rate sought and generally obtained as a return upon capital invested in banking, merchandising, and other businesses in the vicinity; 7 per cent. being the 'legal rate' of interest in Nebraska. Complainant had not such a monopoly nor were its profits 'virtually guaranteed' in such a sense as to permit the public authorities to restrict it to a return of 6 per cent. upon its invested capital. It is not entirely clear, however, that the rate ordinance did so restrict it. Again, we question the propriety of the master's treatment of 'going value,' which he seems to have estimated at less than otherwise he would have placed it upon the theory that the company's business had been developed, at the expense of the public, in the expenditure of past earnings exceeding a fair return upon the capital invested, and this without any finding, or any clear evidence to which our attention has been called, that past earnings were excessive. On the other hand, the master erred in favor of complainant by allowing as operating expenses occupation taxes for the years 1907 to 1909, inclusive, these taxes not having been paid, and the taxing ordinance applicable to that period having been held invalid by the decree of the Circuit Court entered April 6, 1909, and so held since his report by the state Supreme Court. And it is possible he erred in allowing occupation taxes for the year 1910 and subsequent years, since these were not in fact paid. As we have seen, the occupation tax erroneously allowed for the crucial year 1907 amounted to more than 1 per cent. upon the invested capital at the master's valuation. He also appears to have been unduly liberal to the company in the allowance for working capital, and in some other items of valuation, as well as in respect of some \n\n[250 U.S. 256, 268]\n\u00a0\n expenditures allowed as operating expense. Without going into details, we content ourselves with announcing our general conclusion that, having regard to the entire period under investigation, we are unable to say that the master erred in holding that the ordinance was not shown to have been confiscatory in its effect. It is probable that in the years 1907 and 1912 the net return was close to the line, if not below it, but that in the other years examined it was at least 7 per cent.; and there are too many doubtful items for us to adjudge the ordinance void, in the absence of an actual and timely test.\n The decree dismissed the bill, however, so far as it related to the rate ordinance, without reservation or qualification. Perhaps it would go without saying, but in our opinion the decree ought to be modified so as to permit complainant to make another application to the courts for relief against the operation of the ordinance hereafter, if it can show, as a result of its practical test of the dollar rate since May 1, 1915, or upon evidence respecting values, costs of operation, and the current rates of return upon capital as they stand at the time of bringing suit and are likely to continue thereafter, that the rate ordinance is confiscatory in its effect under the new conditions. It is a matter of common knowledge that, owing principally to the world war, the costs of labor and supplies of every kind have greatly advanced since the ordinance was adopted, and largely since this cause was last heard in the court below. And it is equally well known that annual returns upon capital and enterprise the world over have materially increased, so that what would have been a proper rate of return for capital invested in gas plants and similar public utilities a few years ago furnishes no safe criterion for the present or for the future.\n The final decree of September 23, 1915, will be modified by embodying in it a reiteration of that part of the \n\n[250 U.S. 256, 269]\n\u00a0\n final decree of April 6, 1909, which held that the ordinance of the city of Lincoln approved December 10, 1906, levying an occupation tax against complainant, was illegal and void because violative of the Constitution of the state of Nebraska, and that the enforcement of the same as to complainant should be perpetually enjoined.\n The decree of September 23, 1915, will be further modified so that the dismissal of the bill of complaint, in so far as it relates to the ordinance of the city of Lincoln approved November 19, 1906, establishing a rate of charges for gas in said city, shall be without prejudice to the commencement of a new action to restrain the enforcement of said ordinance hereafter, and decree, as thus modified, affirmed, with costs. \n\n\n\n","121":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLIVERPOOL &C.

Mattison, both of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a libel in admiralty brought by the petitioner against the respondent for a collision with the petitioner's steamship Vauban while it was moored at a pier in Brooklyn. The respondent does not deny liability but claims the right to limit it under Rev. Stats.  4283, 4284 and 4285 ( Comp. St.  8023-8025), to the value of the vessel that caused the damage. The moving cause was the respondent's steam tug Intrepid which was proceeding up the East, River, with a car flat loaded with railroad cars lashed to its port side and on its starboard side a disabled tug, both belonging to the \n\n[251 U.S. 48, 52]\n\u00a0\n respondent. By a stipulation dated August 3, 1917, it was agreed that the damage sustained was $28,036.98 with $5,539.84 interest. The value of the tug Intrepid was found to be $5,750, and the liability of the respondent was limited by the District Court to that sum with interest. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree without an opinion. 250 Fed. 1021, 162 C. C. A. 664. The case is brought here on the question whether the value of the whole flotilla should not have been in cluded in the decree.\n The car float was the vessel that came into contact with the Vauban, but as it was a passive instrument in the hands of the Intrepid that fact does not affect the question of responsibility. The James Gray v. The John Fraser, 21 How. 184; The J. P. Donaldson, \n167 \nU.S. 599, 603\n, 604 S., 17 Sup. Ct. 951; The Eugene F. Moran, \n212 \nU.S. 466, 474\n, 475 S., 29 Sup. Ct. 339; Union Steamship Co. v. Owners of the Aracan, L. R. 6 P. C. 127. The rule is not changed by the ownership of the vessels. The John G. Stevens, \n170 \nU.S. 113, 123\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 544; The W. G. Mason, 142 Fed. 913, 917, 74 C. C. A. 83; The Eugene F. Moran, \n212 \nU.S. 466, 475\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 339; L. R. 6 P. C. 127, 133. There cases show that for the purposes of liability the passive instrument of the harm does not become one with the actively responsible vessel by being attached to it. If this were a proceeding in rem it may be assumed that the car float and disabled tug would escape, and none the less that they were lashed to the Intrepid and so were more helplessly under its control than in the ordinary case of a tow.\n It is said, however, that when you come to limiting liability the foregoing authorities are not controlling-that the object of the statute is 'to limit the liability of vessel owners to their interest in the adventure,' The Main v. Williams, \n152 \nU.S. 122, 131\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 486, 488 ( 38 L. Ed. 381), and that the same reason that requires the surrender of boats and apparel requires the surrender of the other instrumentalities by means of which the tug was rendering the services for which it \n\n[251 U.S. 48, 53]\n\u00a0\n was paid. It can make no difference, it is argued, whether the cargo is carried in the hold of the tug or is towed in another vessel. But that is the question, and it is not answered by putting it. The respondent answers the argument with the suggestion that if sound it applies a different rule in actions in personam from that which as we have said, governs suits in rem. Without dwelling upon that, we are of opinion that the statute does not warrant the distinction for which the appellant contends.\n The statute follows the lead of European countries, as stated in The Main v. Williams, \n152 \nU.S. 122, 126\n, 127 S., 14 Sup. Ct. 486. Whatever may be the doubts as to the original grounds for limiting liability to the ship or with regard to the historic starting point for holding the ship responsible as a moving cause, The Blackheath, \n195 \nU.S. 361, 366\n, 367 S., 25 Sup. Ct. 46, it seems a permissible conjecture that both principles, if not rooted in the same conscious thought, at least were influenced by the same semi-conscious attitude of mind. When the continental law came to be followed by Congress, no doubt, alongside of the desire to give our shipowners a chance to compete with those of Eurppe, there was in some sense as intent to limit liability to the venture, but such a statement gives little help in deciding where the line of limitation should be drawn. No one, we presume, would contend that other unattached vessels, belonging if you like to the same owner, and co- operating to the same result with the one in fault, would have to be surrendered. Thompson Towing & Wrecking Association v. McGregor, 207 Fed. 209, 212-214, 124 C. C. A. 479; The Sunbeam, 195 Fed. 468, 470, 115 C. C. A. 370; The W. G. Mason, 142 Fed. 913, 919, 74 C. C. A. 83. The notion as applicable to a collision case seems to us to be that if you surrender the offending vessel you are free, just as it was said by a judge in the time of Edward III, 'If my dog kills your sheep and I freshly after the fact tender you the dog you are without recourse against me.' Fitz. Abr., Barre, 290. The words of the \n\n[251 U.S. 48, 54]\n\u00a0\n statute are:\n'The liability of the owner of any vessel for any injury by collision shall in no case exceed the value of the interest of such owner in such vessel.'\n\n The literal meaning of the sentence is reinforced by the words 'in no case.' For clearly the liability would be made to exceed the interest of the owner 'in such vessel' if you said frankly, In some cases we propose to count other vessels in although they are not 'such vessel'; and it comes to the same thing when you profess a formal compliance with the words but reach the result by artifically construing 'such vessel' to include other vessels if only they are tied to it. Earlier cases in the Second Circuit had disposed of the question there, and those in other circuits for the most part if not wholly are reconcilable with them. We are of opinion that the decision was right. The Transfer No. 21, 248 Fed. 459, 160 C. C. A. 469; The W. G. Mason, 142 Fed. 913, 74 C. C. A. 83; The Erie Lighter 108 (D.

C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit certifies to this court for answer the question, whether Safety Appliance Act March 2, 1893, c. 196, 27 Stat. 531 (Comp. St.  8605-8612), as amended by Act March 2, 1903, c. 976, 32 Stat. 943 (Comp. St.  8613-8615), requires that 85 per cent. of the train brakes shall be coupled so as to be under engine control when making the transfer of 26 cars, in a movement which is described in the court's certificate.\n The pertinent part of the original act approved March 2, 1893 (27 Stat. 531), reads: \n\n[249 U.S. 534, 536]\n\u00a0\n 'It shall be unlawful for any common carrier engaged in interstate commerce by railroad to use on its line any locomotive engine in moving interstate traffic not equipped with a power driving-wheel brake and appliances for operating the train-brake system, or to run any train in such traffic ... that has not a sufficient number of cars in it so equipped with power or train brakes that the engineer on the locomotive drawing such train can control its speed without requiring brakemen to use the common hand brake for that purpose.' Comp. St.  8605\n\n\n And the relevant part of the amendment, approved March 2, 1903 (32 Stat. 943) is:\n'That the provisions and requirements hereof and of said acts relating to train brakes ... shall be held to apply to all trains ... used on any railroad engaged in interstate commerce.' Comp. St .  8613.\n\n Section 2 of the amendment provides that when any train is operated with power or train brakes not less than 50 per cent. of the cars in such train shall have their brakes used and operated by the engineer of the locomotive, etc. Authority was given the Interstate Commerce Commission to increase the percentage of cars in any train which must have their brakes so used and operated, and in 1910 the commission increased it to 85 per cent.\n The essential facts, somewhat condensed, from the statement of the Circuit Court of Appeals are:\n The Bridge Company, a common carrier engaged in interstate commerce, operates a large terminal yard at Louisville, Ky., which constitutes the joint terminal of the Big Four and the Chesapeake & Ohio Systems of railway. The yard is 1,800 feet in length, 700 feet in width, and consists of two main tracks, with from 15 to 25 approximately parallel tracks, which are connected with the main tracks by leads in the customary manner. \n\n[249 U.S. 534, 537]\n\u00a0\n For the purposes of this proceeding the following movement of cars was adopted by the parties as typical. Twenty-six cars were assembled at the easterly end of the yard of the Bridge Company and were coupled together, but without any of the air brakes being connected, preparatory to their transfer westerly and delivery into the Illinois Central yard. The engine was at the easterly end of the cars, nearly 1,100 feet in length, which were pushed westerly the entire length of the large and necessarily busy yard. Part of this movement in the Bridge Company's yard, how much does not appear, was over a main line track, it was necessarily over many connections with other tracks on which several other engines and crews must have been working, habitually, and it was over four city streets at grade the crossing over the most westerly one, on account of the grade beyond, being made at a speed of 15 miles an hour. A short distance from the exit from the Bridge Company's yard the cars entered upon a track of the Illinois Central Railroad Company, used as a main line by both the Big Four and the Chesapeake & Ohio Companies, and after they had been pushed westerly on that track a distance of 1,100 feet, they were stopped on this main track. Next, reversing the movement, the engine, now pulling the cars, moved easterly over three city streets at grade a distance of 1,300 feet on a track used by the Chesapeake & Ohio Company for its through main line trains, and stopped on that track. Again reversing, the engine, now pushing the cars, ran westerly over three city streets at grade a distance of 1,300 feet, still on the track used as a through main line track by the Chesapeake & Ohio Company, and then into the Illinois Central yard, where the cars were delivered.\n The contention of the Bridge Company is that the foregoing describes a mere switching of cars, not a train movement within the meaning of the act of Congress, and \n\n[249 U.S. 534, 538]\n\u00a0\n that, therefore, the requirement that 85 per cent. of the cars shall have the train brakes upon them used and operated does not apply.\n An engine and 26 cars assembled and coupled together, not only satisfies the dictionary definition of a 'train of cars,' but would certainly be so designated by men in general, and in any fair acceptation of the term must be regarded as constituting a train within the meaning of the statute. It was a train greater in length than most regularly scheduled trains were when this Safety Appliance Act was passed 26 years ago, and even yet, probably, exceeds in length, passenger and freight trains considered, more than a majority of the regular road trains in this country.\n The work done with the cars, as described, was not a sorting, or selecting, or classifying of them, involving coupling and uncoupling and the movement of one or a few at a time for short distances, but was a transfer of the 26 cars as a unit from one terminal into that of another company for delivery, without uncoupling or switching out a single car, and it cannot therefore with propriety be called a switching movement.\n The movement of this train of cars, 1,100 feet in length, was for a distance of over three-quarters of a mile, and involved crossing, at grade, three city streets once, two streets twice, one street three times, and a main track movement of at least 2,600 feet, with two stops and startings on the main track. This is not only a train movement, but it would be difficult to imagine one in which the control of the cars by train brakes would be more necessary, in order to secure that safety of employes, of passengers and of the public which it is the purpose of the act to secure, by requiring that engineers shall be given control sufficient to stop any train they may be moving, promptly on the first signal or sight of danger. The mere inertia of 26 cars, which must usually be \n\n[249 U.S. 534, 539]\n\u00a0\n loaded, and especially when running 15 miles an hour, would render it impossible to control or to stop them promptly with power brakes operative only on the engine, and the ability to use such brakes on the entire train must often mean the difference between safety and serious accident when running, as here, in a crowded yard, across busy city streets and on main line tracks of railroads.\n It is argued that coupling of the train brakes was not necessary for the reason that the street crossings used were protected by gates, that a yardmaster from an elevated tower watched over the main line movements, and that the coupling of the train-brake appliances would involve more danger to the employes than the movement of the cars without their being used and operated. These suggestions serve to emphasize the dangerous character of the movement. But the construction which the act should receive is not to be found in balancing the dangers which would result from obeying the law with those which would result from violating it, nor in considering what other precautions will equal, in the promotion of safety, those prescribed by the act. Such considerations were for Congress when enacting the law, and it has repeatedly been held by this court that other provisions of the Safety Appliance Act impose upon the carrier the absolute duty of compliance in cases to which they apply, and that failure to comply will not be excused by carefulness to avoid the danger which the appliances prescribed were intended to guard against, nor by the adoption of what might be considered equivalents of the requirements of the act.

So far as it alleged a failure to comply with the State laws the State decision is conclusive against it, and of course it connot complain of not being given a hearing simply because it is referred for that hearing to a different suit from that in which the value of the property is fixed. The separation is familiar. United States v. Jones, \n109 \nU.S. 513, 519\n, 3 S. Sup. Ct. 346. Passing these matters by, the first contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment alleged is that under the Mississippi laws the right could be taken only for a new line, whereas the bill avers that the telegraph company wanted the right not for a new line but for the purpose of maintaining an existing line that it had maintained theretofore under a contract with the railroad now brought to an end. To this the Supreme Court replied that, the judgments being \n\n[250 U.S. 363, 366]\n\u00a0\n right upon their face, if the telegraph company attempted to use them to maintain an existing line instead of a new one its rights could be determined when the attempt was made. The Fourteenth Amendment knows no difference between the two purposes, and the extent to which the telegraph company is confined to one of them under the State laws is for the State court to decide. No constitutional right is infringed when the State court postpones discussion until the attempt is made. The decree as well as the opinion saves the railroad's right in that event.\n It is argued that the judgments are void because they do not fix the exact location of the telegraph poles within the specified right of way. But they allow only one line of poles to be set up, and require it to be erected 'in such manner and at such distance from defendant's (the railroad's) track as in no way to interfere with the operation of trains of said defendants, or with any proper and legitimate use thereof by defendants, or the use by any telegraph or telephone company now existing thereon, and so as not to be dangerous to persons or property, and subject to all the stipulations and agreements in said petition contained.' The petition contains a agreement that if, after the erection of the poles, etc., 'it should become necessary for the said defendant to change the location of its tracks, or construct new tracks, or side tracks, where the same do not now exist, and for such purpose to use or occupy that portion of said right of way on which petitioner's poles are, or may be set, cross arms placed thereon and wires strung, your petitioner will, at its own expense upon reasonable notice from said defendants, remove said poles, cross arms and wires to such other point, or points, on said defendant's right of way as shall be designated by said defendant.' This agreement is binding. Mobile & Ohio R. R. Co. v. Postal Telegraph Cable Co., 76 Miss. 731, 752, 753, 26 South. 370, 45 L. R. A. 223. The description has been held to satisfy the requirements of \n\n[250 U.S. 363, 367]\n\u00a0\n State law and it would be extravagant to say that the Fourteenth Amendment made it bad.\n It is contended that the State had no power to condemn for the use of the telegraph company any part of the right of way of an interstate road or bridge over navigable waters. Support for the argument is sought in Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., \n195 U.S. 540\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 133, 1 Ann. Cas. 517. That case shows, to be sure, that the Act of July 24, 1866, c. 230, 14 Stat. 221, R. S.  5263 (Comp. St.  10072), purporting to grant to any telegraph company the right to construct and maintain lines along the post roads of the United States and to cross navigable streams, did not of itself give the right to appropriate private property. But it equally shows that Congress gave its assent to the acquisition of such rights in post roads by any means otherwise proper, as against any objection that it was an interference with interstate commerce, and such is the implication of the cases. 'State sovereignty under the Constitution is not interfered with.' Pensacola Telegraph Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n96 U.S. 1\n, 12; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Richmond, \n224 \nU.S. 160, 169\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 449; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., 207 Fed. 1, 11, 12, 124 C. C. A. 573. The present decision is enough to establish that the condemnation followed the State law. See also Cumberland Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Yazoo & Mississippi Valley R. R. Co., 90 Miss. 686, 44 South. 166. No act of Congress prevents the State proceedings having their intended effect.\n We think it unnecessary to deal with the sm ewhat meticulous objections to the form in which the Mississippi decree was pleaded and proved in the District Court or to repeat the answer of the defendant in error to the contention that if proved it was not an adjudication. If the bill in the District Court had not been disposed of by the State decree it would be dismissed under our present decision. Two days before the answer setting up the \n\n[250 U.S. 363, 368]\n\u00a0\n State decree the railroad filed a supplemental bill alleging that the telegraph company had no longer any rights except under the condemnation proceedings but that it still was using its old line. The telegraph company pleaded in reply an injunction, mentioned above, granted by another Court of the United States, forbidding the railroad to interrupt the telegraph in the use of its wires upon the railroad's right of way, the declared purpose being to preserve the status quo for a certain time, or until the condemnation could be carried out. 207 Fed. 1, 5, 124 C. C. A. 573. If for any reason the supplemental bill does not fall with the bill this earlier action in the Sixth Circuit (while it stands, see 252 Fed. 29, 164 C. C. A. 141), properly was regarded as precluding contrary action in the Fifth.\n Decrees affirmed. \n\n\n\n","124":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMACKAY TELEGRAPH & CABLE CO. v. CITY OF LITTLE ROCK(1919)\nNo. 374\nArgued: Decided: May 19, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 94, 95]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James W. Mehaffy, of Little Rock, Ark., in support of motion.\n Mr. J. C. Marshall, of Little Rock, Ark., in opposition to motion.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The case was submitted on a motion to dismiss or affirm. The facts are as follows: On March 11, 1912, the city council of Little Rock passed an ordinance granting to the telegraph company the right to construct and maintain telegraph poles, wires, and fixtures and to install underground ducts and manholes along and over certain streets in the city particularly mentioned, including the following:\n'Also a line of poles and fixtures and the right to string wires or cables thereon, beginning at the intersection of East Second street and Rector avenue and running thence on the west side of Rector avenue to East \n\n[250 U.S. 94, 96]\n\u00a0\n Sixth; thence east on the north side of Sixth to the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway tracks. From this point the pole line will follow on and along the right of way of said railway to the south city limits.'\n\n Among other things the ordinance provided that the company should pay to the city immediately upon the completion of the line, and annually thereafter, 'a license or tax of fifty cents for each pole erected or set up and a license or tax on all conduits constructed to an amount equal to four poles to each block. And said company shall comply with all ordinances hereafter passed in regard to the license or tax on poles, conduits, or wires, either decreasing or increasing the same, that are general and applicable to all telegraph or telephone companies in said city.' Other provisions made the location and maintenance of wires, poles, and conduits subject to the approval of the city officials; required the poles to be kept painted, and the wires, poles, conduits, and manholes to be maintained in a first-class condition and so as not to endanger life or limb; permitted the city to use the upper cross-arm of the poles for its fire alarm and police telegraph or telephone wires; and required written acceptance by the company before the ordinance should take effect. The company duly filed its written acceptance, and thereafter constructed its line, placing 66 poles upon city streets, 104 poles upon the right of way of the railway within the limits of the city as they existed at the acceptance of the ordinance, and 35 poles upon an adjacent portion of the right of way which at the acceptance of the ordinance was without the city limits but was brought within them a few days thereafter.\n In the year 1917 the city sued the company in a state court, setting up the above-mentioned ordinance, averring that it was duly accepted by the company and was a contract between the parties, and alleging that pursuant to it the defendant had erected and maintained in the \n\n[250 U.S. 94, 97]\n\u00a0\n city 205 poles upon which there were due the license taxes or fees at fifty cents per pole for four and a half years, amounting to $461.25. The company by its answer admitted the passage and acceptance of the ordinance but denied that it was a contract; alleged that the provision as to license fees did not include the poles placed upon the right of way of the railway company, especially not those that were without the limits of the city at the time of the acceptance of the ordinance; that fifty cents per pole per year was unreasonable and excessive and sought to be imposed not for inspection and regulation of the poles but for revenue purposes only; that said license fee or tax deprived defendant of its property without due process of law and denied to it the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; that defendant had accepted the restrictions and obligations of the Act of Congress approved July 24, 1866 ( chapter 230, 14 Stat. 221; Rev. Stat.  5263 et seq. [Comp. St.  10072 et seq.]); that its poles and wires were in use for the transmission of messages for the United States and various departments of the government; and further that defendant was engaged principally in the transmission of telegraphic messages between points in Arkansas and points in other states and in foreign countries, and that the imposition of a fee or tax upon its poles was a burden upon and illegal interference with interstate and foreign commerce and the regulatory power of Congress over the same.\n At the trial the company offered to pay the license tax upon the 66 poles that were placed upon the city streets, but disputed liability for those placed upon the railroad right of way. It proved acceptance of the act of Congress of 1866, showed that the corporate limits had been extended after acceptance of the ordinance in such manner as to include 35 additional poles along the right of way, showed that the line on the right of way ran through a thinly populated part of the city as compared with the \n\n[250 U.S. 94, 98]\n\u00a0\n streets covered by the franchise, being crossed, however, by two important streets and by two turnpikes that lead into the city, and offered to prove that two other telegraph companies maintaining poles and wires in the city were required to pay the tax only upon poles maintained upon the streets and not upon those maintained on railroad rights of way. General ordinances of the city were introduced in evidence, one of them antedating the franchise ordinance and providing as follows:\n'Each telegraph, telephone, electric light or power company shall pay annually a sum equal to fifty cents for each pole used by them whether such poles are leased, rented, or owned by them.'\n\n The trial court overruled the contentions of defendant and rendered a judgment against it for the entire amount claimed. This was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state (131 Ark. 306, 199 S. W. 90), and the case is brought here upon the contention that the taxing provision of the franchise ordinance, as construed and applied, has the effect of depriving the defendant of rights secured to it by the Constitution and laws of the United States.\n We are unable to see ground for dismissal of the writ of error, and will pass at once to the merits.\n Notwithstanding that some of the provisions of the ordinance are contractual in form and by its own terms it was to take effect only after written acceptance by the company and such acceptance was in fact formally given, the Supreme Court of the state, as we read its opinion, dealt with the pole fees not as an agreed compensation for the franchise but as a license tax. Consequently we will-indeed must, for present purposes-so regard it.\n Plaintiff in error contends that the court erred in construing the ordinance as imposing the tax with respect to the poles standing upon the railroad right of way, and especially as to the 35 poles which at the time of acceptance of the ordinance were without the limits of the city. \n\n[250 U.S. 94, 99]\n\u00a0\n But as no question is raised here under the contract clause of the Constitution (article 1,  10, cl. 1), we are not at liberty to revise the decision of the state court upon the question of construction, and can only determine whether as construed and applied the ordinance deprives plaintiff in error of rights secured by other provisions of the Constitution and laws of the United States.\n That a reasonable tax upon the maintenance of poles and wires erected and maintained by a telegraph company within the limits of a city pursuant to authority granted by its ordinances is not an unwarranted burden upon interstate or foreign commerce or upon the functions of the company as an agency of the government, and does not infringe rights conferred by the Act of Congress, is so thoroughly settled by previous decisions of this court that no further discussion is called for. St. Louis v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n148 \nU.S. 92, 100\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 485; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. New Hope, \n187 \nU.S. 419, 425\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 204; Atlantic, etc., Telegraph Co. v. Philadelphia, \n190 \nU.S. 160, 164\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 817; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Richmond, \n224 U.S. 160\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 449; Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Richmond, \n249 U.S. 252\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 265.\n These cases establish that a city (supposing, of course, it acts under the authority of the state) may impose such taxes not merely with respect to the special and exclusive occupancy of streets and other public places by poles and other equipment, but by way of compensation for the special cost of supervising and regulating the poles, wires and other fixtures and of issuing the necessary permits. Hence, in the present case, we cannot hold that the fact that a tax is imposed upon the poles that stand upon the railway right of way, as well as on those that stand upon the streets, is sufficient to condemn the ordinance, especially in view of the finding of the Supreme Court of Arkansas that the telegraph line as laid along the right of way crosses a street car line and several turnpikes coming into the city, and that it is necessary there shall be local \n\n[250 U.S. 94, 100]\n\u00a0\n governmental supervision of the lines crossing these highways for the protection of travelers upon them.\n There is no support in the record for the contention that a tax of fifty cents per pole per year is unreasonable in amount, even though it be made to apply to poles standing on private property or upon a railroad right of way as well as to poles erected in the streets.\n Nor is there ground for holding that plaintiff in error is subjected to unreasonable discrimination, in contravention of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case shows that its franchise ordinance imposes the same and no greater tax than that which is applied by a general ordinance to other companies maintaining poles in the city. The offer of testimony to prove that the two other companies were not in fact required to pay the tax upon so many of their poles as stood upon railroad rights of way went no further than to show that the general ordinance had not been enforced against them in the same manner that it was proposed to enforce the franchise ordinance against plaintiff in error. There was no offer to show an arbitrary and intentionally unfair discrimination in the administration of the ordinance as in Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356, 374\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 1064. Peradventure the present action was a test case to determine whether the license fees were applicable to poles standing elsewhere than on the streets, with the intent, in case of an affirmative answer, to enforce the general ordinance against the other companies in the same sense. Nor was there any offer to show that the circumstances of the several companies and their telegraph lines were so much alike as to render any discrimination in the application of the polc tax equivalent to a denial of the equal protection of the laws.\n None of the contentions of plaintiff in error being well founded, the judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","125":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMACLEOD v.

The court in a lucid opinion, speaking through Mr. Chief Justice Rugg, having after full consideration reached the conclusion that the Postmaster General was empowered by the law of the United States to fix the schedule of rates complained of and that the telephone company was authorized by such law to put in effect and enforce such rates even though in doing so the rate established by the Public Service Commission of the state was disregarded, held that the suit was virtually one against the United States which the court was without \n\n[250 U.S. 195, 199]\n\u00a0\n power to entertain and entered a decree of dismissal for want o jurisdiction.

Parkin, all of Chicago, Ill., for appellant.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On the 20th of May, 1916, Margaret Ryan, the appellee, alleging herself to be a subject of the King of Great Britain residing in Ottawa, Canada, applied for a writ of habeas corpus to obtain the possession of her alleged minor child, Irean, by taking her from the asserted illegal custody of Anna D. Matters, the appellant, alleged to be a resident of the state of Illinois.\n The petition for habeas corpus charged that the said child was born to petitioner ten months before in a hospital in Ottawa, but shortly after the birth of the child she was kidnapped by the respondent, who secreted her until August, when she brought the child by railroad journey to Chicago from Ottawa and there illegally detained her. It was charged that the cause of action arose under the law of the United States, in that the immigration laws of the United States forbade the bringing of an alien child under 16 years of age from Canada into the United States without being accompanied by its father or mother, in the absence of permission by the immigration authorities of the United States. An order was entered allowing the prosecution of the habeas corpus proceedings in forma pauperis, and the writ issued.\n The respondent denied the averments of possession and kidnapping. She alleged that she had a child of her own about 10 months of age, and that if such child was the one referred to in the petition for habeas corpus, the \n\n[249 U.S. 375, 377]\n\u00a0\n petitioner had no right to the custody of the same. The existence of any right in the petitioner to champion the enforcement of the immigration laws of the United States was denied, and the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the controversy was expressly challenged.\n On the return, after hearing, jurisdiction was maintained, the return was held insufficient, and the petitioner was decreed to be entitled to the custody of the child and the appellant was commanded to deliver her. This direct appeal on the question of jurisdiction alone was then taken.\n It is settled that 'the jurisdiction of courts of the United States to issue writs of habeas corpus is limited to cases of persons alleged to be restrained of their liberty in violation of the Constitution or of some law or treaty of the United States, and cases arising under the law of nations.' Carfer v. Caldwell, \n200 \nU.S. 293, 296\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 264, 265; In re Burrus, \n136 \nU.S. 586, 591\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 850; Andrews v. Swartz, \n156 \nU.S. 272, 275\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 389; Storti v. Massachusetts, \n183 \nU.S. 138, 142\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 72. It is obvious that on the face of the petition the sole question at issue was the maternity and custody of the child, and as that question was in its nature local and nonfederal there was nothing to sustain the jurisdiction unless the averment that the case was governed by the immigration laws of the United States had that effect. But when it is observed that the only basis for that assertion rested upon the allegation that the defendant, pretending to be the mother of the infant child, had brought her from Canada into the United States without complying with the administrative requirements of the immigration laws, we are of opinion that the case made involved no federal question adequate to sustain the jurisdiction, because of the unsubstantial and frivolous character of the contention made in that respect.\n We are constrained to this conclusion since we are unable to perceive the possible basis upon which it can be \n\n[249 U.S. 375, 378]\n\u00a0\n assumed that the local question of maternity, and consequent right to custody, which dominated and controlled the whole issue could be transformed and made federal in character by the assertion concerning the immigration laws. And this becomes all the more cogent when the absence of power on the part of the petitioner to champion the enforcement of the immigration laws is borne in mind.\n Whether a case might arise where a court of the United States could take jurisdiction of a petition for habeas corpus upon averment of diversity of citizenship and pecuniary interest, without the assertion of a federal right, does not here arise (a) because the suit was brought exclusively under the assumption that it was governed by the law of the United States which requires a federal question to give jurisdiction, and ( b) because, in any event, there is here no averment of jurisdictional amount.\n It follows that the decree below must be and it is\n Reversed and the case remanded with directions to dismiss the writ of habeas corpus. \n\n\n\n","127":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMAXWELL v.

The attack is upon the inheritance tax law of the state of New Jersey, and is based upon certain provisions of the federal Constitution. The statute has reference to the method of imposing inheritance taxes under the laws of the state. The constitutionality of the law upon both state and federal grounds was upheld in the McDonald Case by the Court of Errors and \n\n[250 U.S. 525, 531]\n\u00a0\n Appeals. 90 N. J. Law, 707, 101 Atl. 248. In the Hill Case the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Jersey (91 N. J. Law, 454, 103 Atl. 861) was affirmed by the Court of Errors and Appeals (92 N. J. Law, 514, 105 Atl. 893).\n The statute under consideration is an act approved April 9, 1914 (P. L. 1914, p. 267), being an amendment to an act approved April 20, 1909 (P. L. 1909, p. 325), for taxing the transfer of property of resident and nonresident decedents by devise, bequest, descent, etc., in certain cases. The 1909 act is found in 4 Comp. Stat. N. J. p. 5301 et seq; the amendment, in 1 Supp. Comp. Stat. N. J. pp. 1538-1542. The act of 1909, in its first section, imposed a tax upon the transfer of any property, real and personal, of the value of $500 or over, or of any interest therein or income therefrom, in trust or otherwise, to persons or corporations including the following cases:\n'First. When the transfer is by will or by the intestate laws of this state from any person dying seized or possessed of the property while a resident of the state.\n\n'Second. When the transfer is by will or intestate law, of property within the state, and the decedent was a nonresident of the state at the time of his death.'\n\n The taxes thus imposed were at the rate of 5 per cent. upon the clear market value of the property, with exemptions not necessary to be specified, and were payable to the treasurer for the use of the state of New Jersey.\n And by section 12 it was provided that upon the transfer of property in that state of a nonresident decedent, if all or any part of the estate, wherever situated, passed to persons or corporations who would have been taxable under the act if the decedent had been a resident of the state, such property located within the state was made subject to a tax bearing the same ratio to the entire tax which the estate of such decedent would have been subject to under the act if the nonresident decedent had been a resident of the state, as the property located in the state bore to the \n\n[250 U.S. 525, 532]\n\u00a0\n entire estate of such nonresident decedent wherever situated.\n The act, having first been amended by an act approved March 26, 1914 ( P. L. 1914, p. 91), not necessary to be recited, was again amended by the act approved April 9, 1914, which is now under consideration (P. L. 1914, p. 267; 1 Supp. Comp. Stat. N. J. pp. 1538-1542). Sections 1 and 12 were amended, the former by confining the tax on the transfer of property within the state of nonresident decedents to real estate, tangible personal property and shares of stock of New Jersey corporations and of national banks located within the state; and by modifying the former rate of 5 per centum upon the clear market value of the property passing, which was subject to exemptions in favor of churches and other charitable institutions, and of parents, children, and other lineal descendants, etc., by making 5 per centum the applicable rate, but subject to numerous exceptions, and in the excepted cases imposing different rates, dependent upon the relationship of the beneficiary to the deceased and the amount of the property transferred. Thus:\n'Property transferred to any child or children, husband or wife, of a decedent, or to the issue of any child or children of a decedent, shall be taxed at the rate of one per centum on any amount in excess of five thousand dollars, up to fifty thousand dollars; one and one- half per centum on any amount in excess to [of] fifty thousand dollars, up to one hundred and fifty thousand dollars; two per centum on any amount in excess of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, up to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars; and three per centum on any amount in excess of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.'\n\n The modified formula for computing the assessment upon the transfer of the estate of a nonresident decedent prescribed in section 12 as amended by the act under consideration, is as follows:\n'A tax shall be assessed on the transfer of property made \n\n[250 U.S. 525, 533]\n\u00a0\n subject to tax as aforesaid, in this state of a nonresident decedent if all or any part of the estate of such decedent, wherever situated, shall pass to persons or corporations taxable under this act, which tax shall bear the same ratio to the entire tax which the said estate would have been subject to under this act if such nonresident decedent had been a resident of this state, and all his property, real and personal, had been located within this state, as such taxable property within this state bears to the entire estate, wherever situated: Provided, that nothing in this clause contained shall apply to any specific bequest or devise of any property in this state.'\n\n An amendatory act, approved April 23, 1915 (P. L. 1915, p. 745; 1 Supp. Comp. Stat. N. J. p. 1542), repeated the provision last quoted, and made no change in the act pertinent to the questions here presented.\n It is this method of assessment in the case of nonresident decedents which is the subject-matter in controversy.\n James McDonald died January 13, 1915, owning stock in the Standard Oil Company, a New Jersey corporation, valued at $1,114,965, leaving an entire estate of $3,969,333.25, which included some real estate in the state of Idaho. Of the entire estate, $279,813.17 went to pay debts and expenses of administration. Mr. McDonald was a citizen of the United States and a resident of the District of Columbia, and left a will and a codicil which were admitted to probate by the Supreme Court of that District. The executors are Lawrence Maxwell, a citizen of Ohio, and the Fulton Trust Company, a New York corporation. The principal beneficiaries under the will are citizens and residents of states of the United States other than the state of New Jersey. Under the will the wife takes by specific legacies; the other beneficiaries are specific and general legatees not related to the deceased and a son and two grandchildren, who take the residuary estate.\n James J. Hill died May 29, 1916, intestate, a resident \n\n[250 U.S. 525, 534]\n\u00a0\n and citizen of the state of Minnesota, leaving a widow and nine children. Under the laws of Minnesota, the widow inherited one-third of the real estate and personal property, and each of the children two twenty-sevenths thereof. The entire estate descending amounted to $53,814,762, which included real estate located outside of New Jersey, and principally in Minnesota and New York, valued at $1,885,120. The only property the transfer of which was subject to taxation in New Jersey was stock in the Northern Securities Company, a New Jersey corporation, valued at $2,317, 564.68. The debts and administration expenses amounted to $757,571.20.\n The amount of the assessment in the McDonald Case was $29,071.68. In the Hill Case the tax assessed amounted to $67,018.43. Following the statute, the tax was first ascertained on the entire estate as if it were the estate of a resident of the state of New Jersey, with all the decedent's property both real and personal located there; the tax was then apportioned and assessed in the proportion that the tazable New Jersey estate bore to the entire estate.\n The thing complained of is that applying the apportionment formula fixed by the statute, in the cases under review, results in a greater tax on the transfer of property of the estates subject to the jurisdiction of New Jersey, than would be assessed for the transfer of an equal amount, in a similar manner, of property of a decedent who died a resident of New Jersey. The cause of this inequality is said to arise because of imposing the graduated tax, provided by the statute, upon estates so large as these. If a resident, in the case of a wife or children, the first $5,000 of property is exempt, the next $45,000 is taxed at the rate of 1 per cent., the next $100,000 at the rate of 1 1\/2 per cent., the next $100,000 at the rate of 2 per cent., and the remainder at the rate of 3 per cent. The contention is that, applying the apportionment rule provided in the case of nonresident estates, a larger amount of tax is assessed. \n\n[250 U.S. 525, 535]\n\u00a0\n The correctness of the figures deduced from the application of the statute as made by the counsel for plaintiff in error is contested, but in our view the differences are unimportant, unless the state is bound to apply the same rule to the transmission of both classes of estates.\n Counsel for plaintiffs in error sum up their objections to the statute, based on the federal Constitution, as follows:\n\n\n (1)\n It taxes the estates of nonresidents more than those of residents, and therefore gives to residents privileges and immunities denied to nonresidents.\n\n\n (2)\n It provides for a tax which bears unequally, and therefore is not imposed upon a uniform rule, and it therefore denies to nonresidents the equal protection of the laws.\n\n\n (3)\n It taxes the transfer of a nonresident's property over which the state of New Jersey has no jurisdiction while it expressly omits like property of residents, that is, real estate without the state, and thereby deprives the nonresident of his property without due process of law.\n Before taking up these objections it is necessary to briefly consider the nature of the tax. In Carr v. Edwards, 84 N. J. Law, 667, 87 Atl. 132, it was held by the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals to be a tax upon the special right, the creation of the statute, of an executor or administrator of a nonresident decedent to succeed to property having its situs in New Jersey. Of section 12, as it stood in the original act of 1909, the court said:\n'That section contains nothing to indicate that it is not the succession of the New Jersey representative that is meant to be taxed. It is true that the tax is not necessarily 5 per cent. upon the whole New Jersey succession. The amount depends on the ratio of the New Jersey property to the entire estate wherever situated. This, however, merely affords a measure of the tax imposed; the tax is still by the very words of the section imposed upon the property located within this state. The reason for adopting this provision was to make sure that the rate of taxation in case of nonresident decedents \n\n[250 U.S. 525, 536]\n\u00a0\n should equal but no exceed the rate imposed in the case of resident decedents. ...\n\n'In the case of the estates of nonresident decedents, it is open for the law of the domicile to provide, as testators sometimes do, that such taxes shall be a general charge against the estate. Our Legislature must be assumed to have had in mind its lack of jurisdiction over legacies under a nonresident's will, and in order to protect the New Jersey executor, administrator or trustee who paid the tax, authorized its deduction from 'property for distribution.' This phrase suffices to reach not only a distributive share of a resident's estate in the case of intestacy, but the whole of the New Jersey property of a nonresident when turned over to the executor or administrator at the domicile of the decedent. The provision for both cases-legacies and property for distribution-demonstrates that the Legislature did not mean to provide, as counsel contends, for a legacy duty only.'\n\n This language correctly characterizes the nature and effect of the tax as imposed under the amendment of 1914; but that act, under which the present cases arise, instead of reaching 'the whole of the New Jersey property of a nonresident when turned over to the executor or administrator at the domicile of the decedent,' now confines the transfer tax upon the property of nonresident decedents to real estate and tangible personal property within the state, the stock of New Jersey corporations, and the stock of national banks located within the state.\n The tax is, then, one upon the transfer of property in New Jersey, to be paid upon turning it over to the administrator or executor at the domicile of the decedent. That transfers of this nature are within the taxing power of the state, and that taxes may be assessed upon such rights owing their existence to local laws, and to them alone, is not disputed. The right to inherit property, or to receive it under testamentary disposition, has been so frequently \n\n[250 U.S. 525, 537]\n\u00a0\n held to be the creation of statutory law, that it is quite unnecessary to cite the decisions which have maintained the principle. While this is confessedly true, the assessment of such taxes is, of course, subject to applicable limitations of the state and federal Constitutions; it is with the latter class only that this court has to do.\n\n\n (1)\n Taking up, then, the objections raised under the federal Constitution, it is said that the law (a) denies to citizens of other states the privileges and immunities granted to citizens of the state of New Jersey, in violation of paragraph 1,  2, art. 4, of the federal Constitution, which reads, 'The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states;' (b) abridges the privileges and immunities of plaintiffs in error, the deceased persons whom they represent, and those taking by will or intestacy under them, as citizens of the United States, in contravention of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The provision quoted from article 4 of the Constitution was intended to prevent discrimination by the several states against citizens of other states in respect of the fundamental privileges of citizenship. As is said by Judge Cooley in his Constitutional Limitations (7th Ed.) p. 569:\n'It appears to be conceded that the Constitution secures in each state to the citizens of all other states the right to remove to, and carry on business therein; the right by the usual modes to acquire and hold property, and to protect and defend the same in the law; the right to the usual remedies for the collection of debts and the enforcement of other personal rights; and the right to be exempt, in property and person, from taxes or burdens which the property, or persons, of citizens of the same State are not subject to.' Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 180; Ward v. Maryland, 12 Wall. 418, 430.\n\n The Fourteenth Amendment recognized a distinction between citizenship of the United States and citizenship \n\n[250 U.S. 525, 538]\n\u00a0\n of one of the States. It provides:\n'No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.'\n\n What those privileges and immunities were was under consideration in Slaughterhouse Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 72-79, where it was shown (16 Wall. 77, 78) that it was not the purpose of this amendment, by the declaration that no state should make or enforce any law which should abridge the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, to transfer from the states to the federal government the security and protection of those civil rights that inhere in state citizenship; and (16 Wall. 79) that the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States thereby placed beyond abridgment by the states were those which owe their existence to the federal government, its national character, its constitution, or its laws. To the same effect is Duncan v. Missouri, \n152 \nU.S. 377, 382\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 570.\n We are unable to discover in the statute before us, which regulates and taxes the right to succeed to property in New Jersey upon the death of a nonresident owner, any infringement of the rights of citizenship either of the states or of the United States, secured by either of the constitutional provisions referred to. We have held that the protection that they afford to rights inherent in citizenship are not infringed by the taxation or transfer of property within the jurisdiction of a state passing by will or intestacy, where the decedent was a nonresident of the taxing state, although the entire succession was taxed in the state where he resided. Blackstone v. Miller, \n188 \nU.S. 189, 207\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 277.\n Upon this point it is unnecessary to decide whether the case might not be rested on a much narrower ground. The alleged discrimination, here complained of, so far as privileges and immunities of citizenship are concerned, is not strictly applicable to this statute, because the difference in the method of taxation rests upon residence \n\n[250 U.S. 525, 539]\n\u00a0\n and not upon citizenship. La Tourette v. McMaster, \n248 U.S. 465\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 160.\n\n\n (2)\n It is next contended that the effect of including the property beyond the jurisdiction of the state in measuring the tax amounts to a deprivation of property without due process of law because it in effect taxes property beyond the jurisdiction of the state.\n It is not to be disputed that, consistently with the federal Constitution, a state may not tax property beyond its territorial jurisdiction; but the subject-matter here regulated is a privilege to succeed to property which is within the jurisdiction of the state. When the state levies taxes within its authority, property not in itself taxable by the state may be used as a measure of the tax imposed. This principle has been frequently declared by decisions of this court. The previous cases were reviewed and the doctrine applied in Kansas City R. R. Co. v. Kansas, \n240 \nU.S. 227, 232\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 261. After deciding that the privilege tax, there involved, did not impose a burden upon interstate commerce, this court held that it was not in substance and effect a tax upon property beyond the state's jurisdiction, although a large amount of the property, which was referred to as a measure of the assessment, was situated outside of the state. In the present case the state imposes a privilege tax, clearly within its authority, and it has adopted as a measure of that tax the proportion which the specified local property bears to the entire estate of the decedent. That it may do so, within limitations which do not really make the tax one upon property beyond its jurisdiction, the decisions to which we have referred clearly establish. The transfer of certain property within the state is taxed by a rule which considers the entire estate in arriving at the amount of the tax. It is in no just sense a tax upon the foreign property, real or personal. It is only in instances where the state exceeds its authority in imposing a tax upon a subject-matter within its \n\n[250 U.S. 525, 540]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction in such a way as to really amount to taxing that which is beyond its authority, that such exercise of power by the state is held void. In cases of that character the attempted taxation must fail. Looney v. Attorney General, \n245 U.S. 178\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 85; International Paper Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 U.S. 135\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 292, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 617. To say that to apply a different rule regulating succession to resident and nonresident decedents is to levy a tax upon foreign estates, is to distort the statute from its purpose to tax the privilege, which the statute has created, into a property tax, and is unwarranted by any purpose or effect of the enactment, as we view it.\n\n\n (3)\n It is further contended that the tax bears so unequally upon nonresidents as to deny to them the equal protection of the laws.\n The subject of taxes of this character was given full consideration by this court in Magoun v. Illinois, \n170 U.S. 283\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 594, in which case a graded legacy and inheritance tax law of the state of Illinois was sustained. The statute exempted all estates valued at less than $20,000, if passing to near relations, or at less than $500 if passing to those more remote, made the rate of tax increasingly greater as the inheritances increased, and assessed it differently according to the relationship of the beneficiary to the testator or intestate. The statute was attacked as void under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, but was held to be valid. Of this class of taxes the court said (\n170 U.S. 288\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 596):\n'They [inheritance taxes] are based on two principles: (1) An inheritance tax is not one on property, but one on the succession. (2) The right to take property by devise or descent is the creature of the law, and not a natural right-a privilege, and therefore the authority which confers it may impose conditions upon it. From these principles it is deduced that the states may tax the privilege, discriminate between relatives, and between these and strangers, and grant exemptions, and are not precluded from this power \n\n[250 U.S. 525, 541]\n\u00a0\n by the provisions of the respective state Constitutions requiring uniformity and equality of taxation.'\n\n And upon examining (\n170 \nU.S. 296, 297\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 594) the classification upon which the provisions of the Illinois statute were based, the court found there was no denial of the equal protection of the laws either in discriminating between those lineally and those collaterally related to decedent, and those standing as strangers to the blood, or in increasing the proportionate burden of the tax progressively as the amount of the benefit increased.\n Equal protection of the laws requires equal operation of the laws upon all persons in like circumstances. Under the statute, in the present case, the graduated taxes are levled equally upon all interests passing from nonresident testators or intestates. The tax is not upon property, but upon the privilege of succession, which the state may grant or withhold. It may deny it to some and give it to others. The state is dealing in this instance not with the transfer of the entire estate, but only with certain classes of property that are subject to the jurisdiction of the state. It must find some rule which will adequately deal with this situation. It has adopted that of the proportion of the local estate in certain property to the entire estate of the decedent. In making classification, which has been uniformly held to be within the power of the state, inequalities necessarily arise, for some classes are reached, and others omitted; but this has never been held to render such statutes unconstitutional. Beers v. Glynn, \n211 U.S. 477\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 186. This principle has been recognized in a series of cases in this court. Board of Education v. Illinois, \n203 U.S. 553\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 171, 8 Ann. Cas. 157; Campbell v. California, \n200 U.S. 87\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 182; Keeney v. Comptroller of the State of New York, \n222 U.S. 525\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 105, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1139. It has been uniformly held that the Fourteenth Amendment does not deprive the states of the right to determine the limitations and restrictions upon the right to inherit property, but 'at the most can only be held to restrain such an exercise of power as would \n\n[250 U.S. 525, 542]\n\u00a0\n exclude the conception of judgment and discretion, and which would be so obviously arbitrary and unreasonable as to be beyond the pale of governmental authority.' Campbell v. California, \n200 U.S. 95\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 185. In upholding the validity of a graduated tax upon the transfer of personal property, to take effect upon the grantor's death, we said in Keeney v. Comptroller of New York, supra, 222 U. S. page 535, 32 Sup. Ct. 107, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1139:\n'The validity of the tax must be determined by the laws of New York. The Fourteenth Amendment does not diminish the taxing power of the state, but only requires that in its exercise the citizen must be afforded an opportunity to be heard on all questions of liability and value, and shall not, by arbitrary and discriminatory provisions, be denied equal protection. It does not deprive the state of the power to select the subjects of taxation. But it does not follow that because it can tax any transfer (Hatch v. Reardon, \n204 U.S. 152\n, 159 [ 27 Sup. Ct. 188, 9 Ann. Cas. 736]), that it must tax all transfers, or that all must be treated alike.'\n\n In order to invalidate this tax it must be held that the difference in the manner of assessing transmission of property by testators or intestates, as between resident and nonresident decedents, is so wholly arbitrary and unreasonable as to be beyond the legitimate authority of the state. We are not prepared so to declare. The resident testator or intestate stands in a different relation to the state than does the nonresident. The resident's property is usually within the ready control of the state, and easily open to inspection and discovery for taxation purposes, by means quite different from those afforded in cases of local holdings of nonresident testators or intestates. As to the resident, his entire intangible, and usually most of his tangible property, pay tribute to the state when transferred by will or intestacy; the transfer of the nonresident's estate is taxed only so far as his estate is located within the jurisdiction and only so far as it comes within the description of 'real property within this state, or of goods, wares, \n\n[250 U.S. 525, 543]\n\u00a0\n and merchandise within this state, or of shares of stock of corporations of this state, or of national banking associations located in this state.' Simple contract debts owing by New Jersey debtors to nonresidents and some other kinds of property of nonresidents are exempt, although it is settled that, for the purpose of founding administration, simple contract debts are assets at the domicile of the debtor (Wyman v. Halstead, \n109 \nU.S. 654, 656\n, 3 S. Sup. Ct. 417), and that the state of the debtor's domicile may impose a succession tax (Blackstone v. Miller, \n188 \nU.S. 189, 205\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 277; Baker v. Baker, Eccles & Co., \n242 \nU.S. 394, 401\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 152).\n The question of equal protection must be decided as between resident and nonresident decedents as classes, rather than by the incidence of the tax upon the particular estates whose representatives are here complaining. Absolute equality is impracticable in taxation, and is not required by the equal protection clause. And inequalities that result not from hostile discrimination, but occasionally and incidentally in the application of a system that is not arbitrary in its classification, are not sufficient to defeat the law.\n In our opinion, there are substantial differences which within the rules settled by this court permit the classification which has been accomplished by this statute. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 367\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 99, and cases cited.\n Finding no error in the judgments of the Court of Errors and Appeals of the state of New Jersey, the same are\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES (dissenting).\n Many things that a legislature may do if it does them with no ulterior purpose, it cannot do as a means to reach what is beyond its constitutional power. That I understand to be the principle of Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, \n216 U.S. 1\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 190, Pullman Co. v. Kansas, \n216 U.S. 56\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 232, and other cases \n\n[250 U.S. 525, 544]\n\u00a0\n in 216 U. S. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Foster, \n247 \nU.S. 105, 114\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 438, 1 A. L. R. 1278. New Jersey cannot tax the property of Hill or McDonald outside the State and cannot use her power over property within it to accomplish by indirection what she cannot do directly. It seems to me that that is what she is trying to do and therefore that the judgment of the Court of Errors and Appeals should be reversed.\n It seems to me that when property outside the State is taken into account for the purpose of increasing the tax upon property within it, the property outside is taxed in effect, no matter what form of words may be used. It appears to me that this cannot be done, even if it should be done in such a way as to secure equality between residents in New Jersey and those in other States.\n New Jersey could not deny to residents in other States the right to take legacies which it granted to its own citizens, and therefore its power to prohibit all legacies cannot be invoked in aid of a principle that affects the foreign residents alone. In Kansas City, Ft. Scott & Memphis Ry. Co. v. Kansas, \n240 \nU.S. 227, 235\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 261, the State could have refused incorporation altogether and therefore could impose the carefully limited condition that was upheld.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concur in the opinion that I express. \n\n\n\n","128":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCKINLEY v.

St. 1918,  2019b). This statute provides:\n'The Secretary of War is hereby authorized, empowered, and directed during the present war to do everything by him deemed necessary to suppress and prevent the keeping or setting up of houses of ill fame, brothels, or bawdy houses, within such distance as he may deem needful of any military camp, station, fort, post, cantonment, training or mobilization place and any person, corporation, partnership, or association receiving or permitting to be received for immoral purposes any person into any place, structure, or building used for the purpose of lewdness, assignation, or prostitution within such distance of said places as may be designated, or shall permit any such person to remain for immoral purposes in any such place, structure, or building as aforesaid, or who shall violate any order, rule, or regulation issued to carry out the object and purpose of this section, shall, unless otherwise punishable under the Articles of War, be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000, or imprisonment for not more than twelve months, or both.'\n\n Plaintiffs in error contend that Congress has no constitutional authority to pass this act. The indictment charged that the plaintiffs in error did unlawfully keep and set up a house of ill fame within the distance designated by the Secretary of War, under the authority of the act of Congress, to wit, within five miles of a certain military station of the United States. \n\n[249 U.S. 397, 399]\n\u00a0\n That Congress has the authority to raise and support armies and to make rules and regulations for the protecition of the health and welfare of those composing them, is too well settled to require more than the statement of the proposition.

See House v. Mayes, \n219 U.S. 270\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 234; Board of Trade v. Christie Grain & Stock Co., \n198 U.S. 236\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 637. The information stated that St. Louis is a city of more than 75,000 inhabitants; that \n\n[248 U.S. 365, 367]\n\u00a0\n public weighers of grain are maintained there at all public warehouses and elevators in compliance with the act; and that the respondent in violation thereof and in abuse of its corporate franchise maintains a bureaufor weighing grain, grants weight certificates, and makes charges therefor. The prayer is that respondent be adjudged guilty of these practices and that a fine be imposed. The return admitted substantially the facts stated in the information but alleged that the service were rendered only at the request of members; that the weighing by its bureau in addition to that of the public weighers added to the general security, thus benefitting farmer, dealer, and consumer; that similar weighing bureaus were maintained by the boards of trade at competing grain markets; and that the statute, in prohibiting the practice, deprived its members of liberty and property and of equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The return also set forth that the grain weighed by its bureau was in large part shipped into or out of the state; that it is commercially necessary as a part of interstate transit to pass grain through an elevator where it is weighed, and the issue of certificates of weight is essential; and that the provisions of the Missouri act therefore violated the commerce clause of the federal Constitution. Upon a demurrer to the return, the full court found the respondent guilty and ordered that it be ousted of the usurped power of weighing grain received into or discharged from public warehouses and elevators and of making charges therefor, and of issuing weight certificates and making charges therefor; and that the respondent pay costs. State ex inf. Barker v. Merchants' Exchange of St. Louis, 269 Mo. 346, 190 S. W. 903, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 871. The case comes here on writ of error.\n First. Section 63 of the act does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. As the state court has pointed out, the statute does not prohibit owners of grain from weighing it before it is went to a public warehouse or after it is removed therefrom. But the issue of a private weigher's \n\n[248 U.S. 365, 368]\n\u00a0\n certificate in addition to the certificate of the public weigher might lead to embarrassment or confusion or prove a means of deception. The regulation of weights and measures with a view to preventing fraud and facilitating commercial transactions is an exercise of the police power. To require that goods received in or discharged from public warehouses shall be weighed by public weighers and that no one else shall issue certificates of or make charges for weighing under those circumstances is not an unreasonable or arbitrary exercise of the discretion vested in the Legislature. Compare House v. Mayers, supra; Brodnax v. Missouri, \n219 U.S. 285\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 238. Nor can we say that to limit the application of the provision to grain and hay is an arbitrary discrimination against dealers in those articles. The fact that respondent is a corporation does not lessen the scope of the state's police power. We have no occasion to consider whether it is thereby enlarged.\n Second. Section 63 does not violate the commerce clause of the Constitution (article 1,  8, cl. 3). The contention that it does was rested below solely on the ground that the prohibition, as applied to grain received from or shipped to points without the state, burdens interstate commerce. It clearly does not. Pittsburg & Southern Coal Co. v. Louisiana, \n156 U.S. 590\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 459; W. W. Cargill Co. v. Minnesota, \n180 U.S. 452\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 423. But the additional contention is made here that all state regulation of the weighing of grain was superseded by the United States Grain Standards Act, approved August 11, 1916 (39 Stat. 482 [Comp. St. 1918,  8747 1\/2-8747 1\/2 k]). That act (which is part B of chapter 313) relates exclusively to the establishment by the Secretary of Agriculture of standards of quality and condition. It does not in any way refer to the weighing of grain. And part B of chapter 313, by section 7 (page 484 [section 8747 1\/2 f)], like part C, the United States Warehouse Act (sections 8747 3\/4-8747 3\/4 pp), which does contain some reference to weighing, by section 29 (page 490 [ section 8747 3\/4 nn]), makes manifest the purpose of Congress not to supersede \n\n[248 U.S. 365, 369]\n\u00a0\n state laws for the inspection and weighing of grain, but to co-operate with state officials charged with the enforcement of such state laws. The Missouri act is not superseded by or in conflict with the federal legislation.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri is therefore.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","130":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMIDDLETON v. TEXAS POWER & LIGHT CO.(1919)\nNo. 102\nArgued: Decided: March 3, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[249 U.S. 152, 153]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles B. Braun, of Waco, Tex., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Harry P. Lawther and Alexander Pope, both of Dallas, Tex., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Alleging that in the month of December, 1913, he was in the employ of the Texas Power & Light Company in the \n\n[249 U.S. 152, 154]\n\u00a0\n state of Texas, and while so employed received serious personal injuries through the bursting of a steam pipe due to the negligence of his employer and its agents, Middleton sued the company in a district court of that state to recover his damages. The defendant interposed an answer in the nature of a plea in abatement setting up that at the time of the accident and at the commencement of the action defendant was the holder of a policy of liability and compensation insurance, issued in its favor by a company lawfully transacting such business in the state, conditioned to pay the compensation provided by the Texas Workmen's Compensation Act, which was approved April 16, 1913, and took effect on the 1st day of September in that year (chapter 179, Acts of 33d Legislature, [Vernon's Sayles' Ann. Civ. St. 1914, arts. 5246h-5246zzzz]) of which fact the plaintiff had proper and timely notice as provided by the act; and that no claim for the compensation provided in the act with respect to the alleged injury had been made by plaintiff, but on the contrary he had refused to receive such compensation, with other matters sufficient to bring defendant within the protection of the act. Plaintiff took a special exception in the nature of a demurrer, upon the ground (among others) that the act was in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The exception was overruled, the plea in abatement sustained, and the action dismissed. On appeal to the Court of Civil Appeals it was at first held that the judgment must be reversed (178 S. W. 956); but upon an application for a rehearing the constitutional questions were certified to the Supreme Court of the state. That court sustained the constitutionality of the law (108 Tex. 96, 185 S. W. 556); and in obedience to its opinion the Court of Civil Appeals set aside its former judgment and affirmed the judgment of the district court. Thereupon the present writ of error was sued out under section 237, Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1156), as amended by Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448,  2, 39 Stat. 726 (Comp. St.  1214). \n\n[249 U.S. 152, 155]\n\u00a0\n Thus we have presented, from the standpoint of an objecting employe, the question whether the Texas Employers' Liability Act is in conflict with the due process and equal protection provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The act creates an employers' insurance association, to which any employer of labor in the state, with exceptions to be mentioned, may become a subscriber; and out of the funds of this association, derived from premiums on policies of liability insurance issued by it to subscribing members and assessments authorized against them if necessary, the compensation provided by the act as due on account of personal injuries sustained by their employes, or on account of death resulting from such injuries, is to be paid. This is a stated compensation, fixed with relation to the employe's average weekly wages, and accrues to him absolutely when he suffers a personal injury in the course of his employment incapacitating him from earning wages for as long a period as one week, or to his representatives or beneficiaries in the event of his death from such injury, whether or not it be due to the negligence of the employer or his servants or agents. Such compensation is the statutory substitute for damages otherwise recoverable because of injuries suffered by an employe, or his death occasioned by such injuries, when due to the negligence of the employer or his servants; it being declared that the employe of a subscribing employer, or his representatives or beneficiaries in case of his death, shall have no cause of action against the employer for damages except where a death is caused by the willful act or omission or gross negligence of the employer. Employers who do not become subscribers are subject as before to suits for damages based on negligence for injuries to employes or for death resulting therefrom, and are deprived of the so-called 'common-law defenses' of fellow servant's negligence and assumed risk, and also of contributory \n\n[249 U.S. 152, 156]\n\u00a0\n negligence as an absolute defense, it being provided that for contributory negligence damages shall be diminished except where the employer's violation of a statute enacted for the safety of employes contributes to the injury or death; but that where the injury is caused by the willful intention of the employe to bring it about the employer may defend on that ground. Every employer becoming a subscriber to the insurance association is required to give written or printed notice to all his employes that he has provided for the payment by the association of compensation for injuries received by them in the course of their employment. Under certain conditions an employer holding a liability policy issued by an insurance company lawfully transacting such business within the state is to be deemed a subscriber within the meaning of the act. There are administrative provisions, including procedure for the determination of disputed claims. By section 2 of part 1 (Vernon's Sayles' Ann. Civ. St. 1914, art. 5246hh) it is enacted as follows:\n'The provisions of this act shall not apply to actions to recover damages for the personal injuries or for death resulting from personal injuries sustained by domestic servants, farm laborers, nor to the employes of any person, firm or corporation operating any railway as a common carrier, nor to laborers engaged in working for a cotton gin, nor to employes of any person, firm or corporation having in his or their employ not more than five employes.'\n\n Following the order adopted in the argument of plaintiff in error, we deal first with the contention that the act amounts to a denial of the equal protection of the laws. This is based in part upon the classification resulting from the provisions of the section just quoted, it being said that employes of the excepted classes are left entitled to certain privileges which by the act are denied to employes of the non- excepted classes, without reasonable basis for the distinction.\n Of course plaintiff in error, not being an employe in \n\n[249 U.S. 152, 157]\n\u00a0\n any of the excepted classes, would not be heard to assert any grievance they might have by reason of being excluded from the operation of the act. Southern Ry. Co. v. King, \n217 \nU.S. 524, 534\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 594; Standard Stock Food Co. v. Wright, \n225 \nU.S. 540, 550\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 784; Rosenthal v. New York, \n226 \nU.S. 260, 271\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 27, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 71; Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 531, 544\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 359; Jeffrey Mfg. Co. v. Blagg, \n235 \nU.S. 571, 576\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 167. But plaintiff in error sets up a grievance as a member of a class to which the act is made to apply.\n However, we are clear that the classification cannot be held to be arbitrary and unreasonable. The Supreme Court of Texas in sustaining it said (108 Tex. 110, 111, 185 S. W. 561):\n'Employes of railroads, those of employers having less than five employes, domestic servants, farm laborers and gin laborers are excluded from the operation of the act, but this was doubtless for reasons that the Legislature deemed sufficient. The nature of these several employments, the existence of other laws governing liability for injuries to railroad employes, known experience as to the hazards and extent of accidental injuries to farm hands, gin hands and domestic servants, were all matters no doubt considered by the Legislature in exempting them from the operation of the act. Distinctions in these and other respects between them and employes engaged in other industrial pursuits may, we think, be readily suggested. We are not justified in saying that the classification was purely arbitrary.'\n\n There is a strong presumption that a Legislature understands and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people, that its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience, and that its discriminations are based upon adequate grounds. The equal protection clause does not require that state laws shall cover the entire field of proper legislation in a single enactment. If one entertained the view that the act might as well have been extended to other classes of employment, this would not \n\n[249 U.S. 152, 158]\n\u00a0\n amount to a constitutional objection. Rosenthal v. New York, \n226 \nU.S. 260, 271\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 27, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 71; Patsone v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 138, 144\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 281; Missouri, Kan. & Texas Ry. v. Cade, \n233 \nU.S. 642, 649\n, 650 S., 34 Sup. Ct. 678; International Harvester Co. v. Missouri, \n234 \nU.S. 199, 215\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 859, 52 L. R. A. (N. S.) 525; Keokee Coke Co. v. Taylor, \n234 \nU.S. 224, 227\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 856; Miller v. Wilson, \n236 \nU.S. 373, 384\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 342, L. R. A. 1915F, 829.\n The burden being upon him who attacks a law for unconstitutionality, the courts need not be ingenious in searching for grounds of distinction to sustain a classification that may be subjected to criticism. But in this case adequate grounds are easily discerned. As to the exclusion of railroad employes, the existence of the federal employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65 (Comp. St.  8657-8665), as amended by act April 5, 1910, c. 143, 36 Stat. 291, applying exclusively as to employes of common carriers by rail injured while employed in interstate commerce, establishing liability for negligence and exempting from liability in the absence of negligence in all cases within its reach ( New York Central R. R. Co. v. Winfield, \n244 U.S. 147\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 546, L. R. A. 1918C, 439, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 1139; Erie R. R. Co. v. Winfield, \n244 U.S. 170\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 556, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 662), and the difficulty that so often arises in determining in particular instances whether the employe was employed in interstate commerce at the time of the injury (see Pedersen v. Del., Lack. & West. R. R., \n229 \nU.S. 146, 151\n, 152 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 648, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 153; North Carolina R. R. Co. v. Zachary, \n232 \nU.S. 248, 259\n, 260 S., 34 Sup. Ct. 305, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 159; Illinois Central R. R. v. Behrens, \n233 \nU.S. 473, 478\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 646, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 163; New York Central R. R. Co. v. Carr, \n238 \nU.S. 260, 263\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 780; Pennsylvania Co. v. Donat, \n239 U.S. 50\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 4; Shanks v. Del., Lack. & West. R. R., \n239 \nU.S. 556, 559\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 188, L. R. A. 1916C, 797; Louisville & Nash. R. R. Co. v. Parker, \n242 U.S. 13\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 4; Erie R. R. Co. v. Welsh, \n242 \nU.S. 303, 306\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 116; Southern Ry. Co. v. Puckett, \n244 \nU.S. 571, 573\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 703, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 69), reasonably may have led the Legislature to the view that it would be unwise to attempt to apply the new system to railroad employes, in whatever kind of commerce employed, and that they might better be left to common-law actions with statutory \n\n[249 U.S. 152, 159]\n\u00a0\n modifications already in force (Vernon's Sayles' Texas Civ. Stat. 1914, arts. 6640-6652), and such others as experience might show to be called for.\n The exclusion of farm laborers and domestic servants from the compulsory scheme of the New York Workmen's Compensation Act was sustained in New York Central R. R. Co. v. White, \n243 \nU.S. 188, 208\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629, upon the ground that the Legislature reasonably might consider that the risks inherent in those occupations were exceptionally patent, simple, and familiar. The same result has been reached by the state courts generally. Opinion of Justices, 209 Mass. 607, 610, 96 N. E. 308; Young v. Duncan, 218 Mass. 346, 349, 106 N. E. 1; Hunter v. Colfax Coal Co., 175 Iowa, 245, 287, 154 N. W. 1037, 157 N. W. 145, L. R. A. 1917D, 15, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 803; Sayles v. Foley, 38 R. I. 484, 490-492, 96 Atl. 340. Similar reasoning may be applied to cotton gin laborers in Texas; indeed, it was applied to them by the Supreme Court of that state, as we have seen. And the exclusion of domestic servants, farm laborers, casual employes, and railroad employes engaged in interstate commerce was sustained in Mathison v. Minneapolis Street Ry. Co., 126 Minn. 286, 293, 148 N. W. 71, L. R. A. 1916D, 412.\n The exclusion of employes where not more than four or five are under a single employer is common in legislation of this character, and evidently permissible upon the ground that the conditions of the industry are different and the hazards fewer, simpler, and more easily avoided where so few are employed together; the Legislature, of course, being the proper judges to determine precisely where the line should be drawn. Classification on this basis was upheld in Jeffrey Mfg. Co. v. Blagg, \n235 U.S. 571\n, 576-577, 35 Sup. Ct. 167, and has been sustained repeatedly by the state courts. State v. Creamer, 85 Ohio St. 349, 404, 405, 97 N. E. 602, 39 L. R. A. (N. S.) 694; Borgnis v. Falk Co., 147 Wis. 327, 355, 133 N. W. 209, 37 L. R. A. (N. S.) 489; Shade v. Cement Co., 93 Kan. 257, 259, 144 Pac. 249; Sayles v. Foley, 38 R. I. 484, 491, 493, 96 Atl. 340.\n The discrimination that results from the operation of the \n\n[249 U.S. 152, 160]\n\u00a0\n act as between the employes of different employers engaged in the same kind of work, where one employer becomes a subscriber and another does not, furnishes no ground of constitutional attack upon the theory that there is a denial of the equal protection of the laws. That the acceptance of such a system may be made optional is too plain for question; and it necessarily follows that differences arising from the fact that all of those to whom the option is open do not accept it must be regarded as the natural and inevitable result of a free choice, and not as a legislative discrimination. They stand upon the same fundamental basis as other differences in the conditions of employment arising from the variant exercise by employers and employes of their right to agree upon the terms of employment. And see Borgnis v. Falk Co., 147 Wis. 327, 354, 133 N. W. 209, 37 L. R. A. (N. S.) 489; Mathison v. Minneapolis Street Ry. Co., 126 Minn. 286, 294, 148 N. W. 71, L. R. A. 1916D, 412.\n In recent years many of the states have passed elective workmen's compensation laws not differing essentially from the one here in question, and they have been sustained by well-considered opinions of the state courts of last resort against attacks based upon all kinds of constitutional objections, including alleged denial of the equal protection of the laws; usually, however, from the standpoint of the employer.

Cas. 1917E, 803. The Ohio law was sustained by this court against special \n\n[249 U.S. 152, 161]\n\u00a0\n attacks in Jeffrey Mfg. Co. v. Blagg, \n235 \nU.S. 571, 576\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 167, and the Iowa law in Hawkins v. Bleakly, \n243 U.S. 210\n, 213, et seq., 37 Sup. Ct. 255, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 637.\n Stress is laid upon the point that the Texas act, while optional to the employer, is compulsory as to the employe of a subscribing employer. Our attention is not called to any express provision prohibiting a voluntary agreement between a subscribing employer and one or more of his employes taking them out of the operation of the act; but probably such an agreement might be held by the courts of the state to be inconsistent with the general policy of the act. The Supreme Court, in the case before us, did not intimate that such special agreements would be permissible; and hence it is fair to assume that all who remain in the employ of a subscribing employer, with notice that he has provided for payment of compensation by the association or by an authorized insurance company, will be bound by the provisions of the act.\n But a moment's reflection will show the impossibility of giving an option both to the employer and to the employe and enabling them to exercise it in diverse ways. The provisions of the act show that the legislative purpose is that it shall take effect only upon acceptance by both employer and employe. The former accepts by becoming a subscriber; the latter by remaining in the service of the employer after notice of such acceptance. And we see in this no ground for holding that there is a denial of the equal protection of the laws as between employer and employe. They stand in different relations to the common undertaking, and it was permissible to recognize this in determining how they should accept or reject the new system. The employer provides the plant, the organization, the capital, the credit, and necessarily must control and manage the operation. In the nature of things his contribution has less mobility than that of the employe, who may go from place to place seeking \n\n[249 U.S. 152, 162]\n\u00a0\n satisfactory employment, while the employer's plant and business are comparatively, even if not absolutely, fixed in position. Again, in order that the new scheme of compensation should be a success, the Legislature deemed it proper, if not essential, that the payment of compensation to the injured employes or their dependents should be rendered secure, and the losses to individual employers distributed, by a system of compensation insurance, in which it was deemed important that all employes of a given employer should be treated alike. Still further there are reasons affecting the contentment of the employes and the discipline of the force, rendering it desirable that all serving under a common employer should be subject to a single rule as to compensation in the event of injury or death arising in the course of the employment. These and other considerations that might be suggested fully justified the legislative body of the state in determining that acceptance of the new system should rest upon the initiative of the employer, and that any particular employe who with notice of the employer's acceptance dissented from the resulting arrangement should be required to exercise his option by withdrawing from the employment. The relation of employer and employe being a voluntary relation, it was well within the power of the state to permit employers to accept or reject the new plan of compensation, each for himself, as a part of the terms of employment; and in doing this there was no denial to employes of the equal protection of the laws within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n This disposes of all contentions made under the equal protection clause.\n It is argued further that there is a deprivation of liberty and property without due process of law in requiring employes, willingly or unwillingly, to accept the new system where their employer has adopted it. Of course there is no suggestion of a deprivation of vested property \n\n[249 U.S. 152, 163]\n\u00a0\n in the present case, since the law was passed in April and took effect in September, while the plaintiff's injuries were received in the following December, after he had been notified of his employer's acceptance of the act. What plaintiff has lost, therefore, is only a part of his liberty to make such contract as he pleased with a particular employer and to pursue his employment under the rules of law that previously had obtained fixing responsibility upon the employer for any personal injuries the plaintiff might sustain through the negligence of the employer or his agents. But, as has been held so often, the liberty of the citizen does not include among its incidents any vested right to have the rules of law remain unchanged for his benefit. The law of master and servant, as a body of rules of conduct, is subject to change by legislation in the public interest. The difinition of negligence, contributory negligence, and assumption of risk, the effect to be given to them, the rule of respondent superior, the imposition of liability without fault, and the exemption from liability in spite of fault-all these, as rules of conduct, are subject to legislative modification. And a plan imposing upon the employer responsibility for making compensation for disabling or fatal injuries irrespective of the question of fault, and requiring the employe to assume all risk of damages over and above the statutory schedule, when established as a reasonable substitute for the legal measure of duty and responsibility previously existing, may be made compulsory upon employes as well as employers.

Crane, of Topeka, Kan., and F. T. Woodburn, of Holton, Kan., for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Robert Stone, George T. McDermott, and H. O. Caster, all of Topeka, Kan., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Under the Act of February 8, 1887 (24 Stat. 388, 389, c. 119), Mish no, a member of the Prairie Band of the Pottawatomies, was allotted land in Kansas, which was to be \n\n[249 U.S. 308, 309]\n\u00a0\n held in trust by the United States and subject to the restrictions on the power of the allottee to deal with the land, provided by that act.\n Mish no leased the land for the year 1912 for a rental of one half the corn and stalks to be produced. In May of that year he sold his right to his share of the prospective crop to McClain, and in the autumn when the crop was made again sold his share to Cooney, who sold and delivered it to Miller.\n The writ of error before us is prosecuted by Miller and Cooney to reverse the judgment of the court below, sustaining the purchase by McClain, with a resulting liability in Miller and Cooney to McClain for the corn or its value. The case as made by the argument turns exclusively upon the correctness of the interpretation affixed by the court below to section 5 of the Act of 1887 (U. S. Comp. St.  4201), to the effect that as by the law of Kansas a growing crop is a chattel, the sale to McClain was valid and not in conflict with the following provision of section 5:\n'And if any conveyance shall be made of the lands set apart and allotted as herein provided, or any contract touching the same, before the expiration of the time above mentioned [the trust period], such conveyance or contract shall be absolutely ... void.'\n\n But we are of opinion that the solution of the case does not require a consideration of this question since it only exacts that we ascertain whether the particular contract in question was by law excepted from the operation of the prohibition of the Act of 1887, thus rendering an analysis and application of that prohibition negligible.\n As we have seen, what was sold to McClain was not an undivided share of a growing crop of the allottee, but was that portion of the total crop of the tenant fixed by the lease as due for rent. The lease, therefore, and the power to make it, was the criterion by which to determine the application of the prohibition of the Act of 1887. If it \n\n[249 U.S. 308, 310]\n\u00a0\n be that the lease was inconsistent with that Act, it would follow that the stipulation as to the rent which it contained would perish with the contract. If on the contrary it be that the lease was valid, the authority to make it would include the right to stipulate for the rental. As it cannot be questioned that a contract leasing land is one touching the land, it is indisputable that the lease was void under the Act of 1887 unless its validity may be excepted by some other statutory provision.\n By a course of legislation beginning in 1891 and extending to 1900 authority was conferred upon the Secretary of the Interior to sanction, when enumerated and exceptional conditions existed, leases of land allotted under the Act of 1887, and the power was given to the Secretary to adopt rules and regulations governing the exercise of the right (Acts of February 28, 1891, c. 383, 26 Stat. 794, 795; August 15, 1894, c. 290, 28 Stat. 286, 305; June 7, 1897, c. 3, 30 Stat. 62, 85; May 31, 1900, 31 Stat. 221, 229, c. 598). The general scope of the legislation is shown by the following provision of the Act of 1900, which does not materially differ from the prior acts:\n'That whenever it shall be made to appear to the Secretary of the Interior that by reason of age, disability, or inability, any allottee of Indian lands cannot personally and with benefit to himself occupy or improve his allotment or any part thereof, the same may be leased upon such terms, regulations, and conditions as shall be prescribed by the Secretary for a term not exceeding five years for farming purposes only.'\n\n The regulations for the purpose of carrying out the power given prescribed a general form of lease to be used under the exceptional circumstances which the statute contemplated and subjected its execution and the subjects connected with it to the scrutiny of the Indian Bureau and to the express or implied approval of the Secretary. (See 'Amended Rules and Regulations to be \n\n[249 U.S. 308, 311]\n\u00a0\n Observed in the Execution of Leases of Indian Allotments,' approved by the Secretary of the Interior March 16, 1905).\n The foregoing provisions were enlarged by the Act of June 25, 1910 ( 36 Stat. 855, 856, c. 431 [Comp. St.  4221]), as follows:\n'That any Indian allotment held under a trust patent may be leased by the allottee for a period not to exceed five years, subject to and in conformity with such rules and regulations as the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe, and the proceeds of any such lease shall be paid to the allottee or his heirs, or expended for his or their benefit, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior.'\n\n And the regulations of the Secretary which were adopted under this grant of power in express terms modified the previous regulations on the subject 'so far as to permit Indian allottees of land held under a trust patent, or the heirs of such allottees who may be deemed by the superintendent in charge or any competency commission to have the requisite knowledge, experience, and business capacity to negotiate lease contracts, to make their own contracts for leasing their lands.' The scope of such regulations is further made clear by the following provision dealing with the rental to result from the lease by the Indian of his allotted land under the power given:\n'The question of consideration, whether a cash rental or share of the crops grown on the land, shall be left to the determination of the lessor.' (Regulations, approved Sept. 19, 1910.)\n\n The right of an allottee under stated conditions to lease and to stipulate for such rental as he deemed adequate, whether in money or crop, having been thus undoubtedly provided for by the statute and the regulations, the only question is, had the capacity of the allottee in this case been recognized conformably to the statute and regulations so as to justify his exercise of the right? That question would seem to be free from difficulty for the following \n\n[249 U.S. 308, 312]\n\u00a0\n reasons: (a) Because in the narrative statement of the testimony on behalf of the plaintiff it is said that, 'Written permission had been given by the government to Mish no to lease his own allotment and he had leased the same for the year 1912'; (b) because there is no denial or controversy as to the correctness of this statement; (c) because the court below in its opinion treated the matter as indisputable by stating, 'Written permission was given him (Mish no) by the government to lease his allotment'; and (d) because the fact thus stated clearly refers to the authority and capacity provided for by the Act of 1910 and the regulations thereunder, that is, not to the authority of the government to lease for the allottee, but to the right to give the allottee permission to lease his allotted land for himself as the result of a conclusion that he had capacity to do so.\n As it results that Mish no, the allottee, had by virtue of the statute of 1910 and resulting regulations the power to make the lease and to stipulate for the rental for which it provided, it follows, as the greater power includes the lesser, that the contract for the sale of the growing crop made with McClain was also within the statute and regulations and excluded from the prohibition of the Act of 1887\n\n\n For the reasons which we have stated we affirm the judgment of the court below which sustanined a like conclusion, although we have not found it necessary to express any opinion as to the correctness of the reasoning by which the court below was controlled in its action.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","132":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMINERALS SEPARATION v.

Hyde, \n242 U.S. 261\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 82.\n The patent has been so frequently described in court proceedings,1 that it will suffice to say of it here, in the \n\n[250 U.S. 336, 339]\n\u00a0\n terms of the specification, that it 'relates to improvements in the concentration of ores, the object being to separate metalliferous material, graphite and the like, from gangue, by means of oils, fatty acids or other substances which have a preferential affinity for metalliferous matter over gangue.'\n The patent contains thirteen claims, which, for the purposes of this opinion, may be conveniently grouped, as follows:\n\n\n (1)\n Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 12, as 'fraction of one per cent. claims,' because they call for the use of that amount of oil on the ore; (2) numbers 5, 6, 7, 8 and 13, as 'oleic acid claims,' because they are limited to the use of oleic acid in a small fraction of 1 per cent. on the ore, 0.02-0.5 per cent.; (3) numbers 9, 10 and 11, as 'small quantity of oil claims'-all three of which were held invalid by the former decision of this court. Only the five 'fraction of one per cent. claims,' are involved in this case.\n The respondent denied the validity of the patent and the claim of infringement.\n The lower courts followed the decision by this court and sustained the patent except as to the three 'small quantity of oil claims.'\n The new evidence introduced on the validity issue is meager in amount, and of a character so unsatisfying that we see no reason for modifying our former conclusion.\n The chief controversy in the case centers about the claim of infringement based upon the use of oil by the respondent in excess of 1 per cent. on (of the weight of) the ore, after the decision of the former case by this court.\n The evidence shows, and counsel now admit, that prior to the decision by this court in December, 1916, the respondent used, in its ore concentration operations, various oils in quantities less than one-half of 1 per cent. on the ore, but that from January 9, 1917, to the time of trial, with the exception of two or three weeks, \n\n[250 U.S. 336, 340]\n\u00a0\n it used oils of a composition which we shall discuss later on, in quantities in excess of 1 per cent. on the ore. In other respects its methodsw ere substantially those of the patent in suit.\n On this showing, the District Court found the patent infringed by the respondent, when it used oil in quantities greater than, as well as when it used it in quantities less than, 1 per cent. on the ore.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held the patent infringed only when the respondent used oil in quantities equal to, or less than, one-half of 1 per cent. on the ore, and it therefore reversed both of the holdings of the District Court, but allowed recovery for the period when less than one- half of 1 per cent. of oil on the ore was used.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals derived its authority to limit the claims to one-half of 1 per cent. on the ore from the construction which it placed upon the following clause of the opinion of this court in the former case, viz.:\n'The patent must be confined to the results obtained by the use of oil within the proportions often described in the testimony and in the claims of the patent as 'critical proportions' 'amounting to a fraction of 1 per cent. on the ore.\"\n\n The reasoning which carried two members of the court to their conclusion was that, as shown by the evidence of the patentees and the argument of their counsel, the amount of oil which is 'critical,' in the sense of marking the point of transition from the processes of the prior art to the process and discovery of the patent, is one-half of 1 per cent. of oil on the ore, and that therefore this court, by using the expression quoted, intended to limit the claims, not to a 'fraction of one per cent.,' but to a 'fraction of one-half of one per cent. on the ore.'\n The specification of the patent points out that the proportion of mineral which floats in the form of froth varies with different ores and with different oily substances \n\n[250 U.S. 336, 341]\n\u00a0\n used and that simple preliminary tests are necessary to determine which oily substance will yield the best results with each ore. Of this feature of the patent this court said:\n'Such variation of treatment must be within the scope of the claims, and the certainty which the law requires in patents is not greater than is reasonable, having regard to their subject-matter. ... The process is one for dealing with a large class of substances and the range of treatment within the terms of the claims, while leaving something to the skill of persons applying the invention, is clearly sufficiently definite to guide those skilled in the art to its successful application, as the evidence abundantly shows. This satisfies the law.'\n\n Thus was it plainly held proper for the patentees to claim a reasonable degree of variation-'within the terms of the claims'-in the amount of oil to be used in the application of their discovery in practice, and that the restricting of the amount to a fraction of 1 per cent. on the ore was reasonable and lawful.\n The two expressions 'critical proportions' and 'amounting to a fraction of one per cent. on the ore' being used, the former derived from the evidence and the latter from the claims of the patent, obviously, to the extent that they differ-if they differ at all-the language of the claims must rule in determining the rights of the patentees.\n While in the former case this court was attempt, to define the scope of the claims, but was considering the patent only from the point of view of the invention and usefulness of the claimed discovery, nevertheless, the language quoted seems to indicate clearly enough that the opinion of the court then was, as it is declared now to be, that as to the claims here involved the patent extends to and covers the use in the process of oils of the patent, in amounts \n\n[250 U.S. 336, 342]\n\u00a0\n equal to any fraction of 1 per cent. on the ore. The oleic acid claims are in terms limited to 0.02-0.5 per cent. on the ore. The Circuit Court of Appeals fell into error in the interpretation which it placed upon our opinion, and its judgment in this respect is reversed.\n Since the case must be retried, there remains to be considered the reversal by the Circuit Court of Appel  of the holding by the District Court that the use of oil by the respondent in excess of 1 per cent. on the ore constituted an infringement of the patent.\n As we have said, prior to the former decision by this court, the respondent used in its ore concentration process less than one-half of 1 per cent. of oil on the ore, and as to such practice infringement is clear, but from January 9, 1917, to the time of trial, with slight exceptions, it used in excess of 1 per cent. on the ore, and it is necessary to consider only the operations during this latter period. The oil used during this period was a compound, varying in composition from time to time, but we agree with the District Court in selecting as typical a mixture made up of 18 per cent. of pine oil, and the remainder of petroleum products or derivatives-12 per cent. of kerosene oil, and 70 per cent. of fuel oil. Of this compound there was used 30 pounds to the ton of ore, which would be 1. 5 per cent. on the ore. As thus stated, without more, it is obvious that the use of such an amount of oil would not infringe the claims of the patent which limit the oil to be used to a fraction of 1 per cent. on the ore.\n But the contention of the petitioners, approved by the District Court, was, and now is, that kerosene and fuel oil were inert and valueless, if not harmful, as used by the respondent in the process, and rendered the recovery less than it would have been if the pine oil only had been used; that they were added solely to carry the content of oil beyond the prescribed fraction of 1 per \n\n[250 U.S. 336, 343]\n\u00a0\n cent. on the ore, in the hope of technically avoiding infringement; and that essentially in its operations the respondent used the process of the patent with 0.27 of 1 per cent. of pine oil on the ore, and therefore infringed it.\n The respondent replied that it was not true that kerosene and fuel oil were inert and useless, and asserted that they were oils of the patent, 'having a preferential affinity for metalliferous matter'; that the patentees by the claims of their patent had limited their exclusive right to the use, in the process, of any oil or oily substance having such an affinity, but in an amount not greater than a fraction of 1 per cent. on the ore, and that therefore the process of the respondent, in which more than 1 per cent. of oil on the ore was used, did not infringe the patent.\n The entire evidence in the Hyde Case was introduced on the trial of this case, and whether the petroleum products or derivatives used by the respondent were oils within the scope of the patent must be determined from the record now before us.\n It is admitted that petroleum products are 'oils having a preferential affinity for metalliferous matter.'\n In each of the four claims of the 'Complete Specification' of the British patent, filed by the same persons who were patentees of the patent in suit, on June 3, 1905, 'petrol' is given as an equivalent of oleic acid in the process. This appears in the statement, repeated in each claim, that the ore and acidified water shall be mixed or agitated with 'a small proportion of an oily substance such as oleic acid or petrol, amounting to a fraction of one per cent. on the ore.' 'Petrol' is the name used in England for gasoline.\n The claims of the patent in suit which we are considering call for the use in the process of an 'oily liquid,' 'an oily substance,' and in the twelfth claim simply of an 'oil.' These expressions are said by Prof. Chandler, \n\n[250 U.S. 336, 344]\n\u00a0\n an expert for the petitioners, much relied on in the Hyde Case and in this, to include petroleum products.\n Higgins, one of the experimenters who discovered the process in suit, and who is much relied upon by the petitioners as an expert witness in both cases, testified as follows in the Hyde Case:\n'Q. Have you since found it possible to use other oils than oleic acid with the result of producing a froth?\n\n'A. Yes.\n\n'Q. What other oils?\n\n'A. I have obtained satisfactory results by the use of petrol and certain proo rtions of distillate of crude petroleum, such as Cosmos oil,'\n\n -and he said 'Cosmos oil' is 'a petroleum distillate.'\n Chapman, an engineer and a witness for the petitioners in the Hyde Case, testified that he had obtained good recoveries in the laboratory and in commercial practice, from the ore of the Braden mine, in Chile, using three pounds of Texas fuel oil to one pound of American wood tar oil per ton of ore. Texas fuel oil is petroleum.\n Greninger, an engineer employed by one of the petitioners in installing its flotation plants, testified in this case that in a mine in British Columbia he used a mixture of oil, 75 per cent. of which was derived from petroleum.\n There is much more of the same character from witnesses for the petitioners, and the evidence of the respondent is strongly to the effect that petroleum products are useful and efficient and have been widely used in the process in laboratory and commercial practice.\n Without quoting more from the record before us, we must conclude that when the patent in suit was obtained, and even until the testimony in the Hyde Case was closed in 1912, petroleum products were recognized by the petitioners, and that they are still used, as oils, efficient and useful in the process of the patent in suit. Much of this evidence is especially impressive because the papers from \n\n[250 U.S. 336, 345]\n\u00a0\n which it is derived were written, and the witnesses testified before the question as to petroleum, now made in this case, was raised or discussed.\n While we thus conclude that petroleum and petroleum products are oils useful in this process of the patent, it is also clear that they are not as highly efficient as pine oil and several other oils and combinations of oils, which, in the nomenclature of the record are called 'frothing oils,' and also that better results would probably have been obtained by the use of less than 1 per cent. on the ore, of pine oil alone, than were obtained by the respondent with that oil in combination with the larger amounts of petroleum products. And this presents the further question necessary to a decision of the case, viz.:\n Does the use of a more efficient, in combination with a less efficient, oil of the patent constitute infringement, where the former is used in an amount within the limits of the claims but the combined amount is in excess of such limit, and when the amount of the more efficient oil used would probably produce better results from the process than are produced with the combination of oils?\n To answer this question requires a consideration of the state of the prior art as it was when the discovery of the patent was made, and of the scope of the claims which we are considering.\n It is always difficult to recover the realities of a situation long past, such as we have here, but it is especially difficult when the importance of the discovery has led, as in this case, to extensive improvements in mechanical appliances for utilizing the invention and to large additions to the knowledge of the adaptability to the process of various oils, singly and in combination.\n We held in the former case that the patentees came late into the field of ore concentration investigation, and that their discovery rests upon a prior art so fully developed that it was 'clear from the record that approach was \n\n[250 U.S. 336, 346]\n\u00a0\n being made slowly, but more and more nearly, to the result which was reached by the patentees of the process in suit in March, 1905,' and that their final step was not a long one.\n Such a patent, in such a field of investigation, must be construed strictly, but candidly and fairly, to give to the patentees the full benefit, but not more, of the disclosure of their discovery which is to become a part of the public stock of knowledge upon the expiration of the patent period, and which was the consideration for the grant to them of a patent monopoly.\n With the state of the prior art in mind, we come to consider the nature and extent of the disclosures of the patent in suit, but only wt h respect to the kinds and quantities of oil which may be used in the process.\n The specification recites that the invention of the patent relates to an 'improvement' upon prior processes employed in ore concentration 'by means of oils, fatty acids, or other substances which have a preferential affinity for metalliferous matter over gangue.'\n Next come the specific disclosures required by the patent law (R. S.  4888 [Comp. St.  9432]), which are intended to describe the advance which the patentees claimed to have made from the prior art Cattermole agglomeration of metalliferous matter into granules, which separate from the gangue, and sink to the bottom of the pulp under treatment, to the discovery of the patent in suit, with its metal bearing froth, rising to the surface of the pulp. Here is the essence of the discovery, and it is announced in these terms:\n'We have found that if the proportion of oily substance be considerably reduced, say to a fraction of one per cent. on the ore, granulation ceases to take place, and after vigorous agitation there is a tendency for a part of the oil-coated metalliferous matter to rise to the surface of the pulp in the form of a froth or scum.' \n\n[250 U.S. 336, 347]\n\u00a0\n This is followed by the description of three 'factors' on which 'this tendency is dependent,' viz., slight acidification, heat, and fine pulverization of the ore, and then the disclosure concludes with the statement that the proportion of mineral which floats in the form of froth varies with different ores and with different oily substances, and that a simple preliminary test is necessary to determine which oily substance yields the proportion of froth or scum desired.\n\n The only additional statement contained in the specification, which is in the nature of a disclosure, is found in the description of the example of the application of the invention, in which it is stated that the 'froth or scum' derives its power of flotation mainly from the inclusion of air bubbles introduced into the mass by agitation, such bubbles or air films adhering only to the mineral particles which are coated with oleic acid.\n There remain the claims of the patent, in which the act of Congress requires that the patentee shall 'particularly point out and distinctly claim the ... improvement ... which he claims as his invention or discovery.' And of these this court has said in Keystone Bridge Co. v. Phoenix Iron Co., \n95 U.S. 274\n, 278 (24 L. Ed. 344):\n'But the courts have no right to enlarge a patent beyond the scope of its claim as allowed by the Patent Office. ... As patents are procured ex parte, the public is not bound by them, but the patentees are. And the latter cannot show that their invention is broader than the terms of their claim; or, if broader, they must be held to have surrendered the surplus to the public.'\n\n And in White v. Dunbar, \n119 \nU.S. 47, 52\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 72, 74 (30 L. Ed. 303):\n'The claim is a statutory requirement, prescribed for the very purpose of making the patentee define precisely what his invention is; and it is unjust to the public, as well as an evasion of the law, to construe it in a manner different from the plain import of its terms.' \n\n[250 U.S. 336, 348]\n\u00a0\n And see Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Co., \n243 \nU.S. 502, 510\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 416, L. R. A. 1917E, 1187, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 959.\n\n Since we are concerned only with the five 'fraction of one per cent. claims,' and since the question we are discussing relates only to the use of petroleum products, we need consider them only with respect to the amount and character of the oil prescribed, and, as they are substantially identical, we quote the first as typical:\n'The herein described process of concentrating ores which consists in mixing powdered ore with water, adding a small proportion of oily liquid having a preferential affinity for metalliferous matter ( amounting to a fraction of one per cent. on the ore), agitating the mixture until the oil-coated mineral matter forms into a froth, and separating th froth from the remainder by flotation.'\n\n The first three claims declare that, so far as oil is concerned, the discovery resides or consists in 'adding a small proportion of an oily liquid having a preferential affinity for metalliferous matter, amounting to a fraction of one per cent. on the ore'; the fourth claim differs only in substituting the word 'substance' for 'liquid' in the first three; and the twelfth claim provides for carrying out the process with 'oil in water containing a fraction of one per cent. of oil on the ore.'\n From this consideration of the terms of the patent as written, it is apparent that it makes no differentiation whatever, either in the claims or in the specification, among the oils having a preferential affinity for metalliferous matter, and that its disclosure, to which the petitioners must be limited, is that, when a fraction of 1 per cent. on the ore of any such oil is used in the manner prescribed, there will be produced a metal- bearing froth, the result of the process. No notice is given to the public, and it is nowhere 'particularly pointed out' in the claims, that some oils or combination of oils, having a preferential affinity for metalliferous matter, are more \n\n[250 U.S. 336, 349]\n\u00a0\n useful than others in the process, or that some may be used successfully and some not, or that some are 'frothing oils,' a designation not appearing in the patent, and that some are not. The patentees discovered the described process for producing the result or effect, the metal- bearing froth, but they did not invent that result or froth-their patent is on the process, it is not and cannot be on the result-and the scope of their right is limited to the means they have devised and described as constituting the process. Corning v. Burden, 15 How. 252, 268; Le Roy v. Tatham, 14 How. 156, 175; Fuller v. Yentzer, \n94 U.S. 288\n; Robinson on Patents,  149.\n The patent in suit was applied for in this country on May 29, 1905, within a few weeks after the discovery which it embodies was made, and whether, from haste or lack of investigation, from the necessity of meeting the exigencies imposed by the prior art or from a desire to make the claims as comprehensive as possible, this discussion of its terms makes it clear that the only disclosure as to the kind and amount of oil which the patentees made to the public as necessary to the practicing of their process is that it must be an oil or oily substance, or oily liquid having a 'preferential affinity for metalliferous matter,' and that it shall be limited in amount 'to a fraction of one per cent. on the ore.'\n It is argued that the provision of the claims that the mixture prescribed, of oil, water and ore, shall be agitated until the oil-coated mineral matter forms into a froth serves to differentiate the 'frothing oils' from others having the required preferential affinity for metalliferous matter, but which, when agitated in the mixtures, may not produce the characteristic froth, if any such there are, and that a proper construction of the patent limits it to such 'frothing oils,' and renders the use of them in a fraction of 1 per cent. on the ore an infringement when used with 'non-frothing oils' having the required affinity in \n\n[250 U.S. 336, 350]\n\u00a0\n amounts sufficient to make the combination exceed the quantity limit of the patent.\n To give such a construction to the patent would subordinate the clear description contained in it of what are oils of the process, to an implied and vague description and classification which would leave the whole subject again at large, to become a field for further experimentation, without definition in the patent of what oils or froths would satisfy it. So interpreted, the patent could not reasonably be said to contain a disclosure of the discovered process in the 'full, clear, concise and exact terms' required by law (R. S.  4888 [Comp. St.  9432]), and the claims might conceivably be said to fall short of 'particularly pointing out and distinctlyc laiming' any discovery at all within the meaning of the act of Congress.\n Thus when to our former conclusion that the respondent used an efficient oil of the patent we add the further conclusion, derived from a study of its terms, that the patentees failed to differentiate among the oils described in the patent, we must conclude that it is impossible for the courts to distinguish among them, as more or less efficient in the process, without amending the claims of the patent, and this they are powerless to do.\n We are confirmed in the conclusion thus arrived at by the evidence which the patentees in the Hyde Case, petitioners in this, introduced to show that their discovered process could not be made operative when more than a fraction of 1 per cent. of oil on the ore was used, and that the use of a greater amount would not produce the typical froth which results from it-this without differentiation among the oils described in the patent, save as to their varying adaptability to different ores.\n Thus, Ballantyne, a metallurgist and the patent agent who prepared the patent specifications for the petitioners, when called by them as an expert witness, testifies to intimate relations with the patentees and with their in \n\n[250 U.S. 336, 351]\n\u00a0\n vestigations before and since the patented discovery was made, and says:\n'I have never seen the agitation-froth process successfully carried out by the use of an amount of oil equal to practically 1 per cent. by weight on the ore, and in my opinion 0.9999 per cent. of oil would not be a proper quantity (that is to say, a suitable and economical quantity), as contemplated by the patent, and would not, therefore, be a suitable fraction of 1 per cent., as contemplated by the patent.'\n\n Liebmann, an expert much relied upon by the petitioners, testified:\n'Q. I understand from your answer ... that you have never in your operation ... obtained any floating mineral-bearing froth when using an amount of oil, or other selective agents, amounting to more than 1 per cent. of the weight on the ore. In order that there may be no misunderstanding, will you state whether I have understood you rightly?\n\n'A. That is my recollection.'\n\n John Ballot, one of the patentees, testified that he had never seen a froth of the character produced by the patent in suit using a pulp containing more than 1 per cent. of oil.\n There is much more of similar import in the record. This, however, will suffice, adding only the record of a remarkable incident which occurred in this court during the argument of the Hyde Case by Mr. Kenyon for the petitioners:\n'Mr. Justice McReynolds: I would like to ask you when in this process of reducing oil your invention came into existence?\n\n'Mr. Kenyon: At about one-half of 1 per cent. of oil.\n\n'Mr. Justice McReynolds: Before you got to the one-half of 1 per cent. did you have any invention? \n\n[250 U.S. 336, 352]\n\u00a0\n 'Mr. Kenyon: We were passing from the region of Cattermole, which was a distinct--\n\n'Mr. Justice McReynolds: I want to know when your invention came into existence.\n\n'Mr. Kenyon: This invention was not reached, I should say, from those figures until about 0.5, that is one-half of 1 per cent. of oil was reached.\n\n'Mr. Justice McReynolds: At 1 per cent. you had no invention?\n\n'Mr. Kenyon: No.\n\n'Mr. Justice McReynolds: At one-half of 1 per cent. you did have invention?\n\n'Mr. Kenyon: It began to come. Remote, but it began to come. At 0.3 of 1 per cent. the float vastly increased. At 0.1 of 1 per cent. the float again vastly increased.\n\n'Mr. Justice McReynolds: When this float has more than one-half of 1 per cent. of oil it does not infringe?\n\n'Mr. Kenyon: It does not infringe.\n\n'Mr. Justice Pitney: What have you to say in answer to what Mr. Scott said the other day to the effect that 1.8 per cent., or perhaps more, of oil, would give the same result with increased agitation?\n\n'Mr. Williams: Absolutely no.\n\n'Mr. Kenyon: It would not.'\n\n While parties should not be held rigidly to statements made by theirc ounsel in the stress of argument, even when replying to questions from members of the court, nevertheless these statements from leading counsel in charge of the Hyde Case and of this case are impressive and significant.\n This and much more of like character in the record brings us unhesitatingly to the conclusion that the scope we have given to the patent, based upon an interpretation of the language of the claims, is justified also by the evidence in the case, and that it is, in fact, that which the petitioners and their counsel, until very recently, placed \n\n[250 U.S. 336, 353]\n\u00a0\n upon it in full confidence, that the essence of the discovery lay to such an extent in the use of a small amount of oil, such as is described in the patent, that the result could not be obtained with more than a fraction of 1 per cent. on the ore.\n It must be added that the evidence is far from satisfying that the results of the respondent's process was, in fact, that peculiarly superior quality of metal-bearing froth characteristic of the patented process when worked with a fraction of 1 per cent. on the ore. The evidence, otherwise doubtful on the point, is rendered especially so by the testimony introduced by the petitioners, and not contradicted, that a computation on the basis of the tonnage of ore treated by the respondent shows that if the process as practiced by it after January 9, 1917, had been used through the year it would have involved a loss of over a million dollars in increased cost of oil and in diminished recoveries, as compared with what the results of operation would have been for the same time using the process of the patent as practiced by the petitioners. It is difficult to see how a process so wasteful and inefficient as that of the respondent is thus proved to be can be other than substantially different from that of the petitioners.\n It is vaguely suggested in the testimony for the petitioners that there was some peculiarity in the composition of the ore of the respondent, or in the treatment of it, which resulted in the presence of 'clayey gangue slimes' which absorbed an unusual quantity of oil, and that this contributed to render it possible to produce the results of the patented process when more than the prescribed fraction of 1 per cent. of oil on the ore was used.\n It is hard to see how this, if true, would be of value to the petitioners, but the evidence is quite too indefinite in character and meager in extent to be accepted as the basis for the judicial determination of such a claim.\n The respondent contends that the disclaimer filed by \n\n[250 U.S. 336, 354]\n\u00a0\n the petitioners with respect to the three claims held invalid by the decision of this court in the former case was so delayed and is so evasive in form that it is invalid, and that, for this reason, the petitioners should not be permitted to further prosecute this suit, under the provisions of R. S.  4917, 4922 (Comp. St.  9462, 9468).\n The decision holding the three claims invalid was rendered on December 11, 1916, and the disclaimer was recorded on the 28th day of March, 1917. Having regard to the fact that the owners of the patent in suit resided in a foreign country, and to the wartime conditions of communication then prevailing, the entry required by law was not 'unreasonably neglected or delayed.' While the wording of the disclaimer borders on finesse, we do not think it can be interpreted as giving any rights under the patent greater than may be legitimately obtained under the claims held valid, and we therefore deem it sufficient to meet the requirements of the statutes cited.\n It results that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals that the respondent infringed the patent only when using one-half of 1 per cent. or less of oil on the ore must be reversed, but that its implied holding that the use made by respondent of petroleum products and pine oil in excess of 1 per cent. on the ore did not constitute infringement must be sustained. The cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedins in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed in part. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] British Ore Concentration Syndicate, Ltd., v.

SEBASTIAN COUNTY(1919)\nNo. 149\nArgued: Decided: March 3, 1919\n\n\n\n Messrs. John H. Vaughn, of Fort Smith, Ark., and B. R. Davidson, of Fayetteville, Ark., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Thomas B. Pryor, of Fort Smith, Ark., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Article 16,  1, Constitution of Arkansas (1874), declares: 'Nor shall any county, city, town or other municipality ever issue any interest- bearing evidences of indebtedness.' \n\n[249 U.S. 170, 171]\n\u00a0\n During 1889 (or about that time) Sebastian county, for the benefit of Greenwood district, issued certain noninterest-bearing warrants payable 'out of any money in the treasury appropriated for ordinary purposes' of which plaintiff in error became lawful holder and owner. It sued upon them in the United States Circuit Court, Western District of Arkansas, and obtained a judgment, January 26, 1891, for $13,703.29, 'with interest at the rate of six per cent. per annum from this date until paid together with all its costs in and about this case laid out and expended.' So far as not satisfied, this was revived in 1900 and again in 1910; and at different dates from 1896 to 1914 the county made payments thereon aggregating its face value together with six per cent. interest reckoned to March 21, 1893, and all costs.\n An act of the Arkansas Legislature approved March 21, 1893 (Acts Ark. 1893, p. 145), provides: 'No judgment rendered or to be rendered against any county in the state on county warrants or other evidences of county indebtedness shall bear any interest after the passage of this act;' and relying upon this inhibition the county claimed that the above-mentioned payments fully discharged the judgment against it. Thereupon, May 23, 1916, plaintiff in error petitioned the court below for a mandamus to compel payment of alleged accrued interest. Answering, the county denied further liability and then asked for an order requiring that the judgment be satisfied of record. The trial court refused a mandamus and directed satisfaction as prayed. Whether plaintiff in error's rights under the federal Constitution would be violated by giving effect to the statute is the only question presented for our consideration. The Supreme Court of the state sustained its validity in Read v. Mississippi County, 69 Ark. 365, 63 S. W. 807, 86 Am. St. Rep. 202, where the precise points here involved were presented.\n The two revivals in 1900 and 1910 kept the judgment \n\n[249 U.S. 170, 172]\n\u00a0\n alive and permitted its enforcement beyond the periods fixed by statutes of limitation. Their entry gave it no greater efficacy than it possessed when first rendered.\n Plaintiff in error maintains that the challenged act conflicts with section 10, art. 1, of the Constitution and also the Fourteenth Amendment, forbidding a state from depriving any person of property without due process of law; but we think the contrary is settled by our opinion in Morley v. Lake Shore Railway Co., \n146 \nU.S. 162, 168\n, 171 S., 13 Sup. Ct. 54, 56 (36 L. Ed. 925). There the judgment directed that interest should accrue from its entry without mentioning any rate, the statutory one then being seven per centum; later another act fixed six per centum for the future and the debtor claimed benefit of it while the creditor maintained that to permit this would violate both the Contract Clause and Fourteenth Amendment. Through Mr. Justice Shiras we said:\n'After the cause of action, whether a tort or a broken contract, not itself prescribing interest till payment, shall have been merged into a judgment, whether interest shall accrue upon the judgment is a matter not of contract between the parties, but of legislative discretion, which is free, so far as the Constitution of the United States is concerned, to provide for interest as a penalty or liquidated damages for the nonpayment of the judgment, or not to do so. When such provision is made by statute, the owner of the judgment is, of course, entitled to the interest so prescribed until payment is received, or until the state shall, in the exercise of its discretion, declare that such interest shall be changed or cease to accrue. Should the statutory damages for nonpayment of a judgment be determined by a state, either in whole or in part, the owner of a judgment will be entitled to receive and have a vested right in the damages which shall have accrued up to the date of the legislative change; but after that time his rights as to interest as damages are, as when he first obtained his judg ment, \n\n[249 U.S. 170, 173]\n\u00a0\n just what the Legislature chooses to declare. He has no contract whatever on the subject with the defendant in the judgment, and his right is to receive, and the defendant's obligation is to pay, as damages, just what the state chooses to prescribe. ... The discretion exercised by the Legislature in prescribing what, if any, damages shall be paid by way of compensation for delay in the payment of judgments is based on reasons of public policy, and is altogether outside the sphere of privace contracts. ... The further contention of the plaintiff in error, that he has been deprived of his property without due process ob law, can be more readily disposed of. If, as we have seen, the plaintiff has actually received on account of his judgment all that he is entitled to receive, he cannot be said to have been deprived of his property.'\n\n See Barnitz v. Beverly, \n163 \nU.S. 118, 129\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 1042.\n It is insisted that as the judgment now under consideration specified a definite interest rate while the one in Morley v. Lake Shore Railway Co., supra, did not, the doctrine there approved is inapplicable. To this we cannot assent; mere recital of a particular rate does not change the nature of the charge as a penalty or liquidated damages.\n It should be noted that the county warrants, upon which plaintiff in error sued, bore no interest; if the parties had lawfully stipulated therefor, a different question would have been presented.\n The judgment of the court below is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","134":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMISSOURI PAC. RY. CO. v. STATE OF KANSAS(1919)\nNo. 14\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1919\n\n\n\n Messrs. William P. Waggener and B. P. Waggener, both of Atchison, Kan ., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[248 U.S. 276, 278]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James P. Coleman, of Topeka, Kan., and Wayne B. Wheeler, of Washington, D. C., for the State of Kansas.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n To avoid penalties sought to be imposed upon it for illegally carrying intoxicating liquors from another state into Kansas, the defendant railroad, plaintiff in error, asserted as follows: (1) That the state law was void as an attempt by the state to regulate commerce and thus usurp the authority alone possessed by Congress; (2) that if such result was sought to be avoided because of power seemingly conferred upon the state by the act of Congress known as the Webb-Kenyon Law (Act March 1, 1913, c. 90, 37 Stat. 699 [Comp. St. 1916,  8739]), such act was void for repugnancy to the Constitution of the United States because in excess of the power of Congress to regulate commerce and as a usurpation of rights reserved by the Constitution to the \n\n[248 U.S. 276, 279]\n\u00a0\n states; (3) because, even if the Webb-Kenyon Law was held not to be repugnant to the Constitution for the reasons stated, nevertheless, that assumed law afforded no basis for the exertion of the state power in question, because it had never been enacted by Congress conformably to the Constitution, and therefore, in legal intendment, must be treated as nonexisting.\n It is conceded that the ruling of this court, sustaining the Webb- Kenyon Law as a valid exercise by Congress of its power to regulate commerce (Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland Ry. Co., \n242 \nU.S. 311, 325\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 180, L. R. A. 1917B, 1218, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 845), disposes of the first two contentions and leaves only the third for consideration. In fact, in argument it is admitted that such question alone is relied upon. The proposition is this, that as the provision of the Constitution exacting a two-thirds vote of each house to pass a bill over a veto means a two-thirds vote, not of a quorum of each house, but of all the members of the body, the Webb-Kenyon Act was never enacted into law, because after its veto by the President it received in the Senate only a two-thirds vote of the Senators present (a quorum), which was less than two-thirds of all the members elected to and entitled to sit in that body.\n Granting the premise of fact as to what the face of the journal disclosed, and assuming for the sake of the argument (Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107, 143\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312; Rainey v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 310, 317\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 429) that the resulting question would be justiciable, we might adversely dispose of it by merely referring to the practice to the contrary which has prevailed from the beginning. In view, however, of the importance of the subject, and with the purpose not to leave unnoticed the grave misconceptions involved in the arguments by which the proposition relied upon is sought to be supported, we come briefly to dispose of the subject.\n The proposition concerns clause 2 of section 7 of article 1 of \n\n[248 U.S. 276, 280]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution, providing that in case a bill passed by Congress is disapproved by the President--\n'... he shall return it, with his objections to that house in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the objections at large on their journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such reconsideration two-thirds of that house shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together with the objections, to the other house, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two- thirds of that house, it shall become a law. ...'\n\n The extent of the vote exacted being certain, the question depends upon the significance of the words 'that house'; that is, whether those words relate to the two houses by which the bill was passed and upon which full legislative power is conferred by the Constitution in case of the presence of a quorum (a majority of the members of each house; section 5, art. 1); or whether they refer to a body which must be assumed to embrace, not a majority, but all its members for the purpose of estimating the two- thirds vote required. As the context leaves no doubt that the provision was dealing with the two houses as organized and entitled to exert legislative power, it follows that to state the contention is to adversely dispose of it.\n But, in addition, the erroneous assumption upon which the contention proceeds is plainly demonstrated by a consideration of the course of proceedings in the convention which framed the Constitution, since, as pointed out by Curtis (History of the Constitution, vol. 2, p. 267 note), it appears from those proceedings that the veto provision as originally offered was changed into the form in which it now stands after the adoption of the article fixing the quorum of the two houses for the purpose of exerting legislative power and with the object of giving the power to override a veto to the bodies as thus organized. A further confirmation of this view is afforded by the fact that there is no indication in the Constitutions and laws \n\n[248 U.S. 276, 281]\n\u00a0\n of the several states existing before the Constitution of the United States was framed that it was deemed that the legislative body which had power to pass a bill over a veto was any other than the legislative body organized conformably to law for the purpose of enacting legislation, and hence that the majority fixed as necessary to override a veto was the required majority of the body in whom the power to legislate was lodged. Indeed, the absolute identity between the body having authority to pass legislation and the body having the power in case of a veto to override it was clearly shown by the Constitution of New York, since that Constitution, in providing for the exercise of the right to veto by the council, directed that the objections to the bill be transmitted for reconsideration to the Senate or House in which it originated. 'but if, after such reconsideration, two-thirds of the Senate or House of Assembly shall, notwithstanding such objections, agree to pass the same, it shall be ... sent to the other branch of the Legislature, where it shall also be reconsidered, and if approved by two-thirds of the members, present, shall be a law,' thus identifying the bodies embraced by the words 'Senate' and 'House' and definitely fixing the two-thirds majority required in each as two-thirds of the members present.\n The identity between the provision of article 5 of the Constitution, giving the power by a two-thirds vote to submit amendments, and the requirements we are considering as to the two-thirds vote necessary to override a veto makes the practice as to the one applicable to the other.\n At the first session of the first Congress in 1789 a consideration of the provision authorizing the submission of amendments necessarily arose in the submission by Congress of the First ten amendments to the Constitution embodying a bill of rights. They were all adopted and submitted by each house organized as a legislative body \n\n[248 U.S. 276, 282]\n\u00a0\n pursuant to the Constitution, by less that the vote which would have been necessary had the constitutional provision been given the significance now attributed to it. Indeed, the resolutions by which the action of the two houses was recorded demonstrate that they were formulated with the purpose of refuting the contention now made. The Senate Record was as follows:\n'Resolved: That the Senate do concur in the resolve of the House of Representatives on 'articles to be proposed to the Legislatures of the states as amendments to the Constitution of the United States,' with amendments; two-thirds of the Senators present concurring therein.' 1st Cong. (1st Sess.) September 9, 1789, Senate Journal, 77.\n\n And the course of action in the House and the record made in that body is shown by a message from the House to the Senate which was spread on the Senate Journal as follows:\n'A message from the House of Representatives. Mr. Beckley, their clerk, brought up a resolve of the House of this date, to agree to the ... amendments proposed by the Senate to 'Articles of amendment to be proposed to the Legislatures of the several states as amendments to the Constitution of the United States,' ... ; two- thirds of the members present concurring on each vote. ...' 1st Cong. (1st Sess.) Sept. 21, 1789, Senate Journal, 83.\n\n When it is considered that the chairman of the committee in charge of the amendments for the House was Mr. Madison, and that both branches of Congress contained many members who had participated in the deliberations of the convention or in the proceedings which led to the ratification of the Constitution, and that the whole subject was necessarily vividly present in the minds of those who dealt with it, the convincing effect of the action cannot be overstated. \n\n[248 U.S. 276, 283]\n\u00a0\n But this is not all, for the Journal of the Senate contains further evidence that the character of the two-thirds vote exacted by the Constitution (that is, two-thirds of a quorum) could not have been overlooked, since that Journal shows that at the very time the amendments just referred to were under consideration there were also pending other proposed amendments, dealing with the treaty and lawmaking power. Those concerning the treaty-making power provided that a two-thirds vote of all the members (instead of that proportion of a quorum) should be necessary to ratify a treaty dealing with enumerated subjects, and exacted even a larger proportionate vote of all the members in order to ratify a treaty dealing with other mentioned subjects; and those dealing with the lawmaking power required that a two-thirds (instead of a majority) vote of a quorum should be necessary to pass a law concerning specified subjects.\n The construction which was thus given to the Constitution in dealing with a matter of such vast importance, and which was necessarily sanctioned by the states and all the people, has governed as to every amendment to the Constitution submitted from that day to this. This is not disputed, and we need not stop to refer to the precedents demonstrating its accuracy. The settled rule, however, was so clearly and aptly stated by the Speaker, Mr. Reed, in the House, on the passage in 1898 of the amendment to the Constitution providing for the election of Senators by vote of the people, that we quote it. The ruling was made under these circumstances: When the vote was announced, yeas, 184, and nays, 11, in reply to an inquiry from the floor as to whether such vote was a compliance with the two-thirds rule fixed by the Constitution, as it did not constitute a two-thirds vote of all the members elected, the speaker said:\n'The question is one that has been so often decided that it seems hardly necessary to dwell upon it. The provision \n\n[248 U.S. 276, 284]\n\u00a0\n of the Constitution says 'two-thirds of both houses.' What constitutes a house? A quorum of the membership, a majority, one-half and one more. That is all that is necessary to constitute a house to do all the business that comes before the House. Among the business that comes before the House is the reconsideration of a bill which has been vetoed by the President; another is a proposed amendment to the Constitution; and the practice is uniform in both cases that if a quorum of the House is present the House is constituted, and two- thirds of those voting are sufficient in order to accomplish the object. ...' 5 Hinds' Precedents of the House of Representatives, pp. 1009-1010.\n\n This occurrence demonstrates that there is no ground for saying that the adherence to the practice settled in both houses in 1789 resulted from a mere blind application of an existing rule, a conclusion which is also clearly manifested, as to the Senate, by proceedings in that body in 1861 where, on the passage of a pending amendment to the Constitution, as the result of an inquiry made by Mr. Trumbull relative to the vote required to pass it, it was determined by the Senate by a vote of 33 to 1 that two- thirds of a quorum only was essential. 36 Cong. (2d Sess.) March 2, 1861, Senate Journal, 383.\n In consequence of the identity in principle between the rule applicable to amendments to the Constitution and that controlling in passing a bill over a veto, the rule of two-thirds of a quorum has been universally applied as to the two-thirds vote essential to pass a bill over a veto. In passing from the subject, however, we again direct attention to the fact that in both cases the continued application of the rule was the result of no mere formal following of what had gone before but came from conviction expressed, after deliberation, as to its correctness by many illustrious men.\n While there is no decision of this court covering the subject, \n\n[248 U.S. 276, 285]\n\u00a0\n in the state courts of last resort the question has arisen and been passed upon, resulting in every case in the recognition of the principle that, in the absence of an express command to the contrary, the two-thirds vote of the house required to pass a bill over a veto is the two-thirds of a quorum of the body as empowered to perform other legislative duties. Warehouse v. McIntoch, 1 Ala. App. 407, 56 South. 102; State v. McBride, 4 Mo. 303, 29 Am. Dec. 636; Southworth v. Railroad, 2 Mich. 287; Smith v. Jennings, 67 S. C. 324, 45 S. E. 821; Green v. Weller, 32 Miss. 650. We say that the decisions have been without difference, for the insistence that the ruling in Minnesota ex rel. Eastland v. Gould, 31 Minn. 189, 17 N. W. 276, is to the contrary is a wholly mistaken one, since the decision in that case was that, as the state Constitution required a vote of the majority of all the members elected to the house to pass a law, the two- thirds vote necessary to override a veto was a two-thirds vote of the same body.\n Any further consideration of the subject is unnecessary, and our order must be, and is,\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","135":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMISSOURI, K. & T.

Winger and Arthur Miller, both of Kansas City, Mo., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In June, 1900, the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company issued bills of lading to shipper's order covering 27 carloads of grain to be shipped from Kansas City, Missouri, to Galveston, Texas. No grain was in fact delivered to it for shipment; but before the fraud was discovered, the alleged shipper transferred the bills of lading to Hutchings, Sealy & Co., who made advances thereon. The advances were not fully repaid, and in 1905 they brought suit against the railroad in a state district court of Kansas. The railroad defended on the ground that since the bills of lading had been delivered in Missouri, the transaction was governed by the Missouri law and that under the law of that state, the railroad was not liable. For more than eight years the record contained no suggestion of a federal question, the case having meanwhile been passed upon twice by the Supreme Court of Kansas. Railway Co. v. Hutchings, 78 Kan. 758, 99 Pac. 230; Hutchings v. Railway Co., 84 Kan. 479, 114 Pac. 1077, 41 L. R. A. (N. S.) 500. Thereafter, in 1913, the railroad presented the claim that the transaction was governed by the federal law, and that, by it, the defendant was not liable. The Supreme Court of Kansas, apparently as a matter of state practice, declared that the contention came too late to be considered, and entered judgment for the plaintiff. Hutchings, Sealy & Co. v. Missouri, K. & T. R. Co., 98 Kan. 225, 158 Pac. 62. The case comes here on writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1156 [Comp.

In his amended petition he alleged that during the years 1903 to 1914, inclusive, he invented the tool in question, which was adapted to be used 'as a reefing iron on the decks, sides and bottoms of vessels where wood caulking is done'; that he entered the employment of the government as a wood caulker in a navy yard on March 26, 1913, and continued therein until July 16, 1914; 'that during the month of May, 1914, your petitioner, after expending a great deal of time, labor and study, completed his invention' of the tool afterwards patented; and that during the hours of his employment by the government he did not do any work upon his invention, but that such work as was performed upon it subsequent to March 26, 1913, when he entered the government employ, was performed at his home during his absence from duty in the navy yard. For the extensive use which the government had made of the tool he prayed for compensation, which had been demanded and refused.\n The appellant can maintain such a suit, if at all, only by warrant of the act of Congress, approved June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. 851, c. 423 [Comp. St.  9465]). This act provides that whenever any invention described in and covered by a patent from the United States shall hereafter be used by the United States without the license of the owner thereof or lawful \n\n[249 U.S. 487, 489]\n\u00a0\n right to use the same, such owner may recover reasonable compensation for such use by suit in the Court of Claims.\n Of the three provisos in the act the third one is applicable to this case and reads:\n'And provided further, (3) that the benefits of this act shall not inure to any patentee, who, when he makes such claim is in the employment or service of the government of the United States; or the assignee of any such patentee; nor shall this act apply to any device discovered or invented by such employe during the time of his employment or service.'\n\n The appellant was not actually in the employ of the government when he made his claim by bringing suit, but the Court of Claims dismissed his petition for want of jurisdiction on the ground that it showed on its face that the device was discovered during the time he was in the employment or service of the government, and that therefore the case fell within the third proviso of the act.\n This decision is so obviously right that discussion of it would be superfluous. The act of Congress must be read 'according to the natural and obvious import of the language, without resorting to subtle and forced construction for the purpose of either limiting or extending its operation.' United States v. Temple, \n105 U.S. 97\n, 99 (26 L. Ed. 967). No matter what the appellant may have done prior to May, 1914, it was in that month, he avers, that he completed his invention, and during the whole of that month he was in the employment or service of the government. To give the effect contended for to the allegation that the appellant confined his work on his invention to the hours when he was not actually on duty, but while he was in the government employ, would be to amend the statute, not to construe or interpret it.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","137":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMT ST MARY'S CEMETERY ASS'N v. MULLINS(1919)\nNo. 56\nArgued: Decided: January 27, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[248 U.S. 501, 502]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. Moore and Mr. Clarence S. Palmer, both of Kansas City, Mo., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Matthew A. Fyke, of Kansas City, Mo., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was begun in the circuit court of Jackson county, Mo., to enforce the liens of tax bills upon land of the Mt. St. Mary's Cemetery Association. The tax bills were assessed in part payment of the cost of two district sewers constructed in a sewer district in Kansas City Mo. The Mt. St. Mary's Cemetery Association is a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Missouri for the purpose of acquiring and maintaining a cemetery, subdividing it into lots, selling, disposing of, and managing the same. The net proceeds after providing for expenses and a maintenance fund are applied to the support of Catholic orphan asylums.\n The case has been three times in the Supreme Court of Missouri. In 239 Mo. 681, 144 S. W. 109, it was held that the cemetery land was liable to assessment under the Constitution and laws of Missouri and the charter of Kansas City. In 259 Mo. 142, 168 S. W. 685, the court held that the land was chargeable with its share of the cost of constructing the sewer; that the holder of a lot in the cemetery had no title or interest in the lot except a mere easement or burial right subordinate to the ownership of the cemetery by the corporation; that the special tax bills were properly issued against the entire grounds of the cemetery; that fraud in \n\n[248 U.S. 501, 503]\n\u00a0\n laying out the sewer district, if such there were, was not a defense to the action on the tax bills unless the alleged fraud was known to the contractor who did the work. In the third case, 268 Mo. 691, 187 S. W. 1169, the court affirmed a judgment in favor of Mullins against the Cemetery Association, holding that the presumption was in favor of the reasonableness of an ordinance which included a cemetery in the sewer district, and assessed its property with the cost of lateral sewers laid in the alleys and streets adjacent to the cemetery, and that such presumption must be satisfactorily overcome by proof in order to be defeated; that when it was shown that the sewer for which the tax bills were issued served to carry away the surface water in the cemetery, and there was no evidence that the sewers were not beneficial in the sanitation of the cemetery, it would be presumed that the city council was fully informed upon the subject, and that its ordinance was reasonable; that the tax, though large, must stand in the absence of a showing that it was unreasonable; that it was not reversible error to exclude evidence that the city in two other cases had made cemetery associations separate sewer districts in the absence of a showing that this was done under a state of facts like those then presented; that such assessments required no notice of the proceedings unless required by some charter, ordinance, or statutory provision; that the sewer tax bills could be issued against the land in its entirety, such ownership being in the Association.\n So far as the judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri turns upon matters of state law it is conclusive. The final judgment is here upon writ of error because of the contention that it violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution in that its effect is to deprive the plaintiff in error of its property without due process of law, and to deny to it the equal protection of the laws. In passing upon the case the Supreme Court of Missouri, \n\n[248 U.S. 501, 504]\n\u00a0\n in the decision under review, found that the sewer district contained about 407 acres; that the Cemetery Association owned about 34 acres of land in said district which was assessed for sewer purposes; that the effect of the sewers was to drain the surface water from some of the land of the Association; that there were no openings in the sewer pipes for house connections, but the evidence showed that such openings were often made by the plumbers when the connections were made; that the grading contractor in grading a street on the west side of the cemetery, made a ten-foot fill near the northwest corner of the cemetery, and placed a ten- inch pipe so as to lead the water from the cemetery into the manhole at that point, thus preventing the formation of a pond; that there are two water-closets in the cemetery grounds not connecting with these sewers; that the Association has an eight-inch pipe about 400 feet long laid in the cemetery for the purpose of drawing the water to the west; that about one-half of the land in the cemetery had been disposed of in lots for burial purposes. Other facts, not essential to be considered in the disposition of the Federal questions were found.\n The plaintiff in error contends that it was deprived of its property without due process of law in as much as about one-half of the tract of 34 acres belonging to the Cemetery Association had before the assessment been conveyed for burial lots; that the assessment against the entire tract had the effect to impose a lien upon much of its property arbitrarily as the burial lots had been conveyed to others. But the Supreme Court of Missouri held that the fee in the title to the burial lots, which had been sold or leased, was still in the Association, with an easement of the right of burial in the lot purchasers. We see no deprivation of due process of law in this holding, making the ownership of the Association the subject of assessment. The right of burial, which was all that the lot purchasers or lessees \n\n[248 U.S. 501, 505]\n\u00a0\n acquired, for obvious reasons could not be put upon the market and sold to pay assessments. The Association had a title which the court held might be and was the subject of assessment.\n It is urged that the Cemetery Association was not benefited by the assessment. But the court found, with evidence to support its conclusion, that the sewers served to carry away surface water; and that there was no evidence to show that the cemetery would not have been benefited as to sanitation as a result of the construction of the sewers. It is well settled that unless such assessment is arbitrary and unreasonable the extent of the benefit, essential to justify the assessment, was a matter within the control of the local authorities. Spencer v. Merchant, \n125 \nU.S. 345, 356\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 921; Wagner v. Baltimore, \n239 U.S. 207\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 66.\n This case is not within the principle of Myles Salt Co. v. Drainage District, \n239 U.S. 478\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 204, where it was sought to embrace property in nowise benefited within the limits of a drainage district.\n It is contended that the Cemetery Association might have been made a sewer district of itself and not have been included in so large a district. Again, this was a matter for the local authorities to decide, and in the absence of arbitrary action, their judgment is conclusive. Spencer v. Merchant, supra; Wagner v. Baltimore, supra; Houck v. Little River District, \n239 U.S. 254\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 58.\n The denial of equal protection of the laws is said to result from the fact that other cemetery grounds had been placed in districts by themselves. But the record fails to show similarity of situation and conditions. In the absence of arbitrary action the making of this assessment upon the district as constituted will be presumed to have been warranted by the circumstances of the case.\n It is insisted that no notice was given, or opportunity to be heard, prior to the creation of the sewer district, and, \n\n[248 U.S. 501, 506]\n\u00a0\n therefore, due process of law was denied. These tax bills were levied upon districts the creation of which was authorized by legislative authority. The record discloses that the owner has had full opportunity to be heard, in judicial proceedings to enforce the tax, and its contentions of arbitrary action and lack of benefits conferred have been considered and decided. This is due process. Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 U.S. 97\n; Embree v. Kansas City Road District, \n240 \nU.S. 242, 251\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 317.\n This court has more than once declared that it does not interfere with the taxation and assessment laws of the states as violative of the Fourteenth Amendment unless the state's action has been palpably arbitrary or grossly unequal in its application to the persons concerned. In this case the assessment is a large one, but we are unable to find that the judgment sustaining it has had the effect to deprive the Cemetery Association of its property without due process of law, or has denied to it the equal protection of the laws.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","138":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMULLEN v. PICKENS(1919)\nNo. 25\nArgued: Decided: November 10, 1919\n\n\n\n Messrs. Fred R. Ellis, of Lawton, Okl., and H. A. Ledbetter, of Ardmore, Okl., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. C. S. Arnold, of Enid, Okl., for defendants in error Pickens and others.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases were submitted together and involve but a single question, which turns upon the effect to be given to the provisions of the Supplemental Agreement with the Choctaw and Chickasaw Tribes of Indians ( Act July 1, 1902, c. 1362, 32 Stat. 641) relating to the allotment of the tribal lands. In each case an enrolled Indian died subsequent to the ratification of the Agreement and before \n\n[250 U.S. 590, 591]\n\u00a0\n selection of an allotment; in each case the personal representative selected lands for allotment in the name of the deceased Indian, which shortly afterwards were attempted to be conveyed by the heirs of such Indian by warranty deeds through which plaintiffs in error claim, each of which deeds contained a clause to the effect that if for any reason the selection of the lands described in the deed should be set aside, other lands should be selected instead, and these should pass to the grantees, and the grantors would execute further conveyances if necessary. In each case the selection for allotment thus made was set aside in contest proceedings, and another selection thereafter made, followed by an allotment in the name of the deceased Indian. And the question is whether plaintiffs in error, by virtue of the deeds for the prior selections and the special covenants contained in them, are entitled in equity to the lands subsequently allotted. The Supreme Court of Oklahoma held not. Mullen v. pickens, 56 Okl. 65, 155 Pac. 871; Mullen v. Gardner, 57 Okl. 186, 156 Pac. 1160. Its judgments were entered before the taking effect of Act Sept. 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726, amending section 237, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214), and the present writs of error were applied for and allowed within the time permitted by section 7 of the amending act.\n Pertinent provisions of the Supplemental Agreement are set forth in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[250 U.S. 590, 592]\n\u00a0\n In Franklin v. Lynch, \n233 U.S. 269\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 505; a white woman, widow of a Choctaw Indian, having applied to be admitted as a member of the tribe by intermarriage, made a warranty deed in October, 1905, for lands exclusive of homestead which might be finally allotted to her, with an accompanying agreement to make conveyance when the land should be actually allotted. Thereafter she was enrolled as an intermarried citizen, made her selection, and received a patent for land, all of which, except the homestead, she sold for value to other parties. This court held (affirming the Supreme Court of Oklahoma) that the earlier deed and the agreement were void because until allotment the Indian had no undivided interest in the tribal \n\n[250 U.S. 590, 593]\n\u00a0\n land nor any vendible interest in any particular tract, and because the attempted conveyance was in conflict with the provisions of sections 15 and 16 of the Supplemental Agreement to the effect that lands allotted should not be affected by any deed, debt, or obligation contracted prior to the time at which such land might be alienated under the act, and should not be alienable except after issuance of patent. It was contended that the prohibition against sale, in its application to the particular case, had been removed by Act April 21, 1904, c. 1402, 33 Stat. 189, 204, providing that 'all restrictions upon the alienation of lands of all allottees of either of the Five Civilized Tribes of Indians who are not of Indian blood' should be removed. But we held that while this removed the restriction to the extent of permitting members who were not of Indian blood to sell land after it had been actually allotted in severalty, it did not permit even a non-Indian to sell a mere float or expectancy.\n It is insisted that a different rule must be applied with respect to lands allotted pursuant to section 22 in the name of a deceased member for the benefit of his heirs, as to which there is no express restriction upon alienation like those found in sections 15 and 16, and, in the absence of such restriction, no obstacle in the way of the owner conveying his equitable interest after allotment, as was held by this court in Mullen v. United States, \n224 \nU.S. 448, 457\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 494 (and see like rulings, as to the corresponding provisions of the Creek Agreement, in Skelton v. Dill, \n235 \nU.S. 206, 210\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 60, and Woodward v. De Graffenried, \n238 \nU.S. 284, 319\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 764). But the decision in Franklin v. Lynch, supra, was based not alone upon the express restrictions, but upon the absence of individual interest in the tribal land prior to allotment and the general policy of the Agreement not to permit the improvident sales that would result if a prospective allottee were enabled to sell his expectancy.\n We have not overlooked the fact that in construing a \n\n[250 U.S. 590, 594]\n\u00a0\n treaty made October 27, 1832 (7 Stat. 399), between the United States and the Pottawatomie Indians, ceding their possessory interest in certain lands to the United States, with a reservation of a considerable number of sections to particular named Indians to be granted to them when selected, it was held by this court in two cases that the treaty itself converted the reserved sections into individual property and created an equitable interest that was the subject of sale and conveyance, and that warranty deeds made prior to selection operated to vest the title in the grantee as soon as the lands were selected and patented. Doe v. Wilson (1859) 23 How. 457; Crews v. Burcham (1861) 1 Black, 352. Nor that a similar result was reached in Jones v. Meehan, \n175 \nU.S. 1, 21\n, 23 S., 32, 20 Sup. Ct. 1, under the provisions of a treaty with certain bands of Chippewa Indians made October 2, 1863, by which a particular reservation was set apart for one of their principal chiefs.\n But we deem it impossible in right reason to apply the doctrine of these decisions to the case in hand. Section 22 of the Supplemental Agreement provides, not for any special grant or reservation in favor of particular Indians upon any special meritorious consideration but makes a substituted provision, in the allotment scheme, in favor of the heirs of any enrolled Indian who might happen to die after the ratification of the Agreement and before selection of his allotment. In the absence of anything to the contrary, the lands prior to allotment were to remain communal, without private interest that was capable of descent or alienation. Gritts v. Fisher, \n224 \nU.S. 640, 642\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 580; Sizemore v. Brady, \n235 U.S. 441\n, 449-451, 35 Sup. Ct. 135. And no reason is suggested, nor does any occur to us, for creating by implication from the provisions of section 22 a separate interest or equity in the heirs of a deceased member prior to allotment that by the general scheme of the act and the express provisions of sections 15 and 16 was withheld from a member entitled to receive an allotment in his own right. The \n\n[250 U.S. 590, 595]\n\u00a0\n implication is clearly to the contrary; and we hold that not only by the terms of section 22 does the equity of the heir of a deceased member take its inception at the selection of the allotment, but that any previous attempt to sell his expectancy is contrary to the spirit and policy of the act.\n Mullen v. United States, \n224 \nU.S. 448, 457\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 494, cited by plaintiff in error, is not in point, for the lands there in controversy had been duly allotted, and the only question was whether they might be alienated thereafter and before the issuance of patent, a question affirmatively answered by reference to the proviso of section 19 of the act of April 26, 1906 (34 Stat. 137, 144, c. 1876).\n In confirmation of our view as to the meaning and effect of section 22 of the Supplemental Agreement, reference may be made to several acts of Congress respecting restrictions upon the lands of the Five Civilized Tribes, containing some provisions for their removal, and others for their maintenance except so far as removed, the language of which is inconsistent with the theory that there was any individual interest or equity in such lands prior to the selection of an allotment. Act April 21, 1904, c. 1402, 33 Stat. 189, 204; Act April 26, 1906, c. 1876,  19, 34 Stat. 137, 144; Act May 27, 1908, c. 199, 35 Stat. 312. The amount to a legislative declaration of the true intent and meaning of the Agreements respecting allotment of the lands of these tribes.\n The provisions of the Supplemental Agreement having permitted no conveyance of an interest in the tribal lands prior to allotment, it is obvious that this policy cannot be evaded by giving to a conveyance with warranty or its equivalent, made prior to actual allotment, effect as a covenant to convey an allotment thereafter to be selected, either upon the ground of estoppel or because of any state statute having like force. Starr v. Long Jim, \n227 \nU.S. 613, 624\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 358; Monson v. Simonson, \n231 \nU.S. 341, 347\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 71.\n Judgments affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 11.

CO. v. SCARLET(1919)\nNo. 242\nArgued: Decided: April 21, 1919\n\n\n\n Messrs. J. Blanc Monroe, of New Orleans, La., Albert S. Bozeman, of Meridian, Miss., Monte M. Lemann, of New Orleans, La., \n\n[249 U.S. 528, 529]\n\u00a0\n and H. O'B. Cooper, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Thomas G. Fewell, of Meridian, Miss., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Scarlet was a fireman on the New Orleans & Northeastern Railroad. While engaged in the performance of his duties he was injured by being thrown down between the engine and the tender. The accident was caused by the uncoupling of engine and tender; and this was apparently due to the breaking of the king pin, which fastened the drawbar to the tender, and the breaking of the coupling chains between engine and tender. He brought suit in a state court of Mississippi under the federal Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65 (Comp. St.  8657- 8665), and the Boiler Inspection Act of February 17, 1911, c. 103, 36 Stat. 913 (Comp. St.  8630-8639), as amended by the Act of March 4, 1915, c. 169, 38 Stat. 1192 (Comp. St.  8639a-8639d), and recovered judgment which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state (115 Miss. 285, 76 South. 265). The case comes here by writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1156), as amended by the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448,  2, 39 Stat. 726 (Comp. St.  1214).\n The railroad contends that the Supreme Court of Mississippi erred in sustaining the action of the trial court, which charged the jury that the so-called 'Prima Facie Act' of Mississippi (section 1985 of the Code of 1906, as amended by chapter 215, Laws 1912, p. 290) applied, and that it relieved the plaintiff of the burden of proof to establish negligence. Scarlet concedes now that the statute cannot constitutionally be applied to suits under the federal Employers' Liability Act, since this court has so decided in New Orleans & Northeastern Railroad Co. v. Harris, 247 \n\n[249 U.S. 528, 530]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 367, 38 Sup. Ct. 535, and that the judgment must be reversed if the rights of the railroad were prejudiced by this error. But he contends that the railroad was not prejudiced, because negligence on its part is not essential to recovery. He insists that the Boiler Inspection Act, as amended, imposes upon the railroad the absolute duty ( compare St. Louis & Iron Mountain Railway Co. v. Taylor, \n210 U.S. 281\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 616) to have the 'locomotive and tender and all parts and appurtenances thereof' in 'proper condition and safe to operate'; that the mere breaking of the king pin and coupling chains shows conclusively that they were defective; that the evidence shows conclusively that this was the proximate cause of the injury; and that the plaintiff was therefore entitled, under the federal act, to have the jury peremptorily instructed to render a verdict in his favor. It does not appear that this contention was made before the Supreme Court of the state, and it was apparently not considered by that court. But whether Scarlet is now in a position to avail himself of the contention need not be determined (compare Yazoo & Mississippi Valley Railroad Co. v. Mullins, No. 273, \n249 U.S. 531\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 368, decided this day); for it is clear that the evidence did not establish as a matter of law that the king pin or the chains were defective. At most it presented a question for the jury. Compare Minneapolis & St. Louis Railroad Co. v. Gotschall, \n244 U.S. 66\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 598. We cannot say, therefore, that the railroad was not prejudiced by the error of the trial court in instructing the jury that the 'Prima Facie Act' was applicable.\n The conflict of a state statute with a valid law of the United States being involved and the decision having been in favor of the validity of the statute, the case is properly here on a writ of error; and the petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","140":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEW YORK CENT R.

E. 82.\n In each case the commission found accidental injuries sustained by an employe in a hazardous occupation, arising out of and in the course of the employment, and, as a result of the injury, some serious facial or head disfigurement, or both. In each case an award was made on account of such disfigurement irrespective of the allowance of compensation according to the schedule based upon the average wage of the injured employe and the character and duration of the disability.\n The sole contention here is that the amendment of 1916, as thus carried into effect, deprives the respective plaintiffs \n\n[250 U.S. 596, 601]\n\u00a0\n in error of property without due process of law, in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The argument is that an award for disfigurement, made wholly independent of claimant's inability to work, is not based upon impairment of earning power; that only such impairment can justify imposing upon an employer without fault compulsory payment by way of compensation to an injured workman; and hence that the 'disfigurement clause' is not a reasonable exercise of the police power, but is arbitrary and oppressive.\n In view of our recent decisions sustaining state laws imposing upon employers in the hazardous industries responsibility in one form or another for the consequences of injuries received by employes in the course of the employment in the absence of fault on the employer's part ( New York Central R. R. Co. v. White, \n243 U.S. 188\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 U.S. 219\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642; Arizona Employers' Liability Cases, \n250 U.S. 400\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 553), little need now be said.\n Even were impairment of earning power the sole justification for imposing compulsory payment of workmen's compensation upon the employer in such cases, it would be sufficient answer to the present contention to say that a serious disfigurement of the face or head reasonably may be regarded as having a direct relation to the injured person's earning power, irrespective of its effect upon his mere capacity for work.\n Under ordinary conditions of life, a serious and unnatural disfigurement of the face or head very probably may have a harmful effect upon the ability of the injured person to obtain or retain employment. Laying aside exceptional cases, which we must assume will be fairly dealt with in the proper and equitable administration of the act, such a disfigurement may render one repulsive or offensive to the sight, displeasing, or at least less pleasing, to employer, to fellow employes, and to patrons or customers. \n\n[250 U.S. 596, 602]\n\u00a0\n See Ball v. Wm. Hunt & Sons, Ltd., \n\n[250 U.S. 596, 1912]\n\u00a0\n App. Cas. 496.\n But we cannot concede that impairment of earning power is the sole ground upon which compulsory compensation to injured workmen legitimately may be based. Unquestionably it is a rational basis, and it is adopted for the generality of cases by the New York law. But the Court of Appeals has construed the 1916 amendment as permitting an allowance for facial or head disfigurement although it does not impair the claimant's earning capacity. Matter of Erickson v. Preuss, 223 N. Y. 365, 368, 119 N. E. 555; and see opinion of Judge Cardozo in the present case, 226 N. Y. 199, 200, 123 N. E. 82. In view of this, and there being no specific finding of such impairment in these cases, it is proper to say that in our opinion the 'due process of law' clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not require the states to base compulsory compensation solely upon loss of earning power.\n The New York law as at first enacted, the Washington, and the Arizona laws presented for our consideration three different methods adopted for the purpose of imposing upon the industry the burden of making some compensation for the human wastage attributable to the hazards of the work. We were unable to find that any of these ran counter to the 'due process' clause. Nor does that provision debar a state from adopting other methods, or a composite of different methods, provided the result be not inconsistent with fundamental rights. As was stated in the Arizona case, \n250 U.S. 429\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 559:\n'If a state recognizes or establishes a right of action for compensation to injured workmen upon grounds not arbitrary or fundamentally unjust, the question whether the award shall be measured as compensatory damages are measured at common law, or according to some prescribed scale reasonably adapted to produce a fair result, is for the state itself to determine.'\n\n And we see no constitutional reason why a state may not, \n\n[250 U.S. 596, 603]\n\u00a0\n in ascertaining the amount of such compensation in particular cases, take into consideration any substantial physical impairment attributable to the injury, whether it immediately affects earning capacity or not.\n For the reasons thus outlined, it was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or contrary to fundamental right to embody in the New York Workmen's Compensation Law a provision for a special allowance of compensation for a serious disfigurement of the face or head. Nor is there any ground for declaring that the allowance prescribed by the 1916 amendment exceeds the constitutional limitations upon state power.\n Whether an award for such disfigurement should be made in combination with or independent of the compensation allowed for the mere inability to work is a matter of detail for the state to determine. The same is true of the question whether the compensation should be paid in a single sum, or in installments. Arizona Employers' Liability Cases, \n250 \nU.S. 400, 429\n, 39 S. Sup.

Paulding, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action brought by respondent against petitoner in the Supreme Court of New York to recover damages equivalent to the value of certain goods shipped in interstate commerce and lost in transit. Plaintiff had judgment in the trial court, which was affirmed by the Appellate Division for the First Department (Goldberg v. New York Cent. R. Co., 164 App. \n\n[250 U.S. 85, 86]\n\u00a0\n Div. 389, 149 N. Y. Supp. 629), and affirmed by the Court of Appeals without opinion (221 N. Y. 539, 116 N. E. 1047).\n The facts are as follows: On September 17, 1912, a firm of fur manufacturers in New York City caused to be delivered to defendant there for transportation to plaintiff at Cincinnati, Ohio, a case containing furs belonging to plaintiff of the value of $693.75. When the case left the consignors' possession it was marked with the name and address of the consignee, and with the word 'furs' conspicuously displayed. It was delivered to a local expressman, whose driver delivered it to defendant and made out a bill of lading which defendant signed and upon which the action depends. This bill of lading described the goods as 'One case D. G.,' which admittedly means 'dry goods.' The misdescription was the driver's mistake, not made with any intent to fraudulently misrepresent the nature of the merchandise shipped. Defendant's clerk who signed the bill of lading relied wholly upon the representations of the driver as to the contents of the case, not seeing the case itself; and, so far as appears, no representative of defendant compared or had a convenient opportunity of compare the bill of lading with the mark on the case. At the time of the shipment the official freight classification filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission provided for a first-class rate for dry goods (65 cents per hundred pounds), and a double-first-class rate ($1.30 per hundred) for furs. As a result of the misdescription in the bill of lading, freight was charged at the smaller rate applicable to dry goods, instead of the higher one applicable to furs. No valuation was placed upon the goods, and no question of limitation of liability to a stipulated value is presented.\n Defendant admitted that it received the goods for transportation, and that they were stolen in transit and never delivered to the consignee.\n Defendant insists that it is not liable in any amount \n\n[250 U.S. 85, 87]\n\u00a0\n for loss of the goods, because they were misdescribed in the bill of lading. Reliance is placed upon a line of decisions in this court relating to the limitation of liability of an interstate rail carrier where goods are shipped at a declared value at a rate based upon value and under a contract conforming to the filed tariff.

Ct. 469.\n The Appellate Division held that these cases did not go to the extent of relieving the carrier from all liability in case of a nonfraudulent misrepresentation as to the nature of the merchandise shipped, and that since there was no clause in the bill of lading exempting the carrier or limiting its liability in case of such a misdescription the carrier was defenseless.\n Defendant's contention is that there is no responsibility for loss of the furs that were shipped because they were goods, not of the same, but of a different, character than those described in the bill of lading, and were goods for the transportation of which a higher rate was established by its filed schedules. Were there otherwise any difficulty in answering this contention, it would be wholly relieved by the fact that the precise contingency was anticipated in the preparation of the form of the bill of lading and provided for by one of its conditions, which reads as follows:\n'The owner or consignee shall pay the freight and all other lawful charges accruing on said property, and, if required, shall pay the same before delivery. If upon inspection it is ascertained that the articles shipped are not those described in this bill of lading, the freight charges must be paid upon the articles actually shipped.'\n\n Clearly, the effect of this is that a misdescription of the \n\n[250 U.S. 85, 88]\n\u00a0\n character of the goods, not attributable to fraud, merely imposed upon the shipper or consignee an obligation to pay freight charges according to the character of the goods actually shipped, and did not affect the liability of the carrier for a failure to deliver the goods.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","142":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEW YORK CENT R.

The demand is based upon implied contracts alleged to arise from the following circumstances: First. Acceptance and transportation of the mails in reliance upon section 4002, Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  7483), as amended. This directs payment of specified sums per mile per annum according to weights; and the claim is that because the Post Office Department improperly construed and applied it, appellant received much less than it should have. Second. Acceptance and transportation of the mails under orders and coercion of the Post Office Department, followed by failure to allow reasonable compensation therefor. Appellant claims its property was taken for public use and adequate compensation must be paid.\n Concerning the challenged interpretation and application of section 4002, Revised Statutes, resulting in payments during each four-year term upon the basis of weights taken \n\n[251 U.S. 123, 127]\n\u00a0\n immediately prior to the beginning of the same, instead of annually, it suffices to say that the action taken accords with prior practice followed for many years, the letter of the statute permits it, the carrier submitted with full knowledge, and, impliedly at least, it was sanctioned by this court in Delaware, L. & W. R. R. Co. v. United States, \n249 U.S. 385\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 348.\n We think it must be treated as settled doctrine that prior to Act July 28, 1916, c. 261, 39 Stat. 412, 429-with the exception of certain roads aided by land grants-railroads were not required by law to carry the mails.

And as appellant voluntarily accepted and performed the service with knowledge of what the United States intended to pay, it cannot now claim an implied contract for a greater sum. It may be that any railroad by failing to carry the mails would incur the hostility of those living along its lines and as a consequence suffer serious financial losses; but the fear of such results certainly does not amount to compulsion by the United States and cannot constitute the basis of a justiciable claim against them for taking property.\n The Court of Claims (53 Ct.

Whipple, all of San Francisco, Cal., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a direct appeal under section 238, Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, 36 Stat. 1087, 1157, c. 231 [Comp. St.  1215]), involving only the question whether the cause was within the admiralty jurisdiction of a District Court of the United States.\n Both parties are corporations of the state of California. Appellee, which for convenience may be referred to as the 'Shipbuilding Company,' filed its libel in personam against appellant, which we may call the 'Steamship Company,' to recover a balance claimed to be due for certain work and labor done, services rendered, and materials furnished in and about the repairing of the steamship Yucatan. The Steamship Company filed an answer denying material averments of the libel, and a cross-libel setting up a claim for damages for delay in the making of the repairs. The cause having been heard upon the pleadings and proofs, there was a decree for a recovery in favor of the Shipbuilding Company and a dismissal of the cross-libel. After this the Steamship Company filed a motion to arrest and vacate the decree and to dismiss the cause for want of jurisdiction. The motion was submitted to the court upon the pleadings, the proofs taken upon the hearings of the merits, and some slight additional proof. It was denied, and the present appeal followed.\n The facts were these: In the month of May, 1911, the Steamship Company was the owner of the American steamer Yucatan, which then lay moored or tied up at \n\n[249 U.S. 119, 123]\n\u00a0\n dock upon the waters of Puget Sound at Seattle, in the state of Washington. The vessel, which was of steel construction, was in need of extensive repairs. She had been wrecked, and had remained submerged for a long time; ice floes had torn away the upper decks, and some of her bottom plates also needed to be replaced. She was under charter for an Alaskan voyage, to be commenced as soon as the repairs could be completed. The Shipbuilding Company was the owner of a shipyard, marine railway, machine shops, and other equipment for building and repairing ships, situate upon and adjacent to the navigable waters of Puget Sound at Winslow, in the same state, and had in its employ numerous mechanics and laborers. Under these circumstances it was agreed between the parties that the Shipbuilding Company should tow the vessel from where she lay to the shipyard, haul her out as required upon the marine railway to a position on dry land adjacent to the machine shop-the pace being known as the 'dry dock,' and the hauling out being described as 'docking'-and should furnish mechanics, laborers, and foremen as needed, who were to work with other men already in the employ of the Steamship Company, and under its superintendence; and the Shipbuilding Company was also to furnish plates and other materials needed in the repairs, and the use of air compressors, steam hammers, riveters, boring machines, lathes, blacksmith forge, and the usual and necessary tools for the use of such machines. At the time the contract was made, another vessel (the Archer) was upon the dry dock, and it was uncertain how soon she could be returned to the water. It was understood that the Yucatan should be hauled out as soon as the Archer came off, should remain upon the dry dock only during such part of the work as required her to be in that position, and at other times should lie in the water alongside the plant. For the services to be performed and the materials and equipment \n\n[249 U.S. 119, 124]\n\u00a0\n to be furnished, the Shipbuilding Company was to receive stated prices, thus: For labor of all classes, the actual rate of wages paid to the men plus 15 per cent.; for use of tug and scow, a stated sum per hour; for hauling out the vessel and the sue of the marine railway, a stated sum for the first 24 hours, and a specified rate per day for 6 'lay days' immediately following the hauling out; for each working day thereafter, another rate; for vessel lying alongside the dock for repairs, no charge; for the running of air compressors, a certain charge per hour; for the use and operation of other machines, certain rates specified; and for materials supplied, invoice prices and cost of freight to plant, with 10 per cent. additional.\n The vessel was docked and repaired in the manner contemplated by the agreement; she was brought to the shipyard on the 27th of May, and lay in the water alongside of the dock there until the 17th of June, during which time upper decks and beams were put in and other work of a character that could be done as well while she was afloat as in the dry dock. On June 17th she was hauled out and remained in dry dock for about two weeks while her bottom plates were renewed. During the same period the propeller was removed to permit of an examination of the tail shaft, and as the shaft showed deterioration a new one was ordered to be supplied by a concern in San Francisco. Upon completion of the work upon the bottom plates, and on the 5th of July, the vessel was returned to the water and lay there for about two weeks awaiting arrival of the new tail shaft. When this arrived the vessel was again hauled out, the tail shaft and propeller were fitted, and the remaining repairs completed. Libelant's claim was for work and labor performed, services rendered, and materials furnished under the circumstances mentioned, and was based upon the agreed scale of compensation.\n The question in dispute is whether a claim thus grounded \n\n[249 U.S. 119, 125]\n\u00a0\n is the subject of admiralty jurisdiction; appellant's contention being that the contract, or at least an essential part of it, was for the use by appellant of libelant's marine railway, shipyard, equipment, and laborers in such manner as appellant might choose to employ them, and that it called for the performance of no maritime service by libelant.\n The Constitution (article 3,  2) extends the judicial power of the United States to 'all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction'; and the legislation enacted by Congress for carrying the power into execution has been equally extensive. Act Sept. 24, 1789, c. 20,  9, 1 Stat. 73, 77; Rev. Stat.  563 (8); Judicial Code,  24(3); 36 Stat. 1087, 1091, c. 231 ( Comp. St.  991). In defining the bounds of the civil jurisdiction, this court from an early day has rejected those trammels that arose from the restrictive statutes and judicial prohibitions of England. Waring v. Clarke, 5 How. 441, 457, 459; Insurance Co. v. Dunham, 11 Wall. 1, 24; The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558, 576.\n It must be taken to be the settled law of this court that while the civil jurisdiction of the admiralty in matters of tort depends upon locality, whether the act was committed upon navigable waters, in matter of contract it depends upon the subject-matter, the nature and character of the contract, and that the English rule, which conceded jurisdiction, with a few exceptions, only to contracts made and to be executed upon the navigable waters, is inadmissible; the true criterion being the nature of the contract, as to whether it have reference to maritime service or maritime transactions. People's Ferry Co. v. Beers, 20 How. 393, 401; Phila. W. & B. R. Co. v. Phila., etc., Steam Towboat Co., 23 How. 209, 215; Insurance Co. v. Dunham, 11 Wall. 1, 26; The Eclipse, \n135 \nU.S. 599, 608\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 873.\n In some of the earlier cases the influence of the English \n\n[249 U.S. 119, 126]\n\u00a0\n rule may be discerned, in that the question whether a contract was to be performed upon the navigable waters was referred to as pertinent to the question whether the contract was of a maritime nature (The Thomas Jefferson, 10 Wheat. 428, 429; The Planter [Peyroux v. Howard] 7 Pet. 324, 341; Steamboat Orleans v. Phoebus, 11 Pet. 175, 183; New Jersey Steam Navigation Co. v. Merchants' Bank, 6 How. 344, 392); but a careful examination of the opinions shows that the place of performance was dealt with as an evidential circumstance bearing with more or less weight upon the fundamental question of the nature of the contract. If they go beyond this, they must be deemed to be overruled by Insurance Co. v. Dunham, supra.\n Neither in jurisdiction nor in the mothod of procedure are our admiralty courts dependent alone upon the theory of implied hypothecation; it being established that in a civil cause of maritime origin involving a personal responsibility the libelant may proceed in personam if the respondent is within reach of process.

Ct. xi) adopted in its present form in the year 1872 (13 Wall. xiv) after a long controversy that began with The General Smith, 4 Wheat. 438, and ended with The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558, 579, 581. See The Glide, \n167 U.S. 606\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 930.\n It is settled that a contract for building a ship or supply ing \n\n[249 U.S. 119, 127]\n\u00a0\n materials for her construction is not a maritime contract. People's Ferry Co. v. Beers, 20 How. 393; Roach v. Chapman, 22 How. 129; Edwards v. Elliott, 21 Wall. 532, 553, 557; The Winnebago, \n205 \nU.S. 354, 363\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 509. In the case in 20 How. 402, the court said:\n'So far from the contract being purely maritime, and touching rights and duties appertaining to navigation (on the ocean or elsewhere), it was a contract made on land, to be performed on land.'\n\n But the true basis for the distinction between the construction and the repair of a ship, for purposes of the admiralty jurisdiction, is to be found in the fact that the structure does not become a ship, in the legal sense, until it is completed and launched.\n'A ship is born when she is launched, and lives so long as her identity is preserved. Prior to her launching she is a mere congeries of wood and iron-an ordinary piece of personal property-as distinctly a land structure as a house, and subject ... to mechanics' liens created by state law enforceable in the state courts. In the baptism of launching she receives her name, and from the moment her keel touches the water she is transformed, and becomes a subject of admiralty jurisdiction.' Tucker v. Alexandroff, \n183 \nU.S. 424, 438\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 195.\n\n In The Robert W. Parsons, \n191 \nU.S. 17, 33\n, 34 S., 24 Sup. Ct. 8, 13 (48 L. Ed. 73), it was held that the admiralty jurisdiction extended to an action for repairs put upon a vessel while in dry dock; but the question whether this would apply to a vessel hauled up on land for repairs was reserved, the language of the court, by Mr. Justice Brown, being:\n'Had the vessel been hauled up by ways upon the land and there repaired a different question might have been presented, as to which we express no opinion; but as all serious repairs upon the hulls of vessels are made in dry dock, the proposition that such repairs are made on land would practically deprive the admiralty courts of their largest and most important jurisdiction in connection with repairs.' \n\n[249 U.S. 119, 128]\n\u00a0\n In The Steamship Jefferson, \n215 U.S. 130\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 54, 17 Ann. Cas. 907, it was held that the admiralty jurisdiction extends to a claim for salvage service rendered to a vessel while undergoing repairs in a dry dock.\n\n What we have said sufficiently indicates the decision that should be reached in the case at bar. The contract as made contemplated the performance of services and the furnishing of the necessary materials for the repairs of the steamship Yucatan. It was an entire contract, intended to take the ship as she was and to discharge her only when completely repaired and fit for the Alaskan voyage. It did not contemplate, as is contended by appellant, either a lease, or a contract for use in the nature of a lease, of the libelant's marine railway and machine shop. The use of these was but incidental; the vessel being hauled out, when consistent with the progress of other work of the Shipbuilding Company, for the purpose of exposing the ship's bottom to permit of the removal and replacement of the broken plates and the examination of the propeller and tail shaft. In The Planter (Peyroux v. Howard), 7 Pet. 324, 327, 341, the vessel, requiring repairs below the water line as well as above, was to be and in fact was hauled up out of the water; and it was held that the contract for materials furnished and work performed in repairing her under these circumstances was a maritime contract. We think the same rule must be applied to the case before us; that the doubt intimated in The Robert W. Parsons, \n191 \nU.S. 17, 33\n, 34 S., 24 Sup. Ct. 8, must be laid aside; and that there is no difference in character as to repairs made upon the hull of a vessel dependent upon whether they are made while she is afloat, while in dry dock, or while hauled up by ways upon land. The nature of the service is identical in the several cases, and the admiralty jurisdiction extends to all.\n This is recognized by the Act of Congress of June 23, 1910 (chapter 373, 36 Stat. 604 [Comp. St.  7783]), which declares that 'any person \n\n[249 U.S. 119, 129]\n\u00a0\n furnishing repairs, supplies, or other necessaries, including the use of dry dock or marine railway, to a vessel, whether foreign or domestic,' upon the order of a proper person, shall have a martime lien upon the vessel.\n The principle was recognized long ago by Mr. Justice Nelson in a case decided at the circuit, Wortman v. Griffith (1856) 3 Blatchf, 528, 30 Fed. Cas. 648, No. 18057, which was a libel in personam to recover compensation for services rendered in repairing a steamboat. Libelant was the owner of a shipyard with apparatus consisting of a railway cradle and other fixtures and implements used for the purpose of hauling vessels out of the water and sustaining them while being repaired. Certain rates of compensation were charged for hauling the vessel upon the ways, and a per diem charge for the time occupied while she was under repair, in cases where the owner of the yard and apparatus was not employed to do the work but the repairs were made by other shipmasters, as was done in that case. The owner of the yard and apparatus, together with his employes, superintended and conducted the operation of raising and lowering the vessel and also of fixing her upon the ways preparatory to the repairs, a service requiring skill and experience and essential to the process of repair. Mr. Justice Nelson held there was no substantial distinction between such a case and the case where the shipmaster was employed to make the repairs; and that the admiralty jurisdiction must be sustained.\n Nor is the present case to be distinguished upon the ground that the repairs in which libelant was to furnish work and materials and the use of a marine railway and other equipment were to be done under the superintendence of the Steamship Company. This affected the quantum of the services and the extent of the responsibility, but not the essential character of the services of the nature of the contract, which, in our opinion, were maritime.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","145":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNORTHERN PAC.

Tanner, of Olympia, Wash., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[250 U.S. 135, 141]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the court.\n In taking over the railroads from private ownership to its control and operation, was the resulting power of the United States to fix the rates to be charged for the transportation services to be by it rendered subordinated to the asserted authority of the several states to regulate the \n\n[250 U.S. 135, 142]\n\u00a0\n rates for all local or intrastate business, is the issue raised on this record. It arises from the allowance by the court below, of a peremptory writ of mandamus commanding the Director General of the railroads, appointed by the President, and the officers of the Northern Pacific Railway Company to desist from charging for transportation in intrastate business in North Dakota the rates fixed by the United States for such services. When this command was obeyed, the mandamus ordered that the Director General should thereafter exact for the services stated only lesser rates which were fixed in a schedule on file with the State Utilities Commission prior to the bringing of suit and which rates under the law of North Dakota could not be changed without the approval of the Utilities Commission. In the opinion of the court below it was stated that all the parties admitted that there was no question as to the jurisdiction to consider the controversy and that they all also agreed that no contention was presented as to the power of Congress to enact the law upon which the controversy depended, as the correct interpretation of such law was the only issue to be decided. We consequently put those subjects temporarily out of view. We say temporarily, since even upon the assumption that issues concerning them necessarily inhere in the cause and cannot be waived by the parties, we could not decide concerning such issues without interpreting the statute, which we proceed to do.\n On the 29th of August, 1916 (39 Stat. 645, c. 418 [Comp. St.  1974a ]), Congress gave the President power, 'in time of war, ... to take possession and assume control of any system or systems of transportation, or any part thereof, and to utilize the same, to the exclusion as far as may be necessary of all other traffic thereon, for the transfer or transportation of troops, war material and equipment, or for such other purposes connected with the emergency as may be needful or desirable.' War with Germany was declared in April, 1917, and with Austria on December 7th of the same year. \n\n[250 U.S. 135, 143]\n\u00a0\n 40 Stat. 1, c. 1; 40 Stat. 429, c. 1. On December 26, 1917, the President, referring to the existing state of war and the power with which he had been invested by Congress in August, 1916, proclaimed that--\n'Under and y virtue of the powers vested in me by the foregoing resolutions and statute, and by virtue of all other powers thereto me enabling, \n\n[250 U.S. 135, 1]\n\u00a0\n do hereby ... take possession and assume control at 12 o'clock noon on the 28th of December, 1917, of each and every system of transportation and the appurtenances thereof located wholly or in part within the boundaries of the continental United States and consisting of railroads, and owned or controlled systems of coastwise and inland transportation, engaged in general transportation, whether operated by steam or by electric power, including also terminals, terminal companies and terminal associations, sleeping and parlor cars, private cars and private car lines, elevators, and warehouses, telegraph and telephone lines, and all other equipment and appurtenances commonly used upon or operated as a part of such rail or combined rail and water systems of transportation, to the end that said systems of transportation be utilized for the transfer and transportation of troops, war material and equipment, to the exclusion so far as may be necessary of all other traffic thereon, and that so far as such exclusive use be not necessary or desirable such systems of transportation be operated and utilized in the performance of such other services as the national interest may require and of the usual and ordinary business and duties of common carriers.' Comp. St. 1918,  1974a.\n\n By the proclamation a Director General of Railroads was appointed with full authority to take possession and control of the systems embraced by the proclamation and to operate and administer the same. To this end the Director General was given authority to avail himself of the services of the existing railroad officials, boards of \n\n[250 U.S. 135, 144]\n\u00a0\n directors, receivers, employes, etc., who were authorized to continue to perform their duties in accordance with their previous authority 'until and except so far as such Director shall from time to time by general or special orders otherwise provide.' Limited by the same qualification the systems of transportation taken over by the government were made subject to existing statutes and orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission and to all statutes and orders of regulating commissions of the various states in which said systems or any part thereof might be located. In addition, however, to the limitation previously stated the proclamation in express terms declared:\n'But any orders, general or special, hereafter made by said Director, shall have paramount authority and be obeyed as such.'\n\n The proclamation imposed the duty upon the Director General to negotiate with the owners of the railroad companies for an agreement as to compensation for the possession, use and control of their respective properties on the basis of an annual guaranteed compensation and with reservations in the interest of creditors, bondholders, etc. The proclamation in concluding declared that--\n'From and after twelve o'clock on said twenty-eighth day of December, 1917, all transportation systems included in this order and proclamation shall conclusively be deemed within the possession and control of said Director without further act or notice.'\n\n Carrying out the authority exerted by the proclamation, the railroads passed into the possession, control and operation of the Director General.\n On March 21, 1918 (Act March 21, 1918, c. 25, 40 Stat. 451 [Comp. St. 1918,  3115 3\/4 a]), dealing with the subject Congress passed a law entitled:\n'An act to provide for the operation of transportation systems while under federal control, for the just compensation of their owners, and for other purposes.'\n\n The opening sentences of the act declared:\n'The President, having in time of war taken over the possession, use, control, and operation \n\n[250 U.S. 135, 145]\n\u00a0\n (called herein federal control) of certain railroads and systems of transportation (called herein carriers), is hereby authorized to agree with and to guarantee to any such carrier making operating returs to the Interstate Commerce Commission, that during the period of such federal control it shall receive as just compensation an annual sum, payable from time to time in reasonable installments, for each year and pro rata for any fractional year of such federal control, not exceeding a sum equivalent as nearly as may be to its average annual railway operating income for the three years ended June 30, 1917.'\n\n Without going into detail it suffices to say that the first eight sections of the act comprehensively provided for giving effect to the purposes just stated and in a general way contemplated affording what was deemed to be just compensation to the owners for the use of their property. In addition it empowered agreements in the interest of security holders of the railroads and sanctioned provisions deemed fair to the United States and to the owners of the property for betterments which might be required to be made during the term of control and for the return of the property when the government possession came to an end, which return was to be accomplished within a stated period after the cessation of war by the proclamation of the ratification of a peace treaty.\n Beyond doubt also, for the purpose of enabling the United States to perform the obligations which it assumed and to secure it from ultimate loss from the pecuniary responsibilities which might result, including the repayment to it of an appropriation of $500,000,000 which the act made applicable, all the earnings of the railroads were by the act expressly made the property of the United States.\n The remaining eight sections of the act need not be stated; but as section 10 (Comp. St. 1918,  3115 3\/4 j), which expressly provides for the power to fix rates, and section 15 (Comp. St. 1918,  3115 3\/4 o), making certain reservations concerning \n\n[250 U.S. 135, 146]\n\u00a0\n the powers granted, were greatly relied upon in the opinion below and in the argument at bar, we reproduce in the margin the more relevant portions of section 10 and the text of section 15.1 \n\n[250 U.S. 135, 147]\n\u00a0\n On May 25, 1918, the Director General made an order establishing a schedule of rates for all roads under his control and covering all classes of service, intrastate as well as interstate. The order made these rates effective on designated dates in the month of June and they were continuously enforced during a period of about eight months up to the 14th of February, 1919, when the bill in this case was filed by the State Utilities Commission for mandamus against the Director General and the officers of the Northern Pacific Railway, asserting the want of power in the United States over intrastate rates and the exclusive right of the state of North Dakota to fix such rates for all intrastate business done in that state. The Director General, admitting that he had made the order complained of and had collected the rates earned thereunder and paid them into the treasury of the United States, sustained his action and denied the alleged right of the state upon the legislation and official acts which we have stated. The Northern Pacific denied interest on the ground that its railway had passed under federal control and that it was receiving the compensation therefor which had been agreed on between itself and the United States. It alleged that the rates under the order complained of had been collected by the Director General through agents appointed by him who were not officials of the company and therefore it had no responsibility concerning them. The prayer was that it be dismissed from the suit.\n Taking the case under the complaint, the returns and the exhibits, the court, as we have previously stated, two of its members dissenting, denied the authority of the United States and upheld that of the state, and the mandamus was made peremptory as to both the Director \n\n[250 U.S. 135, 148]\n\u00a0\n General and the officers of the Northern Pacific Railway. We are thus brought to the question whether the state authority controls the power of the United States as o intrastate rates.\n No elaboration could make clearer than do the act of Congress of 1916, the proclamation of the President exerting the powers given, and the act of 1918 dealing with the situation created by the exercise of such authority, that no divided but a complete possession and control were given the United States for all purposes as to the railroads in question. But if it be conceded that despite the absolute clarity of the provisions concerning the control given the United States, and the all-embracing scope of that control, there is room for some doubt, the consideration of the general context completely dispels hesitancy. How can any other conclusion be reached if consideration be given the comprehensive provisions concerning the administration by the United States of the property which it was authorized to take, the financial obligations under which it came and all the other duties and exactions which the act imposed, contemplating one control, one administration, one power for the accomplishment of the one purpose, the complete possession by governmental authority to replace for the period provided the private ownership theretofore existing. This being true, it must follow that there is no basis for the contention that the power to make rates and enforce them which was plainly essential to the authority given was not included in it.\n Conclusive as are these inferences, they are superfluous, since the portion of section 10 as previously reproduced in the margin in express terms confers the complete and undivided power to fix rates. The provision is this:\n'That during the period of federal control, whenever in his opinion the public interest requires, the President may initiate rates, fares, charges, classifications, regulations, and prac- \n\n[250 U.S. 135, 149]\n\u00a0\n tices by filing the same with the Interstate Commerce Commission, which said rates, fares, charges, classifications, regulations, and practices shall not be suspended by the commission pending final determination.'\n\n These quoted words are immediately followed by provisions further defining the power of the commission and its duty in the premises, so as to enable it beyond doubt to consider the situation resulting from the act and to which the rates were to be applied. The unison between that which is inferable and that which is expressed demonstrates the true significance of the statute.\n A brief consideration of the contentions relied upon to the contrary will at once show either their inappositeness, the mistaken premises upon which they rest, or the errors of deduction upon which they proceed. It is argued that as state control over intrastate rates was the rule prior to the enactment of the statute creating the United States control, the statute must be interpreted in the light of a presumption that a change as to state control was not made. But in view of the unambiguous provision of the statute as to the new character of control which it created, the principle of interpretation applied in its ultimate aspect virtually was: That because the statute made a fundamental change, it must be so interpreted as to prevent that change from becoming effective.\n Besides, the presumption in question but denied the power exerted in the adoption of the statute, and displaced by an imaginary the dominant presumption which arose by operation of the Constitution as an inevitable effect of the adoption of the statute, as shown by the following:\n\n\n (a)\n The complete and undivided character of the war power of the United States is not disputable. Selective Draft Law Cases, \n245 U.S. 366\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 159, L. R. A. 1918C, 361, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 856; Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2; Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wall. 457; Stewart v. Kahn, 11 Wall. 493. On the face of the statutes it is manifest that \n\n[250 U.S. 135, 150]\n\u00a0\n they were in terms based upon the war power, since the authority they gave arose only because of the existence of war, and the right to exert such authority was to cease upon the war's e rmination. To interpret, therefore, the exercise of the power by a presumption of the continuance of a state power limiting and controlling the national authority was but to deny its existence. It was akin to the contention that the supreme right to raise armies and use them in case of war did not extend to directing where and when they should be used. Cox v. Wood, \n247 U.S. 3\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 421.\n\n\n (b)\n The elementary principle that under the Constitution the authority of the government of the United States is paramount when exerted as to subjects concerning which it has the power to control, is indisputable. This being true, it results that although authority to regulate within a given sphere may exist in both the United States and in the states, when the former calls into play constitutional authority within such general sphere the necessary effect of doing so is, that to the extent that any conflict arises the state power is limited, since in case of conflict that which is paramount necessarily controls that which is subordinate.\n Again, as the power which was exerted was supreme, to interpret it upon the basis that its exercise must be presumed to be limited was to deny the power itself. Thus, once more it comes to pass that the application of the assumed presumption was in effect but a form of expression by which the power which Congress had exerted was denied. In fact, error arising from indulging in such erroneous presumption permeates every contention. To illustrate: Because in Reagan v. Mercantile Trust Co., \n154 U.S. 418\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 1062, and other cases unnecessary to be referred to, it was held that it would be presumed that Congress in creating a corporation intended that it should be subject to applicable state laws and regulations so far as Congress did not otherwise provide, therefore, because Congress had \n\n[250 U.S. 135, 151]\n\u00a0\n taken over to the government of the United States property to be used by it in the performance of a governmental function, Congress must be presumed to have intended that such property (and such functions) should continue to be subject to and controlled by state power.\n The confusion produced is again aptly illustrated by the rule of interpretation by which it is insisted that the express power to fix rates conferred by the statute was rightly disregarded. Thus, while admitting that the power which was conferred to initiate rates when considered in and of itself included all rates, it is nevertheless said that such power must be presumed to be limited to the only character of rates which under the prior law the Interstate Commerce Commission had the power to consider, that is, interstate rates, because the new rates when initiated were to be acted upon by that body. As, however, the statute in terms gives power to the Interstate Commerce Commission to consider the new rates in the light of the new and unified control which it creates, the error in the contention becomes manifest, even putting out of view the fact that by the effect of the duty imposed and the new control created the new rates applying to the new conditions were within the purview of the power which the Interstate Commerce Commission previously possessed. Certainly, to mistakenly disregard one provision of the statute intended to give effect to another and upon that basis to decide that the statute is not enforceable, cannot be said to be a correct interpretation. And this view is also true as to the application which was made of the asserted presumption to the excepting clauses of section 15 previously reproduced in the margin, since that section in the light of the purpose to retain the prior law is interpreted so as to cause it to be but an additional means of destroying the all-embracing power to initiate rates fixed by section 10.\n It follows that the judgment below was erroneous. The \n\n[250 U.S. 135, 152]\n\u00a0\n relief afforded against the officer of the United States proceeded upon the basis that he was exerting a power not conferred by the statute, tot he detriment of the rights and duties of the state authority, and was subject therefore to be restrained by state power within the limits of the statute. Upon the premise upon which it rests, that is, the unlawful acts of the officers, the proposition is undoubted, but in view of our conclusion that the acts of the officers complained of were authorized by the law of the United States, the question arises how far, that being established, it results that the suit was one against the United States over which there was no jurisdiction within the rulings in Belknap v. Schild, \n161 U.S. 10\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 443; Postal Supply Co. v. Bruce, \n194 U.S. 601\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 820; Louisiana v. McAdoo, \n234 U.S. 627\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 938; Minnesota v. Hitchcock, \n185 U.S. 373\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 650; Wells v. Roper, \n246 U.S. 335\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 317.\n The principle of these cases however can only be applicable by giving effect to the conclusion we have reached as to the legality of the acts of the officers which were complained of, and to decide which question the United States was not a necessary party. This is undoubtedly true unless it can be said that the contentions concerning the want of power in the officers were so unsubstantial and frivolous as to afford no basis for jurisdiction and hence caused the suit to be from the beginning directly against the United States. As however we are of the opinion that there is no ground for that view, it follows that the case as made gave jurisdiction to dispose of the question of wrong committed by the officials and that a decree giving effect to our conclusion on that subject will dispose of the entire case.\n Our decree therefore must be and it is\n Reversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Section 10. ...

C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to quiet title in the plaintiff to five small tracts of land in Umatilla county, Oregon, the right to such relief being predicated solely on adverse possession under color of title for ten years, the period prescribed in a local statute. The plaintiff obtained a judgment, which at first was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state and then on a petition for rehearing was modified as to two of the tracts. McComas v. Northern Pac. R. Co., 82 Or. 639, 161 Pac. 562, 162 Pac. 862. The case is here on writ of certiorari.\n There was substantial testimony tending to show that McComas, the plaintiff, and his predecessors had been in undisputed possession of the lands for ten years when the suit was brought and that during that period they had been cultivating the lands and claiming the same under the deeds from the state hereinafter mentioned and had put improvm ents thereon costing more than $10,000. The other facts are set forth in a stipulation found in the record.\n The lands are all parts of odd-numbered sections within \n\n[250 U.S. 387, 389]\n\u00a0\n the primary or place limits of the land grant made to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company by the Act of July 2, 1864, c. 217, 13 Stat. 365. At the date of that act they were public lands of the United States and they continued to be such at the time the line of road opposite which they lie was definitely located, save as their status was affected by a pending claim of the state under the swamp-land grant made by the Act of September 28, 1850, c. 84, 9 Stat. 519 (Comp. St.  4958-4960), and the Act of March 12, 1860, c. 5, 12 Stat. 3. This claim was shown by a swamp land selection list filed in the Land Department November 23, 1872, and was still pending in that department in 1892 and 195. In those years the state, without waiting for a determination of its claim by the department executed deeds for the lands to persons who in turn executed deeds therefor to the plaintiff. As to three of the tracts the swamp land claim was examined and rejected by the department some time before this suit was begun, and as to the other two it was still pending at that time.\n The definite location of the line of road opposite which the lands lie was effected by a map filed in the Land Department and approved June 29, 1883. The grant to the railroad company was of all the odd-numbered sections of public land within designated limits on either side of the line of road as so located, with an express exception of such lands as at the time of definite location were reserved, sold, etc., or were not 'free from pre-emption or other claims or rights.' There was also an express exclusion of all mineral lands and a provision that 'in lieu thereof a like quantity of unoccupied and unappropriated agricultural lands in odd- numbered sections nearest to the line of said road may be selected' under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior. By reason of the pendency of the swamp land claim at the time of the definite location all the tracts in question were expected from the grant of lands in place, and this whether \n\n[250 U.S. 387, 390]\n\u00a0\n the claim was well grounded or otherwise; that is to say, the fact that the claim was pending and undetermined prevented the lands from passing under the grant as place lands.

Musser-Sauntry Co., \n168 \nU.S. 604, 609\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 205. But through some mistake in the Land Department three of the tracts were erroneously patented to the railroad company as place lands between 1906 and 1909. Without doubt the patents passed the legal title, but the United States was entitled to a reconveyance from the railroad company and in equity remained the true owner. Germania Iron Co. v.

These selections were received by the local land office and were awaiting action by the Secretary of the Interior at the time of the trial.\n This suit was brought September 25, 1912. Shortly thereafter the railroad company, recognizing that the patents theretofore issued to it for three of the tracts had been erroneously issued, reconveyed the title to the United States and subsequently selected those tracts in lieu of other tracts in place excluded from the grant by reason of being mineral. These selections were received by the local land office; one was approved by the Secretary of the Interior and passed to patent, and the other two were at the time of the trial pending before that officer.\n The plaintiff made no effort by pleading or evidence to show that the swamp land claim was well gron ded or that he, his predecessors or the state, had in any way become entitled to receive the title from the United States.\n With some hesitation the trial court concluded that the lands were not excepted from the grant of lands in \n\n[250 U.S. 387, 391]\n\u00a0\n place by reason of the existence of the swamp land claim at the date of the definite location, and therefore that on the definite location, by which the place limits were identified, the title passed to the railroad company, the grant being one in praesenti as respects place lands falling within its terms and not within its excepting or excluding clauses, and the provision for patents being intended only to give further assurance. Deseret Salt Co. v. Tarpey, \n142 U.S. 241\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 158; Toltec Ranch Co. v. Cook, \n191 U.S. 532\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 166. On that theory a decree was entered quieting the title in the plaintiff as to all the tracts.\n But the court should have held that the swamp land claim pending, as it was, at the date of the definite location prevented these lands from passing under the grant of lands in place. The decisions of this court before cited leave no room for doubt on this point. The cases of Iowa R. Land Co. v. Blumer, \n206 U.S. 482\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 769, and Missouri Valley Land Co. v. Wiese, \n208 U.S. 234\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 294, relied on by the plaintiff, are not apposite. The lands there in question were within the place limits and at the time of definite location were free from other claims; so they were not excepted from the grant, as here, but passed from the government on the definite location. It follows that as to the three tracts erroneously patented as before shown the railroad company had no title, legal or equitable, prior to the issue of the patents. Up to that time the title was in the United States, and of course no prescriptive right was acquired against it under the local statute. Besides, the title received through those patents was turned back to the United States before the trial and this operated to restore the three tracts to their prior status as public lands. The title under those patents-and it was merely the naked legal title-did not remain in the railroad company for anything like the period named in the local statute, if that be material. As to the other two tracts the railroad company up to the time the suit was brought had nothing \n\n[250 U.S. 387, 392]\n\u00a0\n more than pending lieu land selections which required the approval of the Secretary of the Interior to make them effective (Wisconsin Central R. R. Co. v. Price County, \n133 \nU.S. 496, 512\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 341, 33 L. Ed., 687), but as yet they had not received his approval.\n The situation then at the time the case was heard in the trial court was this: The railroad company had neither the legal nor the equitable title to four of the tracts. Instead, the full title was in the United States and all existing claims to them arising under the land grants and other public land laws were pending in the Land Department, whose officers were specially charged be law with their examination and determination and with the disposal of the title accordingly. It is settled that in such a situation the courts may not take up the adjudication of the pending claims, but must await the decision of the land of officers and the issue of patents in regular course. Michigan Land & Lumber Co. v. Rust, \n168 \nU.S. 589, 592\n, 594 S., 18 Sup. Ct. 208; Brown v. Hitchcock, \n73 U.S. 473\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 485; Cosmos Exploration Co. v. Gray Eagle Oil Co., \n190 \nU.S. 301, 315\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 692, 24 Sup. Ct. 860; Humbird v. Avery, \n195 \nU.S. 480, 502\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 123. There is, however, a related jurisdiction which the courts may exercise pending the final action of those officers; they may protect a possession lawfully acquired or restore one wrongfully interrupted, for that is a matter which is not confided to the Land Department and may be dealt with by the courts in the exerciseo f their general power. Gauthier v. Morrison, \n232 \nU.S. 452, 461\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 384.\n Whether the tracts as to which the swamp land claim is still pending were such as came within the terms of the swamp land grant is a question of fact the decision of which is expressly committed to the Land Department; and this also is true of the question whether the tracts covered by the railroad company's lieu land selections were when the selections were tendered so occupied and appropriated as not properly to be subject to acquisition \n\n[250 U.S. 387, 393]\n\u00a0\n in that way. The approval or disapproval by the Secretary of the Interior of such lieu selections is not merely a formal act. It involves an exercise of sound, but not arbitrary, discretion and makes it admissible for him, where a selection is proffered for land which a bona fide occupant, misinformed and misunderstanding his rights, has reclaimed and improved at large cost, to reject the selection and hold the title in the United States until, as this court has said, 'within the limits of existing law or by special act of Congress,' the occupant may be enabled to obtain title from the United States. Williams v. United States, \n138 \nU.S. 514, 524\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 457, 461 (34 L. Ed. 1026).\n As to the fifth tract the railroad company at the time of the trial held a patent issued pending the suit on a lieu land selection but recently initiated; so the prescriptive right asserted by the plaintiff could not possibly include that tract. If, as he asserts, the tract was so occupied or appropriated that it properly could not be selected and patented in lieu of land in place found to be mineral, that may afford an adequate basis for a suit by the United States to cancel the patent ( Diamond Coal & Coke Co. v. United States, \n233 U.S. 236\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 507), or afford a basis for holding the railroad company as a trustee of the title for him if, notwithstanding the silence of the present record on the subject, he was entitled to a patent for the tract ( Svor v. Morris, \n227 \nU.S. 524, 529\n, 530 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 385); but it does not enable him to complain on behalf of the United States or to assail the patent collaterally (Hoofnagle v. Anderson, 7 Wheat. 212, 214, 215; Smelting Co. v. Kemp, \n104 U.S. 636\n, 647; Bohall v. Dilla, \n114 \nU.S. 47, 51\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 782; Sparks v. Pierce, \n115 U.S. 408\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 102; Fisher v. Rule, \n248 \nU.S. 314, 318\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 122).\n The Supreme Court of the state in its final opinion came nearer the views here expressed than did the trial court, but it assumed that the reconveyance by the railroad company to the United States was not accepted by the latter and so was of no effect. In this the court was mis \n\n[250 U.S. 387, 394]\n\u00a0\n taken, for it affirmatively appears not only that the land officers after the reconveyance entertained the lieu selections of the same tracts, but also that they approved one of those selections and passed it to patent. Besides, the ultimate judgment entered by the court departs somewhat- possibly through a clerical inadvertence-from its final opinion.\n The judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the views here expressed.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","147":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNORTHERN PAC. RY. CO. v. PUGET SOUND & W.H. RY. CO.(1919)\nNo. 327\nArgued: April 28, 1919Decided: June 2, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 332, 333]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Lorenzo B. Da Ponte, of Tacoma, Wash., and C. W. Bunn and Charles Donnelly, both of St. Paul, Minn., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Heman H. Field, of Chicago, Ill., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The defendant in error, Puget Sound & Willapa Harbor Railway Company, hereinafter designated the Willapa Company, a railroad corporation organized under the laws of the state of Washington, in the construction of a new line of railroad in 1914, found it necessary to cross at grade, at two places, tracks which had been constructed in 1890-1892 by the plaintiff in error, Northern Pacific Railway Company, hereinafter designated the Pacific Company, a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Wisconsin.\n In appropriate proceedings, provided for by the state law, the Public Service Commission of the state of Washington granted authority and permission to the Willapa Company to cross the tracks of the Pacific Company at grade at the two designated places. This permission was subject to the condition that suitable interlocking devices, of a type to be agreed upon between the two companies, should be installed at the crossings. The companies agreed upon all of the conditions involved in the crossing of their tracks, excepting as to the cost of installing and maintaining the required interlocking devices, \n\n[250 U.S. 332, 334]\n\u00a0\n and upon due submission of this question to the commission it was decided that the entire expense should be borne by the junior, the Willapa Company. The superior court affirmed this holding by the commission, but on appeal the Supreme Court of the state, in the decision which we are reviewing, reversed the two lower tribunals and ruled that the expense should be divided equally between the two companies.\n The decision of the Supreme Court of Washington is based upon the interpretation which it placed upon applicable state statutes enacted in 1913 (chapter 3, Laws of Washington 1913, p. 74), and the case is presented to this court on the single assignment of error:\n'That the state Supreme Court erred in holding and deciding that chapter 30 of the Laws of Washington of 1913, as construed and applied to the facts of this case, is not repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.'\n\n Conceding that the construction placed upon the state statute by the state Supreme Court will be accepted by this court, the contention of the Pacific Company is that, when that company entered the state of Washington and constructed its line, an act of the Legislature, passed in 1888 (Laws 1887-88, p. 63) was in effect, which gave to railway companies formed under the act the right to cross any other railway theretofore constructed, but subject to conditions which the state Supreme Court held, in 1908, in State v. Northern Pacific Railway Co., 49 Wash. 78, 94 Pac. 907, required the junior company to pay the entire cost of the crossing, including the installing and maintaining of interlocking devices where necessary; that this constituted a vested right of property in the senior company, and that the later statute of 1913, which the Supreme Court held in this case required it to bear one-half of the cost of installing and maintaining the interlocker, deprived it of its property without due process of law. \n\n[250 U.S. 332, 335]\n\u00a0\n It is admitted in argument that the act assailed would be validly applicable to apportioning the cost of crossings of highways and railroads, regardless of the dates of their construction (New York & New England Railroad v. Bristol, \n151 U.S. 556\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 437; Chicago, etc., Railroad Co. v. Chicago, \n166 U.S. 226\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 581), and that it would be valid as applied to crossings of railroad lines constructed prior to its enactment where no contract had been entered into with respect to the protection of the crossing (Detroit, etc., Railway v. Osborn, \n189 U.S. 383\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 540). But it is contended that it is not a valid law as applied to the case at bar, where the road of the Pacific Company was constructed at a time when the state law imposed the entire cost of the construction and maintenance of the crossing upon the junior company.\n Obviously this is a slender thread on which to hang a grave constitutional argument, and it is difficult to treat it seriously.\n At most, the earlier statute, and the interpretation which the state Supreme Court placed upon it, was a rule of law applicable to the assessment of damages in a proceeding to appropriate a crossing to which a junior company was entitled by the statute. It was no part of the charter of the Pacific Company, which was organized under the Wisconsin law, and that company had no vested right to insist that the rule should not be changed by statute or by court decision.

Ct. 392.\n While this is sufficient to dispose of the case, it may be added that the act of 1913 was passed in an obviously legitimate and customary exercise of the police power of the state to protect travelers and employes from injury and death at such crossings, and also to protect property in \n\n[250 U.S. 332, 336]\n\u00a0\n the custody of the carriers from damage. It has long been settled law that the imposing of uncompensated charges, involved in obeying a law, passed in a reasonable exercise of the police power, is not a taking of property without due process of law, within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

Garber, of Birmingham, Ala., for appellants.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Brown, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Section 162 of the Judicial Code, enacted March 3, 1911 (36 Stat. 1139, c. 231 [Comp. St.  1153]), provides as follows:\n'The Court of Claims shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the claims of those whose property was taken subsequent to June 1, 1865, under the provisions of the act of Congress approved March 12, 1863, entitled 'An act to provide for the collection of abandoned property and for the prevention of frauds in insurrectionary districts within the United States,' and acts amendatory thereof, where the property so taken was sold and the net proceeds thereof were placed in the Treasury of the United States; and the Secretary of the Treasury shall return said net proceeds to the owners thereof, on the judgment of said court, and full jurisdiction is given to said court to adjudge said claims, any statutes of limitations to the contrary notwithstanding.'\n\n To avail herself of that section Isabel Kouns O'Pry alleged herself to be the sole surviving descendant and sole heir of John Kouns and brought this suit in the Court of Claims and for grounds thereof set forth the following facts:\n June 6, 1865, George L. Kouns and John Kouns were owners of 900 bales of cotton in two lots, of which 350 bales had been raised in Texas and 550 bales raised in Louisiana, and after the cessation of \n\n[249 U.S. 323, 325]\n\u00a0\n hostilities were brought to New Orleans, June 6, 1865. The cotton was worth the sum of $123,110.\n On that date-June 6, 1865-the act of Congress of July 2, 1864 (13 Stat. 375, c. 225), was in force, section 8 of which made it lawful for the Secretary of the Treasury, with the approval of the President, to authorize agents to purchase for the United States products of states declared in insurrection at designated places at such prices as might be agreed on with the seller, not exceeding three-fourths of the market value at the latest quotation in the city of New York.\n (The other provisions of the statute are not necessary to quote.)\n The act of July 2, 1864, was an amendment of the act of March 3, 1863, entitled 'An act to provide for the collection of abandoned property and the prevention of frauds in insurrectionary districts within the United States.' 12 Stat. 820, c. 120.\n In pursuance of the authority thus conferred the Secretary of the Treasury designated, among other cities, the city of New Orleans as a place of purchase and by a subsequent regulation directed that the agents appointed should receive all the cotton brought to the places designated as places of purchase and forthwith return to the seller three-fourths of the cotton or sell the same and retain out of the price thereof the difference between three-fourths of the market price and the full price thereof in the city of New York.\n The agent appointed at New Orleans was Otis N. Cutler, and, on the arrival of the Kouns cotton, Cutler, as such agent, took possession of it and refused to release the same or to allow the owners to have any custody of it until they paid him one-fourth of its market value, being the sum of $ 30,777.50. They paid the same under protest and it was placed in the Treasury of the United States, where it remains.\n June 13, 1865, the President removed by proclamation all \n\n[249 U.S. 323, 326]\n\u00a0\n restrictions upon intercourse and trade in products of states theretofore in insurrection and theretofore imposed in the territory east (italics ours) of the Mississippi river.\n Thereafter the Kounses brought suit in a New York court against Cutler, which was removed to the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York. The ground of Cutler's liability was alleged to be that his retention of the cotton and the exaction of money from them was unwarranted in law. They recovered judgment, but it was reversed by the Supreme Court of the United States (Cutler v. Kouns, \n110 U.S. 720\n, 4 Sup. Ct. 274) and a new trial ordered. The suit was then dismissed.\n The loyalty of the appellants is alleged. The Court of Claims dismissed the suit upon the demurrer of the government. The court expressed the opinion that the claim did not come either 'within the letter or the spirit of section 162 and the correlative statutes' and said:\n'At the time of this transaction the Kouns firm could not have made any disposal of the cotton in question had it not been for the provision of said section 8, it being insurrectionary territory. That section prescribed the method and the conditions upon which it might be sold to the government. The firm complied with those conditions and were doubtless glad to do so. We do not think where one complies with the law in his transaction with the government in the sale of cotton and receives all that the law allows him he has any valid claim under section 162 of the Judicial Code.'\n\n To fulfill the conditions of necessary parties on account of a doubt expressed by the court, there was an intervening petition by Charles Schneidau, assignee in bankruptcy of George L. Kouns. He adopted the petition of Isabel Kouns O'Pry 'and jointly with her claims as therein prayed.'\n By order of the court the petition was amended and \n\n[249 U.S. 323, 327]\n\u00a0\n Schneidau made a party claimant. The government's demurrer to the petition as amended was sustained.\n The case is not in broad compass, involving as it does only the relation and construction of statutes, but it is not easy to state it briefly. The petition recites, as we have seen, that the Kounses in their lifetime brought suit against the agent of the government, Cutler, who had seized the cotton in New Orleans and exacted payment from them of one- fourth of its value, granting them, however, the indulgence of paying it in three installments, respectively, June 12, June 15, and June 20, 1865. They charged Cutler with an unlawful seizure of the cotton and an unlawful exaction of the money. They obtained judgment in the Circuit Court, but the judgment was reversed by this court (\n110 U.S. 720\n, 4 Sup. Ct. 274), and the following is, so far as material, a summary of the decision in the case:\n In consequence of the act of July 13, 1861 (12 Stat. 255, c. 3), it was lawful for the President to declare that the inhabitants of all states in rebellion against the United States were in a state of insurrection and that all commercial intercourse between them should cease and be unlawful so long as such condition of hostilities should continue. And August 16, 1861 (12 Stat. 1262) the states of Texas and Louisiana were declared to be in like condition and intercourse was forbidden between them and other states and parts of the United States. On April 12, 1862, the city of New Orleans, however, was occupied by the national forces and from that date was excepted from the operation of the Nonintercourse Act.\n In this state of affairs Congress passed the act of July 2, 1864, referred to in the petition, section 8 of which authorized the purchase of products of states declared in insurrection, which included the cotton in suit, and it was seized by virtue of such authority and the payments mentioned \n\n[249 U.S. 323, 328]\n\u00a0\n exacted. It was contended that the cotton was exempt from such action by proclamation of the President of June 13, 1865. The contention was rejected, the cotton not being, as it was said, the product of territory east of the Mississippi river. It was, however, further urged that the President's proclamation of June 24, 1865, removed all restrictions as well from products of territory west of the Mississippi river. To this it was replied that upon the arrival of the cotton in New Orleans the rights of the government to it became fixed and that at such time 'one-fourth its value was as much the property of the government as the other three- fourths were the property of the defendants in error [the Kounses]. No proclamation of the President could transfer the property of the government to them.' It was hence decided that Cutler 'had authority under the law and regulations of the Treasury Department to exact the money' which the suit was brought to recover. The defense of the statute of limitations was also sustained.\n It is now asserted that notwithstanding such decision a claim has accrued to appellants by virtue of section 162 of the Judicial Code upon which they are entitled to recover. It will be observed by reference to that section that the Court of Claims is given jurisdiction of claims of those whose property was taken subsequent to June 1, 1865, under the provisions of the act of March 3, 1863, 'and acts amendatory thereof,' where the property was sold and its net proceeds were placed in the Treasury of the United States, and they are directed to be returned upon judgment rendered for the claimant. Appellants invoke the relief of these provisions by the contention that the cotton was taken under the provisions of the act of March 3, 1863, because the act of July 2, 1864, was an amendment to it, and that therefore the provision of section 162 of the Judicial Code is completely satisfied; in other words, that the money exacted was taken under the \n\n[249 U.S. 323, 329]\n\u00a0\n act of March 3, 1863 'and acts amendatory thereof.' It is further contended that the conditions of section 162 being thus satisfied it is no answer to say that the seizure of the cotton was legal, it being the intention of Congress to declare that even in such case 'the proceeds should be returned to the owners.' And this contention counsel offers as an answer to Cutler v. Kouns, supra, and that Congress having by section 162 opened the doors of the Court of Claims 'to claimants whose property was seized after June 1, 1865, they can no longer be met with the defense that because the seizure was lawful when made, there can be no recovery on account of it. To sustain such a defense would be 'to keep the word of promise to the ear and break it to the hope.\" The government opposes the contentions.\n The act of March 3, 1863 (12 Stat. 820), is entitled 'An act to provide for the collection of abandoned property and for the prevention of frauds in insurrectionary districts within the United States.' Its first section empowers the Secretary of the Treasury to appoint a special agent or special agents to collect and receive all abandoned or captured property in any state or territory in, insurrection, with an exception not material. Section 2 provides that the property so received or collected may be put to public use or sold at public auction and the proceeds thereof put into the Treasury of the United States. By section 3 a bond may be required of the agent or agents, who may be required to keep a book or books of accounts showing those from whom the property was received, the cost of transportation and proceeds of sale. It is further provided that the owner of the property may at any time within two years prefer a claim for the proceeds thereof and upon proof of loyalty receive the residue of the proceeds.\n It will be observed that the act had a special purpose and was directed to the receipt and collection of property \n\n[249 U.S. 323, 330]\n\u00a0\n in a particular condition, either abandoned or captured, recognizing however, that there might be a just claim to it, but limiting the assertion of the claim to two years after the suppression of the rebellion.\n The act of July 2, 1864 (13 Stat. 375), describes itself to be 'An act in addition to the several acts concerning commercial intercourse between loyal and insurrectionary states, and to provide for the collection of captured and abandoned property, and the prevention of frauds in states declared in insurrection.' The act, therefore, is declared to be an 'addition' to preceding legislation, not an amendment to it. Is an addition the same as an amendment? We are informed by the dictionaries that in addition the added parts remain independent and by amendment there is change and, it may be improvement. The words and the processes they respectively describe may, however, be regarded as roughly or even accurately interchangeable and in investigating the meaning of legislation we must regard that possibility and resolve a doubt in the words by the purpose of the legislation. In other words, whatever the relation of the statutes, their purpose must be looked to to determine the application to them of section 162. So looked to, we agree with the government that the purpose of the act of July 2, 1864, demonstrates the contrary of the contention of appellants, and that the act was strictly in addition to prior acts and not an amendment of the act of March 3, 1863 in the sense asserted. The latter act applied to a different situation. The cotton collected under it and to which its provisions applied might be the property of those innocent of disloyalty, but victims of the disorder and violence of the times, and the government constituted itself a trustee for them and gave them the opportunity, at any time within two years after the suppression of the rebellion, to establish their right to the proceeds, requiring of them nothing but proof of loyalty and ownership.

Klein, 13 Wall. 128.\n The cotton in the present case, unlike that to which the act of March 3 applied, was the subject of a business enterprise and taken to a market opened by the United States forces upon the conditions expressed in the act of July 2, 1864-that is, that its owners should turn over to the government one-fourth of the cotton, or its money equivalent, which would immediately become the property of the United States. Cutler v. Kouns, supra. The conditions in the two situations, therefore, are in broad contrast and it could not have been the intention of section 162 to confound the conditions. The section did no more than remove the bar of limitation of time to sue that was given by the act of March 3, 1863.

C., for appellees. \n\n[250 U.S. 501, 502]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a decree of the District Court for the Southern District of New York, dismissing plaintiff's (appellant's) bill for want of jurisdiction.\n The District Court certifies: That the case was heard on the bill of complaint and a motion by the defendants to dismiss for want of jurisdiction, that the court ruled that the cause of action stated in the bill is an action on a contract and is not a suit arising under the patent laws of the United States, and that the bill was dismissed for want of jurisdiction, solely because it showed on its face that the matter in controversy is less than $3,000.\n The bill shows the requisite diversity of citizenship to give the court jurisdiction, but the amount claimed is only $1,800, and therefore it did not have jurisdiction (Judicial Code [Act March 3, 1911, c. 231]  24, par. 1, 36 Stat. 1901 [Comp. St.  991]), unless the case is one arising under the patent laws of the United States.\n The contention of the appellant is that the suit is one for infringement of a patent and arises under the patent laws, and that therefore the Court had jurisdiction, regardless of the amount involved, Judicial Code,  24, par. 7.\n The allegations of the bill are: That the plaintiff was an inventor of a new and useful 'steam trap,' upon which he was granted letters patent No. 837,711; that on September 8, 1914, he made a grant, in writing, to one of the defendants, to which the other defendant succeeded, of the 'sole and exclusive right to manufacture and sell all apparatus covered by the patent,' ... 'during the whole term of said patent,' and that on the same date the defendant, assignee of the patent, agreed in writing to pay plaintiff, in addition to the sum paid for the assignment, $100 within six months, and a royalty thereafter of $5 upon each 'apparatus' sold until there should be received on account of such royalties the sum of $1,800. It is further \n\n[250 U.S. 501, 503]\n\u00a0\n alleged that the defendants had sold a large number of patented 'steam traps,' but had accounted and paid for the sale of only five, and that they pretend that the others which they are manufacturing and selling are not covered by the letters patent granted to the plaintiff, and, finally, that the legal title to the patent involved is held by the defendants to use, and pay for the use of, the invention according to the terms of the written contract of September 8, 1914\n\n\n The prayer is for a discovery of the number of 'steam traps' covered by the patent which the defendants have sold and for a decree that they 'account for and pay over to your orator the amount of royalties thereon, which the defendants are required to do under the agreement herein referred to,' and for the costs of suit.\n Thus, neither the allegations nor the prayer of the bill aims at annulling or even modifying either the assignment of the patent or the contract on account of the breach of the latter, but, on the contrary, plainly, the case intended to be stated, is one to enforce the contract and collect the royalties stipulated in it. Infringement of the patent is not alleged, but, on the contrary, a completed grant and assignment of the legal title to it is pleaded, sufficient on its face, while unmodified, to disable the plaintiff from maintaining a suit for any infringement subsequent to the date of such assignment.\n To constitute a suit under the patent laws the 'plaintiff must set up some right, title or interest under the patent laws, or at least make it appear that some right or privilege will be defeated by one construction, or sustained by the opposite construction, of these laws.' Pratt v. Paris Gaslight & Coke Co., \n168 \nU.S. 255, 259\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 62, 64 (42 L. Ed. 458).\n The party who brings suit is 'master to decide what law he will rely upon,' and the allegations of his bill are the evidence, or the expression, of his decision, upon which the courts must act in determining the question of \n\n[250 U.S. 501, 504]\n\u00a0\n their jurisdiction.

Ct. 658.\n It is too clear for discussion that the case stated in the bill is a suit for royalties based on the contract, and not at all involving the construction of any law relating to patents. It has been often decided by this court that such a suit is not one arising under the patent laws, and since less than the requisite jurisdictional amount is claimed the District Court did not err in dismissing the bill.

Fisher, of Manila, P. I., for Erlanger & Galinger.\n\n\n[248 U.S. 521, 523]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are cross appeals from a judgment on a complaint for salvage of cargo brought by Erlanger & Galinger to which the defendant, Oelwerke Teutonia, answered denying the services and setting up a counterclaim for damages alleged to have been caused by the negligence and incompetence of the plaintiffs. The Court of First Instance found for the plaintiffs and awarded to them one-half of the net proceeds of the property saved. On appeal the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, while otherwise confirming the findings of the Court of First Instance, reduced the award to forty per cent. of the main part of the cargo, which was copra, and to twenty per cent. of a small item of agar agar which does not need further mention. We assume that the plaintiffs receive a corresponding proportion of the interest accruing upon the fund. \n\n[248 U.S. 521, 524]\n\u00a0\n The main facts are these. The steamship Nippon, loaded principally with copra, went aground on Scarborough Reef, 120 or 130 miles from Luzon, in the afternoon of May 8, 1913. The next day the chief officer and nine of the crew were sent off in the only seaworthy small boat in search of help and on the twelfth reached Santa Cruz, Luzon, and telegraphed to Manila for 'immediate assistance for saving crew.' Help was sent at once and on the 13th the captain and crew went to Hong Kong on a mail steamer that stopped for them, the captain preferring to take that course rather than to go to Manila by a coast guard cutter that had been sent to the wreck. On May 14 the plaintiffs chartered a cutter, and took possession of the Nippon on the 17th. Shortly after this the work of salvage was begun. It was finished in July when the vessel, the claim for which has been paid, and a great part of the cargo were saved.\n There were protests on behalf of interested parties after the plaintiffs had started, and it is denied that the vessel was abandoned. But all the earliest communications and circumstances indicate that the only hope when the chief officer left the ship was to save the lives of those left on board, and that there was no greater expectation when the captain was taken off. It is unnecessary to say more about the evidence than that it shows no ground for departing from the usual rule when two courts have agreed about the facts. As the only point of difference with regard to them concerns the amount of salvage allowed, that is the only question upon which we shall say a word.\n Unless there has been some violation of principle or clear mistake, appeals to this Court concerning the amount of the allowance are not encouraged. Hobart v. Drogan, 10 Pet. 108, 119; Post v. Jones, 19 How. 150, 160. The plaintiffs complain that their expenses were not taken into account or were not given sufficient consideration. But, as was pointed out by the Court below, the \n\n[248 U.S. 521, 525]\n\u00a0\n cost was their affair. There was no contract and no request. They went into a speculation and their only claim is a lien upon goods that they have rescued for a share in the saving that they have made for the owners. The right to share in a benefit that is the result of their work is the only ground upon which the plaintiffs can stand. Of course, within that limit the necessary work and the danger are matters to be considered. Here the danger might have been great but it was not, and the work seems to deserve neither much praise nor much blame. There was more of commercial speculation and less of help not to be found elsewhere than is usual in salvage cases, and we are not prepared to say that the Supreme Court ought to have allowed more. We are equally unprepared to say that it should have allowed less. The services were rendered rightfully and were fairly efficient. Neither side would be likely to inspire enthusiasm and both justly may be left where they were left by the Court below.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","151":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOHIO VALLEY ELECTRIC R.

Richardson, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for defendants in error.\n\n\n[251 U.S. 104, 106]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1909 the owners platted Linwood Place, adjacent to Oklahoma City, for building lots, streets, etc. To procure extension of a street car line therein, they dedicated a strip forty feet in width, lying along the center of what is now known as Linwood Boulevard, to plaintiff in error's predecessor, 'its successors and assigns, with a like effect as though deeded and conveyed to said company in fee simple by separate deed,' on condition, however, that the property should be subject to reasonable police regulations, that the grantee should construct crossings over the tracks and also put down curbing and pave the crossings whenever the boulevard itself should be paved. Subordinate to above grant the streets as shown on the plat were dedicated to the public for ordinary purposes of travel. Afterwards car tracks were laid in the center of the forty-foot strip and the corporate limits of Oklahoma City were extended to include Linwood Place.\n In order to provide funds for paving the public roadways along Linwood Boulevard, the city undertook in 1910 to lay a tax upon the adjacent property, and directed that it be apportioned according to benefits. The board of commissioners apportioned to the central strip as its proper share of the expenses, $12,046.16. Instead of assessing this amount directly against the property, the city council erroneously assessed it against the street car company. Thereafter, the city and the Severns Company, which had put down the paving, procured from the district court of Oklahoma county a mandamus directing a reassessment against the land itself, but a hearing upon objections thereto was not specifically provided for.\n The Supreme Court of the state (170 Pac. 216) declared:\n'The fee title to the strip of land in question \n\n[251 U.S. 104, 107]\n\u00a0\n here appears to be in the railway company. ... Its right is not merely an intangible privilege or an easement, but under the terms of the dedication is a fee simple title. ... The dominion and control of the strip of land in question here is not in the city authorities. If the street should be vacated by the city authorities, this private right-of-way would not revert to the abutting owners, but would continue to be the property of the railway company. The company took the fee from the original grantors by the dedication before the abutting owners acquired their titles.'\n\n It then held the land was subject to assessment according to benefits resulting from the paving, and--\n'that when the commissioners proceed in obedience to the decree of the court to reassess the property of the railway company an opportunity will be given to the company to be heard and to complain or object to the amount of the assessment.'\n\n Nevertheless, it ordered an affirmance of the judgment of the trial court, without more, and by so doing left in serious doubt the right of plaintiff in error to a new and adequate hearing in respect of the assessment. We think, therefore, that the judgment below should be modified and corrected so as definitely to preserve such right. So modified, it is affirmed. The costs here will be equally divided.\n The terms and conditions in the original franchise granted by Oklahoma City to the plaintiff in error, which require it, under given conditions, to pave or pay for paving certain portions of occupied streets, are not applicable in the circumstances here presented and cannot be relied upon to defeat the assessment now in question. The land supposed to be benefited belongs to the company; the city has made no contract which prevents imposition upon it of a fair share of the cost of beneficial improvements. L. & N. R. R. Co. v.

POLICE COURT(1919)\nNo. 31\nArgued: Decided: December 8, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[251 U.S. 22, 23]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. B. Bosley, of San Francisco, Cal., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Edward M. Cleary, of Washington, D. C., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the court.\n By ordinance the city of Sacramento made it the duty of--\n'every person, firm or corporation owning, controlling or operating any street railroad, suburban railroad, or interurban railroad upon and along any of the streets of the city of Sacramento shall, without cost to the city during the months of June, july, August, September and October of each year, and at such other times as may be necessary to keep the dust laid, sprinkle with water the surface of the street, occupied by such railroad, between the rails and tracks and for a sufficient distance beyond the outermost rails thereof, so as to effectually lay the dust and prevent the same from arising when the cars are in operation.'\n\n The gas company, plaintiff in error, operated lines of street railway in Sacramento under franchise granted by the city. It refused to obey the ordinance and was prosecuted in the city police court and there asserted that the ordinance was in conflict with the due process and equal protection of the laws clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n From a sentence imposing upon it a money penalty, it appealed to the superior court for the county of Sacramento, and from the judgment of that court confirming \n\n[251 U.S. 22, 24]\n\u00a0\n the conviction it prosecuted an appeal to the Supreme Court of the state, which court refused to review the case on the ground that it was without jurisdiction. Thereupon the company, alleging the illegality of the conviction upon various grounds, among others that the ordinance was repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment, petitioned the District Court of Appeal for the Third Appellate District for a writ of certiorari requiring the superior court to send up the record for review. The petition was demurred to as stating no cause of action and on the further ground that it disclosed no jurisdiction in the court to review. Although it expressed doubt on the subject, the court took jurisdiction, reviewed the conviction, held that the city had power under the state Constitution and laws to pass the ordinance and that it was not repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. The certiorari was refused. A review of this judgment was then asked at the hands of the Supreme Court of the state, but that court again refused to interfere on the ground of its want of jurisdiction. The writ of error which is before us was then prosecuted by the gas company to the judgment of the District Court of Appeal refusing to grant the writ of cortiorari.\n At the threshold a motion to dismiss requires to be considered. It is based upon the ground that the court below had, under the state Constitution and laws, no power to review by certiorari the action of the superior court and therefore that court was the court of last resort competent to decide the cause. But his disregards the fact that the District Court of Appeal assumed jurisdiction of the cause and that the Supreme Court of the state declined to review its judgment for want of jurisdiction. As whether, under the circumstances, the District Court of Appeal rightfully assumed jurisdiction by certiorari is a question of purely state law which we may not review, the judgment of that court is the judgment of the state \n\n[251 U.S. 22, 25]\n\u00a0\n court of last resort having power to consider the case and the motion to dismiss is denied.\n Besides the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States is relied upon in the assignments. In argument however that contention is based, not upon the impairment by the ordinance of any particular contract right, but upon the unwarranted burden which it is asserted would result from enforcing the ordinance as against the railroad company because of the general authority which it possessed under its franchises to operate its railroad in the streets. But this at once establishes that the consideration of the contract clause is negligible and hence that it is only necessary to pass upon the contentions under the due process and equal protection clauses. This results, since if the police power of the city, to provide by the ordinance for the protection of the health and safety of the people, was unrestrained by any contract provision, the police power necessarily dominated the right of the company under its franchises to use the streets and subjected that right to the authority to adopt the ordinances in question.\n Further, as the right of the city to adopt such ordinance, so far as the state Constitution and laws are concerned, is concluded by the decision below and as it is elementary that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not restrain the states in the exercise of their legitimate police power, it follows that the case narrows down to a consideration of whether the ordinance in question was generically embraced by the police power of the state and, if it was, whether the power was so abused as to cause its exertion to exceed the limits of the police power, thus bringing the ordinance under the prohibitions of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n That the regulation made by the ordinance was in herently \n\n[251 U.S. 22, 26]\n\u00a0\n within the police power is we think too clear for anything but statement. We cite in the margin, however, decided cases dealing with the subject, in some of which the power here in question when exerted for the same purpose and to the same extent was upheld, and in others of which, although the manifestations of the exercise of the power were somewhat different, its existence was accepted as indisputable, and to text-writers who state the same view. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n That the power possessed was on the face of the ordinance not unreasonably exerted and therefore that its exercise was not controlled by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is, we are also of opinion, equally clear. And this is true likewise of the contention as to the equal protection clause of the amendment, since that proposition rests upon the obviously unwarranted assumption that no basis for classification resulted from the difference between the operation of the street railway cars moving on tracks in the streets of the city and the movement of a different character of vehicles in such streets.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Milwaukee v.

The suit was brought in the District Court of the Canal Zone. The defendant, the plaintiff in error, demurred to the declaration generally, and also demurred specifically to that part that claimed damages for pain. The demurrer was overruled \n\n[249 U.S. 41, 43]\n\u00a0\n and there was a trial, at which, after the evidence was in, the defendant requested the Court to direct a verdict in its favor and, failing that, to instruct the jury that the plaintiff could not recover for physical pain. The instructions were refused, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff and the judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 239 Fed. 303, 152 C. C. A. 291, followed in Panama R. Co. v. Toppin (C. C. A.) 250 Fed. 989.\n The main question in the case is whether the liability of master for servant familiar to the common law can be applied to this accident arising in the Canal Zone. Subordinate to that is the one already indicated, whether there can be a recovery for physical pain. There is some slight attempt also to argue that the defendant's negligence was not the immediate cause of the injury, but as that depended upon the view that the jury might take of the facts and as there was evidence justifying the verdict, we shall confine ourselves to the two above-mentioned questions of law.\n By the Act of Congress of April 28, 1904, c. 1758,  2, 33 Stat. 429, temporary powers of government over the Canal Zone were vested in such persons and were to be exercised in such manner as the President should direct. An executive order of the President addressed to the Secretary of War on March 8, 1904, directed that the power of the Isthmian Commission should be exer cised under the Secretary's direction. The order contained this passage, 'The laws of the land, with which the inhabitants are familiar, and which were in force on February 26, 1904, will continue in force in the canal zone ... until altered or annulled by the said commission'; with power to the Commission to legislate, subject to approval by the Secretary. This was construed to keep in force the Civil Code of the Republic of Panama, which was translated into English and pub lished \n\n[249 U.S. 41, 44]\n\u00a0\n by the Isthmian Canal Commission in 1905. By the Act of Congress of August 24, 1912, c. 390,  2, 37 Stat. 560, 561 (Comp. St.  10038):\n'All laws, orders, regulations, and ordinances adopted and promulgated in the Canal Zone by order of the President for the government and sanitation of the Canal Zone and the construction of the Panama Canal are hereby ratified and confirmed as valid and binding until Congress shall otherwise provide.'\n\n On these facts it is argued that the defendant's liability is governed by the Civil Code alone as it would be construed in countries where the civil law prevails and that so construed the code does not sanction the application of the rule respondeat superior to the present case.\n But there are other facts to be taken into account before a decision can be reached. On December 5, 1912, acting under the authority of the before-mentioned Act of August 24, 1912,  3 (Comp. St.  10039), the President declared all the land within the limits of the Canal Zone to be necessary for the construction, etc., of the Panama Canal and directed the Chairman of the Isthmian Commission to take possession of it, with provisions for the extinguishment of all adverse claims and titles. It is admitted by the plaintiff in error that the Canal Zone at the present time is peopled only by the employes of the Canal, the Panama Railroad, and the steamship lines and oil companies permitted to do business in the Zone under license. If it be true that the Civil Code would have been construed to exclude the defendant's liability in the present case if the Zone had remained within the jurisdiction of Columbia it does not follow that the liability is no greater as things stand now. The President's order continuing the law then in force was merely the embodiment of the rule that a change of sovereignty does not put an end to existing private law, and the ratification of that order by the Act of August 24, 1912, no more fastened upon the Zone a specific interpretation of the former Civil \n\n[249 U.S. 41, 45]\n\u00a0\n Code than does a statute adopting the common law fasten upon a territory a specific doctrine of the English Courts. Wear v. Kansas, \n245 \nU.S. 154, 157\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 55, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 586. Probably the general ratification did no more than to supply any power that by accident might have been wanting. Honolulu Rapid Transit & Land Co. v. Wilder, \n211 \nU.S. 137, 142\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 44. In the matter of personal relations and duties of the kind now before us the supposed interpretation would not be a law with which the present 'inhabitants are familiar,' in the language of the President's order, but on the contrary an exotic imposition of a rule opposed to the common understanding of men. For whatever may be thought of the unqualified principle that a master must answer for the torts of his servant committed within the scope of his employment, probably there are few rules of the common law so familiar to all, educated and uneducated alike.\n As early as 1910 the Supreme Court of the Canal Zone announced that it would look to the common law in the construction of the Columbia statutes. Kung Ching Chong v. Wing Chong, 2 Canal Zone Sup. Ct. Rep. 25, 30, and following that announcement, in committed within the scope of his employment, the empresarios of railroads are concerned' the liability of master for servant would be maintained in the Zone to the same extent as recognized by the common law. Fitzpatrick v. Panama Railroad Co., 2 Canal Zone Sup. Ct. Rep. 111, 121, 128. The principle certainly was not overthrown by the Act of 1912. It is not necessary to dwell upon the drift toward the common law doctrine noticeable in some civil law jurisdictions at least, or to consider how far we should go if the language of the Civil Code were clearer than it is. It is enough that the language is not necessarily inconsistent with the common law rule. By article 2341, in the before-mentioned translation:\n'He who shall have been guilty of an offense or fault, which has caused another damage, is obliged to repair it, without \n\n[249 U.S. 41, 46]\n\u00a0\n prejudice to the principal penalty which the law imposes. ...'\n\n By article 2347:\n'Every person is liable not only for his own acts for the purpose of the indemnity of damage, but also for the acts of those who may be under his care,' illustrating by the cases of father, tutor, husband, etc.\n\n By article 2349:\n'Masters shall be responsible for the damage caused by their domestics or servants, on the occasion of a service rendered by the latter to the former; but they shall not be responsible if it be proved or appear that on such occasion the domestics or servants conducted themselves in an improper manner, which the masters had no means to foresee or prevent by the employment of ordinary care and the competent authority; in such case all responsibility for the damage shall fall upon said domestics or servants.'\n\n The qualification in this last article may be taken to refer to acts outside the scope of the employment. It cannot refer to all torts, for that would empty the first part of meaning. A master must be taken to foresee that sooner or later a servant driving a motor will be likely to have a collision, which a jury may hold to have been due to his negligence, whatever care has been used in the employment of the man.\n We are satisfied that it would be a sacrifice of substance to form if we should reverse a decision, the principle of which has been accepted by all the judges accustomed to deal with the locality, in deference to the possibility that a different interpretation might have been reached if the Civil Code had continued to regulate a native population and to be construed by native Courts. It may be that they would not have distinguished between a negligent act done in the performance of the master's business and a malicious one in which the servant went outside of the scope of that for which he was employed. But we are by no means sure that they would not have decided as we decide. At all events we are of opinion that the ruling was correct. As we do not rely for our conclusion upon a \n\n[249 U.S. 41, 47]\n\u00a0\n Columbia act specially concerning the empresarios of railroads, we do not discuss a suggestion, made only, it is said, to show that the act is inapplicable, to the effect that the charter of the Railroad Company did not grant the power to operate the omnibus line. The company was acting under the authority and direction of General Goethals and we do not understand that the defence of ultra vires is set up or could prevail.\n In view of our conclusion upon the main point but little need be said with regard to allowing pain to be considered in fixing the damages. It cannot be said with certainty that the Supreme Court of the Zone was wrong in holding that under the Civil Code damages ought to be allowed for physical pain. Fitzpatrick v.

RICHARD(1919)\nNo. 313\nArgued: April 24, 1919Decided: June 2, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Kearful, for appellants.\n Messrs. Britton H. Tabor and James B. Lucas, both of Checotah, Okl., for appellees. \n\n[250 U.S. 235, 236]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to enjoin two representatives of the Secretary of the Interior-the Superintendent and the cashier of the Five Civilized Tribes- from collecting future royalties on an oil and gas lease of land allotted to a Creek Indian and to compel them to surrender royalties already collected. In the District Court there was a decree for the defendants, which the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, one judge dissenting (Richard v. Parker), 245 Fed. 330, 157 C. C. A. 522. The District Court then complied with the mandate by entering a decree for the plaintiffs, and this the Circuit Court of Appeals declined to disturb. 257 Fed. 990. Appeals from the decisions of the latter bring the case here.\n The questions to be considered are whether the land covered by the lease is land from which restrictions on alienation have been removed, and whether the supervisory authority of the Secretary of the Interior over the collection, care and disbursement of the royalties has terminated.\n The land was part of the Creek tribal lands and was allotted under Act March 1, 1901, c. 676, 31 Stat. 861, and Act June 30, 1902, c. 1323, 32 Stat. 500; the allottee being a minor and an enrolled Indian of the full blood. In 1912, while he was yet a minor, the oil and gas lease was given by his guardian; the lease being approved by the court having jurisdiction of his estate and by the Secretary of the Interior. The allottee died in 1916, while still a minor, and left his father, a full- blood Creek Indian, as his only heir. Approximately $280,000 in royalties have accrued under the lease-part before and part since the allottee died. These royalties have been collected by the defendants pursuant to the terms of the lease and the regulations of the Secretary of the Interior and are being \n\n[250 U.S. 235, 237]\n\u00a0\n held by them in trust under a provision in the regulations which authorizes them to retain and care for such funds 'until such time or times as the payment thereof is considered best for the benefit of said lessor, or his or her heirs.' The plaintiffs are the administrators of the estate of the deceased allottee.\n By section 1 of the Act of May 27, 1908, c. 199, 35 Stat. 312, Congress declared that--\n'All allotted lands of enrolled full-bloods, and enrolled mixed- bloods of three-quarters of more Indian blood, including minors of such degrees of blood, shall not be subject to alienation, contract to sell, power of attorney, or any other incumbrance prior to April twenty-sixth, nineteen hundred and thirty-one, except that the Secretary of the Interior may remove such restrictions, wholly or in part, under such rules and regulations concerning terms of sale and disposal of the proceeds for the benefit of the respective Indians as he may prescribe.'\n\n There was no such removal in this instance and it is conceded that at the date of the lease and at the time of the allottee's death the alienation of the land was still restricted.\n By section 2 of the same act Congress declared that:\n'Leases of restricted lands for oil, gas or other mining purposes ... may be made, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, under rules and regulations provided by the Secretary of the Interior, and not otherwise.'\n\n The lease was given under this provision and was to run for a term of ten years and as much longer as oil or gas might be found in paying quantity. It provided, conformably to the regulations, that the Secretary of the Interior, through his representatives, should supervise all operations under the lease, that the royalties thereunder should be paid to his representatives, that, with exceptions not material here, the regulations as then or thereafter in force should be deemed part of the lease, and that in the event restrictions on alienation should be removed the \n\n[250 U.S. 235, 238]\n\u00a0\n supervision of the Secretary of the Interior over the lease should be relinquished at once and all further royalties thereunder should be paid to the lessor or the then owner of the lands.\n One of the regulations prescribed by the Secretary deals with the payment to lessors, their guardians, heirs, etc., of moneys collected as royalties by his representatives and specially authorizes the latter, as before indicated, to withhold such payment in whole or in part for such time as may be in accord with the best interests of the lessor or his heirs. It is under this regulation that the royalties already collected are being retained. The record indicates that a considerable portion of them has been invested in interest-bearing bonds of the United States, but as the propriety of this is not called in question, it may be passed without further notice.\n By the act of 1908, which imposed the restrictions on alienation and contained the leasing provision, Congress further declared, in section 9:\n'That the death of any allottee ... shall operate to remove all restrictions upon the alienation of said allottee's land: Provided, that no conveyance of any interest of any full-blood Indian heir in such land shall be valid unless approved by the court having jurisdiction of the settlement of the estate of said deceased allottee.'\n\n In the absence of the proviso it would be very plain that on the death of the allottee all restrictions on the alienation of the land allotted to him were removed. But the proviso is there and cannot be disregarded. It obviously limits and restrains what precedes it. In exact words it puts full-blood Indian heirs in a distinct and excepted class and forbids any conveyance of any interest of such an heir in such land unless it be approved by the court named. In other words, as to that class of heirs the restrictions are not removed but merely relaxed or qualified to the extent of sanctioning such conveyances as receive the court's approval. Conveyances \n\n[250 U.S. 235, 239]\n\u00a0\n without its approval fall within the ban of the restrictions. That the agency which is to approve or not is a state court is not material. It is the agency selected by Congress and the authority confided to it is to be exercised in giving effect to the will of Congress in respect of a matter within its control. Thus in a practical sense the court in exercising that authority acts as a federal agency; and this is recognized by the Supreme Court of the state. Marcy v. Board of Commissioners, 45 Okl. 1, 144 Pac. 611. Plainly, the restrictions have the same force and operate in the same way as if Congress had selected another agency, exclusively federal, such as the Superintendent of the Five Civilized Tribes.\n In cases presenting the question whether lands inherited from allottees by full-blood Indian heirs are freed from restrictions by section 9, and thus brought within another provision in the same act declaring that land 'from which restrictions have been of shall be removed' shall be taxable and subject to other civil burdens, the Supreme Court of the state and the federal court of that district have both held that under the proviso such land remains restricted in the hands of the full-blood heirs, and so is not within the taxing provision. Marcy v. Board of Commissioners, supra; United States v. Shock (C. C.) 187 Fed. 870.\n Entertaining a like view of the proviso, we conclude that the land covered by the lease is still restricted land.\n As to the other question this is the situation:\n Under the act of 1908, as already shown, leases of 'restricted lands' for oil and gas mining may be made with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, under regulations prescribed by him, 'and not otherwise.' The present lease was made and approved under that provision. The land was then restricted and the restrictions have not since been removed. Thus the event which the regulations and the lease declare shall terminate the supervision by the Secretary of the Interior of the \n\n[250 U.S. 235, 240]\n\u00a0\n collection, care and disbursement of the royalties has not occurred. Nor has the occasion for some supervision disappeared. The heir is a full- blood Indian, as was the allottee, and is regarded by the act as in need of protection, as was the allottee. In the absence of some provision to the contrary the supervision naturally falls to the Secretary of the Interior. R. S.  441, 463 (Comp. St.  681, 716); West v. Hitchcock, \n205 \nU.S. 80, 85\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 423. And see Catholic Bishop of Nesqually v. Gibbon, \n158 \nU.S. 155, 166\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 779. There is nothing to the contrary in the leasing provision or in any other of which we are aware. True, it is possible under the proviso in section 9 for the heir, if the court approves, to sell and convey his interest in the land. But that has not been done, and it well may be that the heir will remain the owner until the restrictions expire in regular course- April 26, 1931. There is nothing in the proviso indicating that it is intended in the meantime to take from the Secretary or to commit to the court the supervision of matters pertaining to the lease or the royalties. A purpose to do that doubtless would be plainly expressed.\n In this situation we think the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to supervise the collection, care and disbursement of the royalties has not terminated.\n Criticism is made of some of the regulations, but all that are material here seem to be well within the limits of the Secretary's authority, and the acts of his representatives in respect of the lease and the royalties, so far as questioned here, seem to be well within the regulations.\n It results that the original decree in the District Court was right and should stand, and that the second decree in that court and those in the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed.\n Decrees reversed. \n\n\n\n","156":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPARKER v. RILEY(1919)\nNo. 254\nArgued: Decided: May 19, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Kearful, for appellants.\n Mr. William J. Horton, of McAlester, Okl., for appellees. \n\n[250 U.S. 66, 67]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity to settle conflicting claims to royalties collected and accruing under an oil and gas lease of lands allotted to a fullblood Creek Indian as a homestead. The allottee died intestate in November, 1908, leaving a husband and two minor children as her only heirs. One of the children was born before and the other after March 4, 1906. Under the applicable law of descent each heir took and undivided one-third interest in the lands, subject to the estate specially given to the child born after March 4, 1906, by section 9 of the Act of May 27, 1908, c. 199, 35 Stat. 312. The lease was given in 1912 by the husband and children-the latter acting through their respective guardians-in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior, and was approved by that officer. \n1\n The royalties have been and are being regularly paid to an officer of the Indian Bureau under a provision in the lease, and he receives and holds them in trust for the lessors according to their respective interests. The District Court held that each heir was entitled to one-third of the royalties and directed that they be distributed on that basis. Riley v. Kelsey (D. C.) 218 Fed. 391. In the Circuit Court of Appeals that decree was affirmed, one judge dissenting. 243 Fed. 42, 155 C. C. A. 572.\n It is insisted here, as it was in the courts below, that under section 9 of the Act of May 27, 1908, the child born after March 4, 1906, is entitled to all the royalties accruing during her life, but not beyond April 26, 1931, or, if not to the royalties, to the income or interest therefrom during that period.\n The lands were allotted under the Acts of March 1, 1901, c. 676, 31 Stat. 861, and June 30, 1902, c. 1323, 32 \n\n[250 U.S. 66, 68]\n\u00a0\n Stat. 500, both of which provided that the homestead of each allottee should be inalienable for 21 years and on his death should remain for the use and support of his children, if any, born after the date which would entitle them to be enrolled and receive allotments of their own. By the Act of April 26, 1906, c. 1876, 34 Stat. 137, that date was changed to March 4, 1906, and as to certain allotments the restrictions on alienations were extended until April 26, 1931. With these matters in mind the provisions in the act of May 27, 1908, relied on here will be more readily understood.\n By its first section that act relieves certain allotments from all restrictions, and then declares:\n'All homesteads of said allottees enrolled as mixed-blood Indians having half or more than half Indian blood, including minors of such degrees of blood, and all allotted lands of enrolled full bloods, and enrolled mixed bloods of three-quarters or more Indian blood, including minors of such degrees of blood, shall not be subject to alienation, contract to sell, power of attorney, or any other incumbrance prior to April twenty-sixth, nineteen hundred and thirty- one, except that the Secretary of the Interior may remove such restrictions, wholly or in part, under such rules and regulations concerning terms of sale and disposal of the proceeds for the benefit of the respective Indians as he may prescribe. The Secretary of the Interior shall not be prohibited by this act from continuing to remove restrictions as heretofore.'\n\n By its second section it provides:\n'That leases of restricted lands for oil, gas or other mining purposes, leases of restricted homesteads for more than one year, and leases of restricted lands for periods of more than five years, may be made, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, under rules and regulations provided by the Secretary of the Interior, and not otherwise.'\n\n By its fifth section it declares that 'any attempted alienation' of lands while \n\n[250 U.S. 66, 69]\n\u00a0\n they are restricted and 'also any lease of such restricted land made in violation of law ... shall be absolutely null and void.' And its ninth section contains the following:\n'That the death of any allottee of the Five Civilized Tribes shall operate to remove all restrictions upon the alienation of said allottee's land: Provided, that no conveyance of any interest of any full-blood Indian heir in such land shall be valid unless approved by the court having jurisdiction of the settlement of the estate of said deceased allottee: Provided further, that if any member of the Five Civilized Tribes of one-half or more Indian blood shall die leaving issue surviving, born since March fourth, nineteen hundred and six, the homestead of such deceased allottee shall remain inalienable, unless restrictions against alienation are removed therefrom by the Secretary of the Interior in the manner provided in section one hereof, for the use and support of such issue, during their life or lives, until April twenty-sixth, nineteen hundred and thirty-one; but if no such issue survive, then such allottee, if an adult, may dispose of his homestead by will free from all restrictions; if this be not done, or in the event the issue hereinbefore provided for die before April twenty-sixth, nineteen hundred and thirty-one, the land shall then descend to the heirs, according to the laws of descent and distribution of the state of Oklahoma, free from all restrictions.'\n\n The allottee, as has been said, was an enrolled full-blood Creek Indian and died several months after the Act of May 27, 1908. The restrictions on the alienation of her homestead had not been removed, and among her heirs was a child-a daughter named Julia-born after March 4, 1906. In these circumstances a reading of section 9 makes it very plain that the restrictions did not terminate with the allottee's death, but remained in force, and also that the homestead was set apart for the \n\n[250 U.S. 66, 70]\n\u00a0\n 'use and support' of Julia during her life, but not beyond April 26, 1931. We need not stop to consider whether, strictly speaking, the right thus specially given to Julia was an estate for life or for years; for it evidently was not the purpose to make any nice distinctions along that line. Nor need we consider what effect a removal of the restrictions 'in the manner provided by section one' after the death of the allottee would have had on the relative rights of Julia and the other heirs; for no such removal was attempted or intended by the Secretary of the Interior.\n The oil and gas lease was to run for 10 years and as much longer as oil or gas was found in paying quantity. It was given and approved under the provision in section 2 dealing specially with the leasing of restricted lands and homesteads. All the heirs joined in the lease and it was designed to be for the benefit of all. Nothing in it or in the provision under which it was given suggests that the rights of the heirs, as among themselves, were to be altered or affected. The oil and gas were to be extracted and taken by the lessee, and for this royalties in money were to be paid. These minerals were part of the homestead, and the lease was to operate as a sale of them as and when they were extracted. In that sense the heirs were exchanging a part of the homestead for the money paid as royalties, but no heir was surrendering any right to the others. Thus the rights of all in the royalties were the same as in the homestead. Nothing in the Act of May 27, 1908, makes to the contrary. Under the provision in section nine specially providing for issue born after March 4, 1906, Julia was entitled for her support to the exclusive use of the entire homestead while she lived, but not beyond April 26, 1931, and those who took the fee took it subject to that right. The rights of all in the royalties must, as we think, be measured by that standard. In this view Julia is entitled to the use of the royalties, that is to say, the interest or income which may be ob \n\n[250 U.S. 66, 71]\n\u00a0\n tained by properly investing them, during the same period, leaving the principal, like the homestead, to go to the heirs in general on the termination of her special right.\n Our conclusion on this point is in accord with the general trend of decisions in the oil and gas mining regions in similar situations.

Kleeberg, all of New York City, for petitioners.\n Messrs. William St. John Tozer, of New York City, and Henry Buist, of Charleston, S. C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity brought in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York, by persons formerly doing business as partners under the name S. H. P. Pell & Co., to restrain the defendants from proceeding with a suit against them in South Carolina charging them with fraud in partnership transactions in cotton and seeking to recover a million and a half of dollars. The bill was dismissed on demurrer for want of equity by the District Court, 254 Fed. 356, and for want of jurisdiction by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 256 Fed. 512. It is brought here by certiorari (No. 311) and by appeal (No. 335).\n The ground of jurisdiction set up is that the bill is ancillary to proceedings in bankruptcy against S. H. P. Pell & Co. in the same district. The present plaintiff Thompson was the only party served in the South Carolina suit and he alleges that he was a special partner under the laws of New York, that he was adjudicated not to be liable as a general partner in the bankruptcy proceedings and that the Court had ancillary jurisdiction to make its decree respected. The other partners set up a discharge under a \n\n[250 U.S. 573, 575]\n\u00a0\n composition but as they were not served with process in South Carolina the only question raised before us is whether Thompson can maintain the bill.\n The bill discloses the following facts: After the appointment of receivers in the bankruptcy proceedings petitions were filed to have Thompson declared a general partner and adjudicated a bankrupt with the other members of the firm. Later an offer of composition was made by the firm in consideration of the discharge of the bankrupts from their debts and the release of Thompson from liability to S. H. P. Pell & Co. and to any creditor of the firm who should assent to the composition. By the terms of the composition Thompson gave up a scheduled claim of over three million dollars and assumed obligations of over two million dollars for which property of his was pledged. Pursuant to this offer an agreement was made between Thompson and the receivers by which Thompson accepted the composition and agreed to pay the last mentioned obligations and the receiver agreed to turn over the pledged securities to him, he undertaking in case it should be adjudged that he was a general partner to hold the equities in the same as trustee for the estate-all conditioned upon the Court making an order approving the contract. The order was made on January 6, 1915. On January 25, 1915, the composition was declared to be for the best interests of his estate and the creditors thereof, it and the arrangement with Thompson were confirmed, and it was decreed that on his complying with its terms he should be 'relieved of any further liability to the said receiver or the estate by reason of the order heretofore entered by this Court dated January 6, 1915 or otherwise.' It was further decreed that the petitions to have Thompson declared liable as a general partner be dismissed. The defendants had been notified of the bankruptcy and the appointment of receivers, had paid one claim made against them for the estate and had disputed another which is now the subject \n\n[250 U.S. 573, 576]\n\u00a0\n of a suit in New York, but they did not appear in the bankruptcy proceedings, assent to the composition, or attempt to prove a claim.\n We believe that we have stated the essential facts relied upon to support the bill. They seem to us not sufficient for that purpose. It is said that in pursuance of a contract sanctioned by the Court there was a settlement with Thompson discharging him from all liability to the firm and anyone claiming under it. We do not perceive that the decree just recited even purports to deal with the defendants' claim, and reading it in connection with the proposal as to Thompson in the offer of composition we find it at least difficult to understand it to have been directed against other creditors than those who assented to the latter. It is argued, to be sure, that the petitioners seeking to charge Thompson as a general partner were dismissed out and out and that that portion of the decree at least must be taken to operate in rem and decide against all the world that he was not one. But it would be going far to say that the dismissal was not to be read with the rest of the decree in determining its scope, especially when it is remembered that the composition bound the parties who brought the petitions thus dismissed. It is altogether probable that the dismissal was by consent. However this may be, the decree only determined as against everybody that Thompson's property should not be administered in the bankruptcy proceedings; it did not conclusively establish as against the present defendants the finding of facts upon which it is supposed to have been based, if there is any reason to suppose that the facts as to his relation to the firm were found. Gratiot State Bank v. Johnson, \n249 U.S. 246\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 263; Manson v. Williams, \n213 U.S. 453\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 519.\n The claim of the present defendants in their action in South Carolina is based as we have said upon allegations of fraud, and it is further alleged in their complaint that they believed the representations said to be fraudulent \n\n[250 U.S. 573, 577]\n\u00a0\n until long after the decree set up here as a bar. If those allegations are proved the composition would not discharge the claim, and of course they were not passed upon in the bankruptcy court. A decree that, as we have tried to show, cannot be taken to deal with the defendants' rights be taken give ancillary jurisdiction to the District Court to enforce it against them. The concession by the demurrer that Thompson was a special partner does not affect the scope of the decree, and the jurisdiction depends upon that alone. It is true that if he was only liable as a special partner the South Carolina suit cannot be maintained, but the allegations of fraud open the whole matter and moreover the question here is not whether that suit can be maintained but whether an injunction against it should be issued by the District Court.\n The appeal is dismissed and upon the writ of certiorari the decree dismissing the bill is affirmed.\n Appeal dismissed.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","158":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPENNSYLVANIA R.

Two periods were in controversy: In No. 293 from July 1, 1902, to October 1, 1904; in No. 294 from October 1, 1904 to June 30, 1907. Verdicts and judgments were recovered in both cases against the company. The judgments were affirmed in the Circuit Court of Appeals. 244 Fed. 53, 156 C. C. A. 481.\n During the first period James H. Minds and William J. Matz, trading as Bulah Coal Company, operated the mine alleged to have been subjected to unlawful discrimination. During the second period a partnership, composed of Minds and the widow of Matz, trading under the same name, operated the mine. Two proceedings for reparation were brought before the Interstate Commerce Commission. In the first an order of reparation in the sum of $18, 591.48 was awarded, with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum from June 28, 1907. For the second period an award was made in the sum of $31,715.57, with 6 per cent. interest from the same date. The verdicts of the jury were, for the first period, $16,092.92; for the second period $33,618.37.\n\n 1. \nThe plaintiff in error complains of the allowance of an amendment correcting a mistake in the declarations transposing the awards. The mistake was first noticed by the court near the close of the trial. This amendment was so obviously just and within the court's discretion that we need only say that we think no error was committed in allowing it.\n\n 2. \nIt is insisted that the court erred in allowing the jury to add interest not exceeding 6 per cent. on the damages found; this upon the theory that the recoveries were below the amounts claimed before the Commission which were so large as to be wholly unfair. But the defendants in error were entitled to full compensation for the damages \n\n[250 U.S. 368, 371]\n\u00a0\n sustained as the result of the wrongful discrimination against them. Section 8 of the Act to Regulate Commerce (Act Feb. 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 382 [Comp. St.  8572]). The Commission allowed interest as part of its award, and the District Court charged the jury that it might do so in making up its verdicts. We see no error in this. For years these claims have been contested, the company never offered any payment of the awards, and unless interest is to be allowed there seems to be no means of making the claimants whole for the wrongs sustained by violations of the statute.\n\n 3. \nIt is contended that the court erred in fixin counsel fees, as only those are allowable which compensate for court services. Meeker v. Railroad, \n236 U.S. 412\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 328, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 691. But we are not prepared to say that the court abused its discretion in fixing the fees. There is nothing to warrant our interference with the judgments in this respect.\n\n 4. \nError is alleged in the charge as to the cost of producing the coal which entered into the computation of damages. Upon this point there was a conflict in the testimony, and an examination of the charge satisfies us that the question was fully and fairly left to the jury.\n\n 5. \nWe come to the final and most serious complaint of error in the proceedings. As to the first period there was no contest over the amount of tonnage which the plaintiffs could have shipped, had the cars been fairly distributed during that period. As to the second period, the contention is that there was testimony tending to show that the Commission awarded reparation under a rule which violated its own final determination of the correct rule, in the same manner as was shown in Penna. R. R. Co. v. Jacoby, \n242 U.S. 89\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 49, resulting in the reversal of the judgment in that case. There is no showing that the court gave a wrong rule in this respect in its charge to the jury. But here, as in the Jacoby Case, the company called an expert witness who testified that the \n\n[250 U.S. 368, 372]\n\u00a0\n tables in a blueprint, put in evidence by the complainants before the Commission, were made upon a basis of car distribution, which, if applied to complainants, would result, as pointed out in the Jacoby Case, in giving to them the wrongful preference which had been awarded to favored companies. The witness testified that a computation showed that the Commission, in making its award, had followed this erroneous table and had used its percentages as the basis of its award. The record discloses that the company asked 18 special points to be given in charge to the jury, in 2 of which it requested charges which were based on this witness' testimony as to the inaccuracy of the tables, asking the court in substance to say to the jury that, if the Commission used such tables in making its computation, the awards were on a wrong basis and should be disregarded.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals answered this contention by distinguishing the Jacoby Case-in that the recovery in that case was based wholly upon the award of the Commission and in precisely the same amount, whereas, in this case there was other testimony as to the damages, and the jury awarded a recovery in a sum much less than the amount fixed by the Commission. If these were all the grounds of distinction between this and the Jacoby Case we should be constrained to hold that the failure to give the company's special requests, based on the expert's testimony, was substantial error, requiring a reversal; but at the close of his charge the judge said:\n'I think I have gone over the subject-matter of all the different points submitted to me. So far as they are affirmed in the general charge they are affirmed, and so far as not affirmed in the general charge they are disaffirmed, and counsel, if they choose, may call my attention to any specific point which they would like to have specifically answered.'\n\n The court in its charge had not adverted to the effect \n\n[250 U.S. 368, 373]\n\u00a0\n to be given to the testimony of the defendant's expert. The observations, just referred to, called upon counsel to direct the court's attention to points omitted. The plaintiff's counsel called the court's attention to some things. Counsel for the company said:\n'In the first period, we do not dispute the lost tonnage, only the cost. In the second period, we dispute the correctness both of plaintiffs' cost figures and also the tonnage. We ask that the court so charge.'\n\n The court responded:\n'Now, gentlemen, I want to make that clear. In the first period, there is no question of the tonnage raised. The defendant concedes the amount of the tonng e, and the difference is all over the cost. So you need not trouble yourselves there with any other question than the cost question. In the second period, the claim is questioned in two respects; the cost, just as it is in the first period, and the tonnage is also questioned. So, of course, you cannot determine the amount of damage until you have settled both of those questions.\n\n'I understand that the parties have agreed that their respective statements of their positions may be sent out in order to save the jury the labor of making calculations. Is that correct?'\n\n Counsel for the plaintiff and for the company each answered:\n'Yes, sir.'\n\n'The Court: So, gentlemen, you will have the benefit of the figuring of the parties on each side, which will present their respective views. You will take the case and dispose of it. ...\n\n'Counsel for the defendant excepted to the refusal of the trial judge to charge as requested by them in such points as were not affirmed. ( Exception noted for defendant by direction of the court.)'\n\n We have, then, this situation: After a charge dealing with the general questions in the case, with numerous \n\n[250 U.S. 368, 374]\n\u00a0\n special requests to charge 'points' as they are called, the presiding judge expressed the view that he thought he had gone over the subjects embraced in the requests submitted. That he had omitted some is not surprising, for the court was dealing with an exceedingly difficult and complicated situation of car distribution, concerning which the Interstate Commerce Commission, the body primarily intrusted with the determination of such matters, had long deliberated before announcing the rule upon which it finally acted and made its award in the series of cases of which those now before us are a part. Upon the invitation of the trial judge the company's counsel made the request which we have quoted, and the judge at once complied with it, and charged, as counsel desired, upon that particular subject, adding that he understood that the parties had agreed that the respective statements of their positions might go to the jury to save it the labor of making calculations. In this way the parties got before the jury the calculations showing their respective claims. This may have been and probably was the reason for the failure of counsel to call attention to the omission to answer the particular points requested concerning the effect to be given to the testimony of the defendant's witness, if credited by the jury. Apparently counsel were satisfied when the jury had before it the table showing the basis of their claims in the case. But, whatever the reason, the court, after a careful and painstaking charge, thinking he had answered the 'points' of both sides, called upon counsel to suggest omissions as to particular points; then followed the proceedings already recited. We think counsel should have directed attention to the omission which it is evident was inadvertent. The case, in this aspect, is entirely unlike the Jacoby Case, where a specific request was made and refused, and a recovery had upon an award of the Commission which the testimony tended to show was made upon a wrong basis. \n\n[250 U.S. 368, 375]\n\u00a0\n This court has repeatedly held that objections to the charge of a trial judge must be specifically made in order that he may be given an opportunity to correct errors and omissions himself before the same are made the basis of error proceedings; this is the only course fair to the court and the parties.

Parties may not rest content with the procedure of a trial, saving general exceptions to be made the basis of errorp roceedings, when they might have had all they were entitled to by the action of the trial court had its attention been seasonably called to the matter.\n The trial court and the Court of Appeals have refused to disturb the amounts awarded by the jury as compensation for the clear violation of the Interstate Commerce Act, which these records disclose, and which was very much less than the sums awarded by the Commission when the allowance of interest is considered which under the court's instructions entered into the verdicts. We think the only serious ground upon which reversal may be asked is found in the failure to give the points, to which we have referred, and as to them, we are of the opinion that such failure was waived by the course of proceeding to which attention has been directed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","159":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPENNSYLVANIA R. CO. v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF COM. OF(1919)\nNo. 53\nArgued: October 24, 1919Decided: November 10, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 566, 567]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frederic D. McKenney, of Washington, D. C., and Francis I. Gowen, of Philadelphia, Pa., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. William N. Trinkee, of Philadelphia, Pa., G. F. Snyder, of Washington, D. C., and Berne H. Evans, of Harrisburg, Pa., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case was begun by a complaint to the Public Service Commission of Pennsylvania that the plaintiff in error, the Pennsylvania Railroad, ran a specified train the last car of which was not equipped at its rear end with a platform thirty inches in width, guard rails and steps, as required by a statute of Pennsylvania. Act of June 19, 1911 (P. L. 1054)  7. The train was moving in interstate commerce. The Railroad Company admitted the facts but contended that it was not bound by the statute because the rear car was a mail car constructed in accordance with the regulations of the Post Office Department, and because the Government of the United States had assumed control of the matter so far as to exclude such intermeddling on the part of a State. The Commission made an order that the Rail \n\n[250 U.S. 566, 568]\n\u00a0\n road Company should operate its train with the rear end of the rear car equipped as required by the state law. The Railroad Company appealed to the Superior Court, setting up that the order violated the commerce clause of the Constitution (Art. 1,  8) and that in view of the federal legislation and rules, including the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission dated March 13, 1911, and made under the Safety Appliance Act ( Act March 2, 1893, c. 196, 27 Stat. 531 [Comp. St.  8605-8612]), and other matters referred to, the State Commission had no power to do what it did.\n The Superior Court sustained the order holding itself bound by what it took to be the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Ewing, 241 Pa. 581, 88 Atl. 775, 49 L. R. A. (N. S.) 977, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 157, to the effect that nothing had been done by the United States inconsistent with the continued effect of the state law. An appeal to the Supreme Court was refused. On the strength of this it now is argued that the refusal must have been upon the ground that the Commission was a purely administrative body; that it had no judicial power to declare the statute unconstitutional; that therefore no question of the constitutionality of the Act was before the Superior Court, and that this is implied because an appeal to the Supreme Court was a matter of right if the case had involved such a question. But whatever powers a State may deny to its commissions it cannot give them power to do what the laws of the United States forbid, whether they call their action administrative or judicial. The Superior Court treated the question as open. The Supreme Court merely denied an appeal upon a point that probably was thought to have been decided already by the Court.\n We pass to the merits of the case. If all that had been done on behalf of the United States in the way of regulation had been to determine how mail cars should be built, and to exclude a thirty-inch platform, it might be said that the state law could be obeyed by putting a different \n\n[250 U.S. 566, 569]\n\u00a0\n car at the end of the train. It would be a tax upon the railroad when the company wished to run a mail train wholly made up of mail cars, but it could be done and it is not necessary to say that the State could not require it. But when the United States has exercised its exclusive powers over interstate commerce so far as to take possession of the field, the States no more can supplement its requirements than they can annul them. Southern Ry. Co. v. Railroad Commission of Indiana, \n236 \nU.S. 439, 446\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 304; Charleston & Western Carolina Ry. Co. v. Varnville Furniture Co., \n237 \nU.S. 597, 604\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 715, Ann. Cas. 1916D, 333; New York Central R. R. Co. v. Winfield, \n244 U.S. 147\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 546, L. R. A. 1918C, 439, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 1139. In the present instance the rules for the construction of mail cars, admitted to be valid, not only exclude the wide platform but provide an equipment for them when used as end cars. The Safety Appliance Act with its careful requirements for the safety of the men was followed by most elaborate regulations issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission which include three large pages of prescriptions for 'Caboose Cars without Platforms.' Caboose cars constantly are used as end cars and these pages like the Post Office order as to mail cars recognize the lawfulness of an end car such as the Pennsylvania statute forbids.\n The question whether Congress and its commissions acting under it have so far exercised the exclusive jurisdiction that belongs to it as to exclude the State, must be answered by a judgment upon the particular case. The subject-matter in this instance is peculiarly one that calls for uniform law and in our opinion regulation by the paramount authority has gone so far that the statute of Pennsylvania cannot impose the additional obligation in issue here. The Interstate Commerce Commission is continually on the alert, and if the Pennsylvania law represents a real necessity, no doubt will take or recommend steps to meet the need.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n[250 U.S. 566, 570]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE dissenting.\n Of course I agree with the majority of the court that if the United States had taken possession of the field involved in this controversy, the State could not supplement or annul its requirements or regulations, and it is because it seems to me clear that it has done nothing of the kind that I dissent from the conclusion of the court.\n The Interstate Commerce Commission has never assumed control over the manner in which trains shall be made up, or manned, or moved, so far as I know; certainly there is nothing in the record in this case to indicate that it has done so.\n The section of the State statute held invalid has to do, not with individual cars, but with high speed trains of cars in operation, and it does not prescribe what the construction of mail or express cars shall be, but only that the rear car of trains made up of mail or express cars shall be equipped with a platform as prescribed, with 'exits free from obstruction.' It may be a mail car, or an express car, or a passenger coach or a caboose; the only requirement is that it shall have a platform with guard rail and steps.\n For the reason that federal authority had not occupied the field, this court has upheld state laws prescribing the number of men who must be employed to operate trains, Chicago, R. I. & Pac. Ry. Co. v. State of Arkansas, \n219 U.S. 453\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 275, the manner in which the cars of passenger trains shall be heated, N. Y., N. H. & H. Rd. Co. v. New York, \n165 U.S. 628\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 418, the kind of headlight which engines shall carry, Atlantic Coast Line Rd. Co. v. State of Georgia, \n234 U.S. 280\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 829, and that trainmen shall be subject to state examination as to their qualifications, Smith v. Alabama, \n124 U.S. 465\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 564, Nashville, & c., Ry. v. Alabama, \n128 U.S. 96\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 28.\n In this case the action of the court is rested chiefly on the single circumstance that the Interstate Commerce \n\n[250 U.S. 566, 571]\n\u00a0\n Commission has prescribed requisites for 'Caboose Cars without Platforms,' and since caboose cars are constantly used as end cars, therefore it is concluded the Commission recognizes as lawful a type of end car which the state statute condemns.\n If the construction prescribed for 'Caboose Cars without Platforms' at all resembled or was even approximately the equivalent of the construction of express or mail cars in the respects essential to the safety and promptness of service on the rear end of fast trains, or if it appeared that such cabooses are or could be used on such trains, the inference might be justified, but the difference between the two is radical and fundamental. As thus: The illustrations in the record show that mail and express cars have only narrow stirrups and single handholds at the side doors and at their ends, and the ends are equipped with vestibule frames, which render access difficult and dangerous to the brake wheel and markers (signal lights and flags) and to the handholds and stirrups for mounting or alighting. But the requisites prescribed for a 'Caboose without Platform' are a curved and a straight handhold on opposite sides of each side door and 'Side-Door Steps' under each door, with a minimum length of five feet, a minimum width of six inches, a minimum height of backstop of three inches, and hung a maximum height of only twenty-four inches from the top of rail, Such handholds, with such a long, wide and lowhanging step give facilities for mounting or alighting from such a caboose, when in motion, comparable in safety to those of an end platform, and are obviously much better and safer than those on mail or express cars.\n The importance of rear end signals cannot be overstated, yet the construction of the ends of express and mail cars, as shown in the illustrations in the record, is such that such signals can be observed by trainmen with difficulty, when the train is moving, and can be put in place \n\n[250 U.S. 566, 572]\n\u00a0\n or removed only with great risk of injury, especially in time of storm of wind or rain or when the precarious foothold on the narrow ledge of the slightly extended end sill is covered with ice or snow. Such danger is entirely obviated by use of the inexpensive platform prescribed by the state statute.\n To this we must add that a caboose is used only on slowly moving freight trains, while the state act deals only with fast trains, which start so rapidly that mounting them is especially dangerous for men, who, in the discharge of duty, must usually be on the ground to the last moment, for observation and for signalling, and with whom a few moments in alighting, when the emergency signal is given, may mean the difference between safety and disaster to themselves and to passengers and property on such and other trains.\n It was to furnish facilities to employes for prompt and reasonably safe mounting and alighting from these fast trains and for the discharge of other duties without excessive danger that the statute was enacted, and it seems to me, for the reasons stated, that permitting the use of cabooses without platforms does not cover the rear end requirements of fast express and mail trains, and that the court, in its decision, makes a misapplication of that permission.\n It will excite surprise in mamy minds that the plaintiff railroad company does not make, as it is believed many carriers do make, such provision as this statute requires, or its equivalent, from motives of economy, as a protection, from injury to employes and danger to property as well as from the humanitarian motive so obviously involved.\n Believing, as I do, that the section of the State statute is a humance, reasonable and intelligent provision for promoting the safety of employes, passengers and property arising from special conditions on the lines of railway, and \n\n[250 U.S. 566, 573]\n\u00a0\n that there is no federal provision having a like purpose, I decline to share in striking down as unconstitutional a law passed by the Legislature of Pennsylvania, approved by the Public Service Commission of that State as reasonable and necessary and, as I think, by its highest court as constitutional. \n\n\n\n","160":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEOPLE OF STATE OF NEW YORK v.

NORTH CAROLINA(1919)\nNo. 251\nArgued: Decided: April 21, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[249 U.S. 510, 511]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Julius C. Martin, Thomas S. Rollins, and George H. Wright, all of Asheville, N. C., for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[249 U.S. 510, 512]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James S. Manning, of Raleigh, N. C., and R. H. Sykes, of Durham, N. C., for State of North Carolina.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A statute of North Carolina (Pub. Laws 1913, c. 56) provides that any person who owns land or standing timber on land within 400 feet of any watershed held or owned by any city or town for the purpose of furnishing the city or town water supply, upon cutting or removing the timber or permitting either, within 400 feet of the watershed, shall, within three months after cutting, or earlier upon written notice by the city or town, remove or cause to be burned under proper supervision all tree-tops, boughs, laps and other portions not desired to be taken for commercial or other purposes, within 400 feet of the boundary line of the watershed so as to leave such space of 400 feet free and clear of the designated parts required to be removed or burned and other inflammable material caused by or left from cutting the standing timber, so as to prevent the spread of fire from such cut-over area and the consequent damage to the watershed. A violation of the act is a misdemeanor.\n Plaintiffs in error (we shall refer to them as defendants) \n\n[249 U.S. 510, 513]\n\u00a0\n were indicted for violating the act and upon being arraigned filed a motion to quash the indictment on the ground that the act was unconstitutional and void and in violation of the Constitution of the United States, and particularly the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments thereof in that the act abridged privileges and immunities of defendants as citizens of the United States, deprived them of their property without due process of law and denied them the equal protection of the laws. The motion was denied and defendants were put on trial before a jury which specially found that the city of Asheville owned about 16,000 acres of land having an outside boundary of 12 miles and held the land as a watershed; that defendants were owners of standing and fallen timber adjoining the watershed on the north about 4 miles and within 400 feet of the watershed but did not own the land upon which the timber stood and that the water did not drain from the timber, or the land upon which it stood, on to the watershed. And the jury found all other facts which brought defendants within the provisions of the act and made them violators of it. And the jury found the defendants guilty or not guilty as the court should determine the law to be upon the facts found.\n Upon the special verdict the court adjudged defendants guilty and fined each $300 and costs. Upon appeal the Supreme Court of the state affirmed the judgment.\n In considering the contention of plaintiff we may put to one side what property is or what its rights are, in the abstract. It and they necessarily are subject to some exertions of government.\n What then is the case? The city of Asheville is the owner of and conducts a reservoir, and it may be presumed that other cities of the state are in like situation, and the state, by the law in question, seeks to protect their watersheds from damage or devastating fires. The purpose is governmental, but it is contended that the regulation of \n\n[249 U.S. 510, 514]\n\u00a0\n the statute under review is too distant from the purpose and is simply an arbitrary exercise of power. And this is a certain proposition of law, having no other basis in the record than that the forbidden litter of the cut-down and removed timber is 'absolutely harmless' and contains 'no element of injury or damage to any one' and cannot 'by any possibility be construed into a nuisance.' The assertion eludes exact estimation. 'Tree- tops, boughs, and laps' left upon the ground may not of themselves be a nuisance; but they may become dry, and the more quickly and certainly so from the denudation of the land of its trees, and therefore become a source of fires and the perils and damage of fires. This was the conclusion of the courts below, and, we may suppose, in application to the Asheville watershed. The conclusion is fortified by the judgment of the state expressed in the statute, and, it may be, from experience in the state and certainly from experience in other states, ignorance of which we cannot feign. We are not able, therefore, to yield to the contention of defendants that the statute is not proportionate in its regulation nor that its application to defendants' property is arbitrary and unconstitutional.\n Nor do we find illegal discrimination in the statute. The charge is based upon the contention that the statute condemns acts committed by individuals 'when if like and similar acts be done by municipalities there is no violation of the statute.' Counsel again insists too much upon the abstract. We concede the aphorism upon which counsel relies that 'the equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws.' We, on March 24th last, by an almost prescience of the contention now based on it, defined its extent and declared that the Fourteenth Amendment, which is the foundation of the aphorism, does not regard the impracticable and that distinction may be made by legislation between objects or persons and that the power of the state 'may be \n\n[249 U.S. 510, 515]\n\u00a0\n determined by degrees of evil or exercised in cases where detriment is specially experienced. Armour & Co. v. North Dakota, \n240 \nU.S. 510, 517\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 440, Ann. Cas. 1916D, 548.' Moreover, we pointed out that 'the deference due to the judgment of the Legislature on the matter' had 'been emphasized again and again. Hebe Co. v. Shaw, \n248 \nU.S. 297, 303\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 125.' Dominion Hotel, Inc., v. State of Arizona, \n249 U.S. 265\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 273.\n Necessarily the Legislature of the state did not think, and the courts below did not think, that individuals and municipalities stood in the same relation to the evil aimed at or that a public body charged with the care of the interests and welfare of the people would need the same restraint upon its action as an individual, or be induced to detrimental conduct.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","162":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPETERS v.

The steamer was being unloaded. While upon her and engaged in that work, Veasey accidentally fell through a hatchway. Veasey v. Peters, 142 La. 1012, 77 South. 948.\n A compensation policy in favor of Peters, issued by the AEtna Life Insurance Company, was in force when the accident occurred.\n The work in which defendant in error was engaged is maritime in its nature; his employment was a maritime contract; the injuries which he received were likewise maritime; and the rights and liabilities of the parties in connection therewith were matters clearly within the admiralty jurisdiction. In such circumstances, the Workmen's Compensation Law of the state had no application when the accident occurred. Atlantic Transport Co. v. Imbrovek, \n234 \nU.S. 52, 59\n, 60 S., 61, 34 Sup.

Clause third, section 256, provides that the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States shall be exclusive in 'all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, saving to suitors, in all cases, the right of a common-law remedy, where the common law is competent to give it.' By an act approved October 6, 1917 (40 Stat. 395, c. 97 [Comp.

Alan Goldsborough, of Denton, Md., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent brought his action in a state court of Maryland under the provisions of the federal Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908, as amended April 5, 1910 (35 Stat. 65, c. 149 [Comp. St.  8657-8665]; 36 Stat. 291, c. 143), to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by him upon one of petitioner's lines of railroad in the state of Maryland over which petitioner was engaged in transporting interstate as well as intrastate commerce. \n\n[250 U.S. 101, 102]\n\u00a0\n Plaintiff was employed by defendant in connection with a gang of bridge carpenters, who were employed by defendant in the repair of the bridges and bridge abutments upon said line of railway. The gang, including plaintiff, worked over the entire line, and were moved from point to point as the repair work required in what was called a 'camp car,' furnished and moved by defendant, in which they ate, slept, and lived. Plaintiff's principal duties were to take care of this car, keep it clean, attend to the beds, and prepare and cook the meals for himself and the other members of the gang. On December 23, 1915, the bridge carpenters were engaged in repairing a bridge abutment on defendant's line near Easton, Maryland, and the camp car was on defendant's side track at Easton; and while plaintiff was in the car, engaged in cooking a meal for the bridge carpenters and himself, the engineer of one of defendant's trains, without warning, ran the engine upon the side track and against a car to which the camp car was coupled with such force that plaintiff received injuries, to recover for which his action was brought.\n A judgment in plaintiff's favor was affirmed by the Maryland Court of Appeals (132 Md. 345, 103 Atl. 945), and the case comes here on a writ of certiorari.\n The only question we have to consider is whether plaintiff at the time he was injured was engaged in interstate commerce within the meaning of the statute. Petitioner, citing Illinois Central R. R. v. Behrens, \n233 \nU.S. 473, 478\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 646, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 163, and Erie R. R. Co. v. Welsh, \n242 U.S. 303\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 116, as conclusive to the effect that the true test is the nature of the work being done by the employe at the time of the injury, and that what he had been doing before and expected to do afterwards is of no consequence, argues that since plaintiff at the time of the injury and for some weeks prior thereto was and had been working as mess cook and camp cleaner or attendant for a gang of bridge carpenters who were quartered 'for their own convenience' \n\n[250 U.S. 101, 103]\n\u00a0\n in a camp car belonging to petitioner, which was not being moved in interstate commerce, but was located and standing on a switch track in the neighborhood of the bridge upon which the carpenters then were and for some weeks prior thereto had been and for some time afterwards were working; and since plaintiff at the moment of the injury was engaged in cooking food which was the property of himself and the carpenters, he was not at the time engaged in interstate commerce.\n As thus stated, the relation of plaintiff's work to the interstate commerce of his employer would seem to be rather remote. But upon a closer examination of the facts the contrary will appear. Taking it to be settled by the decision of this court in Pedersen v. Delaware, Lack. & West. R. R. Co., \n229 \nU.S. 146, 152\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 648, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 153, that the repair of bridges in use as instrumentalities of interstate commerce is so closely related to such commerce as to be in practice and in legal contemplation a part of it, it of course is evident that the work of the bridge carpenters in the present case was so closely related to defendant's interstate commerce as to be in effect a part of it. The next question is, what was plaintiff's relation to the work of the bridge carpenters? It may be freely conceded that if he had been acting as cook and camp cleaner or attendant merely for the personal convenience of the bridge carpenters, and without regard to the conduct of their work, he could not properly have been deemed to be in any sense a participant in their work. But the fact was otherwise. He was employed in a camp car which belonged to the railroad company, and was moved about from place to place along its line according to the exigencies of the work of the bridge carpenters, no doubt with the object and certainly with the necessary effect of forwarding their work, by permitting them to conduct it conveniently at points remote from their homes and remote from towns where proper board and lodging were to be had. \n\n[250 U.S. 101, 104]\n\u00a0\n The circumstance that the risks of personal injury to which plaintiff was subjected were similar to those that attended the work of train employes generally and of the bridge workers themselves when off duty, while not without significance, is of little moment. The significant thing, in our opinion, is that he was employed by defendant to assist, and actually was assisting, the work of the bridge carpenters by keeping their bed and board close to their place of work, thus rendering it easier for defendant to maintain a proper organization of the bridge gang and forwarding their work by reducing the time lost in going to and from their meals and their lodging place. If, instead, he had brought their meals to them daily at the bridge upon which they happened to be working, it hardly would be questioned that his work in so doing was a part of theirs. What he was in fact doing was the same in kind, and did not differ materially in degree. Hence he was employed, as they were, in interstate commerce, within the meaning of the Employers' Liability Act.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","164":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPIERCE OIL CORPORATION v. CITY OF HOPE(1919)\nNo. 137\nArgued: Decided: January 27, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[248 U.S. 498, 499]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. E. Hemingway, G. B. Rose, and J. F. Loughborough, all of Little Rock, Ark., John D. Johnson, of St. Louis, Mo., and V. M. Miles, of Little Rock, Ark., for plaintiff in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a complaint brought by the plaintiff in error to enjoin the City of Hope from enforcing an ordinance that forbids the storing of petroleum, gasoline, &c. within three hundred feet of any dwelling, beyond certain small quantities specified. A demurrer to the complaint was sustained by the Supreme Court of the State. 127 Ark. 38, 191 S. W. 405. The plaintiff is engaged in the business of selling petroleum oil and gasoline and has tanks on the right of way of a railroad in the city, which it moved to that place at the city's request. The mode of construction is set forth and it is alleged that an explosion is impossible and that the presence of the tanks in no way endangers any buildings. The tanks are necessary for the business; the present position diminishes the cost of transferring oil from cars and cannot be changed without considerable expense and a reduction of the plaintiff's lawful profits. The plaintiff adds that it knows of no available place in the city where the tanks could be put and oil stored without violating the ordinance, that the ordinance is unnecessary and unreasonable, and that the enforcement of it will deprive the plaintiff of its property without due process of law contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n A long answer is not necessary. A state may prohibit the sale of dangerous oils, even when manufactured under a patent from the United States. Patterson v. Kentucky, \n97 U.S. 501\n. And it may make the place where they are kept or sold a criminal nuisance, notwithstanding the Fourteenth Amendment. Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. \n\n[248 U.S. 498, 500]\n\u00a0\n 623, 8 Sup. Ct. 273.

Dobbins v. Los Angeles, \n195 \nU.S. 223, 238\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 18, 21 (49 L. Ed. 169). The averment that the ordinance is unnecessary and unreasonable, if it be regarded as a conclusion of law upon the point which this Court must decide, is not admitted by the demurrer. If it be taken to allege that facts exist that lead to that conclusion, it stands no better. For if there are material facts of which the Court would not inform itself, as in many cases it would, Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., \n211 \nU.S. 210, 227\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 67, an averment in this general form is not enough. Southern Ry. Co. v. King, \n217 \nU.S. 524, 534\n, 535 S., 30 Sup. Ct. 594. Only facts well pleaded are confessed.\n Then as to the allegation that plaintiff's plant is safe and does not threaten the damages that led to the ordinance being passed, there are limits to the extent to which such an allegation can be accepted, even on demurrer; as in the old case of a plea that the defendant threw stones at the plaintiff molliter and that they fell upon him molliter, 'for the judges say that one cannot throw stones molliter.' 2 Rolle's Abr. 548, Trespass, (G) 8. As was well observed by the Court below 'we may take judicial notice that disastrous explosions have occurred for which no satisfactory explanations have been offered. The unexpected happens.' 127 Ark. 43, 191 S. W. 405. Indeed the answer admits some possible combustion but undertakes to limit its possible effects. If it were true that the necessarily general form of the law embraced some innocent objects, that of itself would not be enough to invalidate it or to remove such an object from its grasp.

Fitzgerald, of Dayton, Ohio, for defendant in error.\n\n\n[250 U.S. 577, 579]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n An action was brought by the railway company before a justice of the peace in Montgomery county, Ohio, to \n\n[250 U.S. 577, 580]\n\u00a0\n recover $15, the freight charges upon a shipment in interstate commerce from Los Angeles, Cal., to Dayton, Ohio. The defendant, Fink, prevailed in the magistrate's court, the judgment was reversed in the court of common pleas, the case was taken to the Court of Appeals of Montgomery County where the judgment of the court of common pleas was reversed and that of the magistrate affirmed. Fink v. Pittsburgh, C., C. & St. L. R. Co., 19 Ohio Cir. Ct. R. (N. S.) 103. The Supreme Court of Ohio denied a motion to require the record to be certified to it by the Court of Appeals, and the case is here upon writ of error to the Court of Appeals of Montgomery County, Ohio.\n The facts are that the railroad company on September 13, 1910, delivered to Fink, the consignee, two boxes of Indian relics shipped to him at Dayton, Ohio, from Los Angeles, Cal., the waybill specifying charges in the sum of $15, which sum Fink paid upon receipt of the goods. The tariff rates filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission so classified this merchandise that the transportation charges should have been $30 instead of $15. It is for the difference that this action is prosecuted.\n It appears that Fink had dealt with the consignor at Los Angeles in such wise that some old coins, belonging to Fink, were to be traded for a collection of Indian relics. Fink shipped the coins to the postmaster at Los Angeles to be held for his protection. At the time the action was brought, about one year after the shipment, the postmaster had released the coins, and Fink had sold some of the relics. Fink testified that he had no knowledge of the freight classification and rates, and simply paid the freight bill as it was presented to him. No agreement appears to have been made with the consignor that Fink should pay the freight charges.\n Examination shows some conflict of authority as to the liability at common law of the consignee to pay freight \n\n[250 U.S. 577, 581]\n\u00a0\n charges under the circumstances here shown. The weight of authority seems to be that the consignee is prima facie liable for the payment of the freight charges when he accepts the goods from the carrier. See the cases collected and discussed in Hutchinson on Carriers (3d Ed.)  1559. However this may be, in our view the question must be decided upon consideration of the applicable provisions of the statutes of the United States regulating interstate commerce. The purpose of the Act to Regulate Interstate Commerce (Act Feb. 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379), frequently declared in the decisions of this court, was to provide one rate for all shipments of like character, and to make the only legal charge for the transportation of goods in interstate commerce the rate duly filed with the Commission. In this way discrimination is avoided, and all receive like treatment, which it is the main purpose of the act to secure.\n Section 6 of the Act to Regulate Commerce (Comp. St.  8569), which was in force at the time of this shipment, provides:\n'Nor shall any carrier charge or demand or collect or receive a greater or less or different compensation for such transportation of passengers or property, or for any service in connection therewith, between the points named in such tariffs than the rates, fares, and charges which are specified in the tariff filed and in effect at the time; nor shall any carrier refund or remit in any manner or by any device any portion of the rates, fares, and charges so specified, nor extend to any shipper or person any privileges or facilities in the transportation of passengers or property, except such as are specified in such tariffs.'\n\n It was, therefore, unlawful for the carrier upon delivering the merchandise consigned to Fink to depart from the tariff rates filed. The statute made it unlawful for the carrier to receive compensation less than the sum fixed by the tariff rates duly filed. Fink, as well as the carrier, must be presumed to know the law, and to have understood that the rate charged could lawfully be only the one fixed by the tariff. When the carrier turned over \n\n[250 U.S. 577, 582]\n\u00a0\n the goods to Fink upon a mistaken understanding of the rate legally chargeable, both it and the consignee undoubtedly acted upon the belief that the charges collected were those authorized by law. Under such cirumstances consistently with the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act the consignee was only entitled to the merchandise when he paid for the transportation thereof the amount specified as required by the statute. For the legal charges the carrier had a lien upon the goods, and this lien could be discharged and the consignee become entitled to the goods only upon tender or payment of this rate. Texas & Pacific Railway Co. v. Mugg, \n202 U.S. 242\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 628. The transaction, in the light of the act, amounted to an assumption on the part of Fink to pay the only legal rate the carrier had the right to charge or the consignee the right to pay. This may be in the present as well as some other cases a hardship upon the consignee due to the fact that he paid all that was demanded when the freight was delivered; but instances of individual hardship cannot change the policy which Congress has embodied in the statute in order to secure uniformity in charges for transportation. Louisville & Nashville Railroad Co. v. Maxwell, \n237 U.S. 94\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 494, L. R. A. 1915E, 665. In that case the rule herein stated was enforced as against a passenger who had purchased a ticket from an agent of the company at less than the published rate. The opinion in that case reviewed the previous decisions of this court, from which we find no occasion to depart.\n It is alleged that a different rule should be applied in this case because Fink by virtue of his agreement with the consignor did not become the owner of the goods until after the same had been delivered to him. There is no proof that such agreement was known to the carrier, nor could that fact lessen the obligation of the consignee to pay the legal tariff rate when he accepted the goods. Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Titus, 216 N. Y. 17, 109 N. E. 857, L. R. A. 1916E, 1127, Ann. Cas. 1917C, 862. Nor can the defendant in error successfully invoke the principle of estop \n\n[250 U.S. 577, 583]\n\u00a0\n pel against the right to collect the legal rate. Estoppel could not become the means of successfully avoiding the requirement of the Act as to equal rates, in violation of the provisions of the statute. New York, New Haven & Hartford R. R. Co. v. York & Whitney Co., 215 Mass. 36, 40, 102 N. E. 366.\n In our view the court of common pleas correctly held Fink liable for the payment of the remaining part of the legal rate upon the merchandise received by him. The judgment of the Court of Appeals of Montgomery County, Ohio, is reversed, and the cause remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","166":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPORTSMOUTH HARBOR LAND & HOTEL CO. v.

Hinton, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n\n\n[249 U.S. 252, 255]\n\u00a0\n Mr. H. R. Pollard, of Richmond, Va., for appellee. \n\n[249 U.S. 252, 256]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant, the Telegraph Company, in its bill filed in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Virginia, sought to enjoin the city of Richmond and its officers from collecting an annual license tax of $300 imposed upon the company by ordinance 'for the privilege of doing business within the city of Richmond, but not including business done to or from points without the state, and not including any business done for the government of the United States, its officers or agents,' and also from attempting to collect an annual fee of $2, imposed by another ordinance, for each telegraph pole which the company maintained or used in the streets of the city.\n The allegations of the voluminous bill essential to be considered are: That the company accepted the act of Congress of July 24, 1866 (14 Stat. 221, c. 230 [Comp. St.  10072-10077]), entitled, 'An act to aid in the construction of telegraph lines,' etc., and is engaged in transmitting messages by telegraph, intrastate and interstate-this is admitted; and the following which are denied, viz. that the cost of doing the intrastate business transacted by the company at Richmond is greater than the receipts from it, and that since both taxes must be paid, if at all, from receipts from interstate commerce they constitute such a burden upon that commerce of the company as to render them unconstitutional and void.\n The evidence introduced on the trial was largely in the form of affidavits, together with a transcript of the evidence taken in a former case, which was stipulated into the record.\n The District Court held the taxes valid and dismissed the bill. On the constitutional questions involved a direct appeal brings the case into this court for review. \n\n[249 U.S. 252, 257]\n\u00a0\n Except for the contention that this record shows affirmatively and clearly that the taxes complained of are necessarily unreasonable and a burden upon interstate commerce, the case could well be disposed of, without discussion, on the authority of decided cases.\n That the city of Richmond has authority, under the statutes of Virginia and its charter, to impose an occupation or license tax on the business of the telegraph company done within the city is clear enough. Virginia Code,  1042; Charter of the City of Richmond,  67; Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Norfolk, 101 Va. 125, 43 S. E. 207; Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Norfolk, 118 Va. 455, 87 S. E. 555. Assuming the existence of this power in the city, since interstate and government service are expressly excluded from liability for the license charge, the following cases sustain the validity of the tax: Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Charleston, \n153 U.S. 692\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 1094; Emert v. Missouri, \n156 U.S. 296\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 367; Kehrer v. Stewart, \n197 U.S. 60\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 403; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Richmond, \n224 U.S. 160\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 449; Williams v. Talladega, \n226 \nU.S. 404, 416\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 116.\n The principle of these cases, and of many others cited in the opinions, is that, as against federal constitutional limitations of power, a state may lawfully impose a license tax, restricted, as it is in this case, to the right to do local business within its borders, where such tax does not burden, or discriminate against, interstate business, and where the local business purporting to be taxed, again as in this case, is so substantial in amount that it does not clearly appear that the tax is a disguised attempt to tax interstate commerce. Such a tax is not, as is argued, an inspection measure, limited in amount to the cost of issuing the license or supervising the business, but is an exercise of the police power of the state for revenue purposes, restricted to internal commerce, and therefore within the taxing power of the state. Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Charleston, Williams v. Talladega, supra, and \n\n[249 U.S. 252, 258]\n\u00a0\n Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Alabama State Board of Assessment, \n132 \nU.S. 472, 473\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 161.\n A statute of Virginia requires all telegraph companies doing business in the state to transmit all messages, state or interstate, which are tendered by other companies or by individuals upon payment of the usual charges. This requirement that the appellant shall engage in intrastate business, construed with the ordinance imposing the license tax, results, it is argued, in imposing a burden upon its interstate business for the reason that the net receipts from its intrastate business are insufficient to pay the tax, and therefore payment, if compelled, must be made from the interstate receipts. If the facts were as thus asserted it well might be that this tax would be invalid (Pullman Co. v. Adams, \n189 U.S. 420\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 494; Williams v. Talladega, \n226 \nU.S. 404, 416\n, 417 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 116), but a careful examination of the record fails to convince us that it contains that clear and convincing evidence that the tax thus falls upon interstate commerce which is necessary to justify a finding that the ordinance is unconstitutional and void.\n There remains to be considered the fee, as it is called in the ordinance imposing it, of $2 for each pole maintained or used in the streets of the city of Richmond. This character of tax has also been the subject of definite decision by this court and has been sustained where not clearly shown to be a direct burden upon interstate commerce or unreasonable in amount, having regard to the purpose for which it may lawfully be imposed. St. Louis v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n148 U.S. 92\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 485; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Borough of New Hope, \n187 U.S. 419\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 204; Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Baltimore, \n156 U.S. 210\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 356; Atlantic & Pacific Telegraph Co. v. Philadelphia, \n190 U.S. 160\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 817; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Richmond, \n224 U.S. 160\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 449. These decisions do not conflict with Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. New Hope, \n192 U.S. 55\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 204, or Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Taylor, \n192 U.S. 64\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 208. In the former of these \n\n[249 U.S. 252, 259]\n\u00a0\n cases the decision of this court rests upon its conclusion that the jury found the tax unreasonable in amount and in the latter the ordinance involved was disposed of on exception to the affidavit of defense, admitting the allegations of the bill that no inspection of the poles or wires or supervision of the business of the company had been, or was intended to be, made by the borough, and that if made the cost could not reasonably be one-twentieth of the tax imposed. This showing, taken with other facts in the case, it was held, rendered the charge unreasonable and void.\n The decisions cited sustaining this character of tax proceed upon the principle that, although the occupation of its streets by a telegraph company engaged in interstate commerce, which has accepted the act of Congress of 1866, cannot be denied by a city, yet since the use of its streets for its poles by such a company is necessarily, in a measure, permanent and exclusive in character, and different in kind and extent from that of the general public, and since such use imposes contingent liabilities upon a city, it is competent for it, in the exercise of its police power, to exact reasonable compensation 'in the nature of rental' for the use of its streets, having regard to the duties and responsibilities which such use imposes on the municipality. Even if the net returns from the intrastate business should not equal such tax, and it must be paid from interstate earnings, this alone would not be conclusive against its validity. If the method of doing interstate business necessarily imposes duties and liabilities upon a municipality, it may not be charged with the cost of these without just compensation. Even interstate business must pay its way-in this case for its right of way and the expense to others incident to the use of it. St. Louis v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 148 U.

Such compensation should \n\n[249 U.S. 252, 260]\n\u00a0\n also include the expense of inspection of the poles and wires used, and of such supervision of the business of the company conducted in the streets as may be reasonably necessary to secure the safety of life and property of the inhabitants and of the users of the streets; but with the authority in the courts, on proper application, to determine whether, under the conditions prevailing in a given case, the charge made is reasonably proportionate to the service to be rendered and the liabilities involved, or whether it is a disguised attempt to impose a burden on interstate commerce.

Ct. 449.\n These decisions and principles dispose of the 'pole tax' before us.\n The total amount of this tax was in 1911, $344, in 1914, $384, and in 1915, owing to the extension of the city limits, it became $666. There is evidence, which must be credited, that poles and wires in the streets of a city require official inspection and supervision to secure their being kept in proper position and repair, so that they will not interfere with street traffic and may not, especially in time of storm, become crossed with wires carrying high-tension currents and thus cause fires and loss of life and property. There is conflict in the evidence as to the cost to the city of such inspection and regulation, but the amount stated does not seem excessive for the service which should be rendered, and which witnesses for the city testified was rendered, in looking after the many poles of the appellant, part of which, at least, carried many wires. As great or greater charges were sustained in St. Louis v. Western Union, \n148 U.S. 92\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 485; Postal \n\n[249 U.S. 252, 261]\n\u00a0\n Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Baltimore, \n156 U.S. 210\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 356; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Richmond, \n224 \nU.S. 160, 172\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 449.\n The contention cannot be allowed that the ordinance is shown to be void by a formula, devised by an officer of the appellant and pressed upon our attention, for determining the division of costs and expenses between interstate and intrastate business, which it is claimed shows that the pole tax must be paid wholly from receipts from interstate business.\n Regardless of obvious criticisms which might be advanced to this formula and to the inadequacy of the data furnished by the record for testing its validity, the charge imposed upon the company, as we have seen, was so moderate in amount, having regard to the necessary burdens which the poles and wires in the streets must impose upon the city and is so well within the prior holdings of this court, which we have cited, that it cannot be accepted as a sufficient basis for declaring the ordinance invalid.\n There is no disposition on the part of this court to modify in the least the law as it has been stated in many cases, that 'neither licenses nor indirect taxation of any kind, nor any system of state regulation, can be imposed upon interstate any more than it can be imposed upon foreign commerce; and that all acts of legislation producing any such result, are ... unconstitutional and void.'

But municipal ordinances, which for constitutional inquiry are deemed state laws, will be declared void only where clearly shown to be unconstitutional, and this very certainly cannot be said of the ordinances in this case, assailed, as they are, upon inadequate evidence and upon purely empirical calculations which we are asked to adopt.\n It results that the decree of the District Court must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","168":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPOSTAL TELEGRAPH-CABLE CO. v. TONOPAH & TIDEWATER R. CO.(1919)\n\nArgued: Decided: January 20, 1919\n\n\n\n Messrs. Jacob E. Dittus and Ode L. Rankin, both of Chicago, Ill., and Bynum E. Hinton, of Washington, D. C., for Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. \n\n[248 U.S. 471, 472]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Rush Taggart, of New York City, for Western Union Telegraph Co.\n Mr. Ralph M. Shaw, of Chicago, Ill., for Chicago Great Western R. R.\n Messrs. J. Du Pratt White and Roberts Walker, both of New York City, for Baltimore & O. R. Co.\n Mr. Charles W. Needham, of Washington, D. C., for Interstate Commerce Commission (by leave).\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The first of these cases, Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Tonopah & Tidewater Railroad Co., was a suit in the Municipal Court of the City of New York for services rendered to the Railroad Company. The defendant set up that the services consisted of the sending of telegrams relating to the defendant's business and were covered by a contract such as usually is made between railroads and telegraphs, under which such telegrams were to be sent free of specific charge. The question raised was the validity of the agreement. The Court decided that it was valid and judgment for the defendant was affirmed on appeal, 176 App. Div. 910, 162 N. Y. Supp. 1140. The next case in number, The Western Union Telegraph Co. v. The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., was brought by the Railroad Company in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York and sets up a similar contract, which the Telegraph Company \n\n[248 U.S. 471, 473]\n\u00a0\n now refuses to perform in consequence of a ruling of the Interstate Commerce Commission. It prays a declaration of the validity of the contract and specific performance. The plaintiff obtained a decree in the District Court, 241 Fed. 162, which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 242 Fed. 914. The last of the three cases, Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Chicago Great Western Railroad, was another bill in equity, brought by the Railroad Company in the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Illinois upon a similar contract, to prevent a multiplicity of suits by the Telegraph Company like that first above mentioned, to have the validity of the contract declared, and to obtain a decree that it be performed. The defendant prevailed in the District Court, 245 Fed. 592, but the decision was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, and there the plaintiff obtained a decree, 249 Fed. 664. The only question upon which our decision is sought is the validity of the agreements, which are so far alike as to present a single issue here.\n The contracts elaborately provide for the reciprocal rights of the companies, for a division of expenses between the railroad and telegraph, for the use by the telegraph of the railroad's right of way for its poles, for monthly payment of a certain sum by the telegraph, and then agree, this being the point now material, that up to a certain amount calculated at the regular day rates of the telegraph, it should deliver free of charge messages pertaining to the railroad business to any points on its system on or beyond the railroad lines, and that up to an amount calculated in similar manner the railroad should transport the materials, supplies and employes of the telegraph, needed for the construction, maintenance or renewal of the telegraph lines whether on or off the lines of the road. The latest ruling of the Interstate Commerce Commission is that these contracts for an exchange of service while \n\n[248 U.S. 471, 474]\n\u00a0\n valid for services on the line are invalid as to services off the line, which last, it is held, must be charged for by the railroad upon the basis of its published rates and by the telegraph upon that of its charges reasonably charged to other customers for similar services. The Commission construes in this way a proviso added to section 1 of the act to regulate commerce (Act Feb. 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379) by an amendment of June 18, 1910, c. 309,  7, 36 Stat. 544 (Comp. St.  8563). This amendment brought telegraph, telephone and cable companies within the act but also inserted a proviso 'that nothing in this Act shall be construed strued to prevent telephone, telegraph, and cable companies from entering into contracts, with common carriers, for the exchange of services.' The question more specifically stated is whether the construction adopted by the Commission is right.\n We do not see how that construction can be got from the words of the act. The words are general and as certainly allow services off the line as services on it to be exchanged. In fact they do so almost in terms by allowing common carriers to exchange with cable companies. This being obvious, it is said that while the abstinence of the act from preventing exchanges covers the whole ground, the exchange of services off the line must be on the terms that we have stated, which makes the act as to them merely a superfluous permission to settle accounts periodically instead of paying for each transaction in cash. But 'exchange' is barter and carries with it no implication of reduction to money as a common denominator. It contemplates simply an estimate, determined by self interest, of the relative value and importance of the sevices rendered and those received. This is admitted with regard to services on the line, and if so whatever services can be exchanged can be exchanged in the same way. We cannot follow the argument from Santa Fe, Prescott & Phoenix Ry. Co. v. Grant Brothers Construction Co., \n228 U.S. 177\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 474, that the exchange properly \n\n[248 U.S. 471, 475]\n\u00a0\n so called should be confined to cases where the common carrier is not acting as such. That seems to us a perverse conclusion from a proviso permitting 'common carriers' to exchange.\n Nothing is gained by referring to the provisions in other sections or to those of the section to which the proviso is attached, for the provision is that nothing in the act, in whatever section it may occur, shall be twisted into preventing the exchange. The passion for equality sometimes leads to hollow formulas and the attempt to bring these arrangements under the head of undue preferences and the like hardly seems a natural result of the statute. No one knows which of the two would be found to be preferred as having the best of a very complex bargain. All the great benefits derived on one side are the consideration for all those conferred upon the other. The railroad and the telegraph have grown together in mutual dependence and we are told that contracts of this sort for long terms have been nearly universal for fifty years. The contracts had been called to the attention of Congress repeatedly by the Commission, which, in December, 1906, stated that, so far as it could see, the full performance of them by the carriers would not affect any public or private interest adversely. It held however that under the law as it then stood contracts for services off the line were unlawful. 12 I. C. C. 10, 12. Then the Amendment of 1910 was passed, and passed, we must suppose, having the opinion of the Commission and the notorious longstanding form of existing contracts in view. The contracts are complex, as we have said, and entire. We cannot believe that an act which purported to allow them meant to break them up. The Commission seems not to have believed it in its first ruling upon the amended act.\n Our opinion is confirmed by a consideration of the further additions to section 1, in 1910, allowing free passes to \n\n[248 U.S. 471, 476]\n\u00a0\n be given to the employes of telegraph, telephone and cable lines, and by some further matters of detail referred to in the judgments of the Courts below of which we have cited the reports. The interdependence of the companies is very intimate, and the trouble that would be caused by a narrow construction of the act we believe would be great, with no advantage so far as we can see to any other users of the lines or roads. We do not go into more minute discussion because the result reached must stand on the plain words of the act, the meaning of which is confirmed rather than made doubtful by the circumstances in which the proviso was enacted and the events that had gone before.\n Judgment and decrees affirmed. \n\n\n\n","169":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPOSTAL TELEGRAPH-CABLE CO. v. WARREN-GODWIN LUMBER CO.(1919)\nNo. 91\nArgued: Decided: December 8, 1919\n\n\n\n Messrs. Ellis B. Cooper and J. N. Flowers, both of Jackson, Miss., for petitioner.\n Mr. Wm. D. Anderson, of Tupelo, Miss., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In Primrose v. Western Union Telegraph Company, \n154 U.S. 1\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 1098, the court passed upon the validity of a contract made by a telegraph company with the sender of a message by which, in case the message was missent, the liability of the company was limited to a refunding of the price paid for sending it, unless, as a means of guarding against mistake, the repeating of the message from the office to which it was directed to the office of origin was secured by the payment of an additional sum. It was held that such a contract was not one exempting the company from \n\n[251 U.S. 27, 28]\n\u00a0\n liability for its negligence, but was merely a reasonable condition appropriately adjusting the charge for the service rendered to the duty and responsibility exacted for its performance. Such a contract was therefore decided to be valid and the right to recover for error in transmitting a message which was sent subject to it was accordingly limited.\n In Western Union Telegraph Company v. Showers, 112 Miss. 411, 73 South. 276, the Supreme Court of that state was called upon to consider the validity of a contract by a telegraph company limiting its responsibility for missending an unrepeated message essentially like the contract which was considered and upheld in the Primrose Case. The court decided that as the Act of Congress of June 18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 539, 545, had operated to exert the power of Congress over telegraph companies as to their interstate business and contracts, Congress had taken possession of the field and thus excluded state legislation and hence such a contract was valid and enforcible in accordance with the rule laid down in the Primrose Case. In holding this, however, the court pointed out that but for the act of Congress a different rule would apply, as under the state law such a contract was invalid because it was a stipulation by a carrier limiting its liability for its negligence.\n In Dickerson v. Western Union Telegraph Company, 114 Miss. 115, 74 South. 779, the validity of a like contract by a telegraph company for the sending of an unrepeated message once again arose for consideration. In passing upon it the court declared that the ruling previously made in the Showers Case, as to the operation of the act of Congress of 1910, was erroneous. Coming therefore anew to reconsider that subject, it was held that the act of Congress of 1910 had not extended the power of Congress over the rates of telegraph companies for interstate business and the contracts made by them as to such subject, and hence the \n\n[251 U.S. 27, 29]\n\u00a0\n Showers Case, in so far as it held to the contrary, was overruled. Thus removing the contract from the operation of the national law and bringing it under the state law, the court held that the contract was void and not susceptible of being enforced because it was a mere contract exempting the telegraph company from the consequences of its negligence.\n The case before us involving the extent of the liability of the Telegraph Company for an unrepeated interstate message governed by a contract like those considered in the previous cases, was decided by a state circuit court after the decision in the Showers Case and before the overruling of that case by the Dickerson Case. Presumably therefore the court, because of the Showers decision upheld the validity of the contract and accordingly limited the recovery. The appeal which took the case to the court below, however, was there heard after the decision in the Dickerson Case. In view of that situation the court below in disposing of the case expressly declared that the only issue which was open was the correctness of the ruling in the Dickerson Case, limiting the operation and effect of the act of Congress of June 18, 1910. Disposing of that issue, the ruling in the Dickerson Case was reiterated and the contract, although it concerned the transmission of an interstate message, was declared not affected by the act of Congress and to be solely controlled by the state law and to be therefore void. That subject, presents then, the only federal question, and indeed the only question in the case.\n For the sake of brevity, we do not stop to review the cases which perturbed the mind of the court below in the Dickerson Case as to the correctness of its ruling in the Showers Case (Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Hughes, \n191 U.S. 477\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 132; Western Union Telegraph Company v. Crovo, \n220 U.S. 346\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 399; Adams Express Company v. Croninger, \n226 U.S. 491\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 148, 44 L. R. A. (N. S.) 257; Western Union Telegraph Company v. Brown, \n234 U.S. 542\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 955), but content \n\n[251 U.S. 27, 30]\n\u00a0\n ourselves with saying that we are of opinion that the effect which was given to them was a mistaken one. We come at once therefore to state briefly the reasons why we conclude that the court below mistakenly limited the act of Congress of 1910 and why therefore its judgment was erroneous.\n In the first place, as it is apparent on the face of the act of 1910 that it was intended to control telegraph companies by the act to regulate commerce, we think it clear that the act of 1910 was designed to and did subject such companies as to their interstate business to the rule of equality and uniformity of rates which it was manifestly the dominant purpose of the act to regulate commerce to establish, a purpose which would be wholly destroyed if, as held by the court below, the validity of contracts made by telegraph companies as to their interstate commerce business continued to be subjected to the control of divergent and it may be conflicting local\n In the second place, as in terms the act empowered telegraph companies to establish reasonable rates, subject to the control which the act to regulate commerce exerted, it follows that the power thus given, limited of course by such control, carried with it the primary authority to provide a rate for unrepeated telegrams and the right to fix a reasonable limitation of responsibility where such rate was charged, since as pointed out in the Primrose Case the right to contract on such subject was embraced within the grant of the primary rate-making power.\n In the third place, as the act expressly provided that the telegraph, telephone or cable messages to which it related may be 'classified into day, night, repeated, unrepeated, letter, commercial, press, government and such other classes as are just and reasonable and different rates may be charged for the different classes of messages,' it would seem unmistakably to draw under the federal \n\n[251 U.S. 27, 31]\n\u00a0\n control the very power which the construction given below to the act necessarily excluded from such control. Indeed, the conclusive force of this view is made additionally cogent when it is considered that as pointed out by the Interstate Commerce Commission (Clay County Produce Company v. Western Union Telegraph Company, 44 Interest. Com. R. 670), from the very inception of the telegraph business, or at least for a period of 40 years before 1910, the unrepeated message was one sent under a limited rate and subject to a limited responsibility of the character of the one here in contest.\n But we need pursue the subject no further, since, if not technically authoritatively controlled, it is in reason persuasively settled by the decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission in dealing in the case above cited with the very question here under consideration as the result of the power conferred by the act of Congress of 1910; by the careful opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit dealing with the same subject (Gardiner v. Western Union Telegraph Company, 231 Fed. 405, 145 C. C. A. 399); and by the numerous and conclusive opinions of state courts of last resort which in considering the act of 1910 from various points of view reached the conclusion that that act was an exertion by Congress of its authority to bring under federal control the interstate business of telegraph companies and therefor was an occupation of the field by Congress whcih excluded state action (Western Union Tel. Co. v. Bank of Spencer, 53 Okl. 398, 156 Pac. 1175; Haskell Implement Co. v. Postal Tel.-Cable Co., 114 Me. 277, 96 Atl. 219; Western Union Tel. Co. v. Bilisoly, 116 Va. 562, 82 S. E. 91; Bailey v.

But we do not stop to review or refer to them as we are of opinion that the error in the reasoning upon which they proceed is pointed out by what we have said and by the authorities to which we have just referred.\n It follows that the judgment below was erroneous, and it must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings, not inconsistent with this opinion.\n And it is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY dissents. \n\n\n\n","170":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPUBLIC SERVICE CO.

Burns, of Chicago, Ill., for appellee.\n\n\n[250 U.S. 153, 157]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the court.\n An 'act concerning drainage,' passed in Indiana in 1907 (Laws 1907, c. 252), briefly outlined is as follows: (1) It authorized the appointment by the county commissioners of each county of an officer called a drainage commissioner and made the county surveyor also ex officio such an officer. ( 2) It empowered a defined circuit court, on the petition of private landowners or of municipal or other public bodies representing public ownership, to establish a drainage district and to authorize the carrying out in such district of the work petitioned for, and gave the court authority to appoint an additional drainage commissioner, the three being directed to aid the court to the extent by it desired in securing data concerning the questions required to be passed upon in disposing of the petition. (3) To accomplish the purposes of the statute, personal notice to known property holders and notice by publication to those unknown was exacted, and the court was empowered to reject the whole suggested scheme or to authorize such part \n\n[250 U.S. 153, 158]\n\u00a0\n of it as might be deemed best, or to devise and sanction a new plan. (4) As to any plan which it authorized, the court was empowered to provide for the cost of the work by distributing the amount upon the basis of the benefits to be received and the burdens to result to each landowner. (5) It authorized the designation by the court of one of the drainage commissioners, or, if it deemed best, of any other resident of the district, to carry into execution under the general supervision of the court any work authorized, with power to contract and subject to accountability to the court as the work progressed and at its conclusion.\n The Little Calumet river, rising in the state of Indiana, flows in a westerly direction across Porter and Lake counties in that state into Cook county, Ill., within whose boundaries it commingles with the Grand Calumet, which empties into Lake Michigan.\n After proceedings under the statute, the circuit court of Porter county, in May, 1911, established a drainage district in Porter and Lake counties and authorized the construction of a ditch to proceed from the Little Calumet river in a northerly direction to Lake Michigan. This action of the court was taken to the Supreme Court of Indiana and there affirmed (Lake Shore & M. S. R. Co. v. Clough, 182 Ind. 178, 104 N. E. 975, 105 N. E. 905), and on error from this court was also affirmed (\n242 U.S. 375\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 144).\n Before work on the ditch was commenced, however, the appellant, an Illinois corporation which was not a party to the proceedings to establish the district, brought this suit against Corboy, the drainage commissioner appointed by the court to do the work, to enjoin the execution of the same. The relief prayed was based on the ground that the effect of the ditch would be to draw off from the Little Calument river, an interstate stream, such a quantity of water as to seriously diminish the flow in that river and thereby practically cripple, if not destroy, \n\n[250 U.S. 153, 159]\n\u00a0\n the capacity of petitioner to continue to operate a plant for the production of electrical energy established and owned by it on the banks of the Little Calument in Cook county, Ill. It was alleged that the right to have the river flow in its normal volume was a property right enjoyed by petitioner under the law of Illinois, protected by the Constitutions both of the state and of the United States, and which therefore could not be impaired or taken away without depriving the petitioner of property in violation of due process of law as afforded by both Constitutions. The court, being of opinion that the relief prayed was prohibited by section 265 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1162 [Comp. St.  1242]), dismissed the bill for want of jurisdiction. The case is here by direct appeal on that question alone.\n Although a state may not be sued without its consent, nevertheless a state officer acting under color of his official authority may be enjoined from carrying into effect a state law asserted to be repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, even though such injunction may cause the state law to remain inoperative until the constitutional question is judicially determined. The doctrine is elementary, but we refer to a few of the leading cases by which it is sustained: Pennoyer v. McConnaughty, \n140 \nU.S. 1, 9\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 699; Regan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n154 \nU.S. 362, 392\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 1047; Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123, 152\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 441, 13 L. R. A. (N. S.) 932, 14 Ann. Cas. 764; Prentis v.

Co., \n244 \nU.S. 499, 506\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 673, Ann. Cas. 1917E. 88.\n There was jurisdiction therefore in the court below as a federal court to afford appropriate relief unless the want of power resulted from the prohibition of section 265 of the Judicial Code, which is as follows:\n'The writ of injunction shall not be granted by any court of the United States to stay proceedings in any court of a state, except in cases where such injunction \n\n[250 U.S. 153, 160]\n\u00a0\n may be authorized by any law relating to proceedings in bankruptcy.'\n\n In Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line, \n211 U.S. 210\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 67, the facts, briefly stated, were these: By the Constitution and laws of Virginia the Corporation Commission of that state was constituted a court and was authorized in that capacity to establish railroad rates and to enforce them. The authority thus conferred was exerted and the jurisdiction of a court of the United States was invoked to enjoin the commission from enforcing the rates so fixed on the ground that to put them in operation would amount to a confiscation of the property of the railroad, and hence would be repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. The power to afford relief was challenged on the ground that, as the Corporation Commission was a court under the Constitution and law of the state, its proceedings could not be stayed by a court of the United States because of the prohibition of section 265 of the Judicial Code. It was held, however, that as the power to fix rates was legislative, and not judicial, the prohibition had no application, and the injunction prayed was granted.\n In Simon v. Southern Railway, \n236 U.S. 115\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 255, suit was brought in a court of the United States by the railway company against Simon to enjoin the enforcement of a judgment which had been rendered in a state court in favor of Simon and against the railway company on the ground of want of notice and fraud. Asserting that to grant the relief would be to stay proceedings in the state court, the jurisdiction was disputed, based upon the prohibition of the section previously quoted. The jurisdiction was upheld and it was decied that, although the prohibition might have prevented the granting of an injunction staying proceedings before the judgment was rendered, it did not so operate after the entry of the final judgment because 'when the litigation has ended and a final judgment has been obtained-and when the plaintiff endeavors \n\n[250 U.S. 153, 161]\n\u00a0\n to use such judgment-a new state of facts not within the language of the statute may arise.' The execution of the judgment was therefore enjoined.\n This conclusion was sustained by the text as elucidated by the purely remedial purposes intended to be accomplished by its enactment. The court thus stated the origin of the statute as illustrative of its remedial scope (\n236 \nU.S. 123, 124\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 258):\n'In 1793, when that statute was adopted (1 Stat. 334), courts of equity had a well-recognized power to issue writs of injunction to stay proceedings pending in court, in order to avoid a multiplicity of suits, to enable the defendant to avail himself of equitable defenses and the like. It was also true that the courts of equity of one state or country could enjoin its own citizens from prosecuting suits in another state or country. Cole v. Cunningham, \n133 U.S. 107\n [ 10 Sup. Ct. 269]. This, of course, often gave rise to irritating controversies between the courts themselves which could, and sometimes did, issue contradictory injunctions.\n\n'On principles of comity and to avoid such inevitable conflicts the act of 1793 was passed.'\n\n Be this as it may, it is certain that the prohibitions which the statute imposes secure only the right of state courts to exert their judicial power; that is, a power called into play alone between parties to a controversy, and the operation of which power when exerted was, from the very fact that it was judicial, confined to the parties, their duties, interests and property, in other words, to a power falling within the general limitation of things judicial as demarked by the great distinction between legislative, executive and judicial power upon which the Constitution was framed. This is the necessary result of the ruling in the Prentis Case, by which it is made certain that, although a state may have power to confer upon its courts such authority as may be deemed appropriate, it cannot by \n\n[250 U.S. 153, 162]\n\u00a0\n the exertion of such right draw into the judicial sphere powers which are intrinsically legislative and executive or both, and thus bring the exercise of such powers within the scope of the prohibition of the statute, with the result of depriving the courts of the United States to that extent of their omnipresent authority to enforce the Constitution.\n It follows necessarily, therefore, that although the Constitution did not limit the power of the states to create courts and to confer upon them such authority as might be deemed best for state purposes, that right could not, by its exertion, restrain or limit the power of the courts of the United States by bringing within the state judicial authority subjects which in their constitutional sense were nonjudicial in character, and therefore not within the implied or express limitation by which courts of the United States were restrained from staying judicial proceedings in state courts. To hold to the contrary would be in large measure to recognize that the exertion of the authority of the courts of the United States was dependent, not upon the nature and character of the subject- matter with which they are called upon to deal, but merely upon a state classification.\n This conclusion renders it unnecessary to consider whether the construction of the ditch under the authority of the state statute, isolatedly considered, could be regarded as a judicial proceeding within the meaning of the statute, or whether, putting that view aside under the assumption that the proceedings were judicial, the order for construction could be treated as final and for that reason alone capable of being stayed, within the ruling of Simon v. Railway.\n The arguments at bar pressed upon our attention considerations based upon the assumed application of general principles of comity, but, as on this direct appeal we have power alone to consider questions of the jurisdiction of the court below as a federal court, they are not open to our \n\n[250 U.S. 153, 163]\n\u00a0\n consideration. Louisville Trust Co. v. Knott, \n191 U.S. 225\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 119. This, moreover, puts out of view the argument advanced concerning the adequacy of the averments of the bill to justify relief, since that subject necessarily, for the reasons stated, must be left to the consideration of the court below when it exercises jurisdiction of the cause.\n Our order, therefore, is that the decree be reversed and the case be remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","171":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION FOR STATE OF KANSAS v.

Dana, of Kansas City, Mo., for Kansas City Gas Co. and others. \n\n[249 U.S. 236, 242]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are appeals by different groups of defendants below from decree prohibiting public commissions and officers of Kansas and Missouri, certain municipalities and many local gas distributing companies from interfering with establishment and maintenance of selling rates for gas to consumers sufficiently high to compensate receivers of the Kansas Natural Gas Company. 234 Fed. 152; 242 Fed. 658; 245 Fed. 950.\n The Kansas Natural Gas Company-hereinafter, the Gas Company-a Delaware corporation, owned a system of pipe lines extending from Oklahoma and Kansas points to some forty terminal towns and cities in Kansas and Missouri and produced, purchased, transported, distributed and sold natural gas prior to October 9, 1912. During the years 1904-1908 by separate agreements it undertook to supply many local companies with gas for ultimate sale to their customers and to accept therefor a definite proportion-generally two-thirds-of the gross amounts paid by such customers. Permanent physical connections permitted gas to pass from the Gas Company's pipe lines into the several local companies' mains. The latter operated under special ordinances usually specifying the rates which customers should pay; and, except in four relatively unimportant places, the former had no local franchise permitting either distribution or sale of gas, nor did it own any interest in a defendant distributing company.\n The Gas Company procured gas by drilling, purchase or otherwise in Southern Kansas and Oklahoma-6 per cent. in the former-forced it through pipe lines and delivered it in the local mains at the connection points. None was obtained in Missouri. Having received gas at the connection points the several local companies dis tributed \n\n[249 U.S. 236, 243]\n\u00a0\n and sold it, collected established rates and settled with the Gas Company as agreed. Approximately 44 per cent. of the total was thus sold to customers in Kansas and 56 per cent. in Missouri.\n October 9, 1912, the United States District Court for Kansas appointed receivers for the Gas Company and shortly thereafter, acting under section 56, Judicial Code, extended the receivership to Missouri and Oklahoma. It is unnecessary to detail subsequent changes in respect of this receivership. The receivers took over the company's property, affairs and business and operated them under orders of the court; without specifically adopting or disavowing the supply contracts of 1904-1908 they continued to deliver gas to local distributing companies and to accept payments as originally agreed.\n Available gas diminished; pipe lines to new wells became necessary; operating costs increased; and the sums received from local distributing companies were inadequate for the receivers' demands. In 1915 they petitioned the Kansas Public Utilities Commission to permit higher charges to customers by local companies. Responding the Commission authorized, December 10, 1915, what is known as the '28-Cent Schedule'-much below the rates requested.\n Claiming jurisdiction over distribution and sale of gas in that state and power to fix the rates which local companies should both pay and charge therefor, the Missouri Public Service Commission suspended some proposed advanced rates to consumers and threatened to enforce further appropriate orders if found necessary. Certain local companies, notably the Kansas City Gas Company, insist that the receivers should comply with the original supply contracts between them and the Gas Company.\n In December, 1915, the receivers began this proceeding against Kansas Public Utilities Commission, Missouri Public Service Commission, thirty- two local distributing \n\n[249 U.S. 236, 244]\n\u00a0\n companies and forty-seven cities and towns in those states. After setting out the history of the Gas Company the bill alleged that the above- described actions by state commissions resulted in imposing upon the receivers inadequate and confiscatory rates and unduly burdened the interstate commerce which they were carrying on by transporting and selling gas; that the original supply contracts with distributing companies, although never adopted by them, were improvident, wasteful, a fraud upon creditors and no longer obligatory; that the city ordinances fixing prices to customers were unreasonable, noncompensatory and confiscatory of estate and property in the receivers' hands. They asked an appropriate injunction restraining the commissions, municipalities and distributing companies from interfering with establishment of reasonable and compensatory rates for selling gas to consumers.\n The court below held the business carried on by the receivers- transportation of natural gas and its disposition and sale to consumers through the distributing companies-was interstate commerce of a national character; that the commissions' actions interfered with establishment and maintenance of reasonable sale rates and thereby burdened interstate commerce and took the receivers' property without due process of law; that the original supply contracts were not binding upon the receivers. And it accordingly enjoined the commissions, their members, the Attorneys General of both states, the various municipalities and the distributing companies from interfering with establishment of such reasonable and compensatory rates as the court might approve.\n We think the trial court properly overruled the objections offered to its jurisdiction and nothing need be added to the reasons which it gave. 234 Fed. 152, 155. But we cannot agree with its conclusions that local companies in distributing and selling gas to their customers \n\n[249 U.S. 236, 245]\n\u00a0\n acted as mere agents, immediate representatives or instrumentalities of the receivers and as such carried on without interruption interstate commerce set in motion by them.\n That the transportation of gas through pipe lines from one state to another is interstate commerce may not be doubted. Also, it is clear that as part of such commerce the receivers might sell and deliver gas so transported to local distributing companies free from unreasonable interference by the state. American Express Co. v. Iowa, \n196 \nU.S. 133, 143\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 182; Oklahoma v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., \n221 U.S. 229\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 564, 35 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1193; Haskell v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., \n224 U.S. 217\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 442.\n But in no proper sense can it be said, under the facts here disclosed, that sale and delivery of gas to their customers at burnertips by the local companies operating under special franchises constituted any part of interstate commerce. The companies received supplies which had moved in such commerce and then disposed thereof at retail in due course of their own local business. Payment to the receivers of sums amounting to two- thirds of the product of these sales did not make them integral parts of their interstate business. In fact, they lacked authority to engage by agent or otherwise in the retail transactions carried on by the local companies. Interstate commerce is a practical conception and what falls within it must be determined upon consideration of established facts and known commercial methods. Rearick v. Pennsylvania, \n203 \nU.S. 507, 512\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 159; The Pipe Line Cases, \n234 \nU.S. 548, 560\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 956. The thing which the receivers actually did was to deliver supplies to local companies. Exercising franchise rights, the latter distributed and sold the commodity so obtained upon their own account and paid the receivers what amounted to two-thirds of their receipts from customers. Interstate movement ended when the gas passed into local mains. The court below erroneously \n\n[249 U.S. 236, 246]\n\u00a0\n adopted the contrary view and upon it rested the conclusion that the Public Commissions were interfering with establishment of compensatory rates by the receivers in violation of their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The challenged orders related directly to prices for gas at burner- tips and only indirectly to the receivers' business. They were under no compulsion to accept unremunerative prices; even the original supply contracts had not been adopted and were subject to rejection. See Newark Natural Gas & Fuel Co. v. Newark, \n242 U.S. 405\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 156, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 1025. Our conclusion concerning relationship between the receivers and local companies renders it unnecessary to discuss the effect of rates prescribed for the latter. The receivers were in no position to complain of them.\n The decrees below must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\n\n\n","172":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION FOR STATE OF KANSAS v.

U S(1919)\nNo. 213\nArgued: Decided: April 21, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. H. T. Newcomb, of New York City, for appellant. \n\n[249 U.S. 503, 504]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Brown, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves a consideration of the inheritance tax law of June 13, 1898, generally called the War Revenue Act (30 Stat. 448, 464, 465, c. 448), and was brought in the Court of Claims to recover the amount of a tax assessed and collected under that law.\n The Court of Claims dismissed the case on the grounds: (1) That appellant did not file any claim with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue ; (2) that the tax was voluntarily paid. The decision is resisted by appellant and other contentions are made against the tax.\n Section 29 of the act of 1898 provided that any person or persons having in charge or trust, as administrators, etc., any legacies or distributive shares arising from personal property, the amount of the property exceeding $10,000 in actual value, passing, after the passage of the act, from any person possessed of the property, either by will or by the intestate laws of any state or territory, was made subject to a tax to be paid to the United States; the amount of tax being dependent upon the degree of relationship of the taker to the person who died possessed of the property. And there was an increase of the tax with an increase of the value of the property possessed in excess of $25,000.\n The facts found we give only in summary: June 6, 1900, Edmund Dwight died testate. His will was admitted to probate June 28, 1900. Elizabeth Cabot, his sister, was named executrix of the will. She accepted and qualified, but died January 30, 1902, and Philip Cabot, her son, was appointed administrator, with the will annexed. He qualified. The will, so far as material, \n\n[249 U.S. 503, 505]\n\u00a0\n provided as follows:\n'I give to the New England Trust Company, a corporation duly chartered by the state of Massachusetts, and located in the city of Boston, the sum of one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars ($125, 000), to be invested in the general trust fund of the company and held upon the following trusts: To pay to Mrs. Jennie Lathrop Rand ... the annual income thereof in semi-annual payments during her life.'\n\n October 1, 1900, the trust fund was deposited with the New England Trust Company, the trustee designated in the will, which accepted the trust. The fund was not invested separately but as part of the general trust fund of the company. Semi-annual payments of the accrued net income were made to Mrs. Rand to January 14, 1914. No other payments were made to her or for her benefit, nor did she become entitled to any other or additional payments on account of the trust.\n September 27, 1900, Elizabeth Cabot made to the United States Bureau of Internal Revenue a return of the legacies in her charge as executrix and passing from Dwight's estate to the persons named therein, in which was included the legacy to Mrs. Rand, aged 63, stranger to the decedent, of the clear value of $125,000, the taxable amount of which, after a particular exemption, she stated to be $40,355.91, with $7.50 per hundred dollars as the rate of taxation, and the amount of tax as $3,026.69, and she reported the legacy as in trust with the New England Trust Company. It is not shown that the collector of internal revenue or other officer made a demand for the tax, but September 28, 1900, Elizabeth Cabot paid to the proper collector the tax out of the funds and it has since been retained by the United States. The sum was advanced by Elizabeth Cabot, at the request of Mrs. Rand and other legatees, pursuant to an agreement made September 28, 1900, by which the taxes paid by Elizabeth Cabot were to be refunded to her and were repaid to her. \n\n[249 U.S. 503, 506]\n\u00a0\n The tax paid by her was determined to be the proper tax by regulations of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on December 16, 1898. The regulations contained rules and tables for the determination of the duty or tax to be paid to the United States upon legacies or distributive shares arising from personal property, imposed by the act of June 13, 1898\n\n\n The only assessment ever made under sections 29 and 31 of the act of 1898 and amendments upon the interest of Mrs. Rand in the interest created in the trust fund under Dwight's will was made in pursuance of the rules, tables and instructions of the commissioner and there was no specific investigation by that officer of her expectancy of life or as to the earning capacity of the trust fund otherwise than by application of the tables. The value of her interest was so determined to be $42,320.60, from which was deducted the inheritance tax of Massachusetts, leaving a net balance of $40,355.91, upon which the tax was assessed at the statutory rate of $7.50 per hundred dollars. The computation was from the death of Dwight, the decedent.\n Under authority of the act of Congress of July 27, 1912 (37 Stat. 240, c. 256), a claim for the refund of the sum paid, to wit, $3,026.69, was filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, December 24, 1913, by H. T. Newcomb, representing himself to be the attorney for the New England Trust Company, trustee under the will of Dwight. And on December 30, 1913, Attorneys Lyon & Lyon, of Washington, D. C., acting for and in behalf of the administrator de bonis non of Edmund Dwight, filed with the commissioner of Internal Revenue a claim for the refund of the tax. The grounds of both claims were that the tax was illegally and erroneously assessed and collected and contrary to the provisions of the act of 1898 and amendments and that the same should be refunded by virtue of the act of June 27, 1902 (32 \n\n[249 U.S. 503, 507]\n\u00a0\n Stat. 406, c. 1160), and the act of July 27, 1912. The claims were rejected by the acting commissioner March 28, 1914. It is not shown that Mrs. Rand or any person acting for her or in her behalf filed a claim with the commissioner.\n The court, as we have said, dismissed the claim without considering the validity of the assessment. The conclusion is contested by appellant in an elaborate brief and defended by the government, relying primarily upon section 3226, R. S. (Comp. St.  5949), as the Court of Claims did. The case presents, therefore, at the outset the question whether the conditions of suit required by that section were satisfied as qualified or relieved by the acts of 1902 and 1912, hereafter referred to.\n Section 3226 provides that no suit shall be maintained for the recovery of a tax illegally or erroneously assessed or collected, 'until appeal shall have been duly made to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, according to provisions of law in that regard, and the regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury established in pursuance thereof, and a decision of the commissioner has been had therein.' If, however, it is provided, decision be delayed more than six months from the date of the appeal, suit may be brought within another period prescribed, which it is not necessary to mention.\n The section is clear enough and unless modified or changed precludes the present suit as it was applicable to the tax involved (section 31 of the Act of 1898). But section 3 of the Act of 1902 and section 2 of the Act of 1912, supra, are invoked as removing the bar of section 3226. Section 3 of the Act of 1902 directs the Secretary of the Treasury to refund upon proper application being made to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue any tax that may have been collected on contingent beneficial interests which shall not have become vested prior to July 1, 1902. Section 2 of the Act of July 27, 1912, has a like direction to the Secretary of the Treasury to pay 'such claimants as have presented \n\n[249 U.S. 503, 508]\n\u00a0\n or shall hereafter so present their claims, and shall establish such erroneous or illegal assessment and collection, any sums paid by them.' There is no question that the cited sections remove the bar of sections 3226 and 3228 (Comp. St.  5949, 5951) if appellant has met their requirements and presented to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue a claim for the refund of the tax. Nor is the fact that the tax was voluntarily paid, that is, without protest, an impediment to the application of the act of 1912. United States v. Hvoslef, \n237 U.S. 1\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 459, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 286.\n It will be observed that the repayment is to be made to 'such claimants as have presented or shall hereafter so present their claims.' Has the appellant satisfied these requirements? Two claims were presented, one by the attorney of the trust company and one by attorneys acting for and in behalf of the administrator de bonis non of the estate of Edmund Dwight. Both claims were disallowed because, to quote the commissioner's letter:\n The 'tax was paid upon the absolutely vested interest of a stranger amounting to more than $25,000 and taxed at the legal rate of $7.50 per $100 and accordingly, under the decision of the Supreme Court in the Knowlton and Fidelity Trust cases1 all this tax was legally due.'\n The first demand, it is said, 'was presented by the testamentary trustee then holding trust funds to the use of the claimant, and authorized and required to protect her interests under and in connection with the trust fund. The other claim was filed by the personal representative of the decedent, successor to the executrix who had actually made the payment, although such payment was at the cost of' Mrs. Rand. And it is urged that--\n'The officers of the government were not misled at any time; there was no question as to the identity of the payment sought to be recovered or that of the person to whose benefit recovery would accrue.'\n\n The demands, therefore, it is the further contention, satisfied the statute and should \n\n[249 U.S. 503, 509]\n\u00a0\n be ascribed to Mrs. Rand, and that, the statute being remedial, its remedy is to be promoted by a liberal construction, not impeded by a strict and technical one; and there are adduced statutes that have been liberally construed. Booth's Case, 49 Ct. Cl. 699; Newcomber v. United States, 51 Ct. Cl. 408.\n The inutility of another demand is emphasized, either for information to the department or for the assertion of her claim. She knew, it is said, the precise facts of the demands that had been made and she knew, besides, that claims of the class to which hers belonged had been uniformly rejected and that another claim in her own name would have been no less a 'useless ceremony' than that which was declared in one of the cited cases. And she insists that such ceremony finds exemption in the case of Weaver v. Ewers, 195 Fed. 247, 115 C. C. A. 219. The case is not similar to that at bar. The tax there involved was paid under protest and there had been an application in writing by the payer of it for a refund of the amount. The application was held to have satisfied section 3226 and that there was no necessity for another after the tax was paid. The case at bar does not present the same situation. Its tax was paid without protest, and appellant seeks to avail herself of the act of 1912-not by performing its condition, but by asserting an exemption from performance because of its supposed inutility. The government besides contests the sufficiency and sincerity of her excuse and points out that, not only does the record fail to show that the presented claims were made in her behalf, but that one of the claims was made eight days and the other two days before the time within which claims could have been made and that the decisions rejecting them were several months afterwards, and she could not therefore have been influenced by the rejection. If it be replied that she relied on the rulings upon claims of the class to which hers belonged, the query occurs: Why did not the trustee of the fund and the representative of the estate \n\n[249 U.S. 503, 510]\n\u00a0\n rely on those rulings? Their relation to the taxes, whatever it was, was not as intimate as hers and hers would seem to have called for more solicitude and a demand by her as necessary as suit by her. It seems, therefore, that this suit is a postfact resolution and an experiment with the situation after the indulgent period of the statute. The act of 1912 cannot be made so compliant. It had its purpose and it is not satisfied by representative or negative action; it requires a positive and individual assertion of claim. The condition was easy of performance, its grant a concession, and there is no room for the plea to enlarge it beyond its words. It is direct and clear and liberal enough of itself. It says to the taxpayer: Make a claim for the tax you have paid, show its illegality, and it will be repaid to you. We cannot relax its requirements-certainly not on the assumption that they might have been useless if complied with.\n We see no reason for granting the motion for further findings nor the motion for certiorari, and both are denied.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Knowlton v.

MCCARTHY(1919)\nNo. 874\nArgued: Decided: June 2, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 283, 284]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Stephen C. Baldwin, of Brooklyn, N. Y., for appellant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Brown, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a final order of the District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissing writs of habeas corpus and certiorari sued out by appellant to determine the legality of his detention under a commitment issued by appellee Hitchcock, as United States commissioner, to hold appellant in the custody of the United States marshal pending the issuance of a warrant for his removal to the District of Columbia to answer an indictment returned against him by the grand jury of that District for an alleged violation of the Act of Congress of October 6, 1917, c. 106, 40 Stat. 411 (Comp. St. 1918,  3115 1\/2a-3115 1\/2j), known as the Trading with the Enemy Act.\n This indictment, described as the 'Washington indictment,' contains two counts, each of which recites the existence, at the time of the offense charged, of a state of war between the United States and the Imperial German government, and sets out that the Act of October 6, 1917, was in force, and that the Alien Property Custodian, an officer of the United States appointed \n\n[250 U.S. 283, 285]\n\u00a0\n under authority of that act, had his office for the transaction of official business in the District of Columbia and at no other place. In the first count it is recited that the statute made it the duty of any person in the United States having custody or control of any property of or on behalf of an enemy of the United States to report the fact to the Alien Property Custodian within a period said to have expired December 20, 1917; and it is alleged that on October 6, 1917, and on each day thereafter down to and including the date of the indictment (December 2, 1918), appellant had the custody and control of certain property in the United States, that is to say, certain capital stock of the S. S. McClure Newspaper Corporation, a corporation of the state of New York, which, as appellant knew, belonged to the Imperial German government, and that appellant 'at the District of Columbia and within the jurisdiction of this court' willfully failed, neglected, and omitted to report that fact to the Alien Property Custodian within the period prescribed by law and continuously down to and including the date of the indictment. The second count, in addition to the matter already stated, recites the provision of the act which made it the duty of any person in the United States indebted to an enemy of the United States to report the fact to the Custodian within a period prescribed, and avers that on October 6, 1917, and on each day thereafter down to, etc., appellant, then being within the United States, was indebted in the sum of $1,451,700 to the Imperial German government as he well knew, and being so indebted 'at the District of Columbia and within the jurisdiction of this court' willfully failed, neglected, and omitted to report the fact of such indebtedness to the Custodian.\n Previous to the Washington indictment two indictments had been returned by the United States grand jury for the Southern district of New York, upon which \n\n[250 U.S. 283, 286]\n\u00a0\n appellant was on bail awaiting trial. These were found August 2, 1918; one of them being against appellant alone, and charging perjury in a report made by him December 4, 1917, to the Alien Property Custodian, in that, being required to state the property held by him for alien ee mies and indebtedness owed by him to alien enemies, he swore that the only item in this category was a note for $100,000 made by him and payable to one Herman Sielcken, whereas it was alleged he was not indebted to Sielcken, but was indebted to the Imperial German government in the sum of $1,301, 700, and held and had control of certain property belonging to that government, consisting of shares of the capital stock of the S. S. McClure Newspaper Corporation, a corporation of the state of New York, which facts appellant did not report to the Custodian. In the other New York indictment appellant and one Kaufmann were indicted for a conspiracy to omit to report to the Custodian the fact that appellant had in his custody and control certain property consisting of shares of the capital stock of the S. S. McClure Newspaper Corporation for and in behalf of the Imperial German government, and that appellant was indebted to the said government in the sum of $1,431,700.\n At the hearings before the commissioner appellant admitted his identity and offered no evidence to meet the prima facie case made by producing an exemplified copy of the Washington indictment. On the other hand, it was and is admitted in behalf of the government that the New York indictments relate to the same transactions as the Washington indictment, and that they were pending in the Southern district of New York at the time the Washington indictment was found. To meet objections raised upon the hearing of the habeas corpus, the District Court embodied in the final order dismissing the writ clauses to the following effect: \n\n[250 U.S. 283, 287]\n\u00a0\n (a) One giving the consent of that court to the removal of defendant to the District of Columbia notwithstanding the pendency of the indictments in the New York district;\n\n\n (b)\n One directing a stay of removal pending appeal to this court;\n\n\n (c)\n And one directing that, within 30 days after appellant had pleaded to the Washington indictment, the United States attorney either for the Southern district of New York or for the District of Columbia should give him at least two weeks' notice as to which indictment it was intended to move first for trial.\n Appellant's first point is that in a legal sense there was no probable cause to believe that he had been guilty of the offense charged in the Washington indictment because he could not be required to make a report to the Alien Property Custodian of the facts alleged in that indictment, since this would compel him in a criminal case to be a witness against himself, contrary to the provision of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States in that behalf. As a basis for this contention appellant relies upon the uncontroverted averment in the first count of the Washington indictment that he held stock in the McClure Corporation for and on behalf of the German government and did not report that fact to the Alien Property Custodian; adds to this the fact, said to have been established by his own evidence introduced before the commissioner and not controverted by the government, that during a considerable period he had traded for the benefit of and with the McClure Corporation, so that (it is said) he was guilty of trading with the enemy contrary to section 3 of the act; from which it is deduced that if, as required by section 7(a) of the act, he had reported to the Alien Property Custodian that he held the McClure Corporation stock for the German government, as the first count of the Washington indictment alleges he was obliged to do, this disclosure would have tended to show that he \n\n[250 U.S. 283, 288]\n\u00a0\n was guilty under section 3 of the act of trading without a license, because it would have furnished an essential link in the chain of evidence necessary to convict him of that offense.\n It is at least questionable whether the point, assuming it to have merit, would have any application to the second count of the Washington indictment, which relates not to ownership of stock in the McClure Corporation, but to an indebtedness owing by appellant to the Gem an government and not reported.\n And it is further doubtful whether there is foundation for the contention as applied to the first count, since appellant predicates his trading with the enemy solely upon the fact of his trading with the McClure Corporation, a New York corporation, whereas by section 2 of the act the definition of 'enemy,' for the purposes of the statute, is to include merely 'any corporation incorporated within such territory of any nation with which the United States is at war or incorporated within any country other than the United States and doing business within such territory.'\n But consideration of these questions, or of any question raised under the fifth Amendment, would be premature in this proceeding, since it is entirely plain that they do not go to show a 'want of probable cause' within the meaning of the rule that is invoked. The accusatory averments of the indictment, admitted for the purposes of this proceeding to be true, make out a prima facie case of an offense against the laws of the United States indictable in the District of Columbia. Hyde v. Shine, \n199 \nU.S. 62, 84\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 760; Haas v. Henkel, \n216 \nU.S. 462, 481\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 249, 17 Ann. Cas. 1112. Appellant's constitutional point merely raises a probability that a defense will be interposed, and that thus a controversy will arise, the determination of which is within the proper jurisdiction of the court in which the indictment was found. This furnishes no legal obstacle to the removal of the accused to that jurisdiction; nor may the writ of habeas cor \n\n[250 U.S. 283, 289]\n\u00a0\n pus be employed as an anticipatory writ of error. Henry v. Henkel, \n235 \nU.S. 219, 229\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 54.\n It is contended, indeed, that there was no probable cause to believe that the offense charged in the Washington indictment was committed within the District of Columbia, and this upon the ground that appellant was not personally present in the District at the time of the alleged offense, and that he was under no duty to make report there to the Alien Property Custodian. The commissioner, however, found as a matter of fact that the Custodian's office was in the District of Columbia, and as the finding was supported by competent evidence the District Court properly held that it was not reviewable on writ of habeas corpus. That being so, the duty imposed by the statute to make report to the Alien Property Custodian involved the duty to make such report in the District of Columbia, and failure to make it was an offense against the United States committed in that District. United States v. Lombardo, \n241 \nU.S. 73, 76\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 508; New York Central, etc., R. R. Co. v. United States, 166 Fed. 267, 269, 92 C. C. A. 331.\n It is contended that the removal of appellant to the District of Columbia amounts to an invasion of his constitutional right to a speedy trial on the New York indictments, and that the consent of the District Court for the Southern District of New York to such removal ought not to have been given without requiring from the representative of the government a statement of reasons. These points raise no more than questions of discretion, the determination of which is not for our review.\n Final order affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE dissents. \n\n\n\n","176":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRUST LAND & LUMBER CO. v. JACKSON(1919)\nNo. 171\nArgued: March 4, 1919Decided: May 19, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 71, 72]\n\u00a0\n Messrs.Albert M. Kales, Herbert Pope, Stephen A. Foster, and Harry Eugene Kelly, all of Chicago, Ill., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Garner W. Green and Marcellus Green, both of Jackson, miss., and Gerald Fitz Gerald, of Clarksdale, Miss., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case was brought on for argument immediately following Arkansas v. Mississippi, No. 7, Original, \n250 U.S. 39\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 422, 63 L. Ed . --, this day disposed of.\n It was a replevin suit, brought in the circuit court of one of the counties of Mississippi by defendants in error to recover certain timber taken by plaintiff in error from their possession under a claim of ownership. They recovered a verdict and judgment in the circuit court, and the judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state, without opinion (73 South. 345). Ownership of the timber was deemed to depend upon the ownership of the land from which it had been cut; and this was in dispute, and according to the theory of plaintiff in error was dependent upon the location of the state boundary. The land lay in the Mississippi river bottom, in the vicinity of Horseshoe Bend, where a portion of the former channel had been abandoned as the result of a sudden change that occurred in the year \n\n[250 U.S. 71, 73]\n\u00a0\n 1848; the river having broken through the neck of the Bend and formed a new channel there, with the result that in the course of time the former channel around the Bend was abandoned and in large part filled up, and its location as it was prior to the avulsion has become, after the lapse of so many years, difficult of ascertainment. The adjoining states whose common boundary is marked by the river at this point are in dispute as to its former location, and also as to whether the boundary ought to follow the middle of the former main channel of navigation or rather a line equidistant from the banks of the river at ordinary stage of water. To determine this controversy, the suit between the states was brought in this court, and it is still pending.\n It is the contention of plaintiff in error that the judgment in the present case was based upon the determination of an issue which necessarily involved the location of the interstate boundary; and our first inquiry must be whether the judgment of the Supreme Court of Mississippi herein is reviewable in this court by writ of error. The judgment was rendered December 23, 1916, after the taking effect of the Act of September 6, 1916 (chapter 448,  2, 39 Stat. 726), amendatory of section 237, Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1156 [Comp. St.  1214]), and hence is reviewable here, if at all, only by virtue of that act and in accordance with its provisions.\n It is asserted that the issue involving the location of the boundary line between the states was submitted to the jury under instructions from the trial judge based upon a theory inconsistent with the true principle of decision as laid down by this court in Iowa v. Illinois, \n147 U.S. 1\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 239, Arkansas v. Tennessee, \n246 U.S. 158\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 301, L. R. A. 1918D, 258, and Cissna v. Tennessee, \n246 U.S. 289\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 306, and that thereby plaintiff in error was deprived of a right, privilege, or immunity claimed under the Constitution of the United States and treaties made thereunder. Even if the record showed that such a right, privilege, or immunity was properly set up \n\n[250 U.S. 71, 74]\n\u00a0\n and claimed in the state court, it of course is not maintained, nor could it be, that under section 237, Judicial Code, as amended, a federal question of this character would give us jurisdiction to review the resulting judgment by writ of error. Were that the only federal question, clearly it would at most furnish ground for a review by certiorari.\n But it is insisted that the Supreme Court of the state, in the course of its review of the judgment of the circuit court, rendered an adverse decision upon the question of the validity of an authority exercised under the United States, and for this reason we have jurisdiction by writ of error under the amended section 237.\n The question arose as follows: Plaintiff in error moved the Supreme Court to continue the cause until the decision by this court of the original action then and still pending between the states of Arkansas and Mississippi, in which the location of the disputed boundary at or near the land in question is involved. This motion at first was sustained; but afterwards the defendants in error moved to set aside the continuance upon these grounds: (1) That the decision of this court in the suit between the states would not be controlling in the present case because it would not be rendered upon the same testimony; (2) that the Supreme Court of Mississippi was an appellate tribunal without original jurisdiction, empowered only to affirm or reverse a decision of the circuit court, depending upon whether that court upon the evidence before it had reached a correct conclusion, and that there was no way in which the judgment of this court in the suit between the states could be introduced before the Supreme Court of Mississippi; and (3) because the latter court was not in any way subject to the final jurisdiction of this court. This motion was sustained, the continuance was set aside, and the cause was placed upon the docket and afterwards disposed of in its regular order, with the result, as is maintained, that final judgment was rendered upon an \n\n[250 U.S. 71, 75]\n\u00a0\n erroneous theory respecting the location of the interstate boundary line.\n It is the contention of plaintiff in error that by the last-mentioned motion the validity of the authority of this court to determine the issues involved in the suit between the states was drawn in question, and that the decision of the Supreme Court of Mississippi was against its validity.\n We do not, however, regard the ruling of the state court as having involved the authority or jurisdiction of this court to render a conclusive decision in the suit between the states respecting the location of the boundary line, and hence do not consider that there was any question concerning the validity of 'an authority exercised under the United States' within the meaning of section 237. The question raised involved merely the consequences that were to flow from the exercise of an admittedly valid authority under the United States; that is to say, the effect upon the rights of third parties of a particular exercise by this court of its constitutional jurisdiction over a controversy between two states-the concrete questions being (a) whether, in the event that our decision should be adverse to the state of Mississippi, and therefore, according to the theory of plaintiff in error, inconsistent with the title of its opponents, plaintiff in error would be entitled to set up that decision and judgment as conclusive against defendants in error; and (b) whether, in aid of such right, plaintiff in error was entitled to have the suit against it in the state court stayed to await our decision in the suit between the states. In effect, the contention was that the original jurisdiction conferred by the Constitution upon this court in controversies between states was of such a nature as to render our decree made in a suit of that kind binding upon private parties asserting opposing claims to lands in the disputed territory, and to prevent such private parties from prosecuting their liti \n\n[250 U.S. 71, 76]\n\u00a0\n gation in a state court pending our determination of the suit between states. In setting up this contention plaintiff in error did no more than assert a title, right, privilege, or immunity under the Constitution of the United States. This, at most, afforded ground for an application to this court for a review of the resulting judgment by certiorari, but not for a writ of error. The case of Cissna v. Tennessee, \n242 U.S. 195\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 108; \n246 \nU.S. 289, 293\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 306, in which a similar question was raised but not passed upon was brought to this court by writ of error, but before section 237, Judicial Code was amended by the act of 1916. The present writ of error must be dismissed.\n On the eve of the argument a writ of certiorari was applied for; but as this was long after the expiration of the three months limited by section 6 of the Act of September 6, 1916 (Comp. St.  1228a), the application cannot be entertained, irrespective of whether the record shows a proper case for the allowance of that writ.\n Writ of error dismissed.\n Application for writ of certiorari denied. \n\n\n\n","177":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSAGE v. U S(1919)\nNo. 344\nArgued: April 29, 1919Decided: May 19, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. H. T. Newcomb, of New York City, for appellants.\n Mr. Solicitor General Alex. C. King, of Atlanta, Ga., for the United States.\n\n\n[250 U.S. 33, 36]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a claim under the Acts of June 27, 1902, c. 1160,  3, 32 Stat. 406, and of July 27, 1912, c. 256, 37 Stat. 240, to have refunded a tax collected under the Act of June 13, 1898, c. 448,  29, 30 Stat. 448, 464, 465, upon legacies to the wife and children of the testator Dean Sage. The petition was dismissed by the Court of Claims on demurrer. The testator died domiciled in New York on June 23, 1902, so that the debts of the estate were not ascertained and, as decided in McCoach v. Pratt, \n236 U.S. 562\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 421; the legacies were not 'absolutely vested in possession or enjoyment' before July 1, 1902, and therefore by the terms of the Act of 1902 were not subject to the tax under the above mentioned  29. A tax of $63,940.88 was collected, however, in June, 1903. On August 24, 1903, an application to have it refunded on the ground that the legacies were not subject to taxation under  29 was made to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, but was denied in the following month. Two years later the petitioners sued the Collector and in May, 1912, got judgment for $30,275.49, with interest and costs, which was satisfied by the United States. McCoach v. Pratt, supra, and United States v. Jones, \n236 U.S. 106\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 261, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 316, had not been decided at that time and it was held that some of the interests were vested in enjoyment. Ward v. Sage, 185 Fed. 7, 108 C. C. A. 413. This suit is for the unrepaid residue and was begun on January 23, 1917. The Government contends that the judgment and also the Act of July 27, 1912, c. 256,  1, 37 Stat. 240, are bars to the present claim.\n The former judgment is not a bar. It is true that the \n\n[250 U.S. 33, 37]\n\u00a0\n statutes modify the common law liability for money wrongfully collected by duress so far as to require a preliminary appeal to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue before bringing a suit. Rev. St.  3226 (Comp. St.  5949 ). It is true also that it is the duty of the District Attorney to appear for the collector in such suits, Rev. St. 771 (Comp. St.  1296); that the judgment is to be paid by the United States and the collector is exempted from execution if a certificate is granted by the Court that there was probable cause for his act, Rev. St.  989 (Comp. St.  1635); and that there was a permanent appropriation for the refunding of taxes illegally collected. Rev. St.  3689 (17) (Comp. St.  6799). No doubt too, if it appeared in a suit against a collector who had acted with probable cause and had turned over his money to the United States, that a part of the tax properly was due to the United States, unnecessary formalities might be omitted and the sum properly due might be retained. Of course, the United States in such a case could not require a second payment of that sum. Crocker v. Malley, March 17, 1919. \n249 U.S. 223\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 270. But no one could contend that technically a judgment of a District Court in a suit against a collector was a judgment against or in favor of the United States. It is hard to say that the United States is privy to such a judgment or that it would be bound by it if a suit were brought in the Court of Claims. The suit is personal and its incidents, such as the nature of the defenses open and the allowance of interest, are different. It does not concern property in which the United States asserts an interest on its own behalf or as trustee, as in Minnesota v. Hitchcock, \n185 \nU.S. 373, 388\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 650. At the time the judgment is entered the United States is a stranger. Subsequently the discretionary action of officials may, or it may not, give the United States a practical interest in the amount of the judgment, as determining the amount of a claim against it, but the claim would arise from the subsequent official act, not from the judgment itself. United States v. \n\n[250 U.S. 33, 38]\n\u00a0\n Frerichs, \n124 U.S. 315\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 514. But perhaps it would be enough to say that if the judgment otherwise were a bar the bar would be removed by the subsequent enactment of the Act of July 27, 1912, c. 256, 37 Stat. 240, upon which, as well as the Act of 1902, this claim is based.\n The Act of July 27, 1912, after providing in  1 for the presentation of claims for taxes erroneously collected under the above mentioned  29, as stated in the preceding case of Coleman v. United States, \n250 U.S. 30\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 414, 63 L. Ed. --, directs repayment in  2 to 'such claimants as have presented or shall hereafter so present their claims,' and establish them. The claimants had presented their claim, and so had complied with the letter of the Act. But it is said that they filed it simply as a prerequisite to their suit against the collector and that its effect was extinguished by the judgment in that suit. This argument reads into the words of the statute what is not there and reads what was there out of the claim. The claim was presented to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to get the money. The suit was only the undesired alternative in case the Commissioner rejected the claim. It plays no part in the question that we now are considering. Suppose that no suit had been brought we can see no ground for denying that the claim would have been presented within the meaning of the Act. It did not have to be a claim under the act as the statute in terms contemplated that it might have been presented before the statute was passed. But if the presenting was sufficient before the suit was brought it is sufficient now. The statute of course does not confine its act of justice to unrejected claims.\n The Act of 1912 applied in terms to 'all claims for the refunding of any internal tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed and collected' under the above mentioned  29. The only condition was that it should have been presented not later than January 1, 1914. Until that time no statute of limitations could begin to run. \n\n[250 U.S. 33, 39]\n\u00a0\n After the Act was passed an application was made on September 7, 1916, to the Secretary of the Treasury for repayment of the residue of the erroneously collected tax. It was rejected on October 30, 1916, on the mistaken ground that the judgment against the collector finished the matter. This suit was brought on January 23, 1917, and so was within the six years allowed by Rev. St.  1069 (Comp. St.  1147), for suits in the Court of Claims. The Act of 1912, like that of 1902 created rights where they had not existed before, United States v. Hvoslef, \n237 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 13 S., 35 Sup. Ct. 459, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 286, and the claimant's rights are not barred. See further James v. Hicks, \n110 U.S. 272\n, 4 Sup. Ct. 6.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","178":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSCHENCK v. U.S.(1919)\nNo. 437\nArgued: Decided: March 3, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[249 U.S. 47, 48]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Henry John Nelson and Henry Johns Gibbons, both of Philadelphia, Pa., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. John Lord O'Brian, of Buffalo, N. Y., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an indictment in three counts. The first charges a conspiracy to violate the Espionage Act of June 15, 1917, c. 30, tit. 1,  3, 40 Stat. 217, 219 (Comp. St. 1918,  10212c), by causing and attempting \n\n[249 U.S. 47, 49]\n\u00a0\n to cause insubordination, &c., in the military and naval forces of the United States, and to obstruct the recruiting and enlistment service of the United States, when the United States was at war with the German Empire, to-wit, that the defendant wilfully conspired to have printed and circulated to men who had been called and accepted for military service under the Act of May 18, 1917, c. 15, 40 Stat. 76 (Comp. St. 1918,  2044a-2044k), a document set forth and alleged to be calculated to cause such insubordination and obstruction. The count alleges overt acts in pursuance of the conspiracy, ending in the distribution of the document set forth. The second count alleges a conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, to-wit, to use the mails for the transmission of matter declared to be non-mailable by title 12,  2, of the Act of June 15, 1917 (Comp. St. 1918,  10401b), to-wit, the above mentioned document, with an averment of the same overt acts. The third count charges an unlawful use of the mails for the transmission of the same matter and otherwise as above. The defendants were found guilty on all the counts. They set up the First Amendment to the Constitution forbidding Congress to make any law abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, and bringing the case here on that ground have argued some other points also of which we must dispose.\n It is argued that the evidence, if admissible, was not sufficient to prove that the defendant Schenck was concerned in sending the documents. According to the testimony Schenck said he was general secretary of the Socialist party and had charge of the Socialist headquarters from which the documents were sent. He identified a book found there as the minutes of the Executive Committee of the party. The book showed a resolution of August 13, 1917, that 15,000 leaflets should be printed on the other side of one of them in use, to be mailed to men who had passed exemption boards, and for distribution. Schenck personally attended to the printing. On \n\n[249 U.S. 47, 50]\n\u00a0\n August 20 the general secretary's report said 'Obtained new leaflets from printer and started work addressing envelopes' &c.; and there was a resolve that Comrade Schenck be allowed $125 for sending leaflets through the mail. He said that he had about fifteen or sixteen thousand printed. There were files of the circular in question in the inner office which he said were printed on the other side of the one sided circular and were there for distribution. Other copies were proved to have been sent through the mails to drafted men. Without going into confirmatory details that were proved, no reasonable man could doubt that the defendant Schenck was largely instrumental in sending the circulars about. As to the defendant Baer there was evidence that she was a member of the Executive Board and that the minutes of its transactions were hers. The argument as to the sufficiency of the evidence that the defendants conspired to send the documents only impairs the seriousness of the real defence.\n It is objected that the documentary evidence was not admissible because obtained upon a search warrant, valid so far as appears. The contrary is established. Adams v. New York, \n192 U.S. 585\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 372; Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383, 395\n, 396 S., 34 Sup. Ct. 341, L. R. A. 1915B, 834, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 1177. The search warrant did not issue against the defendant but against the Socialist headquarters at 1326 Arch street and it would seem that the documents technically were not even in the defendants' possession. See Johnson v. United States, \n228 U.S. 457\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 572, 47 L. R. A. ( N. S.) 263. Notwithstanding some protest in argument the notion that evidence even directly proceeding from the defendant in a criminal proceeding is excluded in all cases by the Fifth Amendment is plainly unsound. Holt v. United States, \n218 \nU.S. 245, 252\n, 253 S., 31 Sup. Ct. 2\n\n\n The document in question upon its first printed side recited the first section of the Thirteenth Amendment, said that the idea embodied in it was violated by the conscription act and that a conscript is little better than a \n\n[249 U.S. 47, 51]\n\u00a0\n convict. In impassioned language it intimated that conscription was despotism in its worst form and a monstrous wrong against humanity in the interest of Wall Street's chosen few. It said, 'Do not submit to intimidation,' but in form at least confined itself to peaceful measures such as a petition for the repeal of the act. The other and later printed side of the sheet was headed 'Assert Your Rights.' It stated reasons for alleging that any one violated the Constitution when he refused to recognize 'your right to assert your opposition to the draft,' and went on, 'If you do not assert and support your rights, you are helping to deny or disparage rights which it is the solemn duty of all citizens and residents of the United States to retain.' It described the arguments on the other side as coming from cunning politicians and a mercenary capitalist press, and even silent consent to the conscription law as helping to support an infamous conspiracy. It denied the power to send our citizens away to foreign shores to shoot up the people of other lands, and added that words could not express the condemnation such cold-blooded ruthlessness deserves , &c., &c., winding up, 'You must do your share to maintain, support and uphold the rights of the people of this country.' Of course the document would not have been sent unless it had been intended to have some effect, and we do not see what effect it could be expected to have upon persons subject to the draft except to influence them to obstruct the carrying of it out. The defendants do not deny that the jury might find against them on this point.\n But it is said, suppose that that was the tendency of this circular, it is protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution. Two of the strongest expressions are said to be quoted respectively from well-known public men. It well may be that the prohibition of laws abridging the freedom of speech is not confined to previous restraints, although to prevent them may have been the \n\n[249 U.S. 47, 52]\n\u00a0\n main purpose, as intimated in Patterson v. Colorado, \n205 \nU.S. 454, 462\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 556, 51 L. ed. 879, 10 Ann. Cas. 689. We admit that in many places and in ordinary times the defendants in saying all that was said in the circular would have been within their constitutional rights. But the character of every act depends upon the circumstances in which it is done. Aikens v. Wisconsin, \n195 \nU.S. 194, 205\n, 206 S., 25 Sup. Ct. 3. The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic. It does not even protect a man from an injunction against uttering words that may have all the effect of force. Gompers v. Buck's Stove & Range Co., \n221 \nU.S. 418, 439\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 492, 55 L. ed. 797, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 874. The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent. It is a question of proximity and degree. When a nation is at war many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so long as men fight and that no Court could regard them as protected by any constitutional right. It seems to be admitted that if an actual obstruction of the recruiting service were proved, liability for words that produced that effect might be enforced. The statute of 1917 in section 4 (Comp. St. 1918 ,  10212d) punishes conspiracies to obstruct as well as actual obstruction. If the act, (speaking, or circulating a paper,) its tendency and the intent with which it is done are the same, we perceive no ground for saying that success alone warrants making the act a crime. Goldman v. United States, \n245 U.S. 474\n, 477 38 Sup. Ct. 166, 62 L. ed. 410. Indeed that case might be said to dispose of the present contention if the precedent covers all media concludendi. But as the right to free speech was not referred to specially, we have thought fit to add a few words.\n It was not argued that a conspiracy to obstruct the draft was not within the words of the Act of 1917. The \n\n[249 U.S. 47, 53]\n\u00a0\n words are 'obstruct the recruiting or enlistment service,' and it might be suggested that they refer only to making it hard to get volunteers. Recruiting heretofore usually having been accomplished by getting volunteers the word is apt to call up that method only in our minds. But recruiting is gaining fresh supplies for the forces, as well by draft as otherwise. It is put as an alternative to enlistment or voluntary enrollment in this act. The fact that the Act of 1917 was enlarged by the amending Act of May 16, 1918, c. 75, 40 Stat. 553, of course, does not affect the present indictment and would not, even if the former act had been repealed.

Wilson, of Portland, Or., and A. S. Bennett, of Salem, Or., for Seufert Bros. Co.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Brown, for the United States and another. \n\n[249 U.S. 194, 195]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n As trustee and guardian of the Yakima Indians, the government of the United States instituted this suit in the federal District Court for the District of Oregon to restrain defendant, a corporation, its officers, agents, and employes, from interfering with the fishing rights in a described locality on the south side and bank of the Columbia river, which it was alleged were secured to the Indians by article 3 of the treaty between them and the United States, concluded June 9, 1855, and ratified by the Senate on March 8, 1859 (12 Stat. 951).\n The District Court granted in part the relief prayed for and found as follows:\n That the 'following described portion of the south bank of the Columbia river in the county of Wasco, state and district of Oregon, was at the time of the treaty, always has been, and now is, one of the usual and accustomed fishing places belonging to and possessed by the Confederated Tribes and Bands of Indians known as the Yakima Nation. ...'\n And the court further decreed that the rights and privileges to fish in common with citizens of the United States reserved by said Yakima Nation and guaranteed by the United States to it in the treaty of June 9, 1855, applied to all the usual and accustomed fishing places on the south bank or shore of the Columbia river, in the decree described.\n An appeal from the decree granting an injunction brings the case here for review.\n As stated by counsel for the appellant the most important question in the case is this: Did the treaty with the Yakima Tribes of Indians ceding to the United States lands occupied by them, on the north side of the Columbia river in the territory of Washington and reserving to the Indians 'the right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places in common with citizens of the territory' give them the right to fish in the country of another \n\n[249 U.S. 194, 196]\n\u00a0\n tribe on the south or Oregon side of the river? The appeal requires the construction of the language quoted in this question, and the circumstances incident to the making of the treaty are important.\n Fourteen tribes or bands of confederated Indians, which, for the purposes of the treaty were considered as one nation under the name of Yakima Nation, at the time of the making of the treaty occupied an extensive area in the territory, now state, of Washington, which is described in the treaty, and was bounded on the south by the Columbia river. By this treaty the government secured the relinquishment by the Indians of all their rights in an extensive region, and in consideration therefor a described part of the lands claimed by them was set apart for their exclusive use and benefit as an Indian reservation, and in addition fishing privileges were reserved to them by the following provision in article 3:\n'The exclusive right of taking fish in all the streams, where running through or bordering said reservation, is further secured to said confederated tribes and bands of Indians, as also the right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places, in common with citizens of the territory, and of erecting temporary buildings for curing them.'\n\n This treaty was one of a group of eleven treaties negotiated with the Indian tribes of the northwest between December 26, 1854, and July 16, 1855, inclusive. Six of these were concluded between June 9th and July 16th, inclusive, and one of these last, dated June 25th, was with the Walla-Walla and Wasco Tribes, 'residing in Middle Oregon,' and occupying a large area, bounded on the north by that part of the Columbia river in which the fishing places in controversy are located (12 Stat. 963). This treaty contains a provision for an Indian reservation and one saving fishing rights very similar in its terms to that of the Yakima treaty, viz.:\n'That the exclusive right of taking fish in the streams running through and \n\n[249 U.S. 194, 197]\n\u00a0\n bordering said reservation is hereby secured to said Indians; and at all other usual and accustomed stations, in common with citizens of the United States, and of erecting suitable houses for curing the same.'\n\n These treaties were negotiated in a group for the purpose of freeing a great territory from Indian claims, preparatory to opening it to settlers, and it is obvious that with the treaty with the tribes inhabiting Middle Oregon in effect, the Untied States was in a position to fulfill any agreement which it might make to secure fishing rights in, or on either bank of, the Columbia river in the part of it now under consideration-and the treaty was with the government, not with Indians, former occupants of relinquished lands.\n The District Court found, on what was sufficient evidence, that the Indians living on each side of the river, ever since the treaty was negotiated, had been accustomed to cross to the other side to fish, that the members of the tribes associated freely and intermarried, and that neither claimed exclusive control of the fishing places on either side of the river or the necessary use of the river banks, but used both in common. One Indian witness, says the court, 'likened the river to a great table where all the Indians might come to partake.'\n The record also shows with sufficient certainty, having regard to the character of evidence which must necessarily be relied upon in such a case, that the members of the tribes designated in the treaty as Yakima Indians, and also Indians from the south side of the river, were accustomed to resort habitually to the locations described in the decree for the purposes of fishing at the time the treaty was entered into, and that they continued to do so to the time of the taking of the evidence in the case, and also that Indians from both sides of the river built houses upon the south bank in which to dry and cure their fish during the fishing season. \n\n[249 U.S. 194, 198]\n\u00a0\n This recital of the facts and circumstances of the case renders it unnecessary to add much to what was said by this court in United States v. Winans, \n198 U.S. 371\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 662, in which this same provision of this treaty was considered and construed. The right claimed by the Indians in that case was to fishing privileges on the north part and bank of the Columbia river-in this case similar rights are claimed on the south part and bank of the river.\n The difference upon which the appellant relies to distinguish this from the former case is that the lands of the Yakima Indians were all to the north of the river and therefore it is said that their rights could not extend beyond the middle of that stream, and also that since the proviso we are considering, is in the nature of an exception from the general grant of the treaty, whatever rights it saves must be reserved out of the thing granted, and as all of the lands of the Yakima tribes lay to the north of the river it cannot give any rights on the south bank.\n But in the former case (United States v. Winans, supra), the principle to be applied in the construction of this treaty was given in this statement:\n'We will construe a treaty with the Indians as 'that unlettered people' understood it, and 'as justice and reason demand in all cases where power is exerted by the strong over those to whom they owe care and protection,' and counterpoise the inequality 'by the superior justice which looks only to the substance of the right without regard to technical rules.' [Choctaw Nation v. U. S.] \n119 U.S. 1\n [7 Sup. Ct. 75; Jones v. Meehan], U. S. 1 [20 Sup. Ct. 1].'\n\n How the Indians understood this proviso we are considering is not doubtful. During all the years since the treaty was signed they have been accustomed habitually to resort for fishing to the places to which the decree of the lower court applies, and they have shared such places with Indians of other tribes from the south side of the river and with white men. This shows clearly that their understanding of the treaty was that they had the right \n\n[249 U.S. 194, 199]\n\u00a0\n to resort to these fishing grounds and make use of them in common with other citizens of the United States-and this is the extent of the right that is secured to them by the decree we are asked to revise.\n To restrain the Yakima Indians to fishing on the north side and shore of the river would greatly restrict the comprehensive language of the treaty, which gives them the right 'of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places and of erecting temporary buildings for curing them,' and would substitute for the natural meaning of the expression used-for the meaning which it is proved the Indians, for more than fifty years derived from it-the artificial meaning which might be given to it by the law and by lawyers.\n The suggestion, so impressively urged, that this construction 'imposes a servitude upon the Oregon soil,' is not alarming from the point of view of the public, and private owners not only had notice of these Indian customary rights by the reservation of them in the treaty, but the 'servitude' is one existing only where there was an habitual and customary use of the premises, which must have been so open and notorious during a considerable portion of each year, that any person, not negligently or willfully blind to the conditions of the property he was purchasing, must have known of them.\n The only other questions argued by the appellant relate to the claims which counsel anticipated would be made on the cross-appeal by the government, which, however, was abandoned before oral argument and must be dismissed. It results that the decree of the District Court must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","180":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSHAFFER v.

But the absence of power which results from such disappearance cannot be supplied by the request referred to, since after all it amounts to but a suggestion that that be done which there is no authority to do; in other words that the cause be decided in the absence of the parties whose presence is essential to its decision.

St.  8566), declares that:\n'Whenever a carrier by railroad shall in competition with a water route or routes reduce the rates on the carriage of any species of freight to or from competitive points, it shall not be permitted to increase such rates unless after hearing by the Interstate Commerce Commission, it shall be found that such proposed increase rests upon changed conditions other than the elimination of water competition.'\n\n On August 21, 1916, Skinner and Eddy Corporation brought this suit in the District Court of the United States for the District of Oregon to enjoin an increase in carload rates on iron and steel products from Pittsburgh to Seattle. The United States, the commission, and sixteen railroads were joined as defendants. The bill charged that the action of the carriers in increasing \n\n[249 U.S. 557, 559]\n\u00a0\n their rates and that of the commission in authorizing such increase violated the above provision of the Commerce Act and, being beyond their respective powers, was void. The relief asked against the carriers was to prevent the collection of the proposed increased rates until the 'commission shall have held a hearing to determine whether the proposed increases rest upon changed conditions other than the elimination of water competition.' The relief asked against the commission was to prevent its taking any steps to enforce certain orders 'so far as the same permit' such increases. An application for an interlocutory injunction heard before three judges on December 29, 1916, was denied; and later the bill and a supplemental bill, filed December 16, 1916, were dismissed on the ground that they do not state any cause of action. The case comes here by direct appeal. The essential facts are these:\n After the decision by this court in InterMountain Rate Cases, \n234 U.S. 476\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 986, and while the Sacramento Case ( United States v. Merchants' & Manufacturers' Traffic Association, \n242 U.S. 178\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 24) was pending in the District Court, carriers forming connecting lines between Pittsburgh and Seattle applied to the commission in the same proceeding for further modification of amended fourth section order No. 124, so as to permit a reduction in carload rates or iron and steel products from Pittsburgh to Seattle without making such reduced rates applicable to intermediate points of destination. An order granting leave for a reduction from 80 cents1 to 65 cents per 100 pounds was entered March 1, 1916. Rates on Iron and Steel Articles, 38 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 237. The carriers soon thereafter filed tariffs making that reduction \n\n[249 U.S. 557, 560]\n\u00a0\n effective April 10, 1916; and on that date, the 65-cent rate became operative.\n During March, 1916, two applications had been made to the commission in the same proceeding on behalf of shippers to reopen for further consideration other fourth section applications of carriers concerning westbound transcontinental rates and for modification of orders issued thereon. The petitioners for such modification were the Spokane Merchants' Association and the Railroad Commission of Nevada, which had theretofore taken an active part in the proceedings. Railroad Commission of Nevada v. Southern Pacific Co., 21 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 329; Commodity Rates to Pacific Coast Terminals, 32 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 611. Their prayer was for removal of the existing discrimination in transcontinental freight rates against the intermountain territory and in favor of the Pacific Coast ports. The ground alleged for seeking the modification was that by reason of slides in the Panama Canal and the increased demand for shipping due to the world war, water competition, which had theretofore been held to justify lower rates to the Pacific Coast ports, had in large part disappeared. Thereupon the commission reopened on April 1, 1916, these applications, including that on which was entered the order of March 1, 1916, respecting iron and steel rates from Pittsburgh to Seattle; and a hearing was ordered 'respecting the changed conditions which are alleged in justification of a modification of the commission's orders.'\n None of the railroads had requested the reopening of the applications or the hearing; and, when it was held, all opposed further modification of the transcontinental rates. No increased rates were proposed by them; and no specific increased rates were considered by the commission. The petitioners introduced evidence respecting the changed conditions as a basis for modifying the several fourth section orders. On June 5, 1916, the commission \n\n[249 U.S. 557, 561]\n\u00a0\n filed a report (Reopening Fourth Section Applications, 40 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 35), in which it found that while the Panama Canal had been meanwhile reopened, there was not then 'any effective water competition between the two coasts,' or likely to be any in the near future, and that 'the war and an unparalleled rise in prices for ocean transportation have so changed the situation as to transform a relation of rates which was justified when established to one that is now unjustly discriminatory against intermediate points.' It found also that these conditions were temporary. An order (amended July 13, 1916) was then entered, effective September 1, 1916, rescinding those previously entered on the several applications of carriers, including that of March 1, 1916, authorizing the 65-cent Pittsburgh-Seattle rate; and the carriers were directed to reduce the degree of discrimination then existing in favor of Pacific Coast ports as against intermediate territory.\n Upon entry of this order the carriers filed tariffs effective September 1, 1916, raising, among others, the Pittsburgh-Seattle iron and steel rates from 65 cents to 94 cents. Promptly, on August 4, 1916, Skinner & Eddy Corporation protested, requested that the tariffs effective September 1, 1916, raising, had thereon, and alleged that the proposed increase violated, as later set forth in its bill of complaint, the last paragraph of the fourth section. Their request was not then granted. Thereafter, by action of the commission and the carriers, not necessary to detail, the effective date of the tariff fixing the 94-cent rate was postponed to December 30, 1916; and meanwhile these tariffs were, with consent of the commission, canceled upon the understanding that new tariffs fixing a 75-cent rate effective on that day would be filed. When the 75-cent rate was filed, Skinner & Eddy Corporation again protested on the same ground, and made, as theretofore, the same request for a suspension \n\n[249 U.S. 557, 562]\n\u00a0\n of the tariffs and a hearing; and again the request was not granted.\n First. The defendants contend that the District Court did not have jurisdiction of the subject-matter of this suit; because orders entered in a fourth section proceeding cannot be assailed in the courts; at least, not until after a remedy has been sought under sections 13 and 15 of the Act to Regulate Commerce (Comp. St.  8581, 8583). This contention proceeds apparently upon a misapprehension of plaintiff's position. If plaintiff had sought relief against a rate or practice alleged to be unjust because unreasonably high or discriminatory, the remedy must have been sought primarily by proceedings before the commission, Loomis v. Lehigh Valley Railroad Co., \n240 \nU.S. 43, 50\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 228; Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. American Tie & Timber Co., \n234 \nU.S. 138, 146\n, 34 S. Sup.

Ct. 114; Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. v. Pitcairn Coal Co., \n245 U.S. 481\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 164; and the finding thereon would have been conclusive, unless there was lack of substantial evidence, some irregularity in the proceedings, or some error in the application of rules of law; Manufacturers' Ry. Co. v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 457, 482\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 383; Pennsylvania Co. v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 351, 361\n, 35 S. Sup.

But plaintiff does not contend that 75 cents is an unreasonably high rate, or that it is discriminatory, or that there was mere error in the action of the commission. The contention is that the commission has exceeded its statutory powers; and that, hence, the order is void. In such a case the courts have jurisdiction of suits to enjoin the enforcement of an order, even if the plaintiff has not attempted to secure redress in a proceeding before the commission. Interstate Commerce \n\n[249 U.S. 557, 563]\n\u00a0\n Commission v. Diffenbaugh, \n222 \nU.S. 42, 49\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 22; Louisiana & P. Ry. Co. v. United States (Com.

The defendants contend, also, that if the subject-matter was within the jurisdiction of a District Court of the United States, it was not within that of Oregon. The objection is based upon Act Oct. 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 219 (Comp. St.  994), which declares:\n'The venue of any suit hereafter brought to enforce, suspend, or set aside, in whole or in part, any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission shall be in the judicial district wherein is the residence of the party or any of the parties upon whose petition the order was made.'\n\n And it is asserted that the parties upon whose petition the order was made are the Merchants' Association of Spokane, a resident of the Eastern district of Washington, and the Railroad Commission of Nevada, a resident of the district of Nevada. The applications of these parties, filed in March, 1916, were doubtless instrumental in securing a reopening of the proceedings which resulted in the order complained of. But the proceedings in which the order was made were the original application of carriers for relief under the fourth section. The report and the order are entitled, 'In the Matter of Reopening Fourth Section Applications.' One of for relief from the provisions of the fourth for relief rom the provisions of the fourth section was a resident of Oregon, namely, the Oregon-Washington Railroad & Navigation Company; and, as it was joined as defendant in the suit, the District Court of Oregon had jurisdiction over the parties. \n\n[249 U.S. 557, 564]\n\u00a0\n Third. The main contention of plaintiff is that, as the carriers had in 1916 reduced the rate from 80 cents to 65 cents, neither the carriers nor the commission had power to increase the rate without a prior finding by the commission upon proper hearing 'that such proposed increase rests upon changed conditions other than the elimination of water competition,' and that no such hearing had been had or finding made.\n In construing this provision it is important to bear in mind the limits of the commission's control over rates. Neither the Act to Regulate Commerce nor any amendment thereof has taken from the carriers the power which they originally possessed, to initiate rates; that is, the power, in the first instance, to fix rates or to increase or to reduce them. \n2\n Legislation of Congress confers now upon the commission ample powers to prevent by direct action the exaction of excessively high rates. The original act, proceeding upon he common-law rule which prohibits public carriers from charging more than reasonable rates, gave the commission power to declare illegal one unduly high; but even after such a determination the commission lacked the power to fix the rate which should be charged. Cincinnati, New Orleans & Texas Pacific Ry. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n162 \nU.S. 184, 196\n, 197 S., 16 Sup. Ct. 700; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Cincinnati, New Orleans & Texas Pacific Ry. Co., \n167 U.S. 479\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 896; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Alabama Midland Ry. Co., \n168 \nU.S. 144, 161\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 45. Effective control was not secured until the act of 1906 (Act June 29, 1906, c. 3591, 34 Stat. 584) had given to the commission the \n\n[249 U.S. 557, 565]\n\u00a0\n power to fix, after such hearing, the rate which should be charged, Interstate Commerce Commission v. Humbolt Steamship Co., \n224 \nU.S. 474, 483\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 556; and the act of 1910 had given it power to suspend, during investigation, tariffs for new rates, and placed upon the carrier the burden of proof to establish the reasonableness of the increased rates, M. C. Kiser Co. v. Central of Georgia Ry. Co. (D. C.) 236 Fed. 573.\n Congress, however, steadfastly withheld from the commission power to prevent by direct action the charging of unreasonably low rates. The common law did not recognize that the rate of a common carrier might be so low as to constitute a wrong; and Congress has declined to declare such a rule. Despite the original Act to Regulate Commerce and all amendments, railroads still have power to fix rates as low as they choose and to reduce rates when they choose. \n3\n The commission's power over them in this respect extends no further than to discourage the making of unduly low rates by applying deterrents. One such deterrent is found in the fact that low rates, because voluntarily established by the carrier, may be accepted by the commission as evidence that other rates, actual or proposed, for comparable service are unreasonably high. Board of Trade of Carrollton, Ga ., v. Central of Georgia Ry. Co., 28 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 154, 164; Sheridan Chamber of Commerce v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Co., 26 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 638, 647. Compare Louisville & Nashville Railroad Co. v. United States, \n238 U.S. 1\n, 11, et seq., 35 Sup. Ct. 696. The voluntary making of unremuneratively low rates in important traffic may also tend to induce the commission to resist appeals of carriers for general rate increases on the ground of financial necessities. But the main source of the commission's influence to prevent excessively low \n\n[249 U.S. 557, 566]\n\u00a0\n rates lies in its power to prevent unjust discrimination. Compare Houston, East & West Texas Ry. Co. v. United States, \n234 U.S. 342\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 833. The order prohibiting the unjust discrimination, however, leaves the carrier free to continue the lower rate; the compulsion being that if the low rate is retained, the rate applicable to the locality or article discriminated against must be reduced. That is, the carrier may remove the discrimination either by raising the lower rate to the relative level of the higher, or by lowering the higher to the relative level of the lower, or by equalizing conditions through fixing rates at some intermediate point. American Express Co. v. Caldwell, \n244 \nU.S. 617, 624\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 656\n\n\n A special group of cases in which the commission may indirectly prevent unduly low rates through its power to prevent unjust discrimination is that provided for by the long and short haul clause. It was enacted to remedy one large class of discriminations by creating a legislative presumption that the charge of more for a short haul under substantially similar circumstances and conditions than for a longer distance over the same line in the same direction was unjust. As originally enacted, the provision was construed to authorize the carrier to determine primarily whether the required dissimilarity of circumstances and conditions existed and also to authorize the acceptance of competitive conditions as a justification of a lower rate for the longer distance. So construed, the provisions proved inefficacious, and the act was amended in  90 by striking out the 'substantially similar circumstances and conditions' clause and making the prohibition absolute except to 'the extent to which such designated common carrier may be relieved from the operation of this section' by the commission. Inter-Mountain Rate Cases, supra. But the lack of power to prevent by direct action excessively low rates remains; the carrier still having he option, if relief from the operation of the fourth section is denied, \n\n[249 U.S. 557, 567]\n\u00a0\n to keep in effect the low rate to the more distant point by lowering the rates to intermediate points.\n The last paragraph of section 4, here in question, which was added by the act of 1910, was designed to prevent the railroads from killing water competition by making excessively low rates. But again Congress refrained from prohibiting the carrier to reduce the rate and declined to confer upon the commission power to prevent by direct action a reduction. The act still leaves the carrier absolutely free to make as low a rate as it chooses, and merely provides another deterrent, in declaring that, if the rate is once reduced in competition with a water route or routes, it cannot thereafter be increased, 'unless after hearing by the Interstate Commerce Commission it shall be found that such proposed increase rests upon changed conditions other than the elimination of water competition.' 'This provision may become operative in any case where there has been competition between a railroad and a water line, inland or coastwise. But we have now to determine merely whether the prohibition applies where the rates in question were reduced with the approval of the commission given after hearing, by order entered upon application of the carrier for relief from the operation of the fourth section.\n The language of the paragraph is general and read alone might compel that construction. But it may not be read alone. It must be construed in the light of the purpose of its enactment, of the earlier paragraphs of section 4, and of other sections in the Act to Regulate Commerce designed to prevent unjust discrimination. The specific purpose of section 4 was to prevent discrimination by charging less for the longer haul, unless in the opinion of the commission the circumstances make such action just. Discrimination, just when sanctioned, may become unjust. Recognizing this fact, Congress most unjust. Recognizing this fact, Congress should be exercised \n\n[249 U.S. 557, 568]\n\u00a0\n 'from time to time' to determine 'the extent to which [the] ... carrier may be relieved from the operation of this section.' In other words, the leave granted is not for all time. It is revocable at any time, either because it was improvidently granted or because new conditions have arisen which make its continuance inequitable. The specific purpose of the last paragraph of section 4 is to ensure and preserve water competition; to prevent competition that kills. A reduction made under the authority of a fourth section order after full hearing must have been found by the commission to have been reasonably necessary in order to preserve competition between the rail and the water carrier. A reduction so made is not within the reason of the prohibition declared by the last paragraph. Transportation conditions are not static; the oppressor of to-day may to- morrow be the oppressed. And in order to preserve competition between rail and water carriers it is necessary that the commission's power to approve a modification of rates be as broad as it is to approve a modification in order to prevent unjust discrimination. Even a literal reading of section 4 would not require that prohibition contained in the last paragraph be extended to reductions made with the approval of the commission. The preceding paragraph declares that:\n'The commission may from time to time prescribe the extent to which such designated common carrier may be relieved from the operation of this section.'\n\n The last paragraph is a part of the section. Why should not the commission's power to relieve be extended to it?\n The construction contended for by plaintiff would rather ensure monopoly than preserve competition. If a rail rate reduced in competition with a water route for the avowed purpose of preserving competition by rail should result, contrary to the commission's expectations, in eliminating the water competition, because so low as to drive the water carrier out of business, then the prohibitively \n\n[249 U.S. 557, 569]\n\u00a0\n low rate would have to be continued permanently and other water competition be thereby prevented from arising; unless, perchance, some changed condition should develop which might make removal of the bar possible. Or, if the reduction if the rail rate, sanctioned by the commission under the fourth section as not unjustly discriminating against intermediate points, because forced upon the rail carriers by oppressive water competition designed to destroy its business to the port, should become thereafter unjustly discriminatory, because the water carrier, destroyed by its own rate cutting, abandoned the route, still the low rail rate and resulting discrimination would have to continue. Only compelling language could cause us to impute to Congress the intention to produce results so absurd; and the language of the last paragraph of section 4 is clearly susceptible of the more reasonable construction contended for by defendants.\n Fourth. The defendants further contend that, even if the prohibition of the last paragraph of section 4 be construed to apply also where the reduction was made with the authority of the commission, the increase of the Pittsburgh-Seattle rate to 75 cents is valid, because the finding of the commission complies with the prescribed condition that the increased rate must rest 'upon changed conditions other than the elimination of water competition.' It found in terms that: 'The conditions formerly existing have materially changed;' that 'the withdrawal of boats from this [ coast to coast] service has not been on account of the rates made by the rail carriers with which the boats compete, but on account of slides in the Panama Canal and the extraordinary rise in ocean freights;' that the substantial disappearance of water competition was merely temporary; that competing water carriers 'announced their intention ultimately to return to this service;' and 'that the time of such return depended in \n\n[249 U.S. 557, 570]\n\u00a0\n part upon the measure of the rates they would be able to secure for this service in competition with the rail lines.' It is clear that the changed conditions so found are something other than the 'elimination of water competition' which Congress intended should not justify raising the reduced rates. Compare American Insulated Wire & Cable Co. v. Chicago & Northwestern Ry. Co., 26 Interest. Com. Com'n R. 415, 416.\n Fifth. The plaintiff attacks, however, the validity of the order of June 5, 1916 (amended July 13, 1916) also on the ground that it was not made upon application of the carrier-insisting that application by the carrier is not only a prerequisite to the original granting of relief under the fourth section, but also to the modification from time to time by the commission of the relief afforded. This court expressed in the Sacramento Case, supra, 242 U. S. at page 187, 37 Sup. Ct. 24, its doubt whether such application was a prerequisite even to the original granting of relief. It is clear that application by the carrier is not a prerequisite to modification. As shown above, orders granting relief under the fourth section are not grants in perpetuity. Neither a carrier nor a favored community acquires thereby vested rights. Necessarily implied in each such order is the term, 'until otherwise ordered by the commission'; and the original application is always subject to be reopened, as it was here.\n The District Court did not err in dismissing the bill (and supplemental bill) on the merits; and its decree is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 80 cents was the specific published rate; but the combination of the Pittsburgh-Chicago rate of 18.9 cents and the Chicago-Seattle rate of 55 cents was 73.9 cents, and it was at this rate that the traffic from Pittsburgh actually moved. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] By Act of August 9, 1917, c. 50,  4, 40 Stat. 270, 272 (Comp.

D., for the State of South Dakota. \n\n[249 U.S. 220, 221]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Suit by the state of South Dakota for an accounting and to recover from defendant interest received by him as treasurer of the the state upon moneys of the state deposited by him in various banks.\n There is no dispute about the facts, which are detailed at very great length in the bill of complaint.\n Collins was treasurer for four years, beginning January, 1903. As such he was entitled to the salary of $1,800 a year, and it is provided by the Constitution of the state that neither the treasurer nor any other officer of the state shall 'receive any fees or perquisites whatever for the performance of any duties connected with his office.' And there are statutory provisions supplementing the Constitution, one of which is that:\n'All moneys belonging to the state, deposited in banks by the state treasurer shall be deposited not to his credit as an individual, but in his name as state treasurer, and not otherwise.' Section 333, Revised Political Code of 1903\n\n\n\n It is alleged that defendant received the sum of $10,000 and more, and it is prayed that he be required to make a full and correct accounting of the moneys received by him and wrongfully withheld from the state.\n Defendant answered as follows:\n'I hereby deny the allegation as set forth in the complaint and plead not guilty to the charge of misappropriating, withholding or converting to my personal use any money belonging to the state of South Dakota during my term of office.'\n\n On motion of plaintiff a referee was appointed to take the testimony on its part and that of defendant and make findings and recommendations.\n On May 9, 1918, the referee made return of his proceedings, with the evidence adduced, from which he concluded as follows: \n\n[249 U.S. 220, 222]\n\u00a0\n 'That between January 1, 1903, and January 10, 1907, there was paid to the defendant as interest upon the moneys of the state of South Dakota, which was received by him as treasurer of said state, and paid to him on deposits in the several banks above named, interest amounting to $32,094.27; that said sum was received by the defendant as interest upon the public moneys of the state of South Dakota deposited by him as such state treasurer in said banks in excess of his salary and all other sums due him from said state as state treasurer, and that the same was received and retained by him and he rendered no account thereof to the plaintiff nor any of its officers and paid no part of the same to the plaintiff or any of its officers, and that the said defendant appropriated the said sum to his own use.'\n And the referee recommended that judgment be entered in favor of plaintiff and against defendant in the sum of $32,094.27, with interest thereon at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum from January 1, 1907, and for plaintiff's costs and disbursements of the suit.\n The case was put down for argument and subsequently submitted on brief, the defendant filing none.\n Counsel for the state submits quite a long argument to sustain the report, with citation of authorities to establish the liability of defendant. It is not necessary to review them. There is no doubt of defendant's liability. He has not appeared to contend to the contrary, and at the taking of the testimony his defense or extenuation was that he acted upon his faith in a decision of the Supreme Court of Colorado, and, to evade or to withhold aid from any possible criminal prosecution, he declined to answer in regard to transactions concerning the receipt of interest on the public moneys he had deposited in various banks.\n Further discussion is unnecessary. The Supreme Court of the state has decided (December 4, 1917), construing \n\n[249 U.S. 220, 223]\n\u00a0\n section 333, supra, and other statutory provisions, that in cases like that at bar it is state funds that are deposited and that earn the interest and not the money of the treasurer, and that, therefore, the interest becomes a mere increment of the principal fund and when it is paid to the treasurer it is in effect paid into the state treasury and the treasurer becomes liable for it. State v. Schamber et al., 39 S. D. 492, 165 N. W. 241, L. R. A. 1918B, 803.\n The report of the referee is approved and judgment directed to be entered against defendant in the sum of $32,094.27 with interest thereon at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum from January 1, 1907, and for costs and disbursements of the suit. \n\n\n\n","183":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN PAC. CO. v. BOGERT(1919)\nNo. 305\nArgued: Decided: June 9, 1919\n\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 483, 486]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Lewis H. Freedman, Gordon M. Buck, and Arthur H. Van Brunt, all of New York City, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Charles E. Hughes and H. Snowden Marshall, both of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1888, and for some years prior thereto, the Southern Pacific Company dominated the Houston & Texas Central Railway Company, electing directors and officers through one of its subsidiaries, which owned a majority of the Houston Company stock. In 1888, pursuant to a reorganization agreement, mortgages upon the Houston Company properties were foreclosed, and these were acquired by the Houston & Texas Central Railroad Company; the old company's outstanding bonds were exchanged for bonds of the new; all the new company's stock was delivered to the Southern Pacific; its lines of railroad were incorporated in the transcontinental system of that corporation; and the minority stockholders of the old Houston Company received nothing. In 1913 the appellees, suing on behalf of themselves and other minority stockholders, brought this suit in the Supreme Court of New York to have the Southern Pacific declared trustee for them of stock in the new Houston Company and for an accounting. The plaintiffs below being citizens and residents of New York, and the Southern Pacific, a Kentucky corporation, it removed the case to the District Court of the United States for the \n\n[250 U.S. 483, 487]\n\u00a0\n Eastern District of New York; and that court, after a hearing on the evidence, entered a decree for the plaintiffs. Bogert v. Southern Pacific Co., 226 Fed. 500. See, also, Bogert v. Southern Pac. Co. (D. C.) 215 Fed. 218, and Id. (D. C.) 211 Fed. 776. There had been issued by the old Houston Company 77,269 shares of stock, and by the new 100,000 shares. The decree declared that the Southern Pacific held for plaintiffs and other stockholders who intervened 24,347.9 shares in the new Houston Company, directed that it should deliver to them these shares and also in cash the sum of $702,336.61 (being the aggregate of all dividends paid thereon) and interest thereon from the times the several dividends were received, upon receiving from them 18,816 shares in the old Houston Company and also with each share of old stock delivered $261 in cash and interest thereon from February 10, 1891. This decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (Bogert v. Southern Pac. Co., 244 Fed. 61, 156 C. C. A. 489); and the case comes here on certiorari (\n245 U.S. 668\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 190).\n In considering the many objections urged against the decree, it is important to bear constantly in mind the exact nature of the equity invoked by the bill and recognized by the lower courts. The minority stockholders do not complain of a wrong done the corporation or of any wrong done by it to them. They complain of the wrong done them directly by the Southern Pacific and by it alone. The wrong consists in its failure to share with them, the minority, te proceeds of the common property of which it, through majority stockholdings, had rightfully taken control. In other words, the minority assert the right to a pro rata share of the common property; and equity enforces the right by declaring the trust on which the Southern Pacific holds it and ordering distribution or compensation. The rule of corporation law and of equity invoked is well settled and has been often applied. The majority has the right to control; but when it does so, it \n\n[250 U.S. 483, 488]\n\u00a0\n occupies a fiduciary relation toward the minority, as much so as the corporation itself or its officers and directors. If through that control a sale of the corporate property is made and the property acquired by the majority, the minority may not be excluded from a fair participation in the fruits of the sale. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The facts on which the decree is based are carefully set forth in the bill of complaint; and the decree declares in terms that every allegation contained in its is true. No adequate reason is shown for challenging, in any respect material for the purposes of this opinion, the correctness of this concurrent finding of the two lower courts; and it is accepted as correct. Baker v. Schofield, \n243 \nU.S. 114, 118\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 333. The detailed facts and the evidence upon which they rest are fully recited in the opinions delivered below or in the earlier litigation hereafter referred to; and the facts will be recited here only so far as necessary to an understanding of the several errors of law now insisted upon.\n First. The Southern Pacific contends that plaintiffs are barred by laches. The reorganization agreement is dated December 20, 1887; the decree of foreclosure and sale was entered May 4, 1888; the sale was held September 8, 1888; and the stock in the new company was delivered to the Southern Pacific on February 10, 1891. This suit was not begun until July 26, 1913; and not until that time was there a proper attempt to assert the specific equity here enforced, namely, that the Southern Pacific received the stock in the new Houston Company as trustee for the stockholders of the old. More than 22 years had thus elapsed since the wrong complained of was committed. But the essence of laches is not merely lapse of time. It is essential that there be also acquiescence in the \n\n[250 U.S. 483, 489]\n\u00a0\n alleged wrong or lack of diligence in seeking a remedy. Here plaintiffs, or others representing them, protested as soon as the terms of the reorganization agreements were announced; and ever since they have with rare pertinacity and undaunted by failure persisted in the diligent pursuit of a remedy as the schedule of the earlier litigation referred to in the margin demonstrates. \n3\n Where the cause of action is of such a nature that a suit to enforce it would be brought on behalf, not only of the plaintiff, but of \n\n[250 U.S. 483, 490]\n\u00a0\n all persons similarly situated, it is not essential that each such person should intervene in the suit brought in order that he be deemed thereafter free from the laches which bars those who sleep on their rights. Cox v. Stokes, 156 N. Y. 491, 511, 51 N. E. 316. Nor does failure, long continued, to discover the appropriate remedy, though well known, establish laches where there has been due diligence, and, as the lower courts have here found, the defendant was not prejudiced by the delay.\n Second. The Southern Pacific contends that adverse decisions in the earlier litigation are a bar either as an estoppel or by way of election of remedies; since the prosecution of some, if not all, of the earlier suits also was actively supported by the minority stockholders' committee, and the plaintiffs are bound as privies to the full extent to which the decrees therein constitute res judicata. But in none of these suits was the question here in issue decided. Except in so far as those cases were disposed of on objections to jurisdiction, they decided merely that the foreclosure could not be set aside as fraudulent; that the minority stockholders could not have the reorganization agreement declared fraudulent; and that they could not compel a reduction of the assessment made under it or enjoin distribution of the stock according to its terms. The minority stockholders sought, when presenting the case in the Court of Appeals of New York (MacArdell v. Olcott, 189 N. Y. 368, 372, 373, 82 N. E. 161), to have declared the trust which was later decreed in this suit; but that court refused to consider the contention, for the reason that this claim to relief was based upon a theory 'widely at variance' with that upon which that action was commenced and tried. Because of such wide divergence the earlier decrees do not operate as res judicata. And there is no basis for the claim of estoppel by election; nor any reason why the minority, who failed in the attempt to recover on one theory because unsupported by the facts, should \n\n[250 U.S. 483, 491]\n\u00a0\n not be permitted to recover on another for which the facts afford ample basis. Wm. W. Bierce, Ltd., v. Hutchins, \n205 \nU.S. 340, 347\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 524; Barnsdall v. Waltemeyer, 142 Fed. 415, 420, 73 C. C. A. 515; Standard Oil Co. v. Hawkins, 74 Fed. 395, 20 C. C. A. 468, 33 L. R. A. 739; Henry v. Herrington, 193 N. Y. 218, 86 N. E. 29, 20 L. R. A. (N. S.) 249.\n Third. The Southern Pacific challenges the claim for relief on the ground that it took the new Houston Company stock, not as majority stockholder, but as underwriter or banker under the reorganizt ion agreement. The essential facts are these: While dominating the old company through control of a majority of its stock, the Southern Pacific entered into its reorganization, under an agreement by which the minority stockholders of the old company could obtain stock in the new only upon payment in cash of a prohibitive assessment of $71.40 per share (said to be required to satisfy the floating debt and reorganization expenses and charges), while the Southern Pacific was enabled to acquire all the stock in the new company upon paying an assessment of $26 per share (said to be the amount required to satisfy reorganization expenses and charges). The Southern Pacific asserts that, unlike the minority stockholders, it assumed an underwriter's obligation to take the new company's stock not subscribed for by the minority, and also guaranteed part of the principal and all the interest on the new company's bonds, which were given in exchange for those of the old company. But the purpose of the Southern Pacific in assuming these obligations was in no sense to perform the function of banker. It was to secure the incorporation of the Houston Railroad into its own transcontinental system. And it was never called upon to pay anything under its guaranty.\n Fourth. The Southern Pacific contends that the doctrine under which majority stockholders exercising control are deemed trustees for the minority should not be applied here, because it did not itself own directly any \n\n[250 U.S. 483, 492]\n\u00a0\n stock in the old Houston Company; its control being exerted through a subsidiary, Morgan's Louisiana & Texas Railroad & Steamship Company, which was the majority stockholder in the old Houston Company. But the doctrine by which the holders of a majority of the stock of a corporation who dominate its affairs are held to act as trustee for the minority does not rest upon such technical distinctions. It is the fact of control of the common property held and exercised, not the particular means by which or manner in which the control is exercised, that creates the fiduciary obligation.\n Fifth. Equally unfounded is the contention that the Southern Pacific cannot be held liable because it was not guilty of fraud or mismanagement. The essential of the liability to account sought to be enforced in this suit lies, not in fraud or mismanagement, but in the fact that, having become a fiduciary through taking control of the old Houston Company, the Southern Pacific has secured fruits which it has not shared with the minority. The wrong lay, not in acquiring the stock, but in refusing to make a pro rata distribution on equal terms among the old Houston Company shareholders.\n Sixth. The Southern Pacific also urges that the suit must fail because the old Houston Company is an indispensable party and has not been joined. The contention proceeds upon a misconception of the nature of the suit. Since its purpose is merely to hold the Southern Pacific as trustee for the plaintiffs individually of the property which it has received, the old Houston Company is in no way interested and would not be even a proper party.\n Seventh. The Southern Pacific also contends that the decree is erroneous because the effect is to give to the minority their pro rata share in the new Houston Company without their having made any contribution towards satisfying the floating indebtedness of the old; whereas the floating debt creditors had a claim against the property \n\n[250 U.S. 483, 493]\n\u00a0\n prior in interest to that of the old company's stockholders.

The fact that no provision was made for the floating indebtedness is not a bar to the minority obtaining relief. They did not come into court with unclean hands because there were floating debt creditors unpaid. If any floating debts creditors have been illegally deprived of rights, it was not by the minority's acts. Whether the e rms on which relief should be granted the minority should be affected by the fact that the Southern Pacific had, through a subsidiary, a large interest in the unpaid floating debt, presents a more serious question, which will be considered later.\n Eighth. Objection is made by the Southern Pacific to the terms of the decree also on the ground that, in requiring distribution of stock in the old Houston Company to the minority stockholders instead of providing merely for an accounting and compensation in damages, the decree imposes upon it a heavy and unnecessary hardship. This, it is said, will result from the fact that all the stock of the new Houston Company (except 17 shares to qualify directors) has been pledged by the Southern Pacific as part collateral for an issue of 35-year 4 per cent. bonds to the amount of 250,000,000 francs, and that by reason of a clause in the collateral agreement by which the Southern Pacific covenants that it is the lawful owner of the securities, and that they 'are not subject to any prior pledge, charge, or equity,' a decree requiring distribution of stock to the minority stockholders may conceivably entitle the trustee for these bonds to declare them due, that such default might preclude it from withdrawal of the stock and from substituting other collateral, and that, in any event, if substitution of collateral is permissible, additional securities will have to be deposited, because the agreement provides that in case of withdrawal of any \n\n[250 U.S. 483, 494]\n\u00a0\n securities upon request made after September, 1911, those 'offered in substitution and those remaining on deposit (in each instance) shall be equal in value, as appraised or reappraised, at the time of such proposed substitution, to one hundred and twenty per centum (120%) of the amount of bonds then outstanding hereunder,' and that there had been a heavy depreciation in such other securities since the time of their deposit. The alleged hardship involved in requiring a delivery to plaintiffs of new Houston Company stock in specie was made by the interlocutory decree a subject of investigation by the special master; and his report that the requirement would not impose undue hardship appears to have been carefully considered before entry of the final decree; but neither of the lower courts set forth the reasons which led to the rejection of the Southern Pacific's contention. The final decree was entered in the District Court on October 5, 1916. Since then the World War and the participation in it of the United States have greatly affected financial conditions and security values, especially those involving transportation properties. It may be that the clause in the collateral agreement requiring reappraisal of all securities upon the withdrawal of any might now prove very burdensome. The pledge was made in 1911; and, as the Southern Pacific contends, it was justified then in depositing this stock as collateral, because up to that time the minority stockholders had not made any claim to stock in specie. For reasons hereinafter stated, the case must be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings with a view to modifying the terms of the decree in other respects. It seems to us proper that the Southern Pacific should also have liberty to present to that court reasons, if any, for believing that the decree as framed will under then existing conditions impose undue hardship upon it.\n Ninth. The Southern Pacific objects to the terms of the decree also on the ground that, if the minority stockholders \n\n[250 U.S. 483, 495]\n\u00a0\n are held entitled to a pro rata share of the new company stock, it should be upon payment, not merely of the $26 per share required to meet reorganization expenses and charges, but also of the additional sum required to discharge the floating indebtedness. At the time of the reorganization there was outstanding a large floating indebtedness for which on May 17, 1889, judgments were recovered: by the Lackawanna Iron & Coal Company in the sum of $555,914.25; by Morgan's Louisiana &T exas Railroad & Steamship Company in the sum of $1,795,570.81; and by the Southern Development Company in the sum of $858,133.15. The last two companies held as collateral for their claims $880,000 of bonds of the old Houston Company, for which they later received in exchange bonds of a new company to be applied at their par value toward payment of the debts for which judgment had been recovered. The reorganization agreement provided in substance that the whole $10,000,000 of stock of the new company, if not taken by the old company's stockholders, should be divided pro rata among such of the floating debt creditors as should provide the cash required to pay the floating indebtedness and reorganization expenses and charges; but no floating debt creditor took advantage of this provision, and all were thus wiped out in the reorganization.\n The Southern Pacific asserts that the Morgan Company was and still is its subsidiary; that it owned and now owns a large part of the stock of that corporation; and that through such stock ownership it is, in effect, a large floating debt creditor of the old Houston Company. It suggests also that it has paid out moneys to protect the property of the new company from other floating indebtedness. If the Southern Pacific had been allowed to retain all the stock in the new Houston Company, it would obviously lose nothing by the wiping out of its interest in the floating indebtedness of the old company; and any \n\n[250 U.S. 483, 496]\n\u00a0\n money expended by it in protecting the property of the new company would be fully reflected in the increased value of the stock therein, if it owned all. But, if part of the new company stock is taken from it and distributed among the minority stockholders, the Southern Pacific will lose and the minority stockholders will gain the pro rata increase in value of the new company stock, due to wiping out of the Southern Pacific's share in the floating debt and to its expenditures made for wiping out other indebtedness.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals recognized that there was great force in this contention of the Southern Pacific, but overruled it because it 'was never raised in the case by pleading or otherwise until an exception was taken to the report of the special master' and because 'there is nothing in the record to show what, if anything, the Southern Pacific Company did give up.' The memorandum filed by the district judge on settlement of the interlocutory decree indicates that some such contention was made then. At all events it was clearly made before entry of the final decree; and it does not appear that the minority stockholders were in any way prejudiced by the failure to make the exact contention earlier. There is no reason to believe that the parties cannot determine now, as easily as they might have done a few years ago, to what extent the floating indebtedness due the Morgan Company represents money in effect expended by the Southern Pacific for the benefit of the old Houston Company and to what extent the wiping out of any indebtedness and any expenditure made by the Southern Pacific in connection therewith will inure to the benefit of such of the minority stockholders of the old company as receive stock in the new. Some adjustment should obviously be made so as to compensate the Southern Pacific for any contribution made at its expense to the value of the stock in the new company of which the minority stock \n\n[250 U.S. 483, 497]\n\u00a0\n holders may get the benefit. The purpose of this proceeding is not to punish the Southern Pacific, but to declare and enforce its obligation as trustee. The minority stockholders who seek equity should do equity; and a court of chancery has power in granting relief to prevent unjust enrichment of the minority stockholders at the expense of the Southern Pacific. To determine the amount of such contribution by the Southern Pacific and of such benefit to the minority stockholders further investigation by the trial court will be necessary; and the judgments on the floating indebtedness entered in 189 against the old company should not be held a bar to any inquiry into relevant facts. Whether this compensation shall be made by way of addition to the assessment of $26 per share provided for in the decree, or whether it can and should be made by requiring the minority stockholders to consent to the creation in favor of the Southern Pacific of some charge against or interest in the new company which would have priority over the 100,000 shares of stock outstanding, as, for instance, an income bond or preferred stock, or whether the compensation should be made in some other manner, should also be determined in the first instance by the District Court where all the relevant facts can be ascertained. The final decree must be set aside and the interlocutory decree be modified so as to provide for the necessary inquiry; and, when all the relevant facts shall have been ascertained, a final decree should be entered which will embody such terms as shall be found to be appropriate to afford to the Southern Pacific appropriate compensation for its contribution.\n Tenth. The Southern Pacific objects to the orders permitting Gernsheim and the estate of Minzesheimer to intervene after the entry of the interlocutory decree, and objects also to the final decree in so far as it declares these interveners entitled to the relief granted other \n\n[250 U.S. 483, 498]\n\u00a0\n minority stockholders. The suit was brought on behalf of all stockholders of the old Houston Company, situated similarly to the plaintiffs. The court found on competent evidence that these parties were such. If they could not have intervened as of right, it was at least within the discretion of the court to permit them to do so; and no reason is shown for questioning the exercise of its discretion. It is also urged that the earlier litigation by Gernsheim bars his claim to relief on the grounds of estoppel or of inconsistency of remedy; but that contention has already been shown to be unfounded.\n Eleventh. The certiorari and return were filed May 3, 1918. On October 8, 1918, separate petitions were filed in this court by Henry J. Chase, by Fergus Reid, by Albert M. Polack, by Francis P. O'Reilly, and by the Corn Exchange Bank, alleging that they were respectively owners of stock in the old Houston Company and praying leave to intervene, and that they be permitted to share in the benefits of the decree, or, in the alternative, that they be permitted to make such application to the District Court. Action on these petitions was postponed to the hearing of the case on the merits. As the case must be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings as above stated, we deny these several petitions without expressing any opinion on their merits and without prejudice to the right to apply to the District Court for leave to intervene and to share in the benefits of the decree.\n Decree modified, and cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion; the costs in this court to be equally divided between the parties.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or the decision of this case. \n\n[250 U.S. 483, 499]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissenting.\n It seems to me quite clear that the judgment below is wholly wrong. Respondents' complaint should be dismissed.\n This suit was brought in 1913, some 25 years after those who complain came into possession of all material facts. During that period they were parties or privies to suit after suit-the first begun in 1889 and all unsuccessful-which sought to upset what petitioner had done because of its actual fraud.\n The original bill of complaint in the present cause alleges:\n'As soon as the terms of the said reorganization agreement were announced and published \n\n[250 U.S. 483, 1888]\n\u00a0\n, S. W. Carey, Cornelius MacArdell, Walter B. Lawrence, plaintiffs' testator, and other stockholders of the railway company protested against the terms of the said agreement, claiming that it practically gave the railway company to the Southern Pacific Company in fraud of the individual stockholders.' 'Immediately after the entry of the said consent decree of May 4, 1888, the said Carey, MacArdell, Lawrence, and other stockholders of the said railway company formed a committee of stockholders to protect themselves from the frauds committed and proposed to be committed by the Southern Pacific Company under the said reorganization agreement and consent decree, and said committee of stockholders employed as counsel Frederick R. Coudert, Edward M. Shepard, and A. J. Dittenhoefer, of New York City, Jefferson Chandler, of St. Louis, and later on H. Snowden Marshall, Russell H. Landale, and David Gerber, and from the commencement of their first suit [ December, 1889] hereinafter mentioned, to the present day, the firm of Dittenhoefer, Gerber & James has been their attorneys of record.'\n\n Having long emphatically condemned, attacked, and sought without success to annul petitioner's action, re \n\n[250 U.S. 483, 500]\n\u00a0\n spondents finally come before a court of equity saying in effect: Although represented by counsel of great eminence, we have not heretofore known the law; notwithstanding all solemnly declared to the contrary, we now maintain that petitioner was really acting for us, our trustee indeed; and we wish to share in the plan which it has carried to success against our persistent opposition. Such a claim exhales a very bad odor; and I think the parties presenting it should be dismissed, burdened with an appropriate bill of costs, for two very simple reasons:\n First. They are barred by laches. Rational men are presumed to know the law; knowledge of consequent rights and appropriate means of asserting them is necessarily implied from full acquaintance with the facts. Respondents' attempt to rely upon an alleged belated discovery of a well- known remedy after years of litigation conducted in full view of all the circumstances affronts both established principles and common experience. And this is emphasized by the names of distinguished counsel who have continuously represented the minority stockholders since 1888\n\n\n'Nothing can call a court of equity into activity but conscience, good faith, and reasonable diligence; and when a party with full knowledge of the facts, acquiesces in a transaction, and sleeps upon his rights, equity will not aid him.' Hayward v. Eliot National Bank, \n96 U.S. 611\n.\n\n Due diligence in asserting a constructive trust is incompatible with persistent denial of such relationship after full knowledge of all the circumstances and a furious chase for 25 years in the opposite direction by the soi-disant beneficiary.\n Second. Certainly the petitioner never consciously undertook to act as respondents' trustee-for years nobody seems to have thought any such relation existed. When the latter obtained full information of the real facts \n\n[250 U.S. 483, 501]\n\u00a0\n (1888), AT MOST, THEIR OPTION WAS PROMPTLy to treat petitioner as their constructive trustee, or to reject that view. And I had supposed in such circumstances, under an elementary rule, failure affirmatively to ratify, approve, or adopt the alleged fiduciary's action within a reasonable time amounted to disapproval. A potential cestui que trust may not indefinitely speculate on the outcome. In the present case respondents not only failed promptly to approve the action whose benefits they now seek; they deliberately engaged in a long series of actions inconsistent with their present claim; and while they did so petitioner, supposing its title absolute and unquestioned, dealt with the stock accordingly and as it probably would not have done if the present claim had been asserted. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The exact figure is $26.026. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Menier v.

CO. v. STATE OF ARIZ.(1919)\nNo. 238\nArgued: Decided: April 14, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[249 U.S. 472, 473]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. C. W. Durbrow, Henley C. Booth, and William F. Herron, all of San Francisco, Cal., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[249 U.S. 472, 474]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wiley E. Jones, of Phoenix, Ariz., for the State of Arizona.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n An agent for Campbell's United Shows applied to the Southern Pacific Company to transport 18 cars, carrying a carnival show equipment, including employes and animals, from Tucson, via Maricopa, to Phoenix, Arizona.\n In reply to this application the company gave two reasons for refusing the request. The first of these was that the company had contracted for the transportation of another show, under an agreement not to carry a second one within 30 days, which had not expired; and the second, that the company was not a common carrier of shows and would not make the customary contract with Campbell, but would serve him only at certain published interstate rates, which it regarded as applicable. These were many times greater than had been charged for the same show and than had been the customary charge by the Southern Pacific and other companies for similar service.\n Upon receiving this refusal, an application by the owner of the shows to the Arizona Corporation Commission for relief, resulted in an order to the Southern Pacific Company and the Arizona Eastern Railroad Company, operating a connecting line, to show cause why they should not publish, on one day's notice a special rate, designated in the order of the Commission, for the transportation of the shows between the points named. The reasonableness of the required rate is not contested, and the order permitted the Southern Pacific Company to make the special terms for transportation of the shows which had been customary with it in like cases. \n\n[249 U.S. 472, 475]\n\u00a0\n The company refused to obey the order and the Commission issued to it a second rule to show cause why it should not be punished for contempt for such disobedience. On this second rule a hearing was had, and the company was adjudged in contempt and fined $1,500, which it refused to pay.\n Thereupon the state of Arizona instituted this suit in a Superior Court of that state to recover the amount of the fine.\n In its answer to the complaint of the state, the Southern Pacific Company alleged:\n That the proposed movement of the shows was 'interstate in character' because they were engaged in a tour, beginning at the city of El Paso, Texas, and designed to extend through the states of Arizona and New Mexico into the state of California, of which tour the movement from Tucson to Phoenix was a part; that in its necessary operation the order would require the company to accept a rate lower than its published interstate rate would be a direct burden upon interstate commerce; and that, for these reasons, the order for the transportation was in contravention of the provisions of article 1, section 8, of the Constitution of the United States, and the fine for contempt was unlawfully imposed and void.\n The judgment of the superior court was in favor of the state, the company appealed to the Supreme Court of Arizona, which affirmed the judgment, and the case is here on writ of error.\n The only claim of error argued in this court which is properly presented by the record is: Whether the persons and property which the Commission ordered the railroad company to carry were in interstate transportation when the order was made for the service between two stations in Arizona. If the shipment was then in interstate commerce the order was void, and if \n\n[249 U.S. 472, 476]\n\u00a0\n it was not the order was valid and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Arizona must be affirmed.\n The evidence which was before the courts and the Commission was as follows:\n Early in February, 1914, an agent for the shows applied to the Southern Pacific Company for their transportation from El Paso, Texas, to various towns in Arizona where it was desired to exhibit, and ultimately to Cochise, Arizona, from which point another line would be taken into Tucson. Nothing came of this application and an arrangement was made for carriage to Tucson by another road. Before the shows arrived at Tucson the application out of which this suit arose was made. The agent for the shows testified that the tentative purpose of the management was to go from Tucson to Prescott, to Clarkdale, to Kingman, all in Arizona, and then to Needles, California, exhibiting in each town, but when testifying on March 23d, when his show was exhibiting in Tucson, he said that although he had made application to the Santa Fe Railroad Company for a contract for transportation beyond Phoenix, he had not at that time received a reply.\n The agent for the Santa Fe Company at Phoenix testified that about March 20th an application was made to him for a rate and contract for the transportation of the shows over his line from Phoenix to Prescott, 'possibly to Clarkdale and to Needles, California.'\n Two contracts with the Santa Fe Company were introduced in evidence, one dated April 3d, providing for the transportation of the shows from Phoenix to Prescott, to Kingman and to Needles, and the other dated April 16th, providing for transportation from Prescott direct to Bakersfield, California.\n The shows were actually carried by the Southern Pacific Company on March 29th or 30th from Tucson to Phoenix, but at an interstate rate insisted upon in \n\n[249 U.S. 472, 477]\n\u00a0\n defiance of the Commission's order. At Phoenix the transportation ended so far as the Southern Pacific Company was concerned, and the contract with the Santa Fe Company to carry the shows beyond that city was not concluded, as we have seen, until April 3d-in its modified form not until April 16th.\n This statement of the case decides it. Whether a shipment was at a given time in interstate commerce is a question of fact, Railroad Commission of Ohio v. Worthington, \n225 \nU.S. 101, 108\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 653; and it is plainly impossible to say that the property and persons constituting the shipment of the shows here involved were in progress of interstate transportation when the Arizona Commission entered its order on March 25th that the company should accept the intrastate shipment from Tucson to Phoenix. For at that time the shows were in the exclusive possession and control of the owner, exhibiting for six days at Tucson, and the application to the Southern Pacific Company, which was refused shows, incontrovertibly, that the transportation to Tucson had terminated, and that no other transportation had then been contracted for. The company itself proved that interstate transportation was not subsequently arranged for until April 3d certainly-and probably not until Apruil 16th-and then was via another line from Phoenix, after two weeks for exhibition in that city.\n The mere intention of the shipper to ultimately continue his tour beyond the state of Arizona did not convert the contemplated intrastate movement into one that was interstate. The case is ruled by Coe v. Errol, \n116 U.S. 517\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 475; Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. State of Iowa, \n233 U.S. 334\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 592; Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe R. R. Co. v. Texas, \n204 U.S. 403\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 360; Arkadelphia Milling Co. v. St. Louis Southwestern Railway Co., decided March 3d last, \n249 U.S. 134\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 237.\n It is further argued by the plaintiff in error that the \n\n[249 U.S. 472, 478]\n\u00a0\n order of the State Commission deprived it of its right to make or refuse to make a contract as a private carrier for the transportation of traveling shows, and thereby deprived it of the equal protection of the laws and of its property without due process of law.\n It would be enough to say of this contention that no such claim was asserted in the answer of the company in the state court, or even in the assignments of error in this court, and that, therefore, it cannot be considered here. But this omission is not an oversight, for the record shows that it had been in prior practice of the plaintiff in error to transport such shows on application under special contract-a short time before it had transported another show and the year before it had accepted these same shows for transportation-and that the order of the Commission was:\n'It is understood ... that the ... company may enter into a contract covering this transportation, the terms of which shall not be in substantial variance with the contract now existing between the Arizona & Eastern Railroad Company and the Sells-Floto Shows Company, with respect to details, as to the responsibility, service, conditions and equipment'\n\n -which contract was on file with the Commission, and was dated March 4, 1914. This form of contract was one also used by the Southern Pacitic Company.\n Thus this second claim, obviously an afterthought, is so clearly without merit that it cannot be considered and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Arizona is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","185":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN PAC.

Hayes and Thomas Armstrong, Jr., both of Phoenix, Ariz., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Stewart sued for damages sustained in transit by dairy cows delivered July 1, 1913, to plaintiff in error for shipment over its railroad from California to Phoenix, Arizona, under a 'live stock shipping order contract and bill of lading' signed both by himself and it, which, among other things, provided:\n'Second party [the shipper] hereby further agrees that in case any loss or damage shall have been sustained for which first party is liable, demand or claim for such loss or damage will be made by second party on the freight claim agent of first party in writing, within ten days after unloading of the live stock; and that in event of failure so to do all claims for loss or damage in the premises are hereby expressly waived, released and made void, and it is also expressly agreed by second party that the amount to be by him claimed for each animal as described herein, so lost or damaged, shall be adjusted on basis of value at time and place of shipment, not exceeding the declared value as hereinbefore set forth, and on which \n\n[248 U.S. 446, 448]\n\u00a0\n declared value the rate or rates of transportation hereinbefore named by first party are based, and in no event is there to be any recovery from first party or its lessors for any loss of or damage to said live stock, from whatsoever cause arising in excess of the declared value hereinbefore set forth.'\n\n As one ground of defense the company relied upon non-compliance with the abovequoted provision. In reply the shipper alleged and at the trial introduced evidence tending to establish facts and circumstances as follows:\n He admitted that the cattle were unloaded and received by him July 5, 1913, at Phoenix and that he made no written claim for loss or damage upon any agent of the carrier within ten days thereafter. But he denied that he could have given notice of his claim within such time or that he had waived or released it.\n He alleged that on July 4, 1913, and subsequently the carrier had full knowledge of injuries sustained by the cattle; that they were unloaded into its stock-pens at Yuma July 4, 1913, and prior to reloading five died; that they remained in the stock-pens there without shelter or protection nine hours, under care of carrier's agents; that upon reloading it provided an additional car for sick and crippled cows; that at various points en route the train officials received inquiries from other railroad officials as to conditions and after arrival at Phoenix one of the crippled animals remained several days in a car; that immediately after unloading at Phoenix and daily until October 21, shipper and the railroad agents were in communication relative to damages sustained; that the nature and extent of injuries to cows which arrived at destination alive made it impossible to determine within ten days the extent of damage sustained; and that a number of cattle died many days after their arrival at Phoenix.\n He further alleged that about October 21, 1913, after repeated efforts to determine the damages, shipper made \n\n[248 U.S. 446, 449]\n\u00a0\n demand in writing for $1,570 and on December 15th, as soon as he was able to ascertain nature and extent of the injuries, made written demand for $2, 695; that the carrier had repeatedly waived requirement for demand within ten days by recognizing the shipper's right to recover something and attempting to settle and compromise; and that subsequent to October 21st carrier through its claim agents had twice attempted to adjust with the shipper the loss and damage sustained.\n The trial court refused to direct a verdict in defendant's favor. Among other things, it said to the jury:\n'I charge you as a matter of law that if you believe the defendant or its agents or employes did know that five or more of the cattle died while in transit, and also believe that the defendant was negotiating with the plaintiff for a settlement of his claim, and that the defendant knew that the cattle had been injured as alleged in the plaintiff's complaint, then the plaintiff was relieved and released from the giving of such notice of loss or injury within ten days as required by the said provisions of said contracts.'\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a judgment entered upon verdict for the shipper July 3, 1916 (233 Fed. 956, 147 C. C. A. 630), and, in the course of its opinion, said:\n'There was proof tending to sustain all the facts so alleged in the [ plaintiff's] reply. We think, therefore, that the court below committed no error in instructing the jury that in view of the evidence, if they found it to be true, the plaintiff was relieved and released from giving notice within the ten days.'\n\n We have jurisdiction and the motion to dismiss based upon another view is denied.

And we also think those opinions make it clear that the circumstances relied upon by the shipper are inadequate to show a waiver by the carrier of written notice as required by the contract.\n The trial court erred in giving to the jury the instruction quoted above; and it should have granted the carrier's request for a directed verdict.\n The judgment of the court is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA and Mr. Justice CLARKE dissent. \n\n\n\n","186":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nST LOUIS POSTER ADVERTISING CO. v. CITY OF ST LOUIS(1919)\n\nArgued: Decided: March 24, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[249 U.S. 269, 270]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Marion C. Early, of St. Louis, Mo., for plaintiff in error and appellant.\n\n\n[249 U.S. 269, 272]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Everett Paul Griffin and Charles H. Daues, both of St. Louis, Mo., for defendants in error and appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The first mentioned of these cases was brought by the plaintiff in error in a State Court of Missouri to prevent the City of St. Louis and its officials from enforcing an ordinance regulating the erection of billboards, on the ground that the ordinance is contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment in various respects. The suit was begun on March 21, 1914, and on May 22, 1917, a judgment of that Court dismissing it upon demurrer was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State. 195 S. W. 717. \n\n[249 U.S. 269, 273]\n\u00a0\n The other case was begun a little earlier, on January 30, 1914, in the District Court of the United States, by a bill in equity substantially to the same effect as in the State case. The bill was dismissed upon motion on February 29, 1914. The two cases appear to have proceeded to a conclusion without any reference to each other, but as they involve the same parties and the same questions they have been argued as one case here.\n The ordinance complained of is number 22,022, passed on April 7, 1905. It allows no billboard of twenty-five square feet or more to be put up without a permit and none to extend more than fourteen feet high above the ground. It requires an open space of four feet to be left between the lower edge and the ground, forbids an approach of nearer than six feet to any building or to the side of the lot, or nearer than two feet to any other billboard, or than fifteen feet to the street line, and with qualifications requires conformity to the building line. No billboard is to exceed four hundred square feet in area. The fee for a permit is one dollar for every five lineal feet. The bill states that the size of posters has been standardized and cannot be changed without great expense and that the limits in size fixed for the boards are too small for such posters and will affect the plaintiff's business disastrously. The billboards are all upon private ground owned by or let to the plaintiff. They are built to withstand a windstorm of eighty-three miles an hour, a greater velocity than any known in St. Louis, and the frames and facing are of galvanized iron so as to exclude all danger of fire. The plaintiff has contracts running from six months to three years binding it to maintain advertisements upon its boards. The defendants are proposing to tear down these boards unless the plaintiff complies with the ordinance. This is a greatly abbreviated statement of the case but is sufficient, we believe, to present the question that we have to decide.\n\n\n[249 U.S. 269, 274]\n\u00a0\n Of course, the several restrictions that have been mentioned are said to be unreasonable and unconstitutional limitations of the liberty of the individual and of rights of property in land. But the argument comes too late. This Court has recognized the correctness of the decision in St. Louis Gunning Advertising Co. v. St. Louis, 235 Mo. 99, 137 S. W. 929, followed in this case, that bill-boards properly may be put in a class by themselves and prohibited 'in the residence districts of a city in the interest of the safety, morality, health and decency of the community.' Thomas Cusack Co. v. Chicago, \n242 \nU.S. 526, 529\n, 530 S., 37 Sup. Ct. 190, 191 (61 L. Ed. 472, L. R. A. 1918A, 136, Ann. Cas. 1917C, 594). It is true that according to the bill the plaintiff has done away with dangers from fire and wind, but apart from the question whether those dangers do not remain sufficient to justify the general rule, they are or may be the least of the objections adverted to in the cases. 235 Mo. 99, 137 S. W. 929; Kansas City Gunning Advertising Co. v. Kansas City, 240 Mo. 659, 671, 144 S. W. 1099. Possibly one or two details, especially the requirement of conformity to the building line, have aesthetic considerations in view more obviously than anything else. But as the main burdens imposed stand on other ground, we should not be prepared to deny the validity of relatively trifling requirements that did not look solely to the satisfaction of rudimentary wants that alone we generally recognize as necessary. Hubbard v. Taunton, 140 Mass. 467, 468, 5 N. E. 157.\n If the city desired to discourage billboards by a high tax we know of nothing to hinder, even apart from the right to prohibit them altogether asserted in Thomas Cusack Co.'s Case. Citizens' Telephone Co. v. Fuller, \n229 \nU.S. 322, 329\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 833. As to the plaintiff's contracts, so far as appears they were made after the ordinance was passed, but if made before it they were subject to legislation not invalid otherwise than for its incidental effect upon them. Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. Goldsboro, \n232 \nU.S. 548, 558\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 364. The same thing may be said, apart from other an swers, \n\n[249 U.S. 269, 275]\n\u00a0\n with regard to the alleged standardizing of the size of posters. In view of our recent decision we think further argument unnecessary to show that the ordinance must be upheld.\n Judgment in No. 220 and decree in No. 2 affirmed. \n\n\n\n","187":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nST LOUIS, I M & S R.

C., for appellant.\n\n\n[251 U.S. 198, 202]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents questions arising upon a suit brought by the railway company in the Court of Claims to recover compensation for the carriage of mail bags under facts found in the Court of Claims in the record sent up for our consideration. These facts are: That the St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Railway Company, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Missouri, operated a line of railway between Tower Grove, Missouri, and Texarkana, in Arkansas. So much of the railway line as lies between Poplar Bluff, Missouri, and Texarkana, Arkansas, was aided in its construction by a grant of land from the United States by the Act of February 9, 1853 (10 Stat. 155, c. 59), and by the Act of July 28, 1866 (14 Stat. 338, c. 300).\n The fourth section of the Act of February 9, 1853, provides:\n'The said railroad and branches shall be and remain a public highway for the use of the Government of the United States, free from toll or other charge upon the transportation of any property or troops of the United States.'\n\n The first section of the Act of July 28, 1866, with respect to said railway provides:\n'All property and troops of the United States shall at all times be transported over said railroad and branches at the cost, charge, and expense of the company or corporation owning or operating said road and branches respectively, when so required by the Government of the United States.'\n\n February 4, 1910, the Post Office Department transmitted to the claimant company a distance circular which \n\n[251 U.S. 198, 203]\n\u00a0\n relates to mail transportation, the same was duly filled out and certified and returned to the Post Office Department. Between the 17th of February and the 1st day of June, 1910, the Post Office Department made the quadrennial weighing of mail in the weighing division which included the railway company's lines. Before this weighing of the mails, Congress passed the Act of May 27, 1908, 35 Stat. 412, c. 206, making appropriations for the Post Office Department, which provides:\n'The Postmaster General shall require, when in freightable lots and whenever practicable, the withdrawal from the mails of all postal cards, stamped envelopes, newspaper wrappers, empty mail bags, furniture, equipment, and other supplies for the postal service except postage stamps, in the respective weighing divisions of the country, immediately preceding the weighing period in said divisions, and thereafter such postal cards, stamped envelopes, newspaper wrappers, empty mail bags, furniture, equipment and other supplies for the postal service, except postage stamps, shall be transmitted by either freight or express.'\n\n Subsequent to the passage of the Act of May 27, 1908, the Post Office Appropriation Acts provided for specific sums for the payment of expressage on postal cards, stamped envelopes, newspaper wrappers and empty mail bags, and they carried similar provisions as to the withdrawal of said articles from the mails preceding weighing periods.\n Before the weighing of the mails of the railway company the Postmaster General, acting under authority of the provisions of the Act of 1908, withdrew from the mail the empty mail bags, and the same were thereafter transported by freight over claimant's line of railway, and the weights were not included in estimating the weight of the mail carried during the contract term beginning July 1, 1910\n\n\n The findings give the number of pounds of empty mail \n\n[251 U.S. 198, 204]\n\u00a0\n bags withdrawn from the mails during the weighing season of 1910 and sent by freight to St. Louis from Texarkana, Arkansas, and Little Rock, Arkansas, and show that if these empty bags had not been so withdrawn and the weight thereof had been included with the weight of the mails, upon which compensation was based, the claimant would have received $15,296.82 more than it did receive for service performed between July 1, 1910, and February 1, 1912.\n During the period from July 1, 1910, to and including January 31, 1912, a total of 1,452,271 pounds of empty mail bags were transported over the railroad of the claimant in freight trains from Texarkana, Arkansas, to St. Louis, Missouri, for which service the claimant submitted bills at the published tariff rate against the United States amounting in the aggregate to $14,043.17. In making settlement of these charges the Auditor for the Post Office Department made a deduction for the entire charge for the services performed from Texarkana, Arkansas, to Poplar Bluff, Missouri, amounting to $8,251.45.\n The sixth section of the Act of 1853 provides:\n'The United States mail shall at all times be transported on the said road and branches, under the direction of the Post Office Department, at such price as Congress may by law direct.'\n\n And the thirteenth section of the Act of July 12, 1876 (19 Stat. 78, c. 179 [Comp. St.  7485]) provides:\n'That railroad companies whose railroad was constructed in whole or in part by a land grant made by Congress on the condition that the mails should be transported over their road at such price as Congress should by law direct shall receive only 80 per centum of the compensation authorized by this act.'\n\n The findings further state that ever since the passage of said last- mentioned act it has been the custom and practice of the Post Office Department to pay all the railroads \n\n[251 U.S. 198, 205]\n\u00a0\n whose construction was aided by grants of land from the United States 80 per centum of the rate of compensation paid to nonlandaided roads for carrying the mails.\n Claimant presented its bill for the transportation of said freight at the full commercial rate provided by the duly published and approved tariffs. In making settlement therefor, the Postmaster General made deduction of the entire charge between Texarkana, Arkansas, and Poplar Bluff, Missouri, and refused to pay anything therefor, on the ground that the railway company was obliged by the provisions of the Acts of 1853 and 1866 to transport said empty mail bags without cost or expense to the United States.\n Upon these findings the Court of Claims decided against the claimant, and dismissed its petition. 53 Ct. Cl. 45.\n Two questions are presented, which are thus stated in the opinion of the Court of Claims:\n'(1) Could the empty mail bags be lawfully withdrawn from the mails merely for the purpose of reducing claimant's compensation for mail transportation service?\n\n'(2) And assuming that said empty mail bags were lawfully withdrawn from the mails and shipped by freight, were they 'property' of the United States within the purview of the land grant acts of 1853 and 1866?'\n\n As to the first question there can be little difficulty. There was nothing in any law or contract of the Government which required it to permit the weighing of empty sacks or containers as part of the mail in determining the compensation to be paid for carrying the same. While, generally speaking, a bag or container in which letters or other mailable matter is carried is part of the mail, and collectively the containers might be considered as part of the mail essential to carry the mailable matter from one place to another, nevertheless there was nothing to prevent Congress, in fixing compensation for the carriage of the mails to expressly withdraw therefrom the empty \n\n[251 U.S. 198, 206]\n\u00a0\n MAIL BAGS, AND THIS IT DID BY THE ACT OF may 27, 1908, above quoted.\n For the purposes of fixing compensation in the weighing of the mail Congress directed that the weight of the empty bags should be withheld in determining the average weight of the mails as the basis of fixing compensation. We agree with the Court of Claims that such action violated no contractual or other right of the claimant.\n Concerning the other question presented there is perhaps more difficulty. By the sixth section of the Act of 1853 it was directed that the United States mail should be transported over the claimant's road at such prices as Congress may by law direct, and by the thirteenth section of the Act of July 12, 1876, railroads aided by grants of land made by Congress on condition that Congress should fix the basis of compensation for transportation of mails over its lines should receive 80 per centum of the compensation provided for in the act. These acts make specific reference to the amounts to be paid for the transportation of the mails. The payment provided in them is for the transportation of the mails which, it may be conceded, might include with the mail matter the bags in which the same was carried. However, by the Act of May 27, 1908, the Congress has classified empty mail bags with furniture and equipment and other supplies for the postal service, to be transported by freight or express. Congress thus undertook to make a separate provision covering the carrying of empty mail containers after they had served their purpose of inclosing the mail matter during transportation.\n It is insisted that the return of the empty mail bags is but part of the transportation of the mail. But certainly Congress might provide that empty mail bags should be differently treated than those used in the actual transportation of mailable matter. None will dispute that forwarding mail bags from their place of manufacture to \n\n[251 U.S. 198, 207]\n\u00a0\n different points in the country for use would not constitute transportation of mail. We see no reason why Congress may not regard empty mail bags, being returned for further use, as no longer a part of the mails. Congress authorized contracts for the transportation of the mail, but by the Act of May 27, 1908, it withdrew empty mail bags from mail transportation and directed that they be sent by freight or express. How then was such transportation to be compensated? Ordinarily the applicable freight or express rates would control. But the acts of Congress which provided that property of the United States should be transported at the expense of the company were in full force and effect. It is said that in the report and action upon the legislation which took empty mail bags from carriage as part of the mails and directed the carriage by freight or express there is no intimation that the result of such legislation would have the effect of obtaining free transportation under the land grant acts, and that no such requirement is made in the act itself. But, Congress must be presumed to have known of its former legislation in the Acts of 1853 and 1866, and to have passed the new laws in view of the provisions of the legislation already enacted. These statutes must be construed together and effect given to all of them. Under the earlier acts this railroad in consideration of benefits received, was bound, when required, to transport troops and property of the United States free of charge.\n We have here a question concerning the transportation of property of the United States. See Southern Pacific Co. v. United States, \n237 \nU.S. 202, 204\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 573. The act of Congress providing for 50 per cent. rates concerns only 'army' transportation and is not applicable to this case. See Act June 30, 1882, c. 254, 22 Stat. 120, 1 Supp. Rev. Stats. 375, 376. The empty mail bags were property, and belonged to the United States. When the Government required their transportation by freight, the former legislation which accompanied \n\n[251 U.S. 198, 208]\n\u00a0\n the grant of lands to this railway company controlled the terms of carriage.\n We find no error in the judgment of the Court of Claims, which was also the conclusion of the Comptroller of the Treasury, 17 Comp. Dec. 749.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, dissenting.\n Appellant's right to recover seems quite plain to me.\n The Act of February 9, 1853, ch. 59, 10 Stat. 155, granted lands afterwards used to aid in constructing appellant's lines. Section 4:\n'... The said railroad and branches shall be and remain a public highway for the use of the Government of the United States, free from toll or other charge upon the transportation of any property or troops of the United States.'\n\n Section 6:\n'That the United States mail shall at all times be transported on the said road and branches, under the direction of the Post Office Department, at such price as Congress may by law direct.'\n\n The Act of July 28, 1866, ch. 300, 14 Stat. 338, among other things, revived and extended the Act of 1853. Section 1:\n'... And provided further, that all property and troops of the United States shall at all times be transported over said railroad and branches at the cost, charge, and expense of the company or corporation owning or operating said road and branches respectively, when so required by the Government of the United States.\n\n And thus it appears that one section of the statutes directs free transportation of 'all property and troops of the United States' and a wholly different section requires transportation of the United States mail 'under the direction of the Post Office Department, at such price as Congress may by law direct.'\n Through the Post Office Department, the United States \n\n[251 U.S. 198, 209]\n\u00a0\n are engaged in handling the mails for pay. Their transportation is part of a well-defined business. In the orderly course and as an essential part of that business emptied sacks are constantly being returned for further use. They are property of the United States in a certain sense, whether full or empty; and they are elements of the mail whether going out or coming back.\n A clear distinction between property of the United States and United States mail is preserved by the very language of the land grant statutes; and, I think, Congress had no purpose-if, indeed, the power-to convert mail into property within the meaning of these statutes simply by directing carriage of the former in freight trains. The purpose was to secure transportation at less than former cost, and to such end Congress, in effect, commanded that emptied bags, a portion of the mails for which rapid movement is not essential, 'shall be transmitted by either freight or express' and compensation made according to the ordinary rates. Under this interpretation, the railroad would suffer no oppressive burden and contemplated economies would be effectuated. \n\n\n\n","188":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nST LOUIS, I M & S R. CO. v. WILLIAMS(1919)\nNo. 66\nArgued: November 11, 1919Decided: December 8, 1919\n\n\n\n Messrs.\nRobert E. Wiley and Edgar B. Kinsworthy, both of Little Rock, Ark., for plaintiff in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By a statute of Arkansas, regulating rates for the transportation of passengers between points within the state, \n\n[251 U.S. 63, 64]\n\u00a0\n any railroad company that demands or collects a greater compensation than the statute prescribes is subjected 'for every such offense' to a penalty of 'not less than fifty dollars nor more than three hundred dollars and costs of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee,' and the aggrieved passenger is given a right to recover the same in a civil action. Act April 4, 1887 (Laws 1887, p. 227; Kirby's Digest, 1904,  6620); Act March 4, 1915 (Laws 1915, p. 365; Kirby & Castle's Digest, 1916,  8094).\n In June, 1915, a company operating a line of railroad within the state demanded and collected 66 cents more than the prescribed fare from each of two sisters carried over part of its line when returning to their home from a school commencement elsewhere in the state; and in suits separately brought for the purpose, and afterwards consolidated, these passengers obtained judgments against the company for the overcharge, a penalty of seventy-five dollars and costs of suit, including an attorney's fee of twenty-five dollars. The company appealed, asserting that the provision for the penalty was repugnant to the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; but the Supreme Court of the state sustained the provision and affirmed the judgments. 131 Ark. 442, 199 S. W. 376. To obtain a review of that decision the company prosecutes this writ of error.\n The grounds upon which the provision is said to contravene due process of law are, first, that the penalty is 'so severe as to deprive the carrier of the right to resort to the courts to test the validity' of the rate prescribed, and, second, that the penalty is 'arbitrary and unreasonable, and not proportionate to the actual damages sustained.'\n It is true that the imposition of severe penalties as a means of enforcing a rate, such as was prescribed in this instance, is in contravention of due process of law, where no adequate opportunity is afforded the carrier for safely testing, in an appropriate judicial proceeding, the validity \n\n[251 U.S. 63, 65]\n\u00a0\n of the rate-that is, whether it is confiscatory or otherwise-before any liability for the penalties attaches. The reasons why this is so are set forth fully and plainly in several recent decisions and need not be repeated now. Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123, 147\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 441, 13 L. R. A. (N. S.) 932, 14 Ann. Cas. 764; Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n212 \nU.S. 19, 53\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 192, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1134, 15 Ann. Cas. 1034; Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v.

Georgia, \n235 U.S. 651\n, 659, et seq., 35 Sup. Ct. 214.\n And it also is true that where such an opportunity is afforded and the rate is adjudged valid, or the carrier fails to avail itself of the opportunity, it then is admissible, so far as due process of law is concerned, for the state to enforce adherence to the rate by imposing substantial penalties for deviations from it. Wadley Southern Ry. Co. v. Georgia, supra, 235 U. S. p. 667 et seq., 35 Sup. Ct. 214; Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Texas, \n246 \nU.S. 58, 62\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 236.\n Here it does not appear that the carrier had not been afforded an adequate opportunity for safely testing the validity of the rate, or that its deviation therefrom proceeded from any belief that the rate was invalid. On the contrary, it is practically conceded-and we judicially know-that if the carrier really regarded the rate as confiscatory, the way was open to secure a determination of that question by a suit in equity against the Railroad Commission of the state, during the pendency of which the operation of the penalty provision could have been suspended by injunction. Wadley Southern Ry. Co. v. Georgia, supra. See, also, Allen v. St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Ry. Co., \n230 U.S. 553\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 1030; Rowland v. St. Louis & San Francisco R. R.

And the record shows that at the trial the carrier not only did not raise any question about the correct fare, but proposed and secured an instruction to the jury wherein the prescribed rate was recognized as controlling. \n\n[251 U.S. 63, 66]\n\u00a0\n It therefore is plain that the first branch of the company's contention cannot prevail.\n The second branch is more strongly urged, and we now turn to it. The provision assailed is essentially penal, because primarily intended to punish the carrier for taking more than the prescribed rate. Railway Co. v. Gill, 54 Ark. 101, 106, 15 S. W. 18, 11 L. R. A. 452; St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Ry. Co. v. Waldrop, 93 Ark. 42, 45, 123 S. W. 778. True, the penalty goes to the aggrieved passenger and not the state, and is to be enforced by a private and not a public suit. But this is not contrary to due process of law; for, as is said in Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Humes, \n115 \nU.S. 512, 523\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 110, 114 (29 L. Ed. 463), 'the power of the state to impose fines and penalties for a violation of its statutory requirements is coeval with government; and the mode in which they shall be enforced, whether at the suit of a private party, or at the suit of the public, and what disposition shall be made of the amounts collected, are merely matters of legislative discretion.' Nor does giving the penalty to the aggrieved passenger require that it be confined or proportioned to his loss or damages; for, as it is imposed as a punishment for the violation of a public law, the Legislature may adjust its amount to the public wrong rather than the private injury, just as if it were going to the state. See Marvin v. Trout, \n199 \nU.S. 212, 225\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 31.\n The ultimate question is whether a penalty of not less than fifty dollars and not more than three hundred dollars for the offense in question can be said to bring the provision prescribing it into conflict with the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n That this clause places a limitation upon the power of the states to prescribe penalties for violations of their laws has been fully recognized, but always with the express or tacit qualification that the states still possess a wide latitude of discretion in the matter, and that their enactments transcend the limitation 73, 78, 28 Sup. Ct. 28; Waters-Pierce \n\n[251 U.S. 63, 67]\n\u00a0\n so severe and oppressive as to be wholly disproportioned to the offense and obviously unreasonable. Coffey v.

Ct. 649\n\n\n Of this penalty and the need for it the Supreme Court of the State says:\n'It is commonly known that carriers are not prone to adhere uniformly to rates lawfully prescribed and it is necessary that deviation from such rates be discouraged and prohibited by adequate liabilities and penalties, and we regard the penalties prescribed as no more than reasonable and adequate to accomplish the purpose of the law and remedy the evil intended to be reached.' Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Davis, 114 Ark. 519, 525, 170 S. W. 245, 246.\n\n When the penalty is contrasted with the overcharge possible in any instance it of course seems large, but, as we have said, its validity is not to be tested in that way. When it is considered with due regard for the interests of the public, the numberless opportunities for committing the offense, and the need for securing uniform adherence to established passenger rates, we think it properly cannot be said to be so severe and oppressive as to be wholly disproportioned to the offense or obviously unreasonable.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissents. \n\n\n\n","189":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTANDARD COMPUTING SCALE CO. v. FARRELL(1919)\nNo. 228\nArgued: March 14, 1919Decided: May 5, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. H. C. Smyth, of New York City (Messrs. C. Scofield and Frederick W. Bisgood, of New York City, of counsel), for appellant.\n Messrs. Charles D. Newton, of Geneseo, N. Y., and Edward G. Griffin, Deputy Atty. Gen., of Albany, N. Y., for appellee. \n\n[249 U.S. 571, 572]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By the statutes of New York a sealer of weights and measures is appointed in every county and every city by the local authorities, with the duty, among other things, to keep safely the standards and to seal and mark such weights as correspond with the standards in his possession. The statutes provide also for a state superintendent of weights and measures with, among other things, a like duty to keep the state standards, and 'where not otherwise provided by law' to 'have a general supervision of the weights, measures and measuring and weighing devices of the state, and in use in the state.' General Business Law of New York (Consol. Laws, c. 20)  11-15; Laws 1909, c. 25, amended by Laws 1910, c. 187. Under a specific appropriation he publishes and distributes 'bulletins of instruction and information to dealers, and weights and measures officials.' Laws 1914, c. 521, p. 2093. In the bulletin for August, 1914, there appeared, among other matter, the following item:\n'Specifications.\n\n'Automatic Computing Scales.\n\n'All combination spring and lever computing scales must be equipped with a device which will automatically compensate for changes of temperature at zero balance and throughout the whole range of weight graduations.'\n\n The Standard Company manufactures a combination spring and lever computing scale which was then being used and sold in New York. It is equipped with a compensating device which is not automatic. Because of these 'specifications,' some county and city sealers of weights neglected to seal scales of plaintiff's make and warned scale users to discontinue the use thereof. A state inspector, who was a subordinate of the state superintendent, \n\n[249 U.S. 571, 573]\n\u00a0\n also marked some of these scales 'slow and faulty.' As a result, the Standard Company's business in New York was injured; sales diminished and collections for scales theretofore sold became difficult. The Standard Company contends that its scales with a mechanical compensating device are at least as trustworthy as those of its competitor with the automatic device; and it presented these views to State Superintendent Farrell, both before the 'specifications' were issued and thereafter. Failing to secure a withdrawal of the 'specifications' it brought, in February, 1915, this suit in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York against the state superintendent, setting forth, in substance, the facts above stated and praying that the issuing of the 'specifications,' which it termed a 'rule,' be declared an invalid exercise of the police power of the state, and their enforcement enjoined on the ground that the rule violates the federal Constitution, in that it impairs the obligation of contracts, interferes with interstate commerce, abridges the privileges and immunities of a citizen, deprives the plaintiff of property without due process, and denies to it equal protection of the laws. An answer was filed, and upon full hearing on the evidence the bill was dismissed on the merits. 242 Fed. 87. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree; but, at appellant's request, the mandate was later withdrawn, and the appeal dismissed for want of jurisdiction, because it appeared that the jurisdiction of the District Court had been invoked solely under section 24, par. 14, of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1092 [Comp. St.  991(14)]), on the ground that the defendant's 'rule' was unconstitutional. Carolina Glass Co. v. South Carolina, \n240 \nU.S. 305, 318\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 293. Thereupon the case was brought here by direct appeal under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215).\n No question is made as to the constitutionality of the statute creating the office of state superintendent and defining his duties. The attack is upon the 'specifications' \n\n[249 U.S. 571, 574]\n\u00a0\n in the bulletin which plaintiff assumes are a regulation; that is, a law. Its contention is that the so-called 'rule' is not a proper exercise of the police power, and is void, because it is arbitrary and unreasonable, because it unjustifiably discriminates against plaintiff's product, and because it interferes with interstate commerce. The claim that it impairs the obligation of contracts is not now insisted upon.\n The 'specifications' were not published as a regulation purporting to prescribe a course of action to be enforced by the power of the state. They embody, as the evidence shows, the result of prolonged investigation and extensive experimentation, and formulate the conclusion reached by the state superintendent that every known automatic computing scale without an automatic compensating device is likely to mislead the customer who purchases at retail. In other words, the vice in this kind of scales was found by him to be generic, and, as the objection was not one due to a defect of an individual machine, it was deemed useless to make individual tests. The 'specifications' are a law only in the sense that every truth of general application may be spoken of as a law. If they may be termed a rule, it is only in the sense that they furnish a guide for the action of those interested; that is, the function of the 'specifications' is educational, and at most advisory.\n The item was one appropriate for a bulletin 'of instruction and information to dealers and weights and measures officials.' That such was its purpose is shown also by the other items contained in the same issue of the bulletin. In the pages preceding the 'specifications' here in question was one item giving elementary information as to how prosecutions for violation of the General Business Law may be conducted, and two recent opinions of the Attorney General of New York addressed to the state superintendent. The first concerned the power of \n\n[249 U.S. 571, 575]\n\u00a0\n local magistrates to punish for violation of that law; the other the right to mark containers in terms of the metric system. Following the 'specifications' in question are two more opinions of the Attorney-General and the opinion of a Municipal Court. The last item of the bulletin is entitled 'Specifications-Measuring Pumps,' and conveys useful information concerning automatic measuring devices. The information given in the 'specifications' complained of may, as the plaintiff contends, be incorrect; the instruction may be unsound, and, if it is so, may be mischievous, and seriously damage the property rights of innocent persons. But the opinions and advice, even of those in authority, are not a law or regulation such as comes within the scope of the several provisions of the federal Constitution designed to secure the rights of citizens as against action by the states.\n If the state superintendent had undertaken to introduce a regulation legislative in character-that is, to prescribe rules of action which the city and county sealers would be forced to follow, and to prohibit the use in the state of scales not sealed in accordance with his regulations-he would have exceeded his powers; for the few conferred upon him are not of that character. The General Business Law, substantially as enacted in 1909, provided by section 11 that:\n'The state superintendent of weights and measures shall take charge of the standards adopted by this article as the standards of the state; cause them to be kept in a fireproof building belonging to the state, from which they shall not be removed, except for repairs or for certification, and take all other necessary precautions for their safe-keeping. He shall maintain the state standards in good order and shall submit them once in ten years to the national bureau of standards for certification. He shall correct the standards of the several cities and counties, and, as often as once in five years, compare the same with those in his possession, and where not otherwise pro vided \n\n[249 U.S. 571, 576]\n\u00a0\n by law he shall have a general supervision of the weights, measures and measuring and weighing devices of the state, and in use in the state.'\n\n The statutes give the state superintendent no control of county or city sealers. He does not appoint them and they are, in no respect, his subordinates. The powers which they new exercise are substantially the same as those conferred upon them by the Colonial Act of June 19, 1703,1 which created those offices. Section 11 of the General Business Law was a re-enactment of section 11 of the Domestic Commerce Law (Laws 1896, c. 376 ), and the latter was substantially a re-enactment of section 17 of chapter 134 of the Laws of 1851, which act created (by section 16) the office of state superintendent. \n2\n Section 11, as enacted in 1909, was amended (Laws 1910, c. 187), so as to prescribe additional specific duties of the state superintendent. \n3\n But none of these \n\n[249 U.S. 571, 577]\n\u00a0\n is legislative in character, and the enumeration of them serves rather to limit than to enlarge the meaning of the clause, giving 'general supervision of the weights ... in use in the state.'\n If the 'specifications' had been issued as a regulation-that is, a law-we might have been called upon to inquire whether it was a proper exercise of the police power, or was, as plaintiff contends, void, because arbitrary and unreasonable, or because it was discriminatory, or as interfering with interstate commerce. For the protection of the federal Constitution applies, whatever the form in which the legislative power of the state is exerted; that is, whether it be by a Constitution, an act of the Legislature, or an act of any subordinate instrumentality of the state exercising delegated legislative authority, like an ordinance of a municipality or an order of a commission. Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, \n238 U.S. 340\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 753; Home Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Los Angeles, \n227 U.S. 278\n, 286-288, 33 Sup. Ct. 312; Oregon Railroad & Navigation Co. v.

The superior court held the law to be unconstitutional. Upon appeal the Supreme Court of Washington reversed the judgment. 94 Wash. 291, 162 Pac. 558.\n The statute is the 'State Oil Inspection Law' (Laws 1907, p. 412) of the state of Washington. Its provisions are thus summarized in the opinion of the Supreme Court of the state:\n'The inspection law referred to in the complaint was first passed during the legislative session for the year 1905 (Laws 1905, p. 310). That act was amended in 1907, and will be found in chapter 192 of the Laws of 1907, p. 413 (Rem. Code,  6051 et seq.). Section 3 (Id.,  6052) of this act provides that all gasoline, benzine, distillate or \n\n[249 U.S. 389, 392]\n\u00a0\n other volatile product of petroleum intended for use or consumption in this state for illuminating, manufacturing, domestic or power purposes, 'before being sold or offered for sale,' shall be inspected by the state oil inspector or his deputies. When the inspection is made, a certificate is to be issued, and the barrel or receptacle which contains the oil must be labeled or branded. Section 4 (Id.,  6053) of the act contains a schedule of the fees which shall be paid for the inspection. Section 6 (Id.,  6055) provides that if any person or persons, whether manufacturer, vender or dealer, or as agent or representative of any manufacturer, vender or dealer, 'shall sell or attempt to sell' to any person, firm or corporation in this state, any illuminating oil, gasoline, benzine, distillate or any volatile product of petroleum, intended for use or consumption within this state, that has not been inspected and branded according to the provisions of the act, 'shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.' By the Laws of 1913, chapter 60, p. 196 (Rem. Code,  3000-1 et seq.), it was made the duty of the commissioner of agriculture to exercise all the powers and perform all the duties which, by the law of 1907, were vested in, and required to be performed by, the state oil inspector.'\n\n The case was heard upon demurrer to the amended complaint.\n Among other things, the amended complaint set out:\n'Plaintiff is engaged in the state of California in the business of producing and buying crude petroleum oil, and of manufacturing and refining the same, and of shipping products of such manufacture, to wit, illuminating oils, gasoline, distillate and other volatile products of petroleum from its refineries in California into the state of Washington, where the same are sold by this plaintiff in large quantities for use and consumption in the state of Washington, for illuminating, manufacturing, domestic and power purposes. None of the products herein-before \n\n[249 U.S. 389, 393]\n\u00a0\n referred to are manufactured by plaintiff in the state of Washington, but all of said products are shipped into said state from the state of California.\n\n'The plaintiff maintains in the state of Washington wharves and docks, tanks, warehouses. buildings, machinery, horses and wagons, and other equipment for receiving, shipping, handling, selling and otherwise distributing said products shipped as aforesaid from the state of California into the state of Washington.'\n\n The fees collected under the inspection acts are set out in the amended bill of complaint:\n The total receipts from the fees collected under said statute, chapter 192 of the Laws of 1907, and chapter 161, Laws of 1905, of the state of Washington, for the inspection therein provided for of said products mentioned in said laws intended for sale or consumption in this state, and the total disbursements in connection with the collection thereof, and in connection with the administration of said laws, and the net revenue from such receipts during the following years have respectively been the following:\n Date.

The total \n\n[249 U.S. 389, 394]\n\u00a0\n receipts for the same time $335,776.30, a difference of $255,672.93.\n It is contended by the plaintiff in error that this inspection law violates the commerce clause, article 1,  8, of the Constitution of the United States, in that it directly burdens such commerce by imposing inspection taxes far in excess of the cost of inspection. The Supreme Court of the state held that the tax was not upon property, but could be sustained as an excise or occupation tax upon the business of selling oil within the state. The reason given by the court for holding that the tax could not be upheld as a property tax rested upon provisions of the state Constitution.\n While this court follows the decisions of the highest court of a state, as to the meaning of statutes in cases of this character, the name given to the statute is not conclusive. It must be judged by its necessary effect, and if that is to violate the Constitution of the United States, the law must be declared void. Minnesota v. Barber, \n136 \nU.S. 313, 319\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 862; Crew Levick v. Pennsylvania, \n245 \nU.S. 292, 294\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 126, and cases cited.\n That the state may pass proper inspection laws for oils brought into its borders in interstate commerce, there can be no question. But, taking the allegations of the complaint to be true, as we must for present purposes, the cost of the inspection was greatly less than the tax imposed. The general principle that a state may not impose burdens upon interstate commerce is so well settled, and has been so often declared in the opinions of this court, that a repetition of the reasons which have induced these decisions would be superfluous. In this case the amended complaint alleges that the oils were shipped into Washington from California. They are brought there for sale. This right of sale as to such importations is protected to the importer by the federal Constitution, certainly while the same are in the original \n\n[249 U.S. 389, 395]\n\u00a0\n receptacles or containers in which they are brought into this state. Under this law the oils cannot be lawfully sold at all until the importer has paid the inspection fees provided in the statute, after inspection. That inspection fees, so grossly in excess of the cost of inspection imposed upon articles brought into the state in interstate commerce are unconstitutional, was held in Foote v. Maryland, \n232 U.S. 494\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 377. In that case the plaintiffs were engaged in the business of packing oysters in the city of Baltimore, and brought large quantities in from the state of Maryland and also from the waters of the states of Virginia and New Jersey. These oysters were inspected in Baltimore, where they were unloaded from vessels, by officials appointed under the provisions of the Maryland act which fixed an inspection fee of one cent per bushel to be paid one-half by the seller and one-half by the buyer. The case was brought to this court upon the ground that the inspection fee was excessive, and a burden upon interstate commerce, and levied an unlawful tax upon goods shipped into Maryland from other states. It was held that in view of the excessive nature of the inspection fees the requirement of the payment thereof necessarily imposed a burden upon interstate commerce in excess of the expenses of inspection, and that the act was therefore void. The subject was fully considered in an opinion by the late Mr. Justice Lamar, speaking for this court, and after recognizing the power of the state to impose reasonable inspection fees, and that such legislation will not be declared void unless the fees are obviously and largely beyond what is needed for the cost of inspection, he said:\n'If, therefore, it is shown that the fees are disproportionate to the service rendered, or that they include the cost of something beyond legitimate inspection to determine quality and condition, the tax must be declared void because such costs, by necessary operation, obstruct the freedom of commerce among \n\n[249 U.S. 389, 396]\n\u00a0\n the states. McLean v. Denver & Rio Grande R. R. Co., \n203 U.S. 38\n [27 Sup. Ct. 1]; Brimmer v. Rebman, \n138 U.S. 78\n, 83 [11 Sup. Ct. 213]; Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Taylor, \n192 U.S. 64\n [24 Sup.

Jones, \n225 U.S. 501\n, 504 [32 Sup. Ct. 715].'\n\n The principles stated in Foote v. Maryland were recognized in Pure Oil Co. v. Minnesota, decided by this court at this term, \n248 U.S. 158\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 35. The inspection fees there in question were held not excessive, and we said (248 U. S. page 162, 39 Sup. Ct. page 37):\n'But, if such inspection charge should be obviously and largely in excess of the cost of inspection, the act will be declared void, because constituting, in its operation, an obstruction to and burden upon that commerce among the states the exclusive regulation of which is committed to Congress by the Constitution.'\n\n It is said that the Foote Case did not overrule the previous case of General Oil Co. v. Crain, \n209 U.S. 211\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 475, and that the principles of that case should be controlling here. In the Crain Case this court sustained a tax upon oil which had been removed from the tank cars in which it was transported into Tennessee, and which, although destined for points beyond Tennessee, was then in storage in that state. The distinction between that case and the one now under consideration is obvious. Bacon v. Illinois, \n227 U.S. 504\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 299, is also relied upon. In that case this court sustained a property tax upon grain brought from another state, but taken from the carrier and held by the owner in Illinois with full power of disposition in that state, and although intended to be ultimately forwarded to a point beyond the state; the property tax, after a review of the previous decisions of this court, was sustained.\n We reach the conclusion that the statute imposing these excessive inspection fees, in the manner stated, upon all sales of oils brought into the state in interstate \n\n[249 U.S. 389, 397]\n\u00a0\n commerce necessarily imposes a direct burden upon such commerce, and is therefore violative of the commerce clause of the federal Constitution. We may remark that the conclusion at which we have arrived has been reached by the Supreme Courts of North Dakota and Ohio. Bartels Northern Oil Co. v. Jackman, 29 N. D. 236, 150 N. W. 576; Castle v. Mason, 91 Ohio St. 296, 110 N. E. 463, Ann.

Since the proceedings in that court some of the constitutional questions have been determined, and need not be considered. Schenck v. United States, \n249 U.S. 47\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 247; Frohwerk v. United States, \n249 U.S. 204\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 249; Debs v. United States, \n249 U.S. 211\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 252.\n Counsel for plaintiffs in error in view of these decisions only press for consideration certain assignments of error comprised in the following summary.\n\n 1. \nWhether or not, in ruling that there could be no severance of defendants and that a peremptory challenge by one defendant should count as a challenge by all defendants, the trial judge was in error under Article VI of the Amendments of the United States Constitution.\n\n 2. \nWhether or not the trial judge erred in his charge to the jury in that portion thereof in which he said the jury might determine the guilt of the defendants from general information.\n\n 3. \nWhether or not the trial judge erred in not refreshing the jury's memory as to the evidence.\n\n 4. \nWhether or not the trial judge erred in overruling a motion to take the case away from the jury, and in refusing to charge the jury, 'under all the evidence your verdict should be 'not guilty.\"\n Of these in their order:\n\n 1. \nIt is provided in the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a trial by an impartial jury. That it was within the discretion of the court to order the defendants to be tried together there can be no question, and the practice is too well established \n\n[250 U.S. 583, 586]\n\u00a0\n to require further consideration. The contention raised under the Sixth Amendment comes to this: That because plaintiffs in error were not each allowed ten separate and independent peremptory challenges they were therefore denied a trial by an impartial jury. The statute (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231,  287, 36 Stat. 1166 [Comp. St.  1264]) regulating the matter of peremptory challenges is clear in its terms and provides:\n'When the offense charged in treason or a capital offense, the defendant shall be entitled to twenty and the United States to six peremptory challenges. On the trial of any other felony, the defendant shall be entitled to ten and the United States to six peremptory challenges; and in all other cases, civil and criminal, each party shall be entitled to three peremptory challenges; and in all cases where there are several defendants or several plaintiffs, the parties on each side shall be deemed a single party for the purposes of all challenges under this section. All challenges, whether to the array or panel, or to individual jurors for cause or favor, shall be tried by the court without the aid of triers.'\n\n The requirement to treat the parties defendant as a single party for the purpose of peremptory challenges has long been a part of the federal system of jurisprudence, it certainly dates back to 1865 and was adopted in the Revised Statutes, and has now become a part of the Judicial Code. 36 Stat. 1166,  287. Schwartzberg v. United States, 241 Fed. 348, 154 C. C. A. 228. There is nothing in the Constitution of the United States which requires the Congress to grant peremptory challenges to defendants in criminal cases; trial by an impartial jury is all that is secured. The number of challenges is left to be regulated by the common law or the enactments of Congress. That body has seen fit to treat several defendants, for this purpose, as one party. It the defendants would avail themselves of this privilege they must act accordingly. It may be, as is said to have been the fact in the trial of the present case, that all defendants may not wish to exercise the right of peremptory \n\n[250 U.S. 583, 587]\n\u00a0\n challenge as to the same person or persons, and that some may wish to challenge those who are unobjectionable to others. But this situation arises from the exercise of a privilege granted by the legislative authority and does not invalidate the law. The privilege must be taken with the limitations placed upon the manner of its exercise.\n\n 2. \nIt is insisted that there was prejudicial error in so much of the charge as is contained in the following language:\n'The next question for you to determine is the presence of essential elements. One of them is, for instance, that the United States is at war. Secondly, that what was done was an attempt to cause insubordination, or what was done did amount to obstructing enlistment, and the question may arise in your mind how are you to determine that. Whenever you are asked as a jury to pass upon anything which is a matter within common knowledge, common information, things which people ordinarily know, which are generally and practically universally known, when you are passing upon such questions, you have the right to call upon your general knowledge and information. You must determine, for instance, the question whether or not we are at war, because unless we are, this indictment goes for nothing. You may determine that from your general information this is something of which, in the phrase of the law, the law takes judicial notice. So also when you come to determine the question of whether or not there was an attempt to cause insubordination, you take, of course, all the evidence into case, and you have a right to direct your minds, as naturally you would, to the character of these publications themselves, these pamphlets and these articles, and determine from them, assisted by all the other evidence in the case, whether or not they do reach the dignity of the charge of attempting to cause insubordination; or amount to an obstruction of enlistment.' \n\n[250 U.S. 583, 588]\n\u00a0\n Certainly no prejudice could arise from an instruction that the jury might be supposed to know the fact that the country was at war. As to the other part of the charge, the jury were told to look at all the evidence, including the character of the publications, and determine from them whether there was an attempt to cause insubordination and a willful obstruction of enlistment; in other words-whether they amounted to a substantial violation of the statute. We find no well-founded objection to this part of the charge. It is true this language was used in connection with the observations concerning judicial notice as to the country being in a state of war, but we are of opinion, taking the charge together that the question was fairly left to the jury upon the evidence in the part of the instruction which we have quoted, which left to it to determine whether the facts made a case coming within the denunciation of the statute.\n\n\n 3. \nIt is contended that the court did not analyze and discuss the details of the evidence. The trial judge left matters of fact to the determination of the jury in a charge commendable for its fairness. Certainly the lack of discussion in detail does not amount to a valid objection; particularly in the absence of any specific request for comment upon any special phase of the testimony.\n\n 4. \nAs to the contention that there was no evidence to warrant the convictions of the accused-it must be borne in mind that it is not the province of this Court to weigh testimony. It is sufficient to support the judgment of the District Court, if there was substantial evidence inculpating the defendants which, if believed by the jury, would justify the submission of the issues to it. It would serve no good purpose to set forth the contents of the newspaper articles and the circulars, the publication and destribution of which were alleged to be the overt acts in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy. That they contain appeals tending to cause disloyalty and refusal of duty in \n\n[250 U.S. 583, 589]\n\u00a0\n the military forces of the United States, and to obstruct the recruiting and enlistment service of the government is sufficiently apparent on the face of the publications. That those who by concerted action prepared and circulated such writings could be found guilty of a conspiracy is equally clear. The connection of the plaintiffs in error with the Lithuanian Socialist Federation, whose membership was shown to be actively opposed to the prosecution of the war, is apparent from a perusal of the record. Stilson was the translator-secretary of the Federation. There is evidence tending to show that one of the circulars entitled, 'Let Us Not Go to the Army,' was mimeographed from the typewriter controlled and operated by him. Language of the same character as that set forth in the incriminating circulars is found in articles in evidence which were admittedly written by him.\n Sukys had been a correspondent of 'Kova,' and was afterwards manager of the Kovaprinting plant and was appointed by the executive committee of the Federation, and incriminating acts of his are clearly shown in the record.\n We agree with the trial court that there was ample testimony justifying the submission of the question of the guilt of the accused to the jury, who found both of the plaintiffs in error guilty of concerted action amounting to a conspiracy to violate the provisions of the act. We find no error in this record, and the judgments are\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS dissenting on the ground that as the sentence was upon a general verdict of guilty on both counts, one of which is not sustained, the judgment should be reversed. \n\n\n\n","192":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTROUD v. U.S.(1919)\nNo. 276\nArgued: October 22, 1919Decided: November 24, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[251 U.S. 15, 16]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Martin J. O'Donnell and Isaac B. Kimbrell, both of Kansas City, Mo., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Stewart, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Robert F. Stroud was indicted for the killing of Andrew Turner. The indictment embraced the elements constituting murder in the first degree. The homicide took place in the United States prison at Leavenworth, Kan., where Stroud was a prisoner and Turner a guard. The record discloses that Stroud killed Turner by stabbing him with a knife, which he carried concealed on his person.\n Stroud was convicted in May, 1916, of murder in the first degree, and sentenced to be hanged. Upon confession of error by the United States district attorney the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this judgment. 245 Fed. 990, 157 C. C. A. 672. Stroud was \n\n[251 U.S. 15, 17]\n\u00a0\n again tried at the May term, 1917; the jury in the verdict rendered found Stroud 'guilty as charged in the indictment without capital punishment.' Upon writ of error to this court the Solicitor General of the United States confessed error, and the judgment was reversed; the mandate commanded:\n'Such further proceedings be had in said cause, in conformity with the judgment of this court, as according to right and justice, and the laws of the United States ought to be had, the said writ of error notwithstanding.'\n\n In pursuance of this mandate the District Court issued an order vacating the former sentence, and ordered a new trial. The trial was had; the jury found Stroud guilty of murder in the first degree as charged in the indictment, making no recommendation dispensing with capital punishment. Upon this verdict sentence of death was pronounced. This writ of error is prosecuted to reverse the judgment.\n The case is brought directly to this court because of assignments of error alleged to involve the construction and application of the Constitution of the United States. The argument has taken a wide range. We shall dispose of such assignments of error as we deem necessary to consider in justice to the contentions raised in behalf of the plaintiff in error.\n It is alleged that the last trial of the case had the effect to put the plaintiff in error twice in jeopardy for the same offense in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. From what has already been said it is apparent that the indictment was for murder in the first degree; a single count thereof fully described that offense. Each conviction was for the offense charged. It is true that upon the second trial the jury added 'without capital punishment' to its verdict, and sentence for life imprisonment was imposed. This recommendation was because of the right of the jury so to do under section 330 of the Criminal Code. Act March 4, 1909, c. 321, 35 Stat. 1152, 10 U. S. Comp. Stats. \n\n[251 U.S. 15, 18]\n\u00a0\n  10504. This section permits the jury to add to the verdict, where the accused is found guilty of murder in the first degree, 'without capital punishment,' in which case the convicted person is to be sentenced to imprisonment for life. The fact that the jury may thus mitigate the punishment to imprisonment for life did not render the conviction less than one for the first degree murder. Fitzpatrick v. United States, \n178 \nU.S. 304, 307\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 944\n\n\n The protection afforded by the Constitution is against a second trial for the same offense. Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163; Kepner v. United States, \n195 U.S. 100\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 797, 1 Ann. Cas. 655, and cases cited in the opinion. Each conviction was for murder as charged in the indictment, which, as we have said, was murder in the first degree. In the last conviction the jury did not add the words 'without capital punishment' to the verdict, although the court in its charge particularly called the attention of the jury to this statutory provision. In such case the court could do no less than inflict the death penalty. Moreover, the conviction and sentence upon the former trials were reversed upon writs of error sued out by the plaintiff in error. The only thing the appellate court could do was to award a new trial on finding error in the proceeding, thus the plaintiff in error himself invoked the action of the court which resulted in a further trial. In such cases he is not placed in second jeopardy within the meaning of the Constitution. Trono v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 521, 533\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 121, 4 Ann. Cas. 773.\n It is insisted that the court erred in not granting a change of venue. The plaintiff in error made a motion in the trial court asking such an order. The chief grounds for the application appear to have been that the testimony for the government in the former trials had been printed and commented upon by the local press; that the evidence published was only such as the government had introduced and its wide circulation by the medium of the press created prejudice in the minds of the inhabitants of Leavenworth county against him, and that this prejudice existed to such an extent that the jury impaneled to try the case, though not inhabitants of Leavenworth \n\n[251 U.S. 15, 19]\n\u00a0\n county, were influenced more or less by the prejudice existing in that county against him; that at defendant's last trial the government by issuing pardons to prisoners who claimed to have witnessed the homicide, produced only such witnesses as tended to support its theory of the guilt of the defendant of the crime of first degree murder, and that at the same time the government invoked the rule that prisoners in the penitentiary who witnessed the homicide, being still prisoners under conviction and serving terms of more than one year, were not qualified witnesses on behalf of the defendant; that the cause was set for trial at a special term of the court beginning on May 20, 1918, and on said date the defendant's counsel were engaged in the state of Missouri in the trial of a cause, that the attorneys advised the judge of their inability to be present during the week the case was set for trial; that an affidavit, setting forth the above facts, was filed with the court, praying it not to enter upon the trial; that the counsel for the government submitted an affidavit, in which it was stated that counsel for the defendant, Stroud, stated their wish and desire to escape further responsibility for the conduct of the defense, and expressed their hope that something would occur to make it unnecessary to appear longer in this cause in Stroud's behalf, and proposed that the government consent that the defendant plead guilty to the charge of second degree murder, with the understanding that as a result thereof the court might sentence the defendant to prison for the remainder of his life; that said statement and affidavit were read in the presence and hearing of the special panel of prospective jurors in open court, said jurors being among those before whom the government proposed to put the defendant upon trial for murder; that at the close of the reading of the affidavit in the presence of the prospective \n\n[251 U.S. 15, 20]\n\u00a0\n jurors, the District Judge stated from the bench that in view of the statements set forth in the affidavit he was compelled to feel that counsel had acted unprofessionally by not being there in court-at least one of them; that said facts were commented upon by the public press of Leavenworth county, and created prejudice against defendant and his attorneys; that defendant never authorized any person or attorney to make any such proposal to attorneys for the government, concerning a plea of guilty, for the reason that the defendant was not guilty of the charge contained in the indictment, or of murder in any degree, and that unless the jurors who had theretofore attended the court during the week of May 20, 1918, were discharged by order of the court the defendant could not enjoy the right of a public trial by an impartial jury secured to him by the Constitution, and prayed an order transferring the case to another division of the district. The court overruled the motion, except in so far as it asked for an exclusion of inhabitants of Leavenworth county as jurors; to that extent it was sustained. The motion to quash the panel, called to act as jurors, was made on like grounds, and was also overruled.\n The division in which Leavenworth county is situated consists of fifty counties, and, after hearing these applications, the District Court excluded persons from the jury who were residents of Leavenworth county, and refused to quash the panel upon the grounds alleged. Matters of this sort are addressed to the discretion of the trial judge, and we find nothing in the record to amount to abuse of discretion such as would authorize an appellate court to interfere with the judgment. Kennon v. Gilmer, \n131 \nU.S. 22, 24\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 696.\n Certain jurors were challenged for cause upon the ground that they were in favor of nothing less than capital punishment in cases of conviction for murder in the first degree. It may well be that as to one of these jurors, one \n\n[251 U.S. 15, 21]\n\u00a0\n Williamson, the challenge should have been sustained. The juror was peremptorily challenged by the accused, and did not sit upon the jury. The statute, in cases of this character, allowed the accused 20 peremptory challenges; it appears that he was in fact allowed twenty-two peremptory challenges. Thus his right to exercise peremptory challenges was not abridged to his prejudice by an erroneous ruling as to the challenge for cause. In view of this fact, and since there is nothing in the record to show that any juror who sat upon the trial was in fact objectionable, we are unable to discover anything which requires a reversal upon this ground. See Hayes v. Missouri, \n120 \nU.S. 68, 71\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 350; Hopt v. Utah, \n120 U.S. 430\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 614; Spies v. Illinois, \n123 U.S. 131\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 21, 22; Holt v. United States, \n218 \nU.S. 245, 248\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 2, 20 Ann. Cas. 1138.\n Certain letters were offered in evidence at the trial containing expressions tending to establish the guilt of the accused. These letters were written by him after the homicide and while he was an inmate of the penitentiary at Leavenworth. They were voluntarily written, and under the practice and discipline of the prison were turned over ultimately to the warden, who furnished them to the district attorney. It appears that at the former trial, as well as the one which resulted in the conviction now under consideration, application was made for a return of these letters upon the ground that their seizure and use brought them within principles laid down in Weeks v. United States, \n232 U.S. 383\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 341, L. R. A. 1915B, 834, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 1177, and kindred cases. But we are unable to discover any application of the principles laid down in those cases to the facts now before us. In this instance the letters were voluntarily written, no threat or coercion was used to obtain them, nor were they seized without process. They came into the possession of the officials of the penitentiary under established practice, reasonably designed to promote the discipline of the institution. Under such circumstances there was neither \n\n[251 U.S. 15, 22]\n\u00a0\n testimony required of the accused, nor unreasonable search and seizure, in violation of his constitutional rights.\n Other objections are raised in the elaborate brief filed in behalf of the plaintiff in error. We do not find it necessary to discuss them. In view of the gravity of the case they have been examined and considered with care, and we are unable to find that any error was committed to the prejudice of the accused.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n251 U.S. 380\n, 40 Sup.

He was tried in the District Court of the United States for the District of Minnesota, found guilty by the jury, and sentenced. See 245 Fed. 604. Thirty-one exceptions were taken to rulings of the trial judge. Instead of seeking review by the Circuit Court of Appeals under section 128 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1133 [Comp.

Thirty of the rulings excepted to below are assigned as errors here. If any one of them involves a constitutional question which is substantial, or was such when the defendant sued out his writ of error, we have jurisdiction to review all the questions raised and it is our duty to determine \n\n[249 U.S. 182, 184]\n\u00a0\n them, so far as necessary to afford redress, even if we should conclude that the constitutional question was correctly decided below.

But mere reference to a provision of the federal Constitution, or the mere assertion of a claim under it, does not authorize this court to review a criminal proceeding; and it is our duty to decline jurisdiction unless the writ of error presents a constitutional question substantial in character and properly raised below.

These two are for refusal to give the following instructions:\n\n\n (a)\n 'The Constitution of the United States provides that Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition for a redress of grievances. This right has been deemed so essential and necessary to free institutions and a free people that it has been incorporated in substance in the Constitutions of all the states of the Union. These constitutional provisions referred to are not abrogated, they are not less in force now because of war, and they are as vital during war as during times of peace, and as binding upon you now as though we were at peace.'\n\n\n (b)\n 'This provision of our Constitution will not justify or warrant advocating a violation of law. A man may freely speak and write and petition, but he is responsible for the consequences of what he may say, write or publish; and if what he says and publishes has a natural tendency to produce a violation of law, that is to impel the persons \n\n[249 U.S. 182, 185]\n\u00a0\n addressed to violate the law, and the person using the language intends that it should produce a violation of law, then the person using such language is subject to punishment and this is not inconsistent with the right and protection guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States and of this state.'\n While the trial judge refused to give these specific instructions, his charge to the jury included the following passage:\n'Now, considerable has also been said in this case about freedom of speech. The Constitution of the United States provides that Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech. This provision of the Constitution is of course in force in times of war as well as in times of peace. But 'freedom of speech' does not mean that a man may say whatever he pleases without the possibility of being called to account for it. A man has a right to honestly discuss a measure or a law, and to honestly criticize it. But no man may advise another to disobey the law, or to obstruct its execution, without making himself liable to be called to account therefor.'\n\n This passage in the charge clearly embodied the substance of the two requests made by the defendant. The judge was not obliged to adopt the exact language of the instructions requested; Holt v. United States, \n218 \nU.S. 245, 253\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 2, 20 Ann. Cas. 1138; nor was he obliged to repeat the instructions already given in substance. Compare Bennett v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 333, 339\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 288. As no substantial constitutional question was presented by the defendant, this court is without jurisdiction to review the other errors assigned.\n Dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","194":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSULLIVAN v. CITY OF SHREVEPORT(1919)\nNo. 89\nArgued: Decided: December 15, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. E. H. Randolph, of Shreveport, La., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. J. E. Smitherman, of Shreveport, La., for defendant in error. \n\n[251 U.S. 169, 170]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1907 the city of Shreveport, Louisiana, passed an ordinance requiring that each street car used in its streets should be operated during designated hours by two persons, a conductor and a motorman, and providing penalties for its violation.\n The company with street railway lines in the city complied with the requirement until in June, 1917, when it procured some cars equipped for operation by one man, and attempted to use them on its 'Allendale Line,' with only a motorman in charge. Thereupon the plaintiff in error, hereinafter designated the defendant, who was superintendent of the railway company, was arrested for violation of the ordinance.\n He defended by filing a motion to quash the affidavit for arrest, on the ground that the ordinance was unreasonable and arbitrary and that the enforcement of it would deprive the company of its property without due process of law and without compensation, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n The motion to quash was 'referred to the merits,' a full trial was had, the motion was overruled and the defendant, found guilty, was sentenced to pay a fine. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana affirming this judgment is before us for review on writ of error.\n The defense introduced evidence tending to show that the new type of car used was so equipped that it could be operated by one motorman with safety to the public as great as was secured by cars theretofore used when operated by two men. The car, designated in the record as 'a one-man car,' is described as so arranged that passengers enter and leave it only at the front end, where the motorman is placed. It is so equipped electrically that the motorman must remain in an assigned \n\n[251 U.S. 169, 171]\n\u00a0\n position necessary for the discharge of his duties and must perform 'some conscious act' at all times when the car is in motion. If he fails in this 'conscious act,' the current is automatically cut off, the brakes are applied in emergency, the rail is sanded, and the door of the car is unlocked, and is so adjusted that opening it lowers the step for use. There is testimony tending to show economy in the use of such cars, not only in the saving of the wages of one man, but also in immunity from accident.\n It is apparent from this description derived from the record that it presents for decision the question: Whether the ordinance of 1907, confessedly a valid exercise of the police power when it was passed, was rendered arbitrary and invalid by the development of a car which it is claimed can be operated by one man with as much safety to the traveling public as, and with less cost than, was secured by the two-man car, in use at the time the ordinance was passed and which was contemplated by it.\n It is not necessary to decide in this case whether a valid regulating ordinance can be rendered invalid by a change of conditions which render it arbitrary and confiscatory (Lincoln Gas & Electric Light Co. v. Lincoln, \n250 \nU.S. 256, 269\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 454; Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 473\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 729, 48 L. R. A. [N. S.] 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18; Johnson v. Gearlds, \n234 \nU.S. 422, 426\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 794; Perrin v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 478, 481\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 387; Municipal Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission, 225 N. Y. 89, 95, 97, 121 N. E. 772, and Castle v. Mason, 91 Ohio St. 296, 303, 110 N. E. 463, Ann. Cas. 1917A, 164), for the claim that such a change of condition had arisen in the case is stoutly disputed by the city authorities.\n While on the record before us it might be plausibly contended that when all the appliances on the 'one-man car' work as it was intended they should, it could be operated with a high degree of safety in streets where the traffic is not heavy, yet there is evidence that in the short period of the operation of such cars in Shreveport, \n\n[251 U.S. 169, 172]\n\u00a0\n the brakes on one of them failed to operate on a descending grade, resulting in the car getting out of control under conditions which, except for good fortune, might have resulted in serious accident. A passenger testified to receiving slight injuries when entering a car, due to the premature closing of the door, and he attributed the accident to the presence of other persons between him and the motorman whose duty it was to close the door. It was in evidence that the line on which these cars were placed, while in general one of light travel, extended into the principal business section of a city of 40,000 inhabitants; that it had at least one steep grade in it; and that at times the travel was heavy and the cars crowded.\n It is obvious, and not disputed, that such cars are better adapted to light than to heavy travel, for all passengers must enter and leave at one door, and one man must take fares, make change, issue transfers, answer questions, and also remain in position to start the car promptly. So occupied and placed, plainly this one man could not render such assistance as is often necessary to infirm or crippled, or very young passengers, or to those incumbered with baggage or bundles, and it would not be difficult to suggest emergencies of storm or accident in which a second man might be of first importance to the safety and comfort of passengers.\n These 'one-man cars' at the time of trial were, as yet, experimental, and enough has been said to show that in each community the operation of street cars presents such special problems-due to the extent and character of the travel, to grades and other conditions-that with peculiar appropriateness they have been committed by the law primarily to the disposition of the local authorities, whose determination will not be disturbed by the courts, except in cases in which the power has been exercised in a manner clearly arbitrary and oppressive. The rule is:\n'That every \n\n[251 U.S. 169, 173]\n\u00a0\n intendment is to be made in favor of the lawfulness of the exercise of municipal power, making regulations to promote the public health and safety, and that it is not the province of the courts, except in clear cases, to interfere with the exercise of the power reposed by law in municipal corporations for the protection of local rights and the health and welfare of the people in the community.' Dobbins v. Los Angeles, \n195 \nU.S. 223, 235\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 18, 20 (49 L. Ed. 169).\n\n Since the record, as we have thus discussed it, fails to show a clear case of arbitrary conduct on the part of the local authorities, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","195":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nT H SYMINGTON CO. v. NATIONAL MALLEABLE CASTINGS CO.(1919)\nNo. 24\nArgued: Decided: June 9, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 383, 384]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George I. Haight and Charles C. Linthicum, both of Chicago, Ill., for Miner.\n Mr. Charles Neave, of Boston, Mass., for National Castings Co.\n Messrs. Melville Church, Gilbert P. Ritter, and Ernest F. Mechlin, all of Washington, D. C., for T. H. Symington Co.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases are so related that they may be disposed of together. Each is a suit to enjoin the infringement of a patent. One was begun in the district of Maine and is based on letters patent granted May 7, 1901, to Jacob J. Byers on an application filed April 21, 1900. The other was begun in the Northern District of Illinois and is based on letters patent granted February 18, 1902, to William H. Emerick on an application filed May 24, 1901. Both patents cover an improvement in draft rigging for railroad cars. In each suit it became necessary to compare the patents, determine whether the invention of one was anticipated by the other, and ascertain which of the patentees was the original and first inventor. Ultimately the suits reached the Circuit Courts of Appeal for the circuits in which they were brought. In the Maine suit the court held that Byers was the prior inventor and that \n\n[250 U.S. 383, 385]\n\u00a0\n claims 3, 5, and 6 of the patent to him were valid and infringed. National Malleable Castings Co. v. T. H. Symington, 230 Fed. 821, 145 C. C. A. 131; 234 Fed. 343, 148 C. C. A. 245. In the Illinois suit the court held that Emerick was the prior inventor and that claims 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the patent to him were valid and infringed. 229 Fed. 730, 144 C. C. A. 140. These conflicting decisions led to the allowance of the present writs of certiorari.\n While the discussion at the bar and in the briefs has taken a wide range, only two points need be considered.\n One of the elements called for by the claims in the Byers patent which were sustained is a 'pocket' or housing, which is to hold other parts in place. The corresponding element of the Emerick patent is described as 'counterpart castings' and is in two parts. Whether the Byers pocket was to be integral or might be in two or more parts is a matter about which the two courts differed. In the Maine suit it was held that the claims were not limited to an integral pocket, but in the Illinois suit the ruling was the other way. The former view, as it seems to us, is the right one. There is nothing in Byers' claims which were sustained indicating that the pocket is to be integral, while there is a distinct call for such a pocket in claim 9. The difference in terms points persuasively to a difference in purpose, and the specification does even more, for it says 'the pocket may be case in a single piece.' This is the common form of designating an admissible alternative in such instruments. Of course, the other alternative is casting it in a pluraity of pieces. When this is done and the pieces are assembled, they form a pocket and serve in the same way as if there were but one.\n The courts differed also as to who was the prior inventor. Presumptively it was Byers, for his application and patent were both prior to Emerick's application. Recognizing this, the parties claiming under Emerick sought by proof to carry his invention back to an earlier date, and to that end produced the testimony of three \n\n[250 U.S. 383, 386]\n\u00a0\n witnesses, Emerick being one. All three testified in both suits, their testimony being substantially the same in both. In the Maine suit the court pronounced this testimony too equivocal and uncertain to establish priority as against Byers' application and patent, but in the Illinois suit the court, although regarding the testimony as hardly satisfactory, gave effect to it. On reading it we are persuaded that it was clearly insufficient.\n This court has pointed out that oral testimony tending to show prior invention as against existing letters patent is, in the absence of models, drawings, or kindred evidence, open to grave suspicion, particularly if the testimony be taken after the lapse of years from the time of the alleged invention, Deering v. Winona Harvester Works, \n155 \nU.S. 286, 300\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 118. And it has said:\n'A conception of the mind is not an invention until represented in some physical form, and unsuccessful experiments or projects, abandoned by the inventor, are equally destitute of that character.' Clark Thread Co. v. Willimantic Co., \n140 \nU.S. 481, 489\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 846, 849 (35 L. Ed. 521).\n\n Here the evidence was oral. No model, drawing, or kindred exhibit was produced. Fifteen years had elapsed since the date as of which invention was being claimed. The testimony was not direct and strong, but weak and uncertain and in some respects contradictory. At most it only disclosed a mental conception in process of development which occasionally was outlined on scraps of paper and then committed to the waste basket and was roughly worked into a wooden model four or five inches long with a pen knife. The first real model or drawing was made about the time of the actual application for a patent and there was no attempt at reduction to practice until after the patent was issued. Such proof under the rule just stated does not suffice.\n Decree in No. 31 affirmed.\n Decree in No. 24 reversed. \n\n\n\n","196":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTAYABAS LAND CO. v. MANILA R. CO.(1919)\nNo. 331\nArgued: April 25, 1919Decided: May 19, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 22, 23]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. David A. Baer, of Washington, D. C., and C. W. O'Brien, of Manila, P. I., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Edward S. Bailey, of Washington, D. C., and C. A. De Witt, of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A case of eminent domain exercised by the railroad company to condemn twelve small parcels of land in Lucena, Province of Tayabas, Philippine Islands, in accordance with the petition of the railroad company.\n In accordance with the statutory provisions three commissioners were appointed to hear the parties and inspect the properties. They subsequently reported that the parties had been heard and that they, the commissioners, had inspected the properties and examined the same 'inch by inch.'\n They made further detail of their proceedings, set forth certain causes for the increase in value of the properties in the four or five years preceding the hearing, even before the coming of the railroad to the town 'so that the value of land near Cotta was quoted at P2.00 up per square meter, according to the importance and situation of the land,' but that the railroad had 'undoubtedly greatly influenced the rise in the prices of the same lands.' They reported, however, that, taking into consideration all the circumstances, benefits to the railroad and others, they unanimously fixed the values of the pieces of property \n\n[250 U.S. 22, 24]\n\u00a0\n belonging to the parties who were first impleaded in the cause. These values it is not necessary to give nor to designate the properties to which they were attached, for the reason that the ownership of the properties, part before and part after the rendition of the commissioners' report, had become vested in the Tayabas Land Company.\n In accordance with the report judgment was rendered in favor of the land company for P81,412.75 with interest at the rate of 6 per cent. from the date of taking possession of the land.\n Motions for new trials were denied, and the case was taken to the Supreme Court of the Islands by the railroad company, and that court modified the judgment by reducing the award for one of the parcels, containing 16,094 square meters, to the sum of P6,500 and the damages for the remaining parcels were fixed at the same proportionate amount.\n The company says, however, that--\n'The prime question involved in this entire case is in the last analysis one of value, that is, what is a fair value of the land taken by the railroad company for its railroad station at Lucena?'\n\n That, indeed, is the ultimate inquiry but it depends, according to other contentions, upon the power of the Supreme Court over the report of the commissioners and to review and consider the evidence. In other words, the weight that was to be given to the report of the commissioners as a matter of fact and law under section 246 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the Islands and to the findings of the Court of First Instance under sections 273 and 497 of the same Code.\n Section 273 describes the elements that must be considered in determining in a case where 'the preponderance or superior weight of the evidence on the issues involved lies,' and section 497 provides for the extent of the power of the Supreme Court to review and dispose of the case on appeal, \n\n[250 U.S. 22, 25]\n\u00a0\n and it is contended that the Supreme Court was bound, as the Court of First Instance was, to decide by the preponderance of the evidence determined in the same way. This may be conceded, and to what extent the Supreme Court satisfied the requirement of the section we shall presently consider after we have given attention to the more insistent contention based on section 246, which reads as follows:\n'Upon the filing of such report in court, the court shall, upon hearing, accept the same and render judgment in accordance therewith; or, for cause shown, it may recommit the report to the commissioners for further report of facts; or it may set aside the report and appoint new commissioners; or it may accept the report in part and reject it in part, and may make such final order and judgment as shall secure to the plaintiff the property essential to the exercise of his rights under the law, and to the defendant just compensation for the land so taken; and the judgment shall require payment of the sum awarded as provided in the next section, before the plaintiff can enter upon the ground and appropriate it to the public use.'\n\n It will be observed that an alternative power is presented, either to accept the report and render judgment in accordance therewith or to make other dispositions of it or upon it; the latter, however, in a very general way. And the absence of detail encourages and gives some plausibility to controversy, but it is resolved, we think, against the contention of the land company by the analysis of the Supreme Court of the section. The court points out, quoting the section, that 'it may accept the report in part and reject it in part;' and it observed that that situation alone might limit its, the court's, power if it were not 'also empowered to make such final order as shall secure to the plaintiff the property essential to the exercise of his rights under the law, and \n\n[250 U.S. 22, 26]\n\u00a0\n to the defendant just compensation for the land so taken.' A comprehensive power, we may instantly say, and one required to be exercised and adequate when exercised to pass upon and finally adjudge the designated rights. And it gives facility to the statute, substitutes for circumlocution and delay directness and expedition, qualities that a statute of eminent domain should possess.\n The court further pointed out that the 'final 'order and judgment' were reviewable by it by means of a bill of exceptions in the same way as any other 'action,\" and decided besides that section 496 of the Code was applicable. That section gives power in the exercise of appellate discretion to 'affirm, reverse, or modify any final judgment, order, or decree of the Court of First Instance.' And this discretion, the Supreme Court in the present case decided, extends to cases of eminent domain, and, where section 497 of the Code providing for motions for new trial had been complied with, it, the court, might 'examine the testimony and decide the case by a preponderance of the evidence; or, in other words, retry the case on the merits and render such order or judgment as justice and equity may require.' The final conclusion of the court was, rejecting the contention of appellants, that it had power 'to change or modify the report of the commissioners by increasing or decreasing the amount of the award' if the facts of the case justified. And it was the conclusion of the court that the facts so justified; and, after a review of prior cases, it rejected the contention that its conclusion was in conflict with them.\n It will be observed, therefore, that the court considered that it was under the same obligation to determine the case by the preponderance of the evidence as was the Court of Firxt Instance, and discharging its obligation, that is, in determining upon the weight of the evidence, its estimate of the values of the properties taken by the railroad was different from that of the Court of First Instance. \n\n[250 U.S. 22, 27]\n\u00a0\n We are brought back, therefore, to the consideration of section 246 and the contention of appellants that under it the Supreme Court had transcended its powers in reducing the values found and reported by the commissioners, and 'erred in holding as a matter of law that appellants were not entitled to recover the amount fixed by the commissioners,' they being the tribunal to hear the evidence and view the premises, and that under section 246, their report being filed, the court was required 'upon hearing to accept the same and render judgment in accordance therewith,' there being no cause shown, it is contended, for recommitting the report or exercising any of the other alternatives permitted by the section.\n But, as we have seen, as to its power of action upon the report of the commissioners the court differed radically with the land company, and if we should, in deference to the land company's contention, admit there is ambiguity in section 246, we should be unable nevertheless to reverse the ruling of the Supreme Court of the Islands upon the local statutes, and we must assume the court gave consideration to all of the testimony and estimated the weight to be assigned to the report and to the declaration of the commissioners that they had examined 'inch by inch' the properties involved. We say this only in passing. The case is here on writ of error, and we cannot examine questions of fact. Santos v. Roman Catholic Church, \n212 U.S. 463\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 338; Ling Su Fan v. United States, \n218 \nU.S. 302, 308\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 21, 30 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1176; Harty v. Victoria, \n226 U.S. 12\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 4; Gauzon v. Campania General, etc., \n245 U.S. 86\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 46.\n Errors of law besides those stated above are asserted. For instance the company contends that the court used the evidence that had been introduced to prove title as evidence of value, and, further, assigned too much strength to it. Both propositions are too intimately associated with and dependent upon the whole case to be estimated in separation. The court's consideration, therefore, or its \n\n[250 U.S. 22, 28]\n\u00a0\n judgment upon them, we cannot disturb. Indeed, the contention of the land company is but an instance of its broader contention of want of power in the Supreme Court to review the findings of the Court of First Instance or to disregard the report of the commissioners. Accepting the decision of the court upon those propositions, we necessarily affirm its judgment.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concurs in the result. \n\n\n\n","197":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTEXAS & P R. CO. v. LEATHERWOOD(1919)\nNo. 249\nArgued: Decided: June 9, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 478, 479]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George Thompson and J. H. Barwise, Jr., both of Ft. Worth, Tex., for petitioners.\n Mr. D. T. Bomar, of Ft. Worth, Tex., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS announced the judgment of the Court, and delivered the following opinion:\n Leatherwood made, in 1913, a shipment of horses from Watrous, N. M., to Waco, Tex., over four connecting railroads. The initial carrier gave him a through bill of lading which contained a provision barring any action for damages unless suit was brought within six months after the loss occurred. When the horses reached the lines of the Texas & Pacific Railway and of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway, each of these companies insisted, as a condition of carrying them further, that Leatherwood accept and sign a new bill of lading covering the shipment over its line, and he did so.\n In 1915 he brought suit in a state court of Texas for injury to the horses while in transit on the lines of those two companies. The bills of lading issued by them did \n\n[250 U.S. 478, 480]\n\u00a0\n not contain the provision requiring suit to be brought within six months; but the carriers set up as a defense the provisions to that effect contained in the original bill of lading, contending that under the Carmack Amendment (Act of June 29, 1906, . 3591, 34 Stat. 584, 595 [Comp. St.  8604a, 8604aa]) all connecting carriers were bound by its terms and that the later ones issued by themselves were of no legal effect. \n1\n The trial court denied this contention, and ruled as matter of law that the carriers could not rely upon the provision in the initial bill of lading. Judgment was entered for the plaintiff and affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals. On June 2, 1917, that court denied a rehearing and declined to certify to the Supreme Court of Texas the questions involved. The case comes here on writ of certiorari (\n245 U.S. 649\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 12) under section 237 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1156), as amended by Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448,  2, 39 Stat. 726 (Comp. St.  1214).\n The final decision below was rendered two days before the decision of this court in Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Ward, \n244 U.S. 383\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 617. There one of the same railroads had, as connecting carrier, issued a second bill of lading to shippers of live stock, who had received from the initial carriers a through bill of lading on an interstate shipment. But there the carriers relied for defense upon a clause in the second bill of lading, which was not contained in the first. We held that the second bill of lading was void, since under the Carmack Amendment the several carriers must be treated, not as independent contracting parties, but as one system; and that the connecting lines become in effect mere agents whose duty it is to forward the goods under the terms of the contract made by their principal, the initial carrier, and that they are prevented \n\n[250 U.S. 478, 481]\n\u00a0\n by law from varying the terms of that contract. Leatherwood contends that the principle upon which the case was decided is not applicable here, because there the carriers sought to avail themselves of the second bill of lading, while here they seek to ignore it; and he insists that the carriers are, by their conduct, estopped from asserting its invalidity. As stated in Georgia, Florida & Alabama Ry. Co. v. Blish Milling Co., \n241 \nU.S. 190, 197\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 541, the parties to a bill of lading cannot waive its terms, nor can the carrier by its conduct give the shipper a right to ignore them. 'A different view would antagonize the plain policy of the act and open the door to the very abuses at which the act was aimed.' The bill of lading given by the initial carrier embodies the contract for transportation from point of origin to destination; and its terms in respect to conditions of liability are binding upon the shipper and upon all connecting carriers, just as a rate properly filed by the initial carrier is binding upon them. Each has in effect the force of a statute, of which all affected must take notice. That a carrier cannot be prevented by estoppel or otherwise from taking advantage of the lawful rate properly filed under the Interstate Commerce Act is well settled. A carrier has, for instance, been permitted to collect the legal rate, although it had quoted a lower rate and the shipper was ignorant of the fact that it was not the legal rate. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Mugg, \n202 U.S. 242\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 628; Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Henderson Elevator Co., \n226 U.S. 441\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 176; Louisville & Nashville Railroad Co. v.

Ct. 221 (per curiam).\n The provision in the original bill of lading limiting to six months the time within which suit may be brought, not being unreasonable ( Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Harriman, \n227 \nU.S. 657, 672\n, 673 S., 33 u p. Ct. 397), was valid; and as the original bill of lading remained binding, the lower \n\n[250 U.S. 478, 482]\n\u00a0\n courts erred in denying it effect. The judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals must therefore be reversed.\n The record occupies 213 printed pages. Most of the matter which was included in it at the instance of petitioners, was clearly not required for a proper presentation of the questions submitted here. Much useless expense has been incurred; and both court and counsel have been subjected to the burden of examining much that is irrelevant. Section 1 of rule 8 of this court (32 Sup. Ct. vi) specifically provides that if portions of the record unnecessary to a proper presentation of the case are found to have been incorporated into the transcript by either party, the court may order that the whole or any part of the clerk's fees for supervising the printing and the cost of printing the record be paid by the offending party. Under the circumstances of this case it seems appropriate that the whole of this expense be borne by the petitioners; and it is so ordered.\n Judgment reversed.\n I am authorized to say that the CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice HOLMES, and Mr. Justice DAY concur in the above opinion.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, Mr. Justice PITNEY, and Mr. Justice CLARKE dissent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurring.\n I concur in the conclusion that the judgment below must be reversed. Circumstances disclosed by the record and not discussed in the opinion, I think, require this result. But the broad declaration that the parties to a bill of lading cannot waive its terms nor can the carrier, by its conduct, give the shipper the right to ignore them goes beyond what is necessary to the decision and I am not prepared to assent to it as a proposition of law. \n\n[250 U.S. 478, 483]\n\u00a0\n Suit was originally brought against the initial line (The Santa Fe) and connecting ones-Texas & Pacific Ry. Co., and Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway-the claim being based upon the implied obligation arising out of delivery and acceptance of the horses by the former for through interstate carriage. In his pleadings the shipper expressly denied validity of all bills of lading-one issued by the Santa Fe and one by each of the petitioners. Of course, under the rule approved in Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Ward, \n244 U.S. 383\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 617, he could have relied upon the first bill; but it does not follow that if, during transit, a connecting carrier declined to recognize the original agreement for through transportation and refused to proceed thereunder, he had no power to acquiesce, take possession of the animals and re-ship under another contract with such carrier not subject to avoidance by it. And if, in the present cause, instead of repudiating the bills of lading issued by connecting roads he had relied upon them the question presented would be a very different one, decision of which is not now demanded.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The rights of the parties are not affected by the Act of March 4, 1915, c. 176, 38 Stat. 1196, which prohibits a common carrier from providing by contract or otherwise for a shorter period than two years for the institution of suits. \n\n\n\n\n","198":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTHE 6 S(1919)\nNo. 301\nArgued: April 24, 1919Decided: June 2, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 269, 270]\n\u00a0\n Mr. A.

Appellant, as claimant of the scow, denied the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the suit: First, on the ground that by the statute the vessel was made liable only for such penalties as might be imposed in criminal proceedings upon the persons responsible for the illegal act, and there had been in this case no conviction of such persons or assessment of penalties; and, secondly, that the assessment of such penalties was not within the admiralty or maritime jurisdiction of the court.

St.  1215]).\n The statute forbids by section 1 the deposit of mud, etc., in the tidal waters of New York Harbor except within limits prescribed by the supervisor, and provides that--\n'Every such act is made a misdemeanor, and every person engaged in or who shall aid, abet, authorize, or instigate a violation of this section, shall, upon conviction. \n\n[250 U.S. 269, 271]\n\u00a0\n be punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both, such fine to be not less than two hundred and fifty dollars nor more than two thousand five hundred dollars, and the imprisonment to be not less than thirty days nor more than one year, either or both united, as the judge before whom conviction is obtained shall decide.'\n\n Section 2 provides that the master, etc., of any vessel towing a scow loaded with prohibited matter to a place of deposit elsewhere than within the limits shall be punishable as provided in section 1, and in addition have his license revoked or suspended.\n Section 4 contains provisions for disposal of dredged material, and a penalty for violation thereof, and concludes as follows:\n'Any boat or vessel used or employed in violating any provision of this act, shall be liable to the pecuniary penalties imposed thereby, and may be proceeded against, summarily by way of libel in any District Court of the United States, having jurisdiction thereof.'\n\n The principal contention of appellant is that the purpose of the statute was to make the vessel responsible only for such pecuniary penalties as might be assessed against the offending persons in criminal proceedings, and hence that the conviction and fining of such persons is a condition precedent to the maintenance of a suit against the vessel. In support of this The Strathairly, \n124 U.S. 558\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 609, is cited. That was a suit brought under sections 4252, 4253, 4255, 4266, and 4270, Rev. St., which contained provisions respecting the carriage of passengers on vessels entering or leaving ports of the United States, and prescribed fines and penalties against the master and owner of the vessel violating such provisions. Section 4270 provided:\n'The amount of the several penalties imposed by the foregoing provisions regulating the carriage of passengers in merchant vessels shall be liens on the vessel violating those provisions, and such \n\n[250 U.S. 269, 272]\n\u00a0\n vessel shall be libeled therefor in any Circuit or District Court of the United States where such vessel shall arrive.'\n\n This court said (\n124 U.S. 580\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 609) that the penalty recoverable against the vessel, and by section 4270 made a lien upon it, was not an additional penalty, but the same which by section 4253 was to be adjudged against the master in the criminal prosecution.\n We concur with the District Judge in the view that the case is distinguishable from the present one because of the substantial difference in the applicable provisions of law. The act of Congress here in question imposes a direct liability upon the vessel for the pecuniary penalties prescribed, and declares that it may be proceeded against summarily by libel in any District Court of the United States having jurisdiction thereof. This precludes the idea that the proceeding by libel is to be deferred to await the possibly slow course of criminal proceedings against the persons individually responsible. It treats the offending vessel as a guilty thing, upon the familiar principle of the maritime law, and permits a proceeding against her in any court of admiralty 'having jurisdiction thereof'-meaning any court within whose jurisdiction she may be found.\n Libels of this character, without previous conviction of the responsible persons, have been entertained under this act from the time of its enactment, and dealt with upon the merits, without question as to the jurisdiction until now.

Ct. 149, being a suit in admiralty, as they were, to recover prepaid freight upon a shipment of articles of merchandise which were not carried to destination, the carriage having been prevented by action of the government. Judgment was rendered for libelant and the case taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The case is here on certificate from that court (254 Fed. 987), induced, as the court recites, by its decision in the case of International Paper Co. v. The Schooner Gracie D. Chambers (No. 479), to review which a certiorari has been granted by this court.\n The facts as certified are these:\n'On August 17, 1917, varnish belonging to libelant was shipped by it in the port of New York for Gothenburg, Sweden, upon the steamship Bris, consigned to the Allmanna Svenska Elektriska A. B. Westeras, and the agents for said ship thereupon delivered to libelant a bill of lading, of which a copy is annexed hereto, which formed a contract between libelant and claimant in reference to said goods. Particular reference is made to clause 6, clause 7 and the next to last clause of the bill of lading. The libelant paid in advance the freight mentioned in said bill of lading. At the time of said shipment, shippers were required to obtain export licenses from the British government on cargo of this class, and were also required by the United States Statutes to obtain export licenses from the United States government in connection with such articles as the President should, by proclamation, designate. At the time that said shipment was made the President had designated certain articles as to which licenses \n\n[248 U.S. 392, 397]\n\u00a0\n must be thus procured when destined for Gothenburg, Sweden, but varnish was not included among them. At the time of shipment, the libelant presented a license which it had procured from the British government. On August 27, 1917, the President made a further proclamation, effective August 30, 1917, whereby shippers of varnish and all other cargo destined for Gothenburg, Sweden, were required to procure licenses before the same could be exported. The libelant thereupon made application for such a license, and the claimant held its vessel in port until October 8th, to see if such licenses could be procured, before beginning the discharge of the cargo. Unless shipments were accompanied by the aforesaid licenses they were not allowed by the men-of-war belonging to the Allies to proceed to destination. On or about October 8th the United States, acting through the Exports Administrative Board, refused the application for a license to transport the goods mentioned in the libel, and other cargo destined for Gothenburg, and claimant thereupon began to unload the cargo of the Bris and concluded the discharge on October 22, 1917. The claimant continued ready and willing to carry said cargo forward if a license therefor were obtained by libelant. The libelant took redelivery of the cargo at the port of shipment and made a demand upon the claimant that the claimant should return the freight paid, which demand was refused. The question aforesaid is as follows:\n\n'1. Did the bill of lading contract justify the carrier, under the facts stated, in refusing to refund the prepaid freight?'\n\n Clause 6 of the bill of lading is as follows:\n'... Prepaid freight is to be considered as earned on shipment of the goods and is to be retained by the vessel's owners, vessel or cargo lost or not lost, or if there be a forced interruption or abandonment of the voyage at a port of distress or elsewhere. ...'\n\n The material parts of clause \n\n[248 U.S. 392, 398]\n\u00a0\n 7 are as follows:\n'Also, in case the ship shall be prevented from reaching her destination by ... war ... or the hostile act of any power,' the master may wait until the impeding obstacle be removed 'or discharge the goods into any depot or at any convenient port or bring her cargo back to port of shipment where the ship's responsibility shall cease . ...'\n\n Clause 2 should be considered. It exempts 'by arrest and restraint of princes, rulers or 'bt arrest and restraint of princes, rulers or peoples.'\n We think the case is within the principle of the decision of the cases submitted with it. In this case, however, it is urged that the clause relied on by the ship to justify the retention of the advance of freight does not contain the word 'irrevocable' and that upon that word stress was put by the Circuit Court of Appeals and presumably by this court. The word undoubtedly is one of intensity but its absence does not remove the meaning or intention of its associates. Their declaration is that 'prepaid freight is to be considered as earned on shipment of the goods and is to be retained by the vessel's owners, vessel or cargo lost or not lost.' The declaration is clear, and, in anxiety of purpose, uses some tautology. The words 'prepaid freight is to be considered as earned' declare a completed right and carried the power of retention without the expression of the latter. And the expression of the right and the power cannot be put aside. Counsel, however, would make them purposeless and would consider the bill of lading as if they were not contained in it, and urges that the only effect of the refusal of clearance to the ship was the 'commercial frustration of the adventure' working a dissolution of the contract, absolving from performance but requiring the restitution of the payments that were made as the consideration of performance.\n We are not insensible to the appealing force of the contentions nor to the strength of the argument advanced \n\n[248 U.S. 392, 399]\n\u00a0\n to support them, but the contract determines against them and the reasons for assigning to it that effect we have given in our opinions in the other cases.\n We, therefore, answer the questions certified in the affirmative.\n Os ordered. \n\n\n\n","200":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTHE GRACIE D CHAMBERS(1919)\nNo. 479\nArgued: Decided: January 13, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. William C.

Chambers, her tackle, etc., to recover the sum of $5,845 prepaid freight on a cargo of paper loaded on the schooner for shipment from New York to Bordeaux, France, by the International Paper Company. Judgment went for libelant in the District Court. It was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals by a divided court (253 Fed. 182). To this action this writ is directed.\n The facts as found by the Circuit Court of Appeals are as follows:\n'September 14, 1917, the schooner Gracie D. Chambers began to load a general cargo in the port of New York, \n\n[248 U.S. 387, 391]\n\u00a0\n to be delivered at Bordeaux. Between September 27 and 29 the libelant Paper Company shipped 120 tons of print paper.\n\n'September 28, at 4:25 p. m., the Treasury Department at Washington telegraphed the collector at the port of New York to withhold clearance of all sailing vessels, any part of whose voyages would bring them within the danger zone. There was no official publication of this embargo, but it was put into effect beginning September 29, by the refusal of clearance to such vessels as they applied for them. Both the shippers and the shipowners had heard rumors of the embargo as early as October 1.\n\n'October 3 the schooner moved out to an anchorage at the Red Hook Plats, to save wharfage charges and to await clearance.\n\n'October 4 the freight was paid against delivery of the bill of lading.\n\n'October 5 the master applied to the collector for clearance, which was refused. He then applied to the authorities at Washington to except this schooner from the embargo, on the ground that she had begun to load before the order was made. Refusal to allow an exception in her favor was not definitely and finally made until October 10. Subsequently the cargo was discharged and the owners refused to return the prepaid freight.\n\n'The bill of lading contained the following provisions:\n\n\"Restraints of princes and rulers excepted.'\n\n\"Freight for the said goods to be prepaid in full without discount retained and irrevocably, ship and\/or cargo lost or not lost.\"\n\n The case was submitted with Nos. 449 and 450, \n248 U.S. 377\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 147, and its primary question is, as there, the sufficiency of the clauses in the bill of lading as a defense. In those cases we decided that the bill of lading expressed the contract of the parties and hence determined their rights and liabil \n\n[248 U.S. 387, 392]\n\u00a0\n ities. And it is the safer reliance, the accommodation of all the circumstances that induced it. It was for the parties to consider them and to accept their estimate is not to do injustice but accord to each the due of the law determined by their own judgment and convention, which represented, we may suppose, what there was of advantage or disadvantage as well in the rates as in the risks.\n It is asserted, however, that the vessel in this case did not break ground and that this fact distinguishes the case from Nos. 449 and 450. The fact does not deflect the principle of those cases. It was not made to depend upon the fact of breaking ground, but upon the bills of lading which provided for the payment of freight upon the shipment of the goods and the right to retain it though the goods were not carried, their carriage being prevented by causes beyond the control of the carrier.\n Therefore, upon the authority of those cases, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals in this case is affirmed.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","201":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTHE LAKE MONROE(1919)\nNo. 30\nArgued: Decided: June 2, 1919\n\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 246, 247]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Brown, for petitioner. \n\n[250 U.S. 246, 248]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward E. Blodgett, of Boston, Mass., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Upon petition of the United States this court granted an order to show cause why a writ of prohibition or mandamus should not be issued in order to prevent the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, sitting in admiralty, from directing the seizure, attachment, or arrest of a steam vessel known as the Lake Monroe, owned and operated by the government of the United States, to satisfy a claim of the master and part owner of the American auxiliary fishing schooner Helena for damages arising out of a collision between the two vessels which occurred on October 8, 1918, off the coast of Cape Cod.\n A libel having been filed in the District Court in behalf of the Helena against the Lake Monroe to recover damages, and praying that process issue for the seizure and attachment of the steamship, the United States appearing specially, filed suggestions to the effect that, as the steamer was the property of the United States and in its possession and control, the court was without jurisdiction to enforce claims against her by process.\n The essential facts are as follows: The Lake Monroe, while in process of construction on the Great Lakes, was requisitioned and completed by the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation, and on completion was delivered to the United States Shipping Board for operation, and thereafter assigned by that board, through the Emergency Fleet Corporation, to the firm of William H. Randall & Co., of Boston, as operating and managing agents, that firm being a copartnership having experience in the operation of privately owned vessels for \n\n[250 U.S. 246, 249]\n\u00a0\n commercial purposes. They selected the master and other officers of the vessel, put them in charge of her, and furnished her crew; and thereafter they manned, equipped, and repaired her, collected freight moneys from the consignees, and paid the expenses of manning, equipping, and supplying her, and other running expenses, and for these services they were to be paid by, and were to account for the moneys received by them to, the Emergency Fleet Corporation as the agent of the United States Shipping Board. At the time of the collision the Lake Monroe was loaded with coal, and operating under a charter executed by Randall & Co., as agents of the Shipping Board, to the New England Fuel & Transportation Company, a private concern in Boston; the cargo having been purchased from a private owner for private use, and the freight for its carriage paid by the Transportation Company to Randall & Co.\n The District Court, conceding that the Lake Monroe, being a government-owned vessel, would be exempt from arrest except for the provisions of section 9 of the Shipping Board Act of September 7, 1916, c. 451, 39 Stat. 728, 730 (Comp. St.  8146e), held that, because at the time of the collision she was employed solely as a merchant vessel, by the terms of that section she was subject to arrest on process in rem to answer for the collision.\n It is the principal contention of the government that the Shipping Board Act has no application to the Lake Monroe because she was requisitioned by the President through the Emergency Fleet Corporation under the authority of other legislation, was documented in the name of the United States, and then employed by the President through the Shipping Board and the Fleet Corporation. This contention renders it necessary to review the several acts of legislation and the executive action that has been had pursuant thereto.\n The Act of September 7, 1916, passed before the United \n\n[250 U.S. 246, 250]\n\u00a0\n States entered the great war, but when our commerce already was feeling the ill effects of the world-wide shortage in shipping occasioned by that war, is entitled:\n'An act to establish a United States Shipping Board for the purpose of encouraging, developing, and creating a naval auxiliary and naval reserve and a merchant marine to meet the requirements of the commerce of the United States with its territories and possessions and with foreign countries; to regulate carriers by water engaged in the foreign and interstate commerce of the United States; and for other purposes.'\n\n It created a board of five commissioners, and authorized them ( section 5 [Comp. St.  8146c]), with the approval of the President, to cause to be constructed and equipped, in American shipyards or elsewhere, or to purchase, lease, or charter, 'vessels suitable, as far as the commercial requirements of the marine trade of the United States may permit for use as naval auxiliaries or army transports or for other naval or military purposes' and also (section 7 [Comp. St.  8146d]) to charter, lease, or sell to any citizen of the United States any vessel so purchased or constructed.\n The important section 9 in its original form, provided as follows.\n'Sec. 9. That any vessel purchased, chartered, or leased from the board may be registered or enrolled and licensed, or both registered and enrolled and licensed, as a vessel of the United States and entitled to the benefits and privileges appertaining thereto: Provided, that foreign-built vessels admitted to American registry or enrollment and license under this act, and vessels owned, chartered, or leased by any corporation in which the United States is a stockholder, and vessels sold, leased, or chartered to any person a citizen of the United States, as provided in this act, may engage in the coastwise trade of the United States. Every vessel purchased, chartered, or leased from the board shall, unless otherwise authorized by the board, be operated only under such registry or enrollment and license. Such vessels while employed solely \n\n[250 U.S. 246, 251]\n\u00a0\n as merchant vessels shall be subject to all laws, regulations, and liabilities governing merchant vessels, whether the United States be interested therein as owner, in whole or in part, or hold any mortgage, lien, or other interest therein.'\n\n There followed prohibitions not necessary now to be particularly considered.\n Section 11 (Comp. St.  8146f) authorized the Shipping Board to form one or more corporations under the laws of the District of Columbia for the purchase, construction, equipment, lease, charter, maintenance, and operation of merchant vessels in the commerce of the United States, the total capital stock not to exceed $50,000,000, and the Board to acquire for and on behalf of the United States not less than a majority of the capital stock. The act contained numerous provisions imposing duties upon common carriers by water, and conferring powers of regulation upon the Shipping Board.\n The members of this Board were appointed by the President in December, 1916, and, having been confirmed by the Senate, were formally organized in the following month.\n By the time the United States declared war, April 6, 1917, the world's merchant shipping had reached the stage of demoralization. The President, by a proclamation dated February 5, 1917, had declared an emergency, and brought into play the prohibition of one of the clauses of section 9 of the above act against the sale, lease, or charter to a person not a citizen of the United States or the transfer to a foreign registry of flag of any vessel registered or enrolled and licensed under the laws of the United States.\n Soon after the declaration of war the Shipping Board, under authority of section 11 of the above act, caused to be organized (April 16, 1917) under the laws of the District of Columbia a corporation known as the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation, with $50,000,000 of capital stock, all owned by the United \n\n[250 U.S. 246, 252]\n\u00a0\n States. It was officered by the commissioners of the Shipping Board and their nominees, and was but an operating agency of that Board.\n In this state of affairs, Congress embodied in the Urgent Deficiencies Appropriation Act of June 15, 1917 (chapter 29, 40 Stat. 182), a clause entitled 'Emergency Shipping Fund,' which conferred upon the President broad powers of control over contracts for the building, production, or purchase of ships or material, and among others the power--\n'to purchase, requisition, or take over the title to, or the possession of, for use or operation by the United States any ship now constructed or in the process of construction or hereafter constructed, or any part thereof, or charter of such ship.'\n\n Another clause declared:\n'The President may exercise the power and authority hereby vested in him ... through such agency or agencies as he shall determine from time to time: Provided, that all money turned over to the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation may be expended as other moneys of said corporation are now expended. All ships constructed, purchased, or requisitioned under authority herein, or heretofore or hereafter acquired by the United States, shall be managed, operated, and disposed of as the President may direct.' Comp. St. 1918,  3115 1\/16d.\n\n Under this authority the President made an executive order July 11, 1917, directing that the Fleet Corporation should have and exercise all power and authority vested in him by said provision, so far as applicable to the construction of vessels, the purchase or requisitioning of vessels in process of construction, and the completion thereof, and that the Shipping Board should exercise all power and authority vested in him by said provision, so far as applicable to the taking over of title or possession, by purchase or requisition, of constructed vessels or charters therein, and the operation, management, and disposition of such vessels, and of all others theretofore or there \n\n[250 U.S. 246, 253]\n\u00a0\n after acquired by the United States, declaring:\n'The powers herein delegated to the United States Shipping Board may, in the discretion of said Board, be exercised directly by the said Board or by it through the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation, or through any other corporation organized by it for such purpose.'\n\n It was under the authority thus conferred that the Lake Monroe was requisitioned while in process of construction and carried to completion by the Fleet Corporation, and thereafter operated by the Shipping Board through that corporation. She was documented in the name of the United States, and assigned to Randall & Co. as operating and managing agents, and at the time of the collision was operating under a charter executed by them as agents of the Shipping Board to a private concern for carrying coal in coastwise commerce.\n Reference should be made to two acts approved respectively July 15 and July 18, 1918, the former an amendment to the Shipping Act of 1916, the latter 'An act to confer on the President power to prescribe charter rates and freight rates and to requisition vessels, and for other purposes.' Chapters 152 and 157, 40 Stat. 900, 913. They were introduced as companion measures, the former as H. R. 12,100, the latter as H. R. 12,099, and proceeded pari passu through Congress. The Act of July 15th amended section 9 of the Shipping Act of 1916 with respect to some of its prohibitions, but re-enacted almost verbatim the part we have quoted from that section. The Act of July 18 begins with some definitions, and among them:\n'The term 'charter' means any agreement, contract, lease, or commitment by which the possession or services of a vessel are secured for a period of time, or for one or more voyages, whether or not a demise of the vessel.'\n\n In view of this legislation we regard the contention of the government that the Shipping Act of 1916 has no application to the Lake Monroe as untenable. The argu \n\n[250 U.S. 246, 254]\n\u00a0\n ment adduced in support of it would cause the restrictive provisions of the Act of 1916 to operate only with respect to vessels constructed or acquired under that particular act and would render the powers conferred upon the Shipping Board and the Fleet Corporation by the executive order of July 11, 1917, absolute powers, subject to no regulation except such as the President might from time to time prescribe.\n But at the time of the emergency provision of June 15, 1917, the Shipping Board had been established as a public commission, with broad administrative powers and subject to definite restrictions, and the Fleet Corporation had been created as its agency, financed with public funds. The emergency shipping legislation evidently was enacted in the expectation that the President would employ the Shipping Board and the Fleet Corporation as his agencies to exercise the new powers, for the Fleet Corporation was mentioned in the act, and it was known to be but an arm of the Board. It is not necessary to hold that Congress, while entertaining this expectation, went to the extent of restricting the President to those agencies; but it is not to be believed that they intended he should exercise the powers arbitrarily. And when in fact he designated the Fleet Corporation to exercise those powers so far as they pertained to the construction of vessels and the requisitioning of vessels in process of construction, and the Shipping Board so far as they applied to the operation, management, and disposition of vessels, it is to be presumed that he did so because of the general powers that already had been conferred upon them by law, and because they were subject to the regulatory provisions that Congress had enacted.\n The provision of section 9 of the Act of September 7, 1916, that vessels purchased, chartered, or leased from the Shipping Board, while employed solely as merchant vessels, should be subject to all laws, regulations, and liabili \n\n[250 U.S. 246, 255]\n\u00a0\n ties governing merchant vessels, whether the United States were interested therein as owner or otherwise, was a most material restriction, deemed by Congress to be essential to subject them to the same duties and liabilities as privately owned merchant vessels with which they competed.\n That Congress considered this provision and the other provisions of the Act of 1916 as having living force and general application after the executive order of July 11, 1917, is manifest from the amendatory act approved July 15, 1918, while the war was at its height, and treated by Congress as an emergency war measure. See House Rep. 568 and Senate Rep. 536, 65th Cong., 2d Sess.; also House Rep. 569 and Senate Rep. 535, same Session, relating to the companion measure. These reports and the accompanying bills show that the Shipping Board was understood to be executing all its powers under the regulations prescribed by the Act of 1916\n\n\n The government contends further that section 9 of that act has no application to the present case, because liability is imposed thereby only with respect to vessels 'purchased, chartered or leased from' the Shipping Board, and only when 'employed solely as merchant vessels'; it being insisted that the Lake Monroe does not come within either of these descriptions. The return, however, makes it clear that at the time of the collision she was operating under a charter executed by the agents of the Board to a certain coal company; and even were it merely an agreement whereby the shippers paid a stipulated rate per ton for the cargo carried, we think that this would be a charter within the meaning of the Act of 1916. The words 'purchased, chartered or leased' indicate an intent to include a contract for the temporary use of a vessel or its services, not amounting to a demise of the ship; in short, the term 'charter' was here employed in a sense as broad as the definition afterwards embodied in the Act of July 18, 1918.\n We cannot accede to the suggestion that the Lake Mon \n\n[250 U.S. 246, 256]\n\u00a0\n roe was not employed 'solely as a merchant vessel' because she was assigned to the New England coal trade, and because at that time the government, through the Fuel Administration, was rationing the coal supply of the country. The language of section 9 'such vessels, while employed solely as merchant vessels,' must be read in connection with the phrase 'whether the United States be interested therein as owner, in whole or in part, or hold any mortgage, lien, or other interest therein.'

A defense was set up that the libelants were deserters, and, therefore, not entitled to recover.

Kappler, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Asst. Atty. Gen. Thompson and Mr. Geo. M. Anderson, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n Messrs. James C. Davis, of Muskogee, Okl., and R. C. Allen, of Tulsa, Okl., for the Creek Nation.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Creek or Muskogee Nation or Tribe of Indians had, in 1890, a population of 15,000. Subject to the control of \n\n[248 U.S. 354, 355]\n\u00a0\n Congress, they then exercised within a defined territory the powers of a sovereign people, having a tribal organization, thier own system of laws, and a government with the usual branches, executive, legislative, and judicial. The territory was divided into six districts; and each district was provided with a judge. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n In 1889 the Creek Nation enacted a statute which conferred upon each citizen of the Nation, head of a family engaged in grazing livestock, the right to inclose for that purpose one square mile of the public domain without paying compensation. Inclosure of a greater area was prohibited; but provision was made for establishing, under certain conditions, more extensive pastures near the frontiers, to protect against influx of stock from adjoining nations. The conditions prescribed were these: If the district judge should receive notice from citizens of a desire to establish such a pasture, he was required to call a meeting of citizens to consider and act upon the subject; and if it appeared that a majority of the persons of voting age in the neighborhood thus to be protected favored its establishment, the district judge was directed to let such pasture for three years (subject to renewal) to citizens who would by contract bind themselves to build a substantial fence around the pasture, and to pay at least five cents per acre per annum for the grazing privilege.\n In 1890 Turner and a partner formed, under the name of Pussy, Tiger & Co., an organization consisting of themselves and 100 Creeks, with a view to securing such a pasture in the Deep Fork district. They caused an election to be held and a contract to be entered into by the district judge with Pussy, Tiger & Co., which covered about 256,000 acres. The fence required to inclose it was \n\n[248 U.S. 354, 356]\n\u00a0\n about 80 miles in length. Before its construction was begun, dissatisfaction had already developed in the neighborhood; and from the time the fence was commenced, there were rumors of threats by Indians to destroy it if built. The work was, however, undertaken; the threats continued; and Turner and one of his assignees secured from the United States Court in the Indian Territory, First Judicial Division, an injunction restraining the Creek district judge for the Deep Fork district and L. C. Perryman, the Principal Chief of the Nation, from interfering with or damaging the fence. After it had been nearly completed, three bands of Creek Indians destroyed the fence, cutting the wire and posts and scattering the staples. It does not appear that either the Creek judge or the Chief or any other official of the Creek government had any part in the destruction of the fence, except one Moore, the treasurer, whose only official duties seem to have been 'to receive and receipt for all national funds and to disburse the same, as should be provided for by law.'\n More than $10,000 net expended in constructing the fence, and $2,500 paid by Turner to the 100 Creek Indians associated with him for the release of their grazing rights were lost, and large profits which it was expected would be made through assignment of pasturage rights to cattle raisers were prevented. Claims for compensation were repeatedly presented by Turner to the Creek Nation. Once its National Council voted to make compensation; but Chief Perryman vetoed the action and his veto was sustained. Later the Creek Supreme Court declared the fence a legal structure; but still the Nation failed to make any compensation. On March 4, 1906, the tribal organization was dissolved pursuant to Act March 1, 1901, c. 676,  46 (31 Stat. 861, 872). In 1908 Congress provided, by section 26 of the Act of May 29, 1908, c. 216 (35 Stat. 444, 457), as follows:\n'That the Court of Claims is hereby authorized to \n\n[248 U.S. 354, 357]\n\u00a0\n consider and adjudicate and render judgment as law and equity may require in the matter of the claim of Clarence W. Turner, of Muskogee, Oklahoma, against the Creek Nation, for the destruction of personal property and the value of the loss of the pasture of the said Turner, or his assigns, by the action of any of the responsible Creek authorities, or with their cognizance and acquiescence, either party to said cause in the Court of Claims to have the right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States.'\n\n In August, 1908, Turner, having acquired all the rights of his associates, filed a petition in the Court of Claims against the Creek Nation and the United States as trustee of Creek funds,2 to recover the amount lost, which he alleged to be the sum of $105,698.03. The Court of Claims dismissed the petition (51 Ct. Cl. 125), and the case comes here by appeal.\n The claimant contends that, by the general law, the Creek Nation is liable in damages for the action of the mob which resulted in the destruction of the property and prevented him from securing the benefits of the contract entered into between him as grantee and the Creek Nation, and that if the substantive right did not already exist, it was created by the act which conferred jurisdiction upon the Court of Claims to hear and adjudicate the controversy.\n First. No such liability existed by the general law. The Creek Nation was recognized by the United States as a distinct political community, with which it made treaties and which within its own territory administered its internal affairs. Like other governments, municipal as well as state, the Creek Nation was free from liability \n\n[248 U.S. 354, 358]\n\u00a0\n for injuries to persons or property due to mob violence or failure to keep the peace. Compare Louisiana v. Mayor of New Orleans, \n109 \nU.S. 285, 287\n, 291 S., 3 Sup. Ct. 211; South v. Maryland, 18 How. 396; Murdock Grate Co. v. Commonwealth, 152 Mass. 28, 31, 24 N. E. 854, 8 L. R. A. 399. Such liability is frequently imposed by statute upon cities and counties (see City of Chicago v. Pennsylvania Co., 119 Fed. 497, 57 C. C. A. 509); but neither Congress nor the Creek Nation had dealt with the subject by any legislation prior to 1908. The fundamental obstacle to recover is not the immunity of a sovereign to suit, but the lack of a substantive right to recover the damages resulting from failure of a government or its officers to keep the peace. And the participation in the injuries of an officer acting, not colore officii, but in open and known violation of the law, cannot alter the case. The claimant's contention that the defendant owed to the claimant, as its own grantee, a greater duty than it owed to other persons in the territory, to protect him against mob violence, finds no support in reason or authority.\n Second. The special act of May 29, 1908, did not impose any liability upon the Creek Nation. The tribal government had been dissolved. Without authorization from Congress, the Nation could not then have been sued in any court; at least without its consent. The Court of Claims is 'authorized to consider and adjudicate and render judgment as law and equity may require.' The words of the act which follow merely identify the claims which the court is authorized to consider. Authority to sue the Creek Nation is implied; but there is nothing in the act which even tends to indicate a purpose to create a new substantive right. Compare United States v. Mille Lac Chippewas, \n229 \nU.S. 498, 500\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 811; Green v. Menominee Tribe, \n233 \nU.S. 558, 568\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 706; Thompson v. United States, \n246 U.S. 547\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 349. The act simply provides a forum for the adjudication of such rights as Turner may have against the Creek Nation. \n\n[248 U.S. 354, 359]\n\u00a0\n Third. The United States objected also to the jurisdiction of the court over it. Neither the special act nor any general statute authorized suit against the United States. As it cannot be sued without its consent, the United States was improperly joined as a party defendant, although in the capacity of trustee for the Creek Nation. Compare Green v. Menominee Tribe, supra.\n It is not necessary to consider the many other objections urged against the petition. The Court of Claims properly dismissed it; and the judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Treaty of June 14, 1866, art.

Dean Burkheimer and Charles E. Shepard, both of Seattle, Wash., James R. Caton, of Alexandria, Va., and A. A. Hoehling, Jr., Stanton C. Peelle, and C. F. R. Ogilby, all of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Nebeker, for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petition for mandamus to require the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of the General Land Office \n\n[250 U.S. 549, 550]\n\u00a0\n to approve and pass to patent the application of the petitioner for certain coal claims, or to show cause why they have not done so.\n Respondents replied that they are constituted by law the sole agents of the government in the administration and disposal of the public lands by and through the means appointed by Congress and have exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of all claims or applications to enter or acquire any part of them, and that the discharge of that duty involves judgment and discretion.\n And further replied that petitioner sought to acquire title to the coal claims under the Act of April 28, 1904, c. 1772, 33 Stat. 525 (Comp. St.  5071-5074), and the Act of May 28, 1908, c. 211, 35 Stat. 424 (Comp. St.  5075-5078), by virtue of the locations set out in the petition. That the locations came on to be heard and that they, respondents, after considering all of the evidence and applying the law thereto, found and determined that the locations involved were invalid, the locators not having opened or improved any mine or mines of coal on any of the tracts of land in controversy, as required by the cited statutes, and that petitioner was not entitled to purchase the same, and thereupon respondents in the exercise of their discretion and judgment rejected the application.\n Hence they prayed that the rule against them be discharged and the petition dismissed.\n Petitioner demurred to the reply on the ground that it did not set forth any substantial or legal defense. The demurrer was overruled, and, petitioner electing to stand upon it, the rule to show cause was discharged and the petition dismissed. The judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.\n The question in the case, therefore, is direct, that is, the power of the Land Office under the cited statutes and the facts recited in the petition. This power, we may say at the outset, necessarily is something more than ministerial, the mere yielding to and registry of any demand, \n\n[250 U.S. 549, 551]\n\u00a0\n and yet, on the other hand, not arbitrary, without statutory direction or regulation by settled rules and principles. In other words, the Land Office is like any other tribunal-its institution and purpose defining and measuring its power, the determining elements being those of fact and law, upon which necessarily judgment must be passed.\n What are the elements of fact and of law in the present case? As set forth in the petition they are these:\n Sections 2347 to 2352 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  4659-4664) provide for the entry of vacant coal lands, 160 acres to an individual, 320 acres to an association, who have opened and improved, or shall 'open and improve [italics ours], any coal mine or mines upon the public lands.' Section 2348\n\n\n These sections were extended to Alaska by an act passed June 6, 1900 ( 31 Stat. 658, c. 796), and the latter act was amended by the Act of April 28, 1904, supra, section 1 of which provides:\n'That any person or association of persons qualified to make entry under the coal land laws of the United States, who shall have opened or improved [italics ours] a coal mine or coal mines on any of the unsurveyed public lands of the United States in the district of Alaska, may locate the lands upon which such mine or mines are situated. ...'\n\n Section 2 of the act provides for the application for and issue of patent.\n The Act of May 28, 1908, provides for the consolidation of claims and their inclusion in a single claim. It is otherwise of no importance.\n It will be observed that the only substantial difference between the sections of the Revised Statutes and the act extending them to Alaska is that by the former the right of location is granted to one or those 'who have opened and improved' a mine or mines, and 'who have opened or improved' a mine or mines.\n Petitioner in great volume asserts locations under the \n\n[250 U.S. 549, 552]\n\u00a0\n Act of April 28, 1904, to which locations it has succeeded. The facts which locations it has succeeded. The facts concerning them are not in dispute; but whether what was done constituted an opening or improvement of mines, and constrained a decision other than that given by the Land Office, is in dispute.\n Eight locations were made, all of which were conveyed by the asserted locators to petitioner in March, 1909. Surveys were made of the locations, which surveys were duly examined and filed in the proper land office in Alaska; and in 1909 petitioner paid to the Treasurer of the United States $ 10 for each acre surveyed, in the aggregate $9,905.74, and made application to the then Secretary of the Interior through the local land office for a patent, tendering due proof of the locations of each applicant. Notice was posted.\n April 26, 1912, at the local land office (Juneau), under the direction of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, proceedings were instituted against the application of petitioner upon the ground, among others, that neither of the claimants prior to making the locations or at any time thereafter and prior to filing notice of the locations, opened or improved any mine or mines of coal on any of the tracts of land as required by the Act of April 28, 1904.\n Proofs were taken upon the charges, and the register and receiver sustained them and decided and recommended that the application for a patent be rejected.\n Upon an appeal to the Commissioner the decision of the local officers was approved after a circumstantial review of the case; and again, upon appeal from the Commissioner's decision, by the Secretary of the Interior.\n All of the officers decided that the acts of Congress contemplated as a basis of a valid location the opening and developing of a producing mine of coal and that work performed upon a claim for prospecting purposes does not fulfill the requirement. And that such was the character of the work done upon the claims in question was the de duction \n\n[250 U.S. 549, 553]\n\u00a0\n of the officers. 'Shallow surface cuts and openings' the work was denominated, and not made 'for the purpose of the opening or improving of a producing coal mine or mines.'\n The characterization, purpose and effect thus ascribed to the work of the claimants are contested, and it is insisted that the amount and effect of the work done constituted an opening and improving of mines and constrained an opposite conclusion and judgment from that of the Land Office, and it is insisted, indeed, that a contrary conclusion was constrained not only by the provisions of the statutes but by previous rulings of the department, under the assurance of which the locations were made and thereby acquired the quality of vested rights to be recognized by the issue of patent as a matter of course-an irresistible right, therefore, having legal remedy in mandamus. It is hence insisted that:\n'The respondent [Secretary of the Interior] and his said subordinates have erred, not in the facts, but in their interpretation and construction of the acts of Congress and of the law pertaining to coal mines in or under public lands of the United States in Alaska and to the rights of location, application and patent thereof by locators and their assigns ... and thereby exceeding his and their powers and jurisdiction.\n\n The contention is repeated in petitioner's brief in varicus ways and illustrations. Cases besides are cited with the assertion that in such situation there is no room for the exercise of 'discretion,' but that it is the imperative duty of the Secretary to issue a patent, the right to it having become vested.\n Undoubtedly there may be cases in which rights had actually accrued and nothing remained to the Secretary but their recognition, and counsel have collected and urged such as they deem in point;1 but the present case lacks \n\n[250 U.S. 549, 554]\n\u00a0\n their essential condition. The decision of the local land officers and that of the Commissioner and Secretary disproves the assumption that counsel make that there was only an interpretation and construction of the acts of Congress. On the contrary there was a painstaking consideration and review of the evidence and a determination of its probative strength, and the deduction was that what was done was for prospecting purposes merely and did not satisfy the requirements of the acts of Congress-a purpose to open or improve a mine or mines. And necessarily there is a difference in the purposes, a difference between a mere discovery or exposition of a vein of mineral and its development. Counsel's contention confounds the difference and insists that it is established by the rulings in prior cases in the department that a mine is opened or improved by an 'actual excavation of the earth, whether by open cut or tunnel, so as to expose a vein of coal, which is the coal mine.' And this, it is contended, has become a principle of decision and has the insistent quality of stare decisis-commanding a specific conclusion, superseding by its automatism any discretionary function in the land officers.\n It is not necessary to review the cases. It is enough to say that they have not the inflexibility ascribed to them. And this can be illustrated. Counsel speak of exposition of a vein by a 'cut or tunnel.' How deep or extensive must either be to invoke the principle? And is the principle confined to such or is it applicable whatever the kind or extent of the work-by any disturbance of the surface or without any disturbance if the vein be above the sur \n\n[250 U.S. 549, 555]\n\u00a0\n face? Manifestly judgment in all cases must be exercised-judgment not only of the law but what was done under the law, and its sufficiency to avail of the grant of the law.\n In Riverside Oil Co. v. Hitchcock, \n190 U.S. 316\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 698, it was said that Congress has constituted the Land Department the administrator of the public lands and for the discharge of this duty invested it with judicial functions which are not subject to review by injunction or mandamus. This was repeated and applied in Ness v. Fisher, \n223 U.S. 683\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 356.\n Counsel contest the application of these cases and distinguish them from that at bar by the difference between ministerial and judicial action, and assert:\n'That the Secretary has essentially altered the law by converting the essential terms of it, upon which our rights are based, to terms of another meaning, and that that is an arbitrary act which the courts can control and overrule.'\n\n If the accusation were true the conclusion might follow; but the accusation is not true. We rest on this declaration. It would extend this opinion too much to trace through the ingenuity of counsel's reasoning in a very long brief and the citation and analysis of many cases the distinction they rely on, that is, the distinction between formal and discretionary action. Undoubtedly there is that distinction. Lane, Secy., v. Hoglund, \n244 U.S. 174\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 558. But where there is discretion, as we think there is in this case, even though its conclusion be disputable, it is impregnable to mandamus. Riverside Oil Co. v. Hitchcock and Ness v. Fisher, supra.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Cudney v. Flannery, 1 L. D. 165; M., K. & T. Ry. v. Buck (L. D. unreported); Miner v. Mariott, 2 L. D. 709; Milne v.

After receiving more than $50,000 the Trust Company became insolvent, and in September, 1909, refused to honor a proper demand therefor. The state sued the surety in one of its own courts, December 24, 1909, and judgment there for full amount of the bond was affirmed by the Supreme Court October 9, 1917. 168 Pac. 234.\n The cause is here on writ of error, and jurisdiction of this court is challenged upon the ground that the suit is not one 'where is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under the United States, and the decision is against their validity; or where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised under any state, on the ground of their being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of their validity.' Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231)  237, 36 Stat. 1156, as amended by Act Sept. 6, 1916, c. 448,  2, 39 Stat. 726 (Comp. St. 1918,  1214). We think the point well taken, and the writ must be dismissed.\n In support of our jurisdiction it is said:\n'The case is properly here by writ of error because it involves the validity of legislation of the state of Oklahoma alleged by the plaintiff in error to impair the obligation of its contract.'\n\n But we have often held that mere assertion of a claim in respect of some constitutional right is not sufficient; there must be a real and substantial controversy of the required character which deserves serious consideration. Ennis Waterworks v. City of Ennis, \n233 \nU.S. 652, 658\n, 34 S. Sup.

Section 9, c. 22, Session Laws 1913.\n\n It provides:\n'No deposit in a state bank, otherwise secured, shall be protected by, or paid out of, the depostitors' guaranty fund created under the laws of the state of Oklahoma, nor included in the computation of average daily deposits as a basis for assessments. No deposit in any state bank, on which a greater rate of interest is allowed or paid, either directly or indirectly, than is permitted by the rules of the bank commissioner, shall participate in the benefits of the guaranty fund.'\n\n The opinion of the Supreme Court makes no reference to the Act of March 6, 1913, and we can discover no plausible basis for the argument that, notwithstanding such omission, force and effect was really given thereto-that it must have been the basis of the decision. The court approved, and undertook to support its conclusion by former opinions, commencing with Columbia Bank & Trust Co. v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 33 Okl. 535, 126 Pac. 556, decided in 1912, which, it declared, show a consistent view contrary to the position maintained by plaintiff in error. And an examination of these opinions leaves no doubt that they are relevant and tend to uphold the doctrine applied in the present cause.

While these were in force, by Act or August 24, 1912, c. 389 (37 Stat. 557), Congress directed establishment of the parcel post service without providing for any additional compensation on account of the large increase in weights which would surely follow.\n The Postmaster General called attention to the matter January 20, 1913; and after much consideration the following clause was incorporated in the Act of March 4, 1913, c. 143 (37 Stat. 791, 797 [Comp.

Appellee sued for the difference between amount actually received and what it would have received if five per centum had been added. Considering history of the legislation and intent of Congress supposed to be indicated thereby the Court of Claims held that the act--\n'required the Postmaster General to add 5 per cent. to the compensation being paid on all of said routes, and he having failed to do so that the plaintiff is entitled to recover the difference sued for.' Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. United States, 52 Ct. Cl. 338, 361. \n\n[249 U.S. 451, 454]\n\u00a0\n We are unable to agree with this conclusion. The language of the enactment is clear and we think it vested in the Postmaster general a discretion which, so far as shown General a discretion which, so far as shown not unmindful of the burden imposed upon appellee nor of the circumstances which lend color to a different conclusion; but these are not sufficient to justify a disregard of the plain import of the words which Congress deliberately adopted.\n\n The judgment below must be reversed and the cause remanded with direction to dismiss the petition.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\n\n\n","207":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. BABCOCK(1919)\nNo. 708\nArgued: April 15, 1919Decided: June 2, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 328, 329]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for the United States.\n Mr. George A. King, of Washington, D. C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases, which were argued together, are appeals by the United States from judgments entered in the Court of Claims. In each an officer in the army recovered compensation under the Act of March 3, 1885, c. 335, 23 Stat. 350 (Comp. St.  6403), for the loss, while in the service, without fault or negligence on his part, of privately owned personal property. In each case the claim had been duly presented within two years of the occurrence of the loss, and the Secretary of War had decided that the articles in question were 'reasonable, useful, necessary, and proper for' such officer 'while in quarters, engaged in the public service, in the line of duty.'\n In the Babcock Case the horse of a captain stationed at the Presidio died in 1910 of strangulation because the government furnished as the forage ration barley with the awns on it. In the Hayden Case, a lieutenant stationed at Texas City, Tex., lost in 1915 his personal effects during a hurricane and inundation, while he was endeavoring to save the property of the government and of others as well as his own. The claim for the horse had been disallowed by the Auditor of the War Department on the ground that 'the death of officer's horse was not caused by any exigency of the service, nor from a cause incident to or produced by the military service.' He had disallowed the claim for the personal effects because 'the \n\n[250 U.S. 328, 330]\n\u00a0\n property was not lost or destroyed by being shipped on an unseaworthy vessel, nor by reason of the claimant giving his attention to saving property belonging to the United States,' and the Auditor's decision was affirmed on appeal by the Comptroller of the Treasury. The Auditor made no finding as to the value of the property lost. This was fixed by the Court of Claims at $200 for the horse and $333 for the personal effects; and for these amounts it entered judgments on the authority of Newcomber v. United States, 51 Ct. Cl. 408, and Andrews v. United States, 52 Ct. Cl. 373. The loss in each case occurred prior to April 5, 1917, so that the rights of the parties are not affected by the provisions of the Act of March 28, 1918, c. 28, 40 Stat. 459, 479, 480, or chapter VI of the Act of July 9, 1918, c. 143, 40 Stat. 845, 880, 881.\n The questions whether the Act of March 3, 1885 authorizes recovery for horses under any circumstances and under what circumstances it authorizes recovery for other personal property have long been the subject of controversy in the Auditing Department and in that of the Comptroller of the Treasury. See 20 Decisions of the Comptroller, 238. But here we are confronted with the preliminary inquiry: Has Congress conferred upon the Court of Claims jurisdiction to determine in any case whether recovery may be had under that statute for an article lost or destroyed? The right asserted is based upon the provision which declares:\n'That the proper accounting officers of the Treasury be, and they are hereby, authorized and directed to examine into, ascertain, and determine the value of the private property belonging to officers and enlisted men in the military service of the United States which has been, or may hereafter be, lost or destroyed in the military service, under the following circumstances: ...' and that 'the amount of such loss so ascertained and determined shall be paid out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise \n\n[250 U.S. 328, 331]\n\u00a0\n appropriated, and shall be in full for all such loss or damage.'\n\n These general rules are well settled: (1) That the United States, when it creates rights in individuals against itself, is under no obligation to provide a remedy through the courts. United States ex rel. Dunlap v. Black, \n128 U.S. 40\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 12; Ex parte Atocha, 17 Wall. 439; Gordon v. United States, 7 Wall. 188, 195; De Groot v. United States, 5 Wall. 419, 431, 433; Comegys v. Vasse, 1 Pet. 193, 212. (2) That where a statute creates a right and provides a special remedy, that remedy is exclusive. Wilder Manufacturing Co. v. Corn Products Co., \n236 \nU.S. 165, 174\n, 175 S., 35 Sup. Ct. 398, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 118; Arnson v. Murphy, \n109 U.S. 238\n, 3 Sup. Ct. 184; Barnet v. National Bank, \n98 U.S. 555\n, 558; Farmers' & Mechanics' National Bank v. Dearing, \n91 U.S. 29\n, 35. Still the fact that the right and the remedy are thus intertwined might not, if the provision stood alone, require us to hold that the remedy expressly given excludes a right of review by the Court of Claims, where the decision of the special tribunal involved no disputed question of fact and the denial of compensation was rested wholly upon the construction of the act. See Medbury v. United States, \n173 \nU.S. 492, 198\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 503; Parish v. MacVeagh, \n214 U.S. 124\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 556; McLean v. United States, \n226 U.S. 374\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 122; United States v. Laughlin (No. 200), \n249 U.S. 440\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 340, decided April 14, 1919. But here Congress has provided:\n'That any claim which shall be presented and acted on under authority of this act shall be held as finally determined, and shall never thereafter be reopened or considered.'\n\n These words express clearly the intention to confer upon the Treasury Department exclusive jurisdiction and to make its decision final. The case of United States v. Harmon, \n147 U.S. 268\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 327, strongly relied upon by claimants, has no application. Compare D. M. Ferry & Co. v. United States, 85 Fed. 550, 557, 29 C. C. A. 345.\n In the Babcock Case claimant insists also that section 3482 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  6390), as amended by Act of June 22, \n\n[250 U.S. 328, 332]\n\u00a0\n 1874, c. 395, 18 Stat. 193 (Comp. St.  6391, 6392) affords a basis for the recovery. That section provided for reimbursement for horses lost in the military service, among other things 'in consequence of the United States failing to supply sufficient forage.' The 1874 amendment provided for reimbursement in any case 'where the loss resulted from any exigency or necessity of the military service, unless it was caused by the fault or negligence of such officers or enlisted men.' Even if these statutes were applicable to facts like those presented here, there could be no recovery; because under Act Jan. 9, 1883, c. 15, 22 Stat. 401, and Act Aug. 13, 1888, c. 868, 25 Stat. 437, the right to present claims under section 3482 of the Revised Statutes as amended finally expired in 1891. See Griffis v. United States, 52 Ct. Cl. 1, 170.\n The Court of Claims was without jurisdiction in either case, and the judgments are Reversed. \n\n\n\n","208":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. BROOKLYN EASTERN DIST TERMINAL(1919)\nNo. 155\nArgued: January 20, 1919Decided: March 24, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[249 U.S. 296, 297]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for the United states.\n Mr. Henry B. Closson, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n[249 U.S. 296, 299]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Hours of Service Act (Act March 4, 1907, c. 2939, 34 Stat. 1415 [ Comp. St.  8677, 8678])1 prohibits any common carrier by railroad en gaged \n\n[249 U.S. 296, 300]\n\u00a0\n in interstate commerce from requiring or permitting an employe to remain on duty for a longer period than 16 consecutive hours. For alleged violation of this provision, proceedings were brought against the Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of New York. The defendant contended that it was not a common carrier; that it was not engaged in interstate commerce by railroad; and that its employes were not 'connected with the movement of any train.' Upon facts which were agreed the trial court entered judgment for the government. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judgment on the ground that, while the Terminal was engaged in interstate commerce and the employment in question was connected with the movement of trains, it was not a common carrier. Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal v. United States, 239 Fed. 287, 152 C. C. A. 275. The case comes here on writ of certiorari (\n243 U.S. 647\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 475); and the substantial question before us is whether the Terminal is within the scope of the Hours of Service Act, as being a common carrier. The essential facts are these:\n\n 1. \nThe Terminal is a navigation corporation with an authorized capital stock of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), incorporated under section 10 of article 3 of the Transportation Corporations Law of the state of New York (Consol. Laws, c. 63) which reads as follows:\n'Seven or more persons may become a corporation, for the purpose of building for their own use, equipping, furnishing, fitting, purchasing, chartering, navigating, or \n\n[249 U.S. 296, 301]\n\u00a0\n owning steam, sail, or other boats, ships, vessels or other property to be used in any lawful business, trade, commerce, or navigation upon the ocean, or any seas, sounds, lakes, rivers, canals, or other waterways, and for the carriage, transportation, or storing or lading, freight, mails, property, or passengers thereon.'\n\n In its certificate of incorporation, the corporate powers and purposes of the defendant are stated as follows:\n'The purposes for which it is formed are to build for its own use, equip, furnish, fit, purchase, charter, navigate, and own steam, sail, and other boats, ships, vessels, and other property to be used in the business of carrying, transporting, storing, and lading merchandise in New York Harbor and the waters adjacent thereto and connected therewith and the territory bordering thereon.'\n\n\n 2. \nThe Terminal operates a union freight station at Brooklyn under individual contracts with ten interstate railroads and several steamship companies. From the railroads it receives both carload and less than carload freight and transports the same from their termini to its Brooklyn docks. There, the cars containing such freight are hauled from the car floats by its locomotives and placed for unloading either on its team tracks or at its freight houses. The Terminal receives likewise from shippers both carload and less than carload outgoing freight originating at Brooklyn and consigned to points upon the various railroads with which it has contracts. The cars carrying this outgoing freight are then switched and loaded by its locomotives upon its floats and transported by its tugs to the docks of the several railroads.\n\n 3. \nFor its services in handling freight as above set forth the Terminal is paid not by the shipper or consignee, but by the railroad or steamship company upon whose account the transportation service is performed, at the rate of 3 cents per 100 pounds of freight moving to or from points east of the western termini of said railroads, and 4 1\/5 cents \n\n[249 U.S. 296, 302]\n\u00a0\n per 100 pounds on freight moving to or from points beyond such termini. Upon prepaid shipments from shippers not on the credit lists of the railroads it collects from the shipper at Brooklyn the money and charges for the transportation of such freight from that point to its final destination; and also collects from the consignee at Brooklyn the charges for the transportation of such freight from its point of origin to that place, when such charges have not been prepaid. The freight moneys and charges so received by the defendant from shippers or consignees are accounted for and paid over by it without deduction to the railroads or steamship lines upon whose account they are collected.\n\n 4. \nThe Terminal does not hold itself out as a common carrier; nor does it file with the Interstate Commerce Commission any tariffs or concurrences with tariffs, or copies of the contracts with the common carriers by whom it is paid for the transportation of freight, as heretofore set forth. The terminal at Brooklyn is designated by such railroads and rail and water lines, in the tariffs filed by them with the Interstate Commerce Commission, as one of their receiving and delivering stations for freight in the port of New York; and through bills of lading to such terminal as such station are issued by them on freight to be delivered there. For all freight originating at Brooklyn bills of lading of the railroad or steamship line to which the freight is to be delivered are there issued to the shipper by one of the defendant's employes, who is duly authorized to issue such bills of lading by the railroad or steamship line by which the freight is to be transported to its final destination or destinations after the same is delivered to such railroad or steamship line by defendant.\n\n 5. \nThe tracks of the Terminal which extend from its float bridges to several warehouses, coal pockets, platforms, and team tracks have an aggregate length of 8 1\/3 miles. One track connecting its several dock and delivery \n\n[249 U.S. 296, 303]\n\u00a0\n tracks which is kept clear for operating its switching engines is about one mile in length. The length of haul effected by its locomotives in moving cars between its float bridges and warehouses, platforms, pockets, and team tracks varies from a few yards to nearly a mile. The number of cars so hauled as part of a movement varies from a single car to eight cars. As an incident to such movement its locomotives hauling cars cross a public street in Brooklyn.\n\n 6. \nDefendant owns or hires no cars itself, and no cars, except the ones heretofore mentioned, are ever moved over its tracks. For the use of such cars defendant pays no charges; and except by the switching service heretofore described, it transports freight only by water. It handles interstate and intrastate freight indiscriminately, the larger part being interstate. It transports no passengers.\n\n 7. \nIn connection with the movement of one or more cars between the floats and the loading tracks, warehouses, and team or delivery tracks, defendant employs four to eight switching crews during the day and two at night, each crew consisting of a conductor, engineer and two or more brakemen.\n The Hours of Service Act declares (in the first section) that:\n'The term 'railroad' as used in this act shall include all bridges and ferries used or operated in connection with any railroad, and also all the road in use by any common carrier operating a railroad, whether owned or operated under a contract, agreement, or lease.'\n\n Hence, neither the character of the Terminal's railroad nor its independent ownership excludes it from the scope of the act. But the Terminal contends that it is not subject to the provisions of the statute, since it is not incorporated as a common carrier and does not hold itself out as such; does not file tariffs; and does not undertake to transport property for all who may apply to have their goods transported; but merely transports as agent such freight as is delivered to \n\n[249 U.S. 296, 304]\n\u00a0\n it by or for those carriers, and those only, with whom it has elected to make special contracts; and that, under these contracts it performs for the railroads, and not for the public, a part of the whole carriage which they, as common carriers, have undertaken with the shipper to perform.\n We need not undertake a definition of the term 'common carrier' for all purposes. Nor are we concerned with questions of corporate power or of duties to shippers, which frequently compel nice distinctions between public and private carriers. We have merely to determine whether Congress, in declaring the Hours of Service Act applicable 'to any common carrier or carriers, their officers, agents, and employes, engaged in the transportation of passengers or property by railroad,' made its prohibitions applicable to the Terminal and its employes engaged in the operations here involved. The answer to that question does not depend upon whether its charter declares it to be a common carier, nor upon whether the state of incorporation considers it such; but upon what it does. Terminal Taxicab Co. v. District of Columbia, \n241 \nU.S. 252, 254\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 583, Ann. Cas. 1916D, 765.\n The relation of the Terminal to the several railroads is substantially the same as that of the terminal considered in United States v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., \n225 U.S. 306\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 817; \n231 \nU.S. 274, 288\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 75. The transportation performed by the railroads begins and ends at the Terminal. Its docks and warehouses are public freight stations of the railroads. These with its car floats, even if not under common ownership or management, are used as an integral part of each railroad line, like the stockyards in United States v. Union Stockyard, \n226 U.S. 286\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 83, and the wharfage facilities in Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n219 U.S. 498\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 279. They are clearly unlike private plant facilities. Compare Tap Line Cases, \n234 \nU.S. 1, 25\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 741. The services rendered by the Terminal are public in their \n\n[249 U.S. 296, 305]\n\u00a0\n nature; and of a kind ordinarily performed by a common carrier. If these terminal operations were conducted directly by any, or jointly by all, of the ten railroad companies with which the Terminal has contracts, the operations would clearly be within the scope of the Hours of Service Law. The evils sought to be remedied exist equally, whether the terminal operations are conducted by the railroad companies themselves or by the Terminal as their agent; and whether the Terminal acts only as such agent for railroads or undertakes in addition to transport on its own account goods for shippers. The precise question presented is, therefore, whether the fact that the Terminal conducts these operations, not as an integral part of a single railroad system but wholly as an agent for one or several, exempts the railroad companies, because they are not the employer and exempts the Terminal, because it is not a common carrier; thus making inapplicable a provision regarding the physical operation of the property devised for the protection of employes and the public.\n One who transports property from place to place over a definite route as agent for a common carrier may, under conceivable circumstances, be a private carrier. But what is there in the facts above recited to endow the Terminal with that character? The service which it performs is distinctly public in character; that is, conveying between Brooklyn and points on any of the ten interstate carriers and their connections all property that is offered. The fact that the railroad of the Terminal is short does not prevent it from being a common carrier; United States v. Sioux City Stockyards Co. (C. C.) 162 Fed. 556; nor does the fact that the thing which it undertakes to carry is contained only in cars furnished by the railroad companies with which it has contracts. Railroads, whose only service is hauling cars for other railroads, have been held liable as common carriers under the Safety Appliance Acts March 2, 1893, c. 196, 27 Stat. 531, Comp. St.  8605-8612; Act March 2, 1903, c. 976, 32 Stat. 943, Comp. St.  8613-8615; Act April 14, 1910, c. 160, 36 Stat. 298, Comp. St .  8617-8623 \n\n[249 U.S. 296, 306]\n\u00a0\n (Union Stockyards Co. of Omaha v. United States, 169 Fed. 404, 94 C. C. A. 626; Belt Railway Co. of Chicago v. United States, 168 Fed. 542, 93 C. C. A. 666, 22 L. R. A. [N. S.] 582); and under the Twenty-Eight Hour Law Act June 29, 1906, c. 3594, 34 Stat. 607, Comp. St.  8651-8654 (United States v. Sioux City Stockyards Co., supra).2\n What the Terminal contracts to transport, however, is not primarily cars, but their contents. Its compensation is measured not by the weight, size, or character of the car, but by the weight and the origin or destination of the goods carried therein. These goods the Terminal must, under its contracts with the railroad companies, receive and carry at the rates specified for all who offer them, as fully as the railroad companies do at their other stations. The incidental services performed by the Terminal in respect to these goods are also the same as those performed by the railroad companies at their other stations. For all freight originating at Brooklyn, it issues through bills of lading to destination. Upon prepaid shipments originating there, it collects from the shippers the charges for transportation from Brooklyn to final destination; except where shippers are on the credit lists of the railroad companies. Upon goods arriving over its line at Brooklyn, it collects from the consignees the charges from point of origin, unless these were prepaid. As the Terminal receives both from railroad companies and from shippers also less than carload freight, it doubtless performs the loading and unloading, as is done at other railroad stations; and for freight delivered at Brooklyn takes appropriate receipts. In no respects, therefore, does the service actually performed by the Terminal for or in respect to shippers differ from that performed by the railroad companies at their other stations. True, the service is performed by the Terminal under contracts with the railroad companies as agent for them and not on its own account. But a common carrier does not cease to be \n\n[249 U.S. 296, 307]\n\u00a0\n such merely because the services which it renders to the public are performed as agent for another. The relation of connecting carriers with the initial carrier is frequently that of agent. See Bank of Kentucky v. Adams Express Co., \n93 U.S. 174\n. The relation of agency may preclude contractual obligations to the shippers, but it cannot change the obligations of the carrier concerning the physical operation of the railroad under the Hours of Service Act, which as this court has said, must be liberally construed to secure the safety of employes and the public. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. United States, \n244 U.S. 336\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 635, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 794.\n It is now admitted that the Terminal is engaged in interstate commerce; and it is clear that at least 'switching crews' engaged in moving at one time a locomotive with seven or eight cars between the docks and the warehouses or team tracks, a distance of nearly a mile, are engaged in the movement of a 'train.' The decisions under the Safety Appliance Acts depend upon the particular context in which the word 'train' there occurs, and are not here applicable. Compare United States v. Erie Railroad Co., \n237 \nU.S. 402, 407\n, 408 S., 35 Sup. Ct. 621\n\n\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and that of the District Court affirmed.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of March j, 1907, c. 2939, 34 Stat. 1415.\n'That the provisions of this act shall apply to any common carrier or carriers, their officers, agents, and employes, engaged in the transportation of passengers or property by railroad ... from one state ... to any other state. ...

It contained all the \n\n[250 U.S. 199, 201]\n\u00a0\n earmarks which would have been found in a genuine bill of lading.\n The second count charged the knowing, willful, and felonious uttering of the bill of lading, and, with criminal intent and knowledge, obtaining money on it from the Second National Bank of Cincinnati by using it as collateral.\n These first 2 counts are types of the remaining 22, except that the latter dealt with 11 other bills of lading as to each of which there were 2 counts, charging in the exact words used in the first and second counts, on the one hand the felonious fabricating and uttering of a bill of lading, and on the other hand the uttering and obtaining on the same bill of money from the Second National Bank of Cincinnati.\n There was a motion to quash all the counts based upon alleged defects in pleading with which we are not concerned, and by demurrer the failure of the indictment to charge an offense was asserted on these grounds:\n'First. That said Act of Congress ... approved August 29, 1916, is unconstitutional and void, especially section 41 of said act in so far as it attempts to make it a crime and punish any person who forges or counterfeits a bill of lading where no shipment from one state to another is made or intended.\n\n'Second. That said act can only apply to bills of lading representing actual shipments of merchandise or commerce between the states. If it is intended to apply to wholly fictitious shipments it is unconstitutional and void so far as said fictitious shipments are concerned, because the power of Congress to legislate upon this subject matter is based wholly and solely upon the commercial clause of the Constitution, and if there is no commerce, there is no jurisdiction.'\n\n The demurrer was sustained and all the counts in the indictment were dismissed (256 Fed. 388). The court said: \n\n[250 U.S. 199, 202]\n\u00a0\n 'It was agreed in the argument and assumed in the briefs of counsel that the so-called bills of lading were fictitious, in that there was no actual consignor or consignee and that they did not relate to any shipment or attempted shipment of corn whatsoever. This fact so agreed upon in open court is to be read into the indictments.'\n Dealing with the case thus made, the court observed:\n'These bogus bills of lading were nothing but pieces of paper, fraudulently inscribed to represent a real contract between real people and the actual receipt of goods for interstate shipment. ... That they were inscribed so as to purport to relate to interstate shipments was nothing else than a fraud upon such persons as innocently took them, as collateral or otherwise. The execution of them and their use for obtaining money under false pretenses was nothing other than a crime of a kind cognizable by the criminal legislation of the states, and a matter with which the Congress, in the exercise of its power to regulate commerce, is not concerned.'\n\n And upon these premises, after reviewing what were deemed to be the controlling authorities, it was concluded that the case--\n'must be decided in favor of the defendants, and the holding made that the Congress has not the power, under the commerce clause, to prescribe a punishment under the circumstances of this case, and if the Congress has sought to do so, the attempt is futile, because without authority.'\n\n Despite the hypothetical form in which this conclusion is expressed, the context of the opinion makes it certain that, reading the facts charged in the indictment in the light of the admissions made at the argument, the court construed the section of the statute as embracing such acts and decided that as thus construed it was void for repugnancy to the Constitution.\n At the outset confusion in considering the issue may result unless obscurity begotten by the form in which the \n\n[250 U.S. 199, 203]\n\u00a0\n contention is stated by dispelled. Thus both in the pleadings and in the contention as summarized by the court below it is insisted that, as there was and could be no commerce in a fraudulent and fictitious bill of lading, therefore the power of Congress to regulate commerce could not embrace such pretended bill. But this mistakenly assumes that the power of Congress is to be necessarily tested by the intrinsic existence of commerce in the particular subject dealt with, instead of by the relation of that subject to commerce and its effect upon it. We say mistakenly assumes, because we think it clear that if the proposition were sustained it would destroy the power of Congress to regulate, as obviously that power, if it is to exist, must include the authority to deal with obstructions to interstate commerce (In re Debs, \n158 U.S. 564\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 900) and with a host of other acts which, because of their relation to and influence upon interstate commerce, come within the power of Congress to regulate, although they are not interstate commerce in and of themselves. It would be superfluous to refer to the authorities which from the foundation of the government have measured the exertion by Congress of its power to regulate commerce by the principle just stated, since the doctrine is elementary and is but an expression of the text of the Constitution (article 1,  8, cl. 18). A case dealing with a somewhat different exercise of power, but affording a good illustration of the application of the principle to the subject in hand, is First National Bank v. Union Trust Co., \n244 U.S. 416\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 734, L. R. A. 1918C, 283, Ann. Cas. 1918D, 1169\n\n\n Although some of the forms of expression used in the opinion below might serve to indicate that the error just referred to had found lodgment in the mind of the court, the context of the opinion makes it certain that such was not the case, since the court left no obscurity in its statement of the issue which it decided, saying 'They [the fictitious bills of lading] did not affect commerce directly or indirectly. They did not obstruct or interfere \n\n[250 U.S. 199, 204]\n\u00a0\n with it in any manner and had nothing whatever to do with it, or with any existing instrumentality of it.'\n This statement not only clearly and accurately shows the question decided, but also with precision and directness points out the single and simple question which we must consider and dispose of in order to determine whether the court below erred in holding that the authority of Congress to regulate commerce did not embrace the power to forbid and punish the fraudulent fabrication and use of fictitious interstate bills of lading.\n That bills of lading for the movement of interstate commerce are instrumentalities of that commerce which Congress under its power to regulate commerce has the authority to deal with and provide for is too clear for anything but statement, as manifested not only by that which is concluded by prior decisions, but also by the exertion of the power by Congress. Nothing could better illustrate this latter view than do the general provisions of the act, the forty-first section of which is before us. See, also, Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3591,  7, 34 Stat. 584, 593 (U. S. Comp. St.  8604a, 8604aa); Act of June 18, 1910, 36 Stat. 546, c. 309,  7 (Comp. St.  8563); Almy v. California, 24 How. 169: Thames & Mersey Marine Ins. Co. v. United States, \n237 \nU.S. 19, 26\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 496, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 1087; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. Harold, \n241 \nU.S. 371, 378\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 665; Luckenbach v. McCahan Sugar Refining Co., \n248 U.S. 139\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 53; Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Co. v. Sealy, \n248 U.S. 363\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 97. That, as instrumentalities of interstate commerce, bills of lading are the efficient means of credit resorted to for the purpose of securing and fructifying the flow of a vast volume of interstate commerce upon which the commercial intercourse of the country, both domestic and foreign, largely depends, is a matter of common knowledge as to the course of business of which we may take judicial notice. Indeed, that such bills of lading and the faith and credit given to their genuineness and the value they represent are the producing and sustaining causes of the enormous number \n\n[250 U.S. 199, 205]\n\u00a0\n of transactions in domestic and foreign exchange is also so certain and well known that we may notice it without proof.\n With this situation in mind the question therefore is: Was the court below right in holding that Congress had no power to prohibit and punish the fraudulent making of spurious interstate bills of lading as a means of protecting and sustaining the vast volume of interstate commerce operating and moving in reliance upon genuine bills? To state the question is to manifest the error which the court committed, unless that view is overcome by the reasoning by which the conclusion below was sought to be sustained. What was that reasoning? That the bills were but 'pieces of paper fraudulently inscribed ... and did not affect commerce directly or indirectly ... and had nothing whatever to do with it or any existing instrumentality of it.' But this rests upon the unsustainable assumption that the undoubted power which existed to regulate the instrumentality, the genuine bill, did not give any power to prevent the fraudulent and spurious imitation. It proceeds further, as we have already shown, upon the erroneous theory that the credit and confidence which sustains interstate commerce would not be impaired or weakened by the unrestrained right to fabricate and circulate spurious bills of lading apparently concerning such commerce. Nor is the situation helped by saying that, as the manufacture and use of the spurious interstate commerce bills of lading were local, therefore the power to deal with them was exclusively local, since the proposition disregards the fact that the spurious bills were in the form of interstate commerce bills which in and of themselves involved the potentiality of fraud as far-reaching and all-embracing as the flow of the channels of interstate commerce in which it was contemplated the fraudulent bills would circulate. As the power to regulate the instrumentality was coextensive with interstate com \n\n[250 U.S. 199, 206]\n\u00a0\n merce, so it must be, if the authority to regulate is not to be denied, that the right to exert such authority for the purpose of guarding against the injury which would result from the making and use of spurious imitations of the instrumentality must be equally extensive.\n We fail to understand the danger to the powers of government of the several states which it is suggested must arise from sustaining the validity of the provisions of the act of Congress in question. On the contrary, we are of opinion that to deny the power asserted would be to depart from the text of the Constitution and to overthrow principles of interpretation which, as we have seen, have been settled since McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, and which in application have never been deviated from.\n This conclusion remains unshaken despite an examination of the decided cases cited by the court below in its opinion or which were pressed upon our attention in argument, since in our judgment they all but express the general principles of interpretation which we have applied and which are decisive against the contention of want of power in Congress which was upheld below and is here insisted upon.\n It follows that the judgment below was wrong. It must therefore be reversed, and the case be remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n And it is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY dissents. \n\n\n\n","211":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. GUDGER(1919)\nNo. 408\nArgued: December 11, 1918Decided: April 14, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for the United states.\n Mr. Joseph S. Graydon, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Virginia being a state which prohibits the manufacture or sale therein of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes, the defendant in error was indicted for having transported into that state an enumerated quantity of whisky in violation of the provision in section 5 of the Post Office Appropriation Act of March 3, 1917, known as the Reed Amendment. 39 Stat. 1058, 1069, c. 162 (Comp. St. 1918,  8739a). For the purposes of a motion to quash, the United States attorney furnished a bill of particulars of the evidence which the government intended to offer to sustain the indictment, and the defendant also made admissions which were recited in such bill. The motion to quash, as elucidated \n\n[249 U.S. 373, 374]\n\u00a0\n by the bill of particulars, was granted on the ground that the statute, when rightly construed, did not embrace the acts charged. The United States prosecutes error.\n The case stated by the court below is this:\n'That the defendant was a passenger on a railroad train from Baltimore, Md., to Asheville, N. C., and that while the train was temporarily stopped at the station at Lynchburg, Va., he was arrested, his baggage examined, and it was found that he had in his valise some seven quarts or more of whisky. The particulars show clearly that the evidence will be that he had no intention of leaving the train at Lynchburg or at any other point in Virginia, and that his sole intention was to carry the liquor with him into the state of North Carolina to be there used as a beverage.'\n\n In addition to these facts we observe that the bill of particulars contained this recital:\n'The charge in the indictment that the defendant caused to be transported liquor to Lynchburg, in the state of Virginia, has no other foundation than the fact that he was arrested while the train was stopped at the railroad station at Lynchburg, Va., and while he was en route to Asheville, N. C.'\n\n The bill stated besides, that the accused was traveling on a through ticket from Baltimore to Asheville and return.\n Under this state of facts we think the court was clearly right in quashing the indictment, as we are of opinion that there is no ground for holding that the prohibition of the statute against transporting liquor in interstate commerce 'into any state or territory the laws of which state or territory prohibit the manufacture,' etc., includes the movement in interstate commerce through such a state to another. No elucidation of the text is needed to add cogency to this plain meaning, which would, however, be reinforced by the context if there were need \n\n[249 U.S. 373, 375]\n\u00a0\n to resort to it, since the context makes clear that the word 'into,' as used in the statute, refers to the state of destination, and not to the means by which that end is reached, the movement through one state as a mere incident of transportation to the state into which it is shipped.\n The suggestion made in argument that, although the personal carriage of liquor through one state as a means of carrying it beyond into another state violates the statute, it does not necessarily follow that transportation by common carrier through a state for a like purpose would be such violation, because of the more facile opportunity in the one case than in the other for violating the law of the state through which the liquor is carried, is without merit. In last analysis it but invites, not a construction of the statute as enacted, but an enactment by construction of a new and different statute.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","212":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. HILL(1919)\nNo. 357\nArgued: Decided: January 13, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[248 U.S. 420, 421]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for the United states.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a writ of error bringing in review under the Criminal Appeals Act March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246 (Comp. St.  1704) the judgment of the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of West Virginia sustaining a demurrer and motion to quash an indictment against one Dan Hill. The indictment charged that Hill on the 20th of November, 1917, being in the state of Kentucky, there intended to go and be carried by means of a common carrier, engaged in interstate commerce, from the state of Kentucky into the state of West Virginia, and intended to carry upon his person, as a beverage, for his personal use, a quantity of intoxicating liquor, to wit, one quart thereof, into the state of West \n\n[248 U.S. 420, 422]\n\u00a0\n Virginia, and did in the state of Kentucky purchase and procure a quantity of intoxicating liquor, to wit, one quart thereof, contained in bottles, and did then and there board a certain trolley car, being operated by a common carrier corporation engaged in interstate commerce, and by means thereof did cause himself and the said intoxicating liquor, then upon his person, to be carried and transported in interstate commerce into the state of West Virginia. It is charged that Hill violated the Act of Congress approved March 3, 1917, commonly known as the Reed Amendment, by thus cartying in interstate commerce from Kentucky to West Virginia a quantity of intoxicating liquor as a beverage for his personal use, the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes being then prohibited by the laws of the state of West Virginia; further that the intoxicating liquor was not ordered, purchased, or caused to be transported for scientific, sacramental, medicinal, or mechanical purposes.\n The Reed Amendment is a part of section 5 of the Post Office Appropriation Act approved March 3, 1917, 39 Stat. 1058, 1069, c. 162 ( Comp. St. 1918,  8739a) and reads as follows:\n'... Whoever shall order, purchase, or cause intoxicating liquors to be transported in interstate commerce, except for scientific, sacramental, medicinal, and mechanical purposes, into any state or territory the laws of which state or territory prohibit the manufacture or sale therein of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes shall be punished as aforesaid: Provided, that nothing herein shall authorize the shipment of liquor into any state contrary to the laws of such state. ...'\n\n The ground of decision, as appears by the opinion of the District Court, was that the phrase, 'transported in interstate commerce,' as used in the act, was intended to mean and apply only to liquor transported for commercial purposes. This conclusion was reached from a \n\n[248 U.S. 420, 423]\n\u00a0\n construction of the act when read in the light of other legislation of Congress upon the subject of interstate transportation of liquor. Attention was called to the terms of the Wilson Act of Aug. 8, 1890, c. 728, 26 Stat. 313 (Comp. St.  8738), providing that intoxicating liquors transported into any state or territory, or remaining therein for use, consumption, sale or storage, shall be subject on the arrival therein to the operation of the laws of the state or territory enacted in the exercise of the police power. Reference was also made to the subsequent legislation known as the Webb-Kenyon Act of March 1, 1913, c. 90, 37 Stat. 699 (Comp. St.  8739), prohibiting the shipment and transportation of intoxicating liquor from one state into another state when such liquor is intended to be received, possessed, sold or used in violation of the laws of such state. Advertence was made to the fact that the provisions of both the Wilson and Webb-Kenyon Acts apply broadly to the interstate transportation of liquors whether for commercial use or otherwise. It was concluded that Congress in the enactment of the Reed Amendment intended to aid the local law of the state by preventing shipment of intoxicating liquors in interstate commerce when intended for commercial purposes; and as the law of West Virginia permits any person to bring into the state not more than one quart of liquor, in any period of thirty days, for personal use, Congress did not intend to prohibit interstate transportation of such liquors not intended to be used for commercial purposes. We are of opinion that this is a too narrow construction of the Reed Amendment.\n The Constitution confers upon Congress commerce.' International Text- book Co. v. states. From an early day such commerce has been held to include the transportation of persons and property no less than the purchase, sale and exchange of commodities. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 188; Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n114 \nU.S. 196, 203\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 826. 'Importation into one state from another \n\n[248 U.S. 420, 424]\n\u00a0\n is the indispensable element, the test, of interstate commerce.' International Text-book Co. .v.

The transportation of one's own goods from state to state is interstate commerce, and, as such, subject to the regulatory power of Congress. Pipe Line Cases, \n234 \nU.S. 548, 560\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 956. The transportation of liquor upon the person of one being carried in interstate commerce is within the well-established meaning of the words 'interstate commerce.' United States v. Chavez, \n228 \nU.S. 525, 532\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 595.\n Congress in the passage of the Reed Amendment must be presumed to have had, and in our opinion undoubtedly did have, in mind this well-known and often declared meaning of interstate commerce. It had already provided in the Wilson Act for state control over liquor after its delivery to the consignee in interstate commerce. In the Webb-Kenyon Act it had prohibted the shipment of liquor in interstate commerce where the same was to be used in violation of the law of the state into which it was transported. In the passage of the Reed Amendment it was intended to take another step in legislation under the authority of the commerce cause (article 1,  8, cl. 3). The meaning of the act must be found in the language in which it is expressed, when, as here, there is no ambiguity in the terms of the law. The order, purchase, or transportation in interstate commerce, save for certain excepted purposes, is forbidden. The exceptions are specific and are those for scientific, sacramental, medicinal, or mechanical purposes; and in the proviso it is set forth that nothing contained in the act shall authorize interstate commerce shipments into a state contrary to its laws.\n West Virginia is a state in which the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes is prohibited. If the act is within the constitutional authority of Congress, it follows that the indictment charged an offense within the terms of the law. That Congress possesses \n\n[248 U.S. 420, 425]\n\u00a0\n supreme authority to regulate interstate commerce subject only to the limitations of the Constitution, is too well established to require the citation of the numerous cases in this court which have so held. Congress may exercise this authority in aid of the policy of the state, if it sees fit to do so. It is equally clear that the policy of Congress acting independently of the states may induce legislation without reference to the particular policy or law of any given state. Acting within the authority conferred by the Constitution it is for Congress to determine what legislation will attain its purposes. The control of Congress over interstate commerce is not to be limited by state laws. Congress, and not the states, is given the authority to regulate interstate commerce. When Congress acts, keeping within the authority committed to it, its laws become by the terms of the Constitution itself the supreme laws of the land.\n'This is not to say that the nation may deal with the internal concerns of the state, as such, but that the execution by Congress of its constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce is not limited by the fact that intrastate transactions may have become so interwoven therewith that the effective government of the former incidentally controls the latter. This conclusion necessarily results from the supremacy of the national power within its appointed sphere.' Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 399\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 729, 739 (57 L. Ed. 1511, 48 L. R. A. [N. S.] 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18), and previous decisions of this court therein cited.\n\n The power of Congress, it is true, is to regulate commerce, which is ordinarily accomplished by prescribing rules for its conduct. That regulation may take the character of prohibition, in proper cases, is well established by the decisions of this court. Lottery Case, supra; Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, \n220 U.S. 45\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 364; Hoke v. United States, \n227 U.S. 308\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 281, 43 L. R. A. (N. S.) 906, Ann. Cas. 1916E, 905; Caminetti v.

Ct. 529. \n\n[248 U.S. 420, 426]\n\u00a0\n That Congress has this authority over the transportation of liquor in interstate commerce, we entertain no doubt. In the recent case of Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland Railroad Co., supra, this subject was given full consideration. That case involved the constitutionality of the Webb-Kenyon Law, prohibiting the shipment of liquors into states to be used therein in violation of the local law. While such was the particular case before the court, the authority of Congress to make regulations of its own was directly involved, and its authority over interstate state commerce in intoxicating liquors was clearly stated and definitely recognized. After discussing the power of Congress over such shipment in interstate commerce, and affirming the ample power possessed by Congress over the subject-matter in view of its characteristics, this court said:\n'... We can see no reason for saying that although Congress in view of the nature and character of intoxicants had a power to forbid their movement in interstate commerce, it had not the authority to so deal with the subject as to establish a regulation (which is what was done by the Webb-Kenyon Law) making it impossible for one state to violate the prohibitions of the laws of another through the channels of interstate commerce. Indeed, we can see no escape from the conclusion that if we accepted the proposition urged, we would be obliged to announce the contradiction in terms that because Congress had exerted a regulation lesser in power than it was authorized to exert, therefore its action was void for excess of power; or, in other words, stating the necessary result of the argument from a concrete consideration of the particular subject here involved, that because Congress in adopting a regulation had considered the nature and character of our dual system of government, state and nation, and instead of absolutely prohibiting, had so conformed its regulation as to produce co-operation between \n\n[248 U.S. 420, 427]\n\u00a0\n the local and national forces of government to the end of preserving the rights of all, it had thereby transcended the complete and perfect power of regulation conferred by the Constituion.'\n\n In view of the authority of Congress over the subject-matter, and the enactment of previous legislation embodied in the Wilson and Webb-Kenyon Laws, we have no question that Congress enacted this statute because of its belief that in states prohibiting the sale and manufacture of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes the facilities of interstate commerce should be denied to the introduction of intoxicants by means of interstate commerce, except for the limited purposes permitted in the statute which have nothing to do with liquor when used as a beverage. That the state saw fit to permit the introduction of liquor for personal use in limited quantity in no wise interferes with the authority of Congress, acting under its plenary power over interstate commerce, to make the prohibition against interstate shipment contained in this act. It may exert its authority, as in the Wilson and Webb-Kenyon Acts, having in view the laws of the state, but it has a power of its own, which in this instance it has exerted in accordance with its view of public policy.\n When Congress exerts its authority in a matter within its control, state laws must give way in view of the regulation of the subject-matter by the superior power conferred by the Constitution.

Construed as forbidding this action because West Virginia had undertaken to forbid manufacture and sale of intoxicants, the Reed Amendment in no proper sense regulates interstate commerce, but is a direct intermeddling with the state's internal affairs. Whether regarded as reward or punishment for wisdom or folly in enacting limited prohibition, the amendment so construed, I think, goes beyond federal power; and to hold otherwise opens possibilities for partial and sectional legislation which may destroy proper control of their own affairs by the several states.\n If Congress may deny liquor to those who live in a state simply because its manufacture is not permitted there, why may not this be done for any suggested reason-e. g. because the roads are bad or men are hanged for murder or coals are dug. Where is the limit?\n The Webb-Kenyon Law, upheld in Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Md. Ry. Co., \n242 U.S. 311\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 180, L. R. A. 1917B, 1218, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 845, is wholly different from the act here involved. It suspends as to intoxicants moving in interstate commerce the rule of freedom from control by state action which the courts infer from congressional silence or failure specifically to regulate. 'The absence of any law of Congress on the subject is equivalent to its declaration that commerce in that matter shall be free.' Bowman v.

In plain terms, it permits state statutes to operate and thereby negatives any inference drawn from silence. The Reed Amendment as now construed is a congressional fiat imposing more complete prohibition wherever the state has assumed to prevent manufacture or sale of intoxicants.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE concurs in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","213":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

Suit was brought by Laughlin in the Court of Claims under section 2 of the Act of March 26, 1908 (35 Stat. 48, c. 102 [Comp. St.  4492]), for the repayment of an alleged excess charge exacted of him when he made a pre-emption cash entry November 20, 1878, for a tract of 160 acres of public land, part of section 33, township 5 south, range 12 east, W. M. in the Dalles, Oregon, land district, for which he was charged by the proper officer of the United States the sum of $400, or at the rate of $ 2.50 per acre. There was a judgment in favor of the claimant (Laughlin v. United States, 52 Ct. Cl. 292), and the present appeal followed.\n The land is a part of an odd-numbered section within 40 miles of the general route of the Northern Pacific Railroad \n\n[249 U.S. 440, 442]\n\u00a0\n Company, as shown by its map filed in the Interior Department August 13, 1870, upon the basis of which the department, on February 14, 1872, issued an order withholding from disposition the odd-numbered sections of public lands and increasing in price to $2.50 per acre the even-numbered sections within the limits indicated by the map. No map of definite location of this particular portion of the proposed railroad was ever filed; this portion never was constructed, and the grant as to it was forfeited by act of Congress of September 29, 1890 (26 Stat. 496, c. 1040). Claimant applied to the Secretary of the Interior under the Act of March 26, 1908, for the refund of $200 of the purchase price, alleging that the lawful price was $1.25 per acre; but the Secretary, on July 22, 1916, although finding the facts to be as above stated, denied the application upon the ground that the questions of law presented had been previously adjudicated by the Land Department adversely to claimant's contention.\n Upon the present appeal it first is insisted in behalf of the government that the Court of Claims had no jurisdiction of the subject- matter. If there was jurisdiction, it arose from the clause of section 145, Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1136 [Comp. St.  1136 ]), which confers upon that court jurisdiction to hear and determine claims founded upon 'any law of Congress'-the act of March 26, 1908, being the law relied on. Section 2 of this act reads as follows:\n'That in all cases where it shall appear to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Interior that any person has heretofore or shall hereafter make any payments to the United States under the public land laws in excess of the amount he was lawfully required to pay under such laws, such excess shall be repaid to such person or to his legal representatives.'\n\n The third section provides machinery for the payment of the amount of the excess when ascertained. It is contended by the government that a favorable decision by the Secretary is a condition precedent to the right of recovery under \n\n[249 U.S. 440, 443]\n\u00a0\n the section quoted; that since the Secretary disallowed the present claim, because not satisfied that an excessive payment under the law had been made, there has been no violation of any right of claimant; and that hence there is not presented a claim founded upon a law of Congress within the meaning of the term as employed in defining the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims. We cannot accept this construction of section 2 of the act of 1908. According to it, although facts were made to appear to the entire satisfaction of the Secretary showing that a person had made 'payments to the United States under the public land laws in excess of the amount he was lawfully required to pay under such laws,' it would rest in the uncontrolled judgment and discretion of the Secretary to deny repayment of the excess because not satisfied that it ought to be repaid, notwithstanding Congress had declared that under the precise state of facts it should be repaid. Under this construction the legislative power would in effect be delegated to the Secretary. In our view it was the intent of Congress that the Secretary should have exclusive jurisdiction only to determine disputed questions of fact, and that, as in other administrative matters, his decision upon questions of law should be reviewable by the courts. In the case before us the facts were not and are not in dispute, and were shown to the Secretary's satisfaction; whether, as matter of law, they made a case of excess payment, entitling claimant to repayment under the act of 1908, was a matter properly within the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims. See Medbury v. United States, \n173 \nU.S. 492, 497\n, 498 S., 19 Sup. Ct. 503; McLean v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 374, 378\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 122; United States v. Hvoslef, \n237 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 459, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 286.\n Upon the merits, the question is: What price could a pre-emptor lawfully be required to pay for public lands in an odd-numbered section within the primary limits of the Northern Pacific Railroad land grant after the filing \n\n[249 U.S. 440, 444]\n\u00a0\n of a map of general route and the making of an order withdrawing the oddnumbered sections from entry; no map of definite location of the line in question having at that time or at any time been filed?\n The company was incorporated by Act July 2, 1864, c. 217, 13 Stat. 365, by the third section of which there was granted to it--\n'every alternate section of public land, not mineral, designated by odd numbers [within defined limits], ... whenever, on the line thereof, the United States have full title, not reserved, sold, granted, or otherwise appropriated, and free from pre-emption, or other claims or rights, at the time the line of said road is definitely fixed, and a plat thereof filed in the office of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, and whenever, prior to said time, any of said sections or parts of sections shall have been granted, sold, reserved, occupied by homestead settlers, or pre- empted, or otherwise disposed of, other lands shall be selected by said company in lieu thereof, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, in alternate sections, and designated by odd numbers, not more than ten miles beyond the limits of said alternate sections.'\n\n By section 6 it was enacted:\n'That the President of the United States shall cause the lands to be surveyed for forty miles in width on both sides of the entire line of said road, after the general route shall be fixed, and as fast as may be required by the construction of said railroad; and the odd sections of land hereby granted shall not be liable to sale, or entry, or pre-emption before or after they are surveyed, except by said company, as provided in this act. ... And the reserved alternate sections shall not be sold by the government at a price less than two dollars and fifty cents per acre, when offered for sale.'\n\n Notwithstanding certain expressions in Buttz v. Northern Pacific Railroad, \n119 \nU.S. 55, 71\n, 72 S., 7 Sup. Ct. 100, it came to be settled \n\n[249 U.S. 440, 445]\n\u00a0\n by a line of more recent cases ending with Nelson v. Northern Pacific Railway, \n188 \nU.S. 108, 116\n, 119 S., 121, 23 Sup. Ct. 302, that the act of 1864 granted to the railroad company only those alternate odd-numbered sections to which at the time of definite location the United States had valid title and which then were free from pre-emption or other claims or rights; that the company acquired no vested interest in any particular section of land until after a definite location and acceptance of its map thereof; and that until then the grant was in the nature of a 'float.' In that case the right of a homestead settler who went upon unsurveyed land after the filing of a map of general route and after the making and transmission to the proper local land office of a withdrawal order based upon that map, and who, as soon as survey was made developing the fact that his land was within an odd-numbered section, attempted to enter it under the homestead laws in the local land office, his application being rejected solely because of supposed conflict with the grant to the Northern Pacific Railroad, was sustained as against the company upon the ground that the acceptance by the land department of the map of general route and the making of a withdrawal order based upon it did not, in view of the terms of the granting act, segregate the land from the public domain or withdraw it from occupancy in good faith by homestead settlers prior to definite location. In Northern Pacific Railroad v. Sanders, \n166 U.S. 620\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 671, it was held upon like reasoning that the title of the railroad company was defeated by an entry upon lands within the primary limits of the grant by persons qualified to purchase them as mineral lands, followed by an application to purchase them as such which was pending at the time of the definite location of the railroad although initiated after the filing of the general route, notwithstanding the fact that the lands were not such as properly were to be regarded as mineral lands. \n\n[249 U.S. 440, 446]\n\u00a0\n In short, construing sections 3 and 6 of the granting act together, the filing of a map of general route, although followed by a withdrawal order, did not take the granted sections out of the public domain or exempt them from entry under the pre-emption and homestead laws prior to the filing and acceptance of the map of definite location.\n It is said on the part of the government that this land was restored to entry and the claimant's application for purchase accepted because the railroad company had filed a relinquishment pursuant to Act June 22, 1874, c. 400, 18 Stat. 194 (Comp. St.  4889); at the same time it is insisted that the provisions of that act have no bearing upon the determination of this case because not only had the land office never declared that the company's rights had attached to these lands, but in fact it never had any rights. It is said that under such circumstances the department uniformly has held that the act of 1874 has no application; the practice of the land office having been to permit relinquishments in cases like the present in order to expedite the perfection of settlement claims, while saving to the railroad companies any rights they might have under the act of 1874 to be determined upon the final adjustment of the grant. There being no finding that the lands in question had been relinquished by the railroad company under the act of 1874, we give no weight to its provisions, beyond saying that in any point of view they conferred no authority upon the officials of the government to charge more for the land relinquished than otherwise might have been charged. It declares that 'entries or filings thus relieved from conflict may be perfected into complete title as if such lands had not been granted.'\n It is clear that the price of lands in odd-numbered sections was not fixed by the granting act of 1864. Section 6 fixed a price of $2.50 per acre only for the alternate sections reserved to the United \n\n[249 U.S. 440, 447]\n\u00a0\n States-that is, those bearing even numbers. We need not pursue the suggestion of counsel for appellee that there could be no 'reserved alternate sections,' within the meaning of the price-fixing clause, until ascertainment of the granted sections by the filing and acceptance of a map of definite location; for, in any event, neither section 6 nor the withdrawal order made any provision for the price of land in the odd- numbered sections. In the absence of special provision the minimum price was fixed by section 2357, Rev. Stat. (Comp. St.  4757), at $1.25 per acre, and under section 2259 a qualified pre-emptor was entitled to purchase at the minimum price. This was a substantial right, of which he could not be deprived by arbitrary action of the officers of the government.\n The government invokes the provisions of section 2364 (Comp. St.  4773), derived from an act contemporaneous with the land grant (Act July 2, 1864, c. 221, 13 Stat. 374), and reading as follows:\n'Whenever any reservation of public lands is brought into market, the Commissioner of the General Land Office shall fix a minimum price, not less than one dollar and twenty-five cents per acre, below which such lands shall not be disposed of.'\n\n It is argued that the withdrawal order of 1872 amounted to a ' reservation of public lands' within the meaning of this section, so far as it concerned the odd-numbered sections within the limits, and that the sale of the particular quarter section to claimant amounted to a 'bringing into market' of this part of the reservation, so that the Commissioner of the General Land Office was permitted to fix the minimum at such price as he saw fit, not less than $1.25 per acre, and was acting within his authority when he set the price of these lands at $2.50 per acre. But of this it suffices to say, as was pointed out in Nelson v. Northern Pacific Railway, supra, that under the terms of the granting act here under consideration the withdrawal on general route neither did nor could effectively \n\n[249 U.S. 440, 448]\n\u00a0\n reserve any of the odd-numbered sections from homestead or pre-emption settlement in advance of the definite location of the line of the railroad; and, as has been stated, there never was a definite location of that part of the road which had been proposed to be built opposite to the land that claimant took up.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","214":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. NEW ORLEANS PAC R. CO.(1919)\nNo. 164\nArgued: Decided: January 27, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[248 U.S. 507, 508]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Francis J. Kearful, for the United states.\n\n\n[248 U.S. 507, 509]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Mark Norris, of Grand Rapids, Mich., F. G. Hudson, of Monroe, La., and H. H. White, of Alexandria, La., for appellees.\n\n\n[248 U.S. 507, 510]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These suits are so related that they may be disposed of in a single opinion. Three tracts of land in Vernon parish, Louisiana, each containing 160 acres, are in controversy-one in each suit. All are in odd-numbered sections within the limits of the grant of March 3, 1871, to the New Orleans, Baton Rouge & Vicksburg Railroad Company (16 Stat. 573, c. 122)- one being within the primary and two within the indemnity limits. All were patented under the grant and after-wards sold by the patentee, the purchasers paying a fair price. Through successive sales the title under the patents was passed along to other purchasers. Whether the latter shall be decreed to hold the title in trust for certain homestead claimants whose claims are founded on settlements antedating the issue of the patents, and also the definite location of the road, is the matter in controversy.\n The suits were brought by the United States, the defendants being the patentee and the present holders of the title under the patents. The relief prayed was that the patents be canceled, or, if that be not done, that the homestead claimants be decreed to be the equitable owners and that a trust in their favor be declared and enforced. Of \n\n[248 U.S. 507, 511]\n\u00a0\n these alternative prayers, the latter was better suited to the case stated. By leave of the court the homestead claimants intervened, set forth their claims, alleged that the patentee and all the purchasers took the title with full notice of their claims, asserted that the title was held in trust for them and sought relief accordingly. Various defenses were set up in the answers, such as the lapse of the period prescribed for bringing suits to cancel patents, laches on the part of the homestead claimants and good faith on the part of the purchasers. On the final hearing the District Court entered a decree for the defendants in each of the suits, and this was affirmed in the Circuit Court of Appeals. 235 Fed. 841, 846, 149 C. C. A. 153, 158. The District Court did not make any specific finding of fact or assign any particular reason for its decree, and the Circuit Court of Appeals rested its decision on three grounds: (a) That in so far as the suits sought a cancellation of the patents they were barred because not brought within the time prescribed by law; (b) that, if a trust had arisen in favor of the homestead claimants, its enforcement was a matter in which the United States was without interest or concern; and ( c) that, if such a trust had arisen, it had become unenforceable by reason of inexcusable laches on the part of the homestead claimants.\n The grant of March 3, 1871, was made to the New Orleans, Baton Rouge & Vicksburg Railroad Company, 'its successors and assigns,' to aid in the construction of a railroad from New Orleans to Shreveport, and embraced all the odd-numbered sections of public land within 20 miles (the primary limits) on each side of the road, subject to enumerated exceptions, one of which excluded any land to which a pre-emption or homestead claim may 'have attached' at the time the line of the road was definitely located. In lieu of the excepted lands others in odd-numbered sections within prescribed indemnity limits were to be selected. Whenever, and as often as, 20 \n\n[248 U.S. 507, 512]\n\u00a0\n consecutive miles of road were completed and put in running order patents were to be issued for the lands opposite to and coterminous with that portion of the road. The entire road was to be completed within five years. Within two years the company was to designate the 'general route' of the road and to file a map of the same in the Department of the Interior. There was no provision directly calling for a map showing the definite location of the road, but that such a map was to be filed was plainly implied.\n The general route of the road was designated on a map filed and accepted in November, 1871. The Secretary of the Interior, complying with an express provision in the granting act, then caused the odd-numbered sections within the primary limits to be withdrawn from entry and sale. That withdrawal became effective in December, 1871, and included the tract in controversy in No. 166. The Secretary also ordered a like withdrawal of the odd-numbered sections within the indemnity limits, but as the granting act did not authorize, but in effect prohibited, their withdrawal, this part of the order was of no effect. Southern Pacific R. R. Co. v. Bell, \n183 U.S. 675\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 232.\n No part of the railroad was constructed by the original grantee, and on January 5, 1881, it transferred the grant to the New Orleans Pacific Railway Company. At that time this company had a line of completed railroad extending from New Orleans to Whitecastle in the direction of Shreveport, and thereafter, during the years 1881 and 1882, it constructed, completed and put in running order, the road from Whitecastle to Shreveport. It also filed with the Secretary of the Interior, on November 17, 1882, a map showing the definite location of the part of the road opposite the tracts now in controversy, and the map was accepted. The road as completed was examined and accepted, and the company was recognized by the Secretary of the Interior, the Attorney General and the President, \n\n[248 U.S. 507, 513]\n\u00a0\n as rightly entitled to patents for the lands falling within the terms of the grant and lying opposite the road from Whitecastle to Shreveport.\n Thereafter, in 1885, patents for a large part of the lands were issued to the New Orleans Pacific Railway Company, the assignee of the grant. Other lands remained as yet unpatented. About that time this company's rights under the grant were persistently questioned by persons who insisted that the grant was not assignable, that all rights under it were extinguished when the road was not constructed within the five years prescribed therefor, and that in any event a forfeiture could and should be declared for the failure to comply with that condition, although the road had been completed in the meantime. Because of this the Secretary of the Interior, although not acceding to the insistence, suspended the issue of patents and called the matter to the attention of Congress, saying in that connection that the company had--\n'... purchased a portion of a line of a railroad already built from New Orleans to Whitecastle, a distance of 68 miles; as to this portion of the road the company waived claim to the land granted. The residue of the road, from Whitecastle to Shreveport, was built by the company upon the belief of the full validity of their right to the land granted, and without this benefit of the grant the road would not have been built. The government railroad examiner reports the road substantially built and equipped, and it would not appear to comport with good faith to those who invested their money on the basis of the grant to take advantage of any technical defect, if such exists, in the transfer to the company. I would, therefore, respectfully suggest for the consideration of Congress the propriety of passing an act curative of defect, if any exists, in the transfer to the New Orleans Pacific Company, and vesting the title, originally granted to the New Orleans, Baton Rouge & Vicksburg Rail \n\n[248 U.S. 507, 514]\n\u00a0\n road Company from Whitecastle to Shreveport, in the New Orleans Pacific road.'\n\n With the matter thus brought to its attention Congress passed the Act of February 8, 1887,1 c. 120, 24 Stat. 391. By its first section a part of the grant, with which we are not here concerned, was declared to be forfeited and was restored to the public domain. By its second section the part of the grant on the west side of the Mississippi river opposite to and coterminous with the road from Whitecastle to Shreveport, which was constructed by the New Orleans Pacific Railway Company as assignee of the grant, was confirmed to that company save as it was declared in a proviso--\n'that all said lands occupied by actual settlers at the date of the definite location of said road and still remaining in their possession or in possession of their heirs or assigns shall be held and deemed excepted from said grant and shall be subject to entry under the public land laws of the United States.'\n\n By this section the map of November 17, 1882, was required to be treated as the 'definite location' of the part of the road opposite the lands now in controversy. By the third section the confirmation in the second was conditioned on the acceptance by the company of the provisions of the act. The fourth section is not material here. The fifth section authorized the Secretary of the Interior to make all needful rules and regulations for carrying the act into effect. The sixth section confirmed the patents already issued to the company, but with the express qualification that--\n'The Secretary of the Interior is hereby fully authorized and in \n\n[248 U.S. 507, 515]\n\u00a0\n structed to apply the provisions of the second, third, fourth, and fifth sections of this act to any of said lands that have been so patented, and to protect any and all settlers on said lands in all their rights under the said sections of this act.'\n\n The company duly accepted the provisions of the act and in that way assented to and became bound by every provision in it-the unfavorable as well as the favorable. The provisions of special importance here are the proviso in section 2 and the latter part of section 6. By one all lands occupied by actual settlers at the time of the definite location of the road and remaining in their possession, or that of their heirs or assigns, were 'excepted from said grant' and made 'subject to entry under the public land laws'; and by the other the Secretary of the Interior was authorized and instructed to apply the same rule to all lands for which patents already had been issued, and to protect all settlers on such lands in their rights under the act.\n It does not admit of any doubt that these provisions, when accepted, became applicable to all the unpatented lands and to such of the patented lands as had not then been sold by the company. Whether they also became applicable to such of the patented lands as were sold theretofore is a question which will be considered presently.\n Of the lands in suit, 80 acres were both patented and sold before the act was passed or accepted, 280 acres were patented before the act was passed and sold after it was accepted, and 120 acres were both patented and sold after the acceptance. Thus all but 80 acres came certainly within the reach of the two provisions as accepted. The 80 acres, as to which the question is left open for the moment, are part of the tract in controversy in no. 166.\n As before stated, the part of the road opposite these lands was definitely located November 17, 1882. At that time there was an actual settler on each of the 160- \n\n[248 U.S. 507, 516]\n\u00a0\n acre tracts. In each instance the settler had the qualifications named in the homestead law, was expecting to acquire the title under that law, had placed on the land a habitable dwelling in which he and his family were living, had cleared, fenced and was cultivating several acres and was asserting a claim to the entire tract. The settler in No. 164 continued his residence, occupancy and cultivation until 1896, when he died, and thereafter his widow continued the occupancy and cultivation, either personally or through tenants. The settler in No. 165 continued his residence, occupancy and cultivation to the time of the hearing in the District Court. And the settler in No. 166 continued his residence, occupancy and cultivation until 1885, when he sold his improvements and possessory right to another, who had the requisite qualifications and wished to acquire the title under the homestead law. The assignee then settled on the tract and thereafter resided thereon with his family and continued the occupancy and cultivation begun by his assignor. While in No. 164 the widow, and in No. 166 the assignee, succeeded to the rights of the original settler, we shall speak of all the claims as if the original settlers were the present claimants.\n The existence and extent of these claims were well known among the people of the neighborhood, and the improvements and evidences of inhabitancy and cultivation on each tract were such that any one purchasing under the land grant would be charged with notice of the nature and extent of the settler's claim.\n The settlers applied at the local land office-one in 1888, one in 1890 and the other in 1896-to make homestead entries of the lands and the railway company opposed their applications. Hearings were had and the contests ultimately were determined in favor of the settlers-one in 1893, one in 1896 and the other 1898. The decision in each contest was to the effect that the proofs established \n\n[248 U.S. 507, 517]\n\u00a0\n the right of the settler to receive the title under the proviso in section 2 and the latter part of section 6. All the lands had then been patented, and the settlers were advised by the regulations which the Secretary of the Interior had adopted, as also by the decisions in the contests, that the land department would secure a relinquishment of the outstanding title for their benefit. 5 L. D. 688. In 1892, before the contests were decided, the company and the trustees of its land grant had filed the following stipulation with the Secretary of the Interior. New Orleans Pac. Ry. Co., 15 L. D. 576:\n'That in cases where patents have issued to said railway company for lands which have been or may hereafter be adjudged by the Commissioner of the General Land Office to have been in the possession of actual settlers at date of the definite location of said railway company's road, and title is in said railway company, said railway company and said trustees agree to make without delay conveyance thereof to the United States; and where such lands have been sold by said railway company to third persons, said railway company undertakes to recover title thereto without delay and convey the same to said settlers or to the United States, and the said trustees undertake to join in such conveyances and to do all acts necessary on their part to enable the railway company to carry out this agreement and stipulation.'\n\n After the contests were decided the land department called on the company to reconvey or surrender the title, but this was not done; and the Secretary of the Interior requested the Attorney General to institute judicial proceedings to secure for the settlers the protection promised in the act of 1887, which the company had accepted. Acting on this request the Attorney General, on February 27, 1901, brought a suit in the name of the United States against the railway company and others to cancel and annul the patents to these and many other lands similarly situated. Various obstacles were encountered in \n\n[248 U.S. 507, 518]\n\u00a0\n the prosecution of that general suit, one being that the purchasers from the company were not made parties, and on January 21, 1915, while that suit was still pending, the Attorney General brought the suits with which we are now concerned.\n As the patents were issued before, and the suits were brought more than five years after, the Act of March 2, 1896, c. 39, 29 Stat. 42 (Comp. St.  4901-4903), the prayer that the patents be canceled must be put out of view, and the alternative prayer-that the title under the patents be declared to be held in trust for the homestead claimants and the trust enforced-must be regarded as if standing alone.\n The right of the United States to maintain the suits is questioned on the ground that the enforcement of the asserted trust is a matter in which the United States is without interest or concern. Were the premise tenable, the conclusion would follow as of course. But the premise is not tenable. A pecuniary interest in the relief sought is not essential; it is enough if there be an interest or concern arising out of an obligation to those for whose benefit the suits are brought. United States v. San Jacinto Tin Co., \n125 \nU.S. 273, 285\n, 286 S., 8 Sup. Ct. 850; United States v. Beebe, \n127 U.S. 338\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 1083; United States v. American Bell Telephone Co., \n128 \nU.S. 315, 367\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 90; Heckman v. United States, \n224 \nU.S. 413, 439\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 424. By the act of 1887 the United States undertook to invest settlers coming within the provisions of that act with the title to the lands in their possession, and also 'to protect' them in that right. This meant that they were to receive a clear title. The act charged the Secretary of the Interior with the duty of adopting appropriate measures to that end, and when other means failed he invoked the aid of the Attorney General, who brought these suits. Through them the United States seeks to fulfill its obligation under the act to the settlers, and in this it has the requisite interest or concern.\n When the United States sues to enforce a public right \n\n[248 U.S. 507, 519]\n\u00a0\n or to protect a public interest the defense of laches is not available; but when the suit, although in the name of the United States, is brought for the benefit of a private person his laches may be interposed with like effect as if he were suing. United States v. Beebe, supra. Applying this view, the court below reached the conclusion that the settlers had been guilty of such laches as would bar them from the relief sought. We are unable to concur in that conclusion. The occupancy of the settlers was both peaceable and continuous and gave notice of their equitable rights. Their claims were asserted before the land department, were the subjects of hearings and appeals, and were by it sustained. The land officers, conformably to the published regulations, undertook to secure a restoration of the outstanding title, and to that end the suit of 1901 was brought. The settlers were justified in believing that their rights were being protected, as was required by the act of 1887. No attempt was made to disturb their occupancy or to assert any right against them. We therefore think it properly cannot be said that they were guilty of any such laches as precluded them from obtaining relief in equity. As a general rule, one who is in peaceable possession under an equitable claim does not subject himself to a charge of laches for mere delay in resorting to equity to establish his claim against the holder of the legal title where the latter manifests no purpose to disturb him or to question his claim. Ruckman v. Cory, \n129 U.S. 387\n, 389-390, 9 Sup. Ct. 316. We think that rule is applicable here.\n On the merits, we are of opinion that the act of 1887, as accepted by the company, operated to exclude from the grant and to subject to these settlement claims all the lands in controversy, patented and unpatented, save the 80 acres which are yet to be specially noticed. In so far as these lands were patented it became the duty of the railway company to surrender the title, and in so far as \n\n[248 U.S. 507, 520]\n\u00a0\n they were unpatented the act forbade the issue of patents to the company for them. Intending purchasers were bound to take notice of the occupancy of the settlers, and this, with the act of 1887, which was a public law, renders untenable the claim that those who hold the title under the patents have the status of bona fide purchasers. In these circumstances the settlers, whose claims come within the proviso in section 2 and the latter part of section 6, are entitled to have a trust in their favor declared and enforced.\n The situation as to the 80 acres which were both patented and sold before the act of 1887 was passed is not the same. Under an express provision of the act of 1871 they were withdrawn from entry and sale while they were yet vacant and unclaimed, and the withdrawal was still in force in 1885, when they were patented. No valid claim to them could be initiated by settlement or otherwise in the presence of the withdrawal. Hamblin v. Sestern Land Co., \n147 \nU.S. 531, 536\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 353; Wood v. Beach, \n156 U.S. 548\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 410; Spencer v. McDougal, \n159 U.S. 62\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 1026. They were part of an odd-numbered section within the primary limits and opposite a 20- mile section of the road which was constructed, completed, put in running order and accepted by the President before they were patented. In other words, they were lawfully patented and when the company sold them, in 1886, it had the right to do so. The purpose of the granting act in directing that patents be issued as each section of twenty miles of road was completed was to enable the company to sell the lands and realize on the grant. In these circumstances the purchase was bona fide and the purchaser took the full title. It follows that before the act of 1887 was passed the 80 acres-described as the S. 1\/2 of N. W. 1\/4 of section 3, township 3 N., range 7 W., L. M.-had passed into hands where they were not within the reach of the act or the company's acceptance. The fact that this land was sold before the \n\n[248 U.S. 507, 521]\n\u00a0\n act was passed seems not to have been brought to the attention of the land department-probably because the purchaser was not a party to the contest proceedings.\n The contention is made that the portions of that act which are material here do not embrace lands within the indemnity limits, but only those within the primary limits. A survey of the entire act shows that the contention is without merit. \n No. 164.\n Decree reversed.\n No. 165. Decree reversed.\n No. 166. Decree affirmed as to S. 1\/2 of N.

PURCELL ENVELOPE CO.(1919)\nNo. 168\nArgued: March 10, 1919Decided: March 31, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for the united states. \n\n[249 U.S. 313, 314]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Arthur Black, of Boston, Mass., for appellee.\n\n\n[249 U.S. 313, 315]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Action brought by appellee, the Purcell Envelope Company, which we shall designate as the Envelope Company, against the United States for damages for breach of an express contract. The Court of Claims rendered judgment for the Envelope Company for the sum of $185,331.76. The United States appeals.\n The findings of the court are quite voluminous, but it is only necessary to quote from them to the following effect: The Post Office Department, through the Postmaster General, James A. Gary, invited by advertisement bids 'for furnishing stamped envelopes and newspaper wrappers in such quantities as may be called for by the department during a period of four years, beginning on the first day of October, 1898.' In pursuance of the invitation the Envelope Company submitted a bid in the manner and time specified in the advertisements of the department.\n The bid of the Envelope Company was accepted, and the following order entered:\n'... (2) That the contract for furnishing the envelopes called for by the advertisement and specifications referred to be awarded to the Purcell Envelope Co., of Holyoke, Mass., as the lowest bidder for the government standard of paper, at the following prices a thousand, namely: ...'\n\n The department, before issuing the order, investigated the financial responsibility of the Envelope Company and considered it satisfactory.\n April 21, 1898, the department sent to the Envelope Company a 'contract in quadruplicate,' to be executed 'at once' and returned to the department. It was promptly returned as requested, signed by the president of the Envelope Company, with the Fidelity & Deposit Company of Maryland as surety in the sum of $200,000. \n\n[249 U.S. 313, 316]\n\u00a0\n April 27, 1898, the department, by the Third Assistant Postmaster General, wrote to the Envelope Company as follows:\n'Your telegram of to-day is before me. As the Postmaster General has not yet signed the contract awarded by the Department to your company for furnishing stamped envelopes during the coming four years, but is holding the matter in abeyance, I have to request that you suspend all action under my letter of the 21st instant until further orders.'\n\n The Envelope Company had, however, already made arrangements and contracts for the supplying to it of the necessary materials to fulfill the terms of the contract and was ready and willing at all times to fully perform it according to its terms. But neither the Postmaster General, nor any department or officer of the government made any call or request upon the Envelope Company to furnish or deliver the envelopes or wrappers which were the subject-matter of the contract and the company's plant was kept intact ready for the performance of the contract, remaining idle.\n July 22, 1898, the department, through Postmaster General Smith, the immediate successor of Postmaster General Gary, the latter having gone out of office, revoked and canceled the contract and declared it to be null and void. Prior to doing so the Postmaster General instituted an investigation through one of his proper officers into the business and financial standing of the Envelope Company and the report thereunder was unfavorable to the company.\n On or about July 22, 1898, the Envelope Company, having received information that the Postmaster General designed readvertising for proposals, sought by a bill filed in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia to enjoin his action. The bill was dismissed August 15, 1898. The court, however, was of opinion that a contract had been executed but that the Envelope Company had an efficient remedy at law. \n\n[249 U.S. 313, 317]\n\u00a0\n An offer was subsequently made by two other companies to supply the Post Office Department, upon an emergency contract, stamped envelopes and wrappers of the kinds and qualities the government should need. The department declared that an emergency existed under section 3709, R. S. ( Comp. St.  6832), accepted the offer and entered into a contract in accordance therewith.\n The total cost to the Envelope Company for materials and the manufacture and delivery of the envelopes and wrappers in accordance with the terms of its contract would have been $2,275,224.46. Deducting that sum from the contract price leaves a difference of $185,331.76, which represents the profit the company would have made if it had been allowed to perform its contract. For that sum judgment was entered.\n It will be observed from the recitation of the above facts that the case presents the propositions: First, was there a completed contract between the Envelope Company and the United States through its Postmaster General; and, second, if there was such contract, what is the measure of damages?\n For an affirmative answer to the first proposition the Envelope Company relies on Garfielde v. United States, \n93 U.S. 242\n, and on that case the Court of Claims rested its decision and considered that the case was supported by other cases which were cited.\n The case may be considered as the anticipation of this-its prototype. It passed upon a transaction of the Post Office Department and decided that a proposal in accordance with an advertisement by that department and the acceptance by it of the proposal 'created a contract of the same force and effect as if a formal contract had been written out and signed by the parties.' And for this, it was said, many authorities were cited but it was considered so sound as to make unnecessary review of or comment upon them. \n\n[249 U.S. 313, 318]\n\u00a0\n In resistance to the case as conclusive the government urges the qualification that 'the court did not say, or assume to say, that the acceptance of the proposal in all [italics counsel's] cases constituted a contract, but held that it did in the present [that] case,' and that 'there was reason for the conclusion which does not obtain in the case at bar.' We cannot agree, and in answer to the first qualification it is only necessary to say that the court expressed a principle, not, of course, applicable to all cases, but applicable to like cases; and the present is a like case, identical in all that makes the principle applicable. And in so determining we answer the other objection of the government that there were features in the law in the Garfielde Case which do not obtain in the pending case, which constituted, if we understand counsel, the determination of the law against the act of the Postmaster General, his duty being merely ministerial. In the present case it is insisted his action is not so subordinate, that he has discretion, and when exercised it is paramount, his action being 'quasi judicial,' the contract not having been consummated, and that, therefore, it was within his power to review and set aside the decision of his predecessor. We are unable to concede the fact or the power asserted to be dependent upon it. There must be a point of time at which discretion is exhausted. The procedure for the advertising for bids for supplies or services to the government would else be a mockery-a procedure, we may say, that is not permissive but required ( section 3709, R. S.). By it the government is given the benefit of the competition of the market and each bidder is given the chance for a bargain. It is a provision, therefore, in the interest of both government and bidder, necessarily giving rights to both and placing obligations on both. And it is not out of place to say that the government should be animated by a justice as anxious to consider the rights of the bidder as to insist upon its own. \n\n[249 U.S. 313, 319]\n\u00a0\n And, we repeat, there must be some point at which discretion ceases and obligation takes its place. That point is defined in the Garfielde Case, and that the definition is applicable to the case at bar is illustrated by the findings of the Court of Claims. Upon the invitation, in accordance with law, of Postmaster General Gary, the Envelope Company and 11 others submitted bids. The Envelope Company was the lowest bidder and after the company had been found upon investigation to be financially responsible its bid was accepted by entry of a formal order. The company was then directed by the department to execute the necessary contract in quadruplicate, which it did, and returned the contract to the department with a surety whose responsibility was not questioned at any time nor was other security demanded, as it might have been. Postmaster General Gary went out of office, and his successor, either by inducement or upon his own resolution, revoked the contract and entered into a contract with other companies.\n The record furnishes no justification of such action. There is no charge of default against the Envelope Company, no charge of inability to perform its contract, except in a particular which we shall hereafter mention. There is, it is true, a finding that Postmaster General Smith caused an investigation to be made of the financial standing of the Envelope Company and that the report thereunder was unfavorable to it. This is made a great deal of, and the fact that the contract was not signed nor the bond of the Envelope Company approved.\n It makes no difference that the contract was not formally signed or the bond formally approved, as counsel for the government contends they should have been, both by the terms of the contract and by a statute of the United States. Act Aug. 13, 1894, c. 282, 28 Stat. 279 (Comp. St.  3293-3300). Their formal execution, as we have seen, was not essential to the consummation of the contract. That was accomplished, as was decided in the \n\n[249 U.S. 313, 320]\n\u00a0\n Garfielde Case, by the acceptance of the bid of the Envelope Company and the entry of the order awarding the contract to it. Therefore, we do not follow with minute attention the argument of the government in asserting the power of Postmaster General Smith to review and annul his predecessor's decision and that directed against the financial standing of the Envelope Company or the deception the government asserts was practiced on Postmaster General Gary, which are made the subject of a request for findings. We may assume that the Court of Claims considered such charges and all other elements before concluding that the Envelope Company was entitled to recover. And we pass to the question of damages.\n The Court of Claims decided that the measure of damages was the difference between the cost to the Envelope Company of materials and the manufacture and delivery of the envelopes and wrappers in accordance with the terms of its contract and what it would have made if it had been allowed to perform the contract. For this the court cited and relied upon Roehm v. Horst, \n178 U.S. 1\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 780. It is there decided that the positive refusal to perform a contract is a breach of it, though the time for performance has not arrived, and that liability for the breach at once occurs. And it is further decided that the measure of damages is the difference between the contract price and the cost of performance. The case was replete in its review of prior cases. We may refer, however, to United States v. Speed, 8 Wall. 77, 85; United States v. Behan, \n110 U.S. 338\n, 4 Sup. Ct. 81; Hinckley v. Pittsburgh Steel Co., \n121 U.S. 264\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 875.\n The government does not attack the ruling, but contends that it was not properly applied by the Court of Claims. The contention is rested on the following finding:\n'Claimant, contemplating making the envelopes under its said contract on the Wickham envelope machines, entered into negotiations with Horace J. Wickham whereby he prom ised \n\n[249 U.S. 313, 321]\n\u00a0\n to furnish claimant with a sufficient number of said machines on which to perform said (envelope) contract, and to have some of them ready before the beginning of the contract term, October 1, 1898.'\n\n The government says of the Wickham machine that it made the envelope in one operation and that there is nothing to show that the Court of Claims, 'as an incident to the cost of performance of the contract, considered the cost of the Wickham machine to appellee although evidence of the same was submitted to it.' And further, 'if the court did find this item and did consider it in arriving at the judgment, appellant is entitled to know this.' Again, the government contends that 'so far as the findings are concerned it does not appear that the court allowed a reasonable deduction from the amount of the judgment by reason of appellee's release from care, trouble, risk and responsibility attending the performance of the contract.'\n To the contentions there may be off set the decision of the Court of Claims. The court in its opinion expressly declares that the findings showed that the Envelope Company had fulfilled all the requirements of the Postmaster General and was ready and willing to furnish the envelopes and wrappers and recognized, we may assume, as grounds to be considered the elements the government urges, so far as the court deemed them relevant or as having any probative strength, and its appreciation of them was obtained after protracted litigation involving two complete trials. We are not, therefore, disposed, on assertions so elusive or disputable of estimation as those of the government, to reverse or modify the judgment.\n There are other contentions of the government which we may pass without comment except one which it submits upon a supplemental brief. It is addressed to the rule of damages adopted by the Court of Claims and urges that it was erroneous, based on the theory, as it is as serted, \n\n[249 U.S. 313, 322]\n\u00a0\n that the Envelope Company 'had a contract which entitled it to furnish all the stamped envelopes and wrappers of the sizes mentioned in the specification, which the Post Office Department should need [italics counsel's] during the four years contract.' This is denied, and it is said, quoting the contract, that the Envelope Company was only to 'furnish and deliver promptly and in quantities as ordered,' the envelopes and wrappers 'that it may be called upon by the Post Office Department to furnish during the four years.' It is difficult to treat the contention seriously. There is something surprising in the declaration that a contract to supply a great department of the government with envelopes and newspaper wrappers which it might need for a period of four years at a cost of nearly two and one-half million dollars bore but scant obligation upon the part of the government, or, to be precise and in the language of counsel, that the Envelope Company 'could not have forced the giving of orders [by the government] in excess of fifteen days' supply,' and that this was the extent of the government's obligation. And the further contention is, that the obligation being thus limited the damages the Envelope Company was entitled to were, at most, 'the expenses, incurred in getting ready to perform the contract, and the profits it would have derived from the manufacture and sale' of such fifteen days' supply-that all else was expectation and cannot be capitalized by the Envelope Company and made the basis of profits and the responsibility of the government. If the contention be more than dialectical we may express wonder that it was not given prominence in the Court of Claims and that in this court it was reserved for the afterthought of a supplemental brief. The further answer may be made that the contract of the Envelope Company was not so dependent as urged, and that its expectation was substantial is evidenced by the haste of the department, after the revocation of the contract \n\n[249 U.S. 313, 323]\n\u00a0\n with the company, to declare an emergency in its need and enter into a contract with other companies.\n On January 13th the government made a motion to remand the case to the Court of Claims for additional findings. It was denied, but the right reserved to make such order if we should be so advised. Our attention is directed to the motion, which it is submitted should be considered on the merits. Again considering the motion and the case as it has been developed by argument of counsel, we think the motion should not be granted. The judgment of the Court of Claims is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","216":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. SOUTHERN PAC CO.(1919)\nNo. 179\nArgued: Decided: November 17, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[251 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. Crawford Biggs, of Raleigh, N. C., and Assistant Attorney General Kearful, for the United States.\n Messrs. Charles R. Lewers, and William F. Herrin, both of San Francisco, Cal., for appellee.\n\n\n[251 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the United States to cancel a patent issued December 12, 1904, to the Southern Pacific Railroad Company for eight full and two partial sections of land within the indemnity limits of the grant made to that company by an act of Congress (Act July 27, 1866, c. 278, 14 Stat. 292), it being charged in the bill that the railroad company \n\n[251 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n fraudulently obtained the patent by falsely representing to the land department that the lands were not mineral but agricultural, when it was known that they were mineral. From the evidence presented the District Court found that the charge was true and entered a decree of cancellation, and this was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting. Southern Pac. Co. v. United States, 249 Fed. 785, 162 C. C. A. 19.\n'All mineral lands' other than those containing coal or iron were excluded from the grant, and this exclusion embraced oil lands. Burke v. Southern Pacific R. R. Co., \n234 U.S. 669\n, 676-679, 34 Sup. Ct. 907. As will be seen presently, there can be no doubt that the patent was procured by representing that the lands were not mineral. Whether this representation was false turns upon the character of the lands as known when the patent was sought and obtained. If they then were known to be valuable for oil, as the government asserts they were, they were mineral in the sense of the granting act.\n\n To compensate for losses to the grant within its primary limits the railroad company was entitled to select other lands of like area within the indemnity limits, approval by the Secretary of the Interior being essential to passing the selections to patent. The established mode of making the selections was by presenting at the local land office selection lists designating the lands lost and those selected, with supporting affidavits showing, among other things, that the lands selected were of the character contemplated, that is to say, were not mineral but agricultural. These lists and affidavits would then be examined in that office and in the General Land Office, and until mately the selections would be passed to the Secretary of the Interior for his action. That course was followed here.\n The original list was presented November 14, 1903, but it encountered obstacles which led to the presentation of a substituted list covering the same lands on September \n\n[251 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n 6, 1904. Both lists were presented by the company's land agent, Mr. Eberlein, and were accompanied by affidavits made by him stating that the lands selected 'are not interdicted mineral,' but 'are of the character contemplated by the grant,' and that 'he has caused' them 'to be carefully examined by the agents and employes of said company as to their mineral or agricultural character, and that to the best of his knowledge and belief none of the lands returned in said list are mineral lands.' In acting on the substituted list the officers of the Land Department relied upon and gave effect to the statements in the supporting affidavits, and the selections were accordingly approved and passed to patent.\n In truth Mr. Eberlein had not examined the lands or caused them to be examined by others. Nor had any examination of them been made on behalf of the railroad company, save such as is inferable from the conduct of its geologists and others presently to be noticed.\n The lands were in the Elk Hills in Kern county, California; were rough, semi-arid and unfit for cultivation; were devoid of timber, springs or running water; and had but little value for grazing. Oil had been discovered in that region as early as 1899, and this had been followed by development and production on an extensive scale. In 1903 and 1904 there were many producing wells about 25 miles to the east and many within a much shorter distance to the west and south, some within 3 or 4 miles. The railroad company was then maintaining a corps of geologists-all informed by experience in the California oil fields-and under their supervision was searching for, developing and producing oil for fuel purposes. In 1902, upon the recommendation of one of its geologists, it withdrew from sale many of its patented lands surrounding and adjacent to those in suit 'because they were in or near oil territory,' and early in 1903 it entered upon a systematic examination of its lands in \n\n[251 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n that territory 'to determine as far as can be done from surface indications and geological structure where oil is to be expected in this region.' In a letter to Mr. Kruttschnitt, one of the company's vice presidents, the chief geologist said when about to take up the examination:\n'So far as I can judge from the trip I have just made over this territory, this work promises results of greatest value to the company.'\n\n The lands in suit were surveyed in 1901 and the approved plat was filed in the local land office in May, 1903. The field notes denominated the lands as mineral and described them as in a mineral district 'within which many successful oil wells have been developed.' As before stated, the original selection list was presented November 14, 1903. Mr. Kruttschnitt already had written to the company's attorney at Washington requesting that 'special attention' be given to securing a patent for the lands when selected, and shortly thereafter Mr. Eberlein wrote to the attorney, saying:\n'I am particularly anxious in regard to this list as the lands adjoin the oil territory, and Mr. Kruttschnitt is very solicitous in regard to it.'\n\n Other letters and telegrams show that this special concern or anxiety persisted until the patent was issued.\n In 1903 the company concluded to lease such of its lands as were considered 'valuable for oil purposes' to a subsidiary company, which was to be a sort of fuel department and to have charge of the development and production of oil. The geologists were requested to designate the lands to be thus leased and as a result of their investigation and recommendation several sections adjacent to and some immediately adjoining those in suit were included. The lease was to be signed on behalf of the railroad company by Mr. Eberlein as land agent and was laid before him for that purpose on August 2, 1904. Perceiving at once that its execution would not be in accord \n\n[251 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n with his action in pressing the pending selection list he took the matter up with some of his superiors. To one he said in a letter:\n'We have selected a large body of lands interspersed with the lands sought to be conveyed by this lease, and which we have represented as non-mineral in character. Should the existence of this lease become known it would go a long way toward establishing the mineral character of the lands referred to, and which are still unpatented. We could not successfully resist a mineral filing after we have practically established the mineral character of the land. I would suggest delay at least until this matter of patent can be adjusted.'\n\n To the same officer he protested against the action of the geologists in examining unpatented lands because 'it was charging the company with notice.' And to another, in New York, he explained 'all phases of the matter,' with the result that the 'impropriety of the lease at that time' and the 'very ambiguous position in which we would be placed' were recognized, and he was instructed to withhold his signature and to place and keep all correspondence and papers relating to the lease in a separate and private file not accessible to others. He followed the instruction and the special or secret file remained in his possession 'until,' as he testified, 'it was pried out' at the hearing.\n But, notwithstanding what was brought to his attention through the proposed oil lease, Mr. Eberlein continued actively to press the pending selection, and when, about a month later, he presented the substituted selection list it was accompanied by affidavits wherein he repeated his prior representation that the lands were not mineral. After presenting this list he had a conference with the chief geologist which prompted the latter, when writing to a superior officer, to explain that --\n'For reasons of policy regarding certain unpatented lands it will be best not to execute the lease ... at present.' \n\n[251 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n The lease was placed by Mr. Eberlein in the special or secret file and some time afterward, when an effort was made to find it, he denied all knowledge of it. The denial was brought to the attention of the chief geologist, and he at once wrote to Mr. Eberlein calling attention to the conference just mentioned, and stating:\n\n'You explain that you were rushing certain lands for final patent and that the immediate execution of the lease showing our idea of what were oil lands might interfere with you and we agreed to defer the execution until that danger was passed.'\n\n The chief geologist was a witness at the hearing and when asked what danger was meant, answered:\n'The danger that these lands might be delayed and not be patented because of their mineral character.'\n\n All that has been recited thus far is proved so well that it is beyond dispute. Fairly considered, it shows that when the patent was sought and obtained the lands had no substantial value unless for oil mining; that the interest and anxiety displayed by the company's officers in securing the patent were wholly disproportionate to the value of the lands for any other purpose; that the lands lay within a recognized and productive oil region which the company's geologists had been systematically examining to determine in what lands oil was to be expected, and that upon the advice and recommendation of its geologists the company was treating and dealing with adjacent and adjoining lands, of which it was the owner, as valuable for oil. Of course among practical men the character-whether oil or otherwise-of these adjacent and adjoining lands had some bearing on the character of those in suit, and this was given pointed recognition when the company's officers halted the signing of the proposed oil lease pending action on the selection list and caused the correspondence and papers relating to the lease to be secreted in a special and private file.\n We think the natural, if not the only, conclusion from \n\n[251 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n all this is that in pressing the selection the officers of the railroad company were not acting in good faith, but were attempting to obtain the patent by representing that the lands were not mineral when they believed the fact was otherwise.\n The observable geological and other physical conditions at the time of the patent proceedings, as shown by the evidence, were as follows: The area called the Elk Hills was about 6 miles wide and 15 long and constituted an anticlinal fold or elongated dome-an occurrence favorable to the accumulation and retention of oil. The lands in suit were about its center. From 5 to 10 miles to the west was the Temblor Range, the main uplift of that region. Along the east flank of that uplift for a distance of 30 miles was a series of outcrops or exposures of Monterey ( diatomaceous) shales, the source of oil in California, and porous sandstone in which oil generally finds its ultimate reservoir. These strata were of exceptional thickness and it was apparent that oil in considerable quantity had been seeping or wasting from the sandstone. The dip of the strata was towards the Elk Hills and there were no indications of any faulting or thinning in that direction. Between the outcrop and the Elk Hills upwards of 200 wells had found the oil-bearing strata and were being profitably operated, several of the wells being on a direct line towards the lands in suit and within 3 or 4 miles of them. In and beyond the Elk Hills were oil seepages and other surface indications of the existence of oil in the underlying strata, one of the seepages being near the lands in suit. Two wells had been sunk in the Elk Hills, but obviously had not gone to an adequate depth and were not productive, although some oil was reached by one.\n Geologists and men of wide experience and success in oil mining-all of whom had examined that territory and \n\n[251 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n some of whom had been familiar with it for years-were called as witnesses by the government and gave it as their opinion, having regard to the known conditions in 1903 and 1904, as just outlined, that the lands were valuable for oil, in that an ordinarily prudent man, understanding the hazards and rewards of oil mining and desiring to engage therein for profit, would be justified in purchasing the lands for such mining and making the expenditures incident to their development, and in that a competent geologist or expert in oil mining, if employed to advise in the matter, would have ample warrant for advising the purchase and expenditure.\n Other geologists and oil operators, called by the company, gave it as their opinion that the lands were not, under the conditions stated, valuable for oil; but as respects the testimony of some it is apparent that they were indisposed to regard any lands as within that category until they were demonstrated to be certainly such by wells actually drilled thereon and producing oil in paying quantities after a considerable period of pumping. This is a mistaken test, in that it takes no account of geological conditions, adjacent discoveries and other external conditions upon which prudent and experienced men in the oil- mining regions are shown to be accustomed to act and make large expenditures. And the testimony of some of these witnesses is weakened by the fact that their prior acts in respect of these lands, or others in that vicinity similarly situated, were not in accord with the opinions which they expressed.\n After considering all the evidence, we think it is adequately shown that the lands were known to be valuable for oil when the patent was sought and obtained, and by this we mean that the known conditions at that time were such as reasonably to engender the belief that the lands contained oil of such quality and in such quantity as would render its extraction profitable and justify expenditures \n\n[251 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n to that end. See Diamond Coal Co. v. United States, \n233 U.S. 236\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 507.\n The railroad company places some reliance on the fact that after the presentation of the original selection list and before the substituted one was tendered a special agent of the General Land Office examined the lands and reported them as nonmineral. But there is nothing in this that can help the company. The agent's report was made in another connection and was not considered by the land officers when they approved the selection. It did not relieve the company from showing that the lands selected were not mineral; nor did the company understand that it had any such effect. Mr. Eberlein knew of the report several months before he and other officers of the company became troubled over the proposed oil lease and concluded that, if given publicity, it would endanger the pending selection. Besides, if the report could be considered here, it would be without any real evidential value, for it appears from testimony given by the agent at the hearing that he was not a geologist or familiar with oil mining and that his examination of the lands was at best only superficial.\n The company makes the contention that drilling done since the patent was issued has demonstrated that the lands have no value for oil. Assuming, without so deciding, that the contention would help the company if sustained by the evidence, we think it is not sustained. The drilling relied upon was done after 1909 upon lands in the Elk Hills other than those in suit. Several wells were started and not more than three were successful. The three were the only ones that were drilled in favorable locations and to an adequate depth, and they penetrated oil sands of considerable thickness and produced a large quantity of oil, but were shut down for reasons not made clear by the record. They were drilled by an oil company which was controlled by the railroad company. \n\n[251 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n The other wells failed for reasons which prevent the outcome from having any significance here. In some the drilling was not carried to an adequate depth because the right to proceed was thought to be uncertain by reason of an executive withdrawal of the lands.\n We conclude that the application of prior decisions to the case made by the evidence entitles the government to the relief sought as was held by the District Court.

UNION PAC R. CO.(1919)\nNo. 199\nArgued: January 30, 1919Decided: March 31, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Brown, for the United States.\n Messrs. William R. Harr and Charles H. Bates, both of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Most of the acts of Congress which granted lands in aid of railroads provide that they shall be 'free from toll or other charge upon the transportation of any property or troops of the United States.' \n1\n This clause was \n\n[249 U.S. 354, 355]\n\u00a0\n construed in Lake Superior & Mississippi Railroad Co. v. United States, \n93 U.S. 442\n, as conferring only the free use of the roadbed as a highway. Since then, under appropriate legislation, payment has come to be made by the government for the transportation of property and troops at rates equal to 50 per cent. of those charged private parties. The Union Pacific, having entered into an agreement to that effect, claimed payment at the full rate for certain persons carried as passengers upon the request of the government. The Auditor of the War Department refused to allow payment for these passengers at more than half fares, on the ground that they were within the provision for transporting 'troops of the United States'; and his ruling was sustained by the Comptroller of the Treasury. 21 Decisions of the Comptroller, 651. Thereupon this suit was brought in the Court of Claims for the amount disallowed; and judgment was rendered for the railroad. 52 Ct. Cl. 226. The case is here on appeal. The questions presented are \n\n[249 U.S. 354, 356]\n\u00a0\n whether any of the following classes of persons are to be deemed 'troops of the United States' within the provision of the land grant acts:\n\n 1. \nDischarged soldiers; that is, former enlisted men of the army en route to their homes after discharge.\n\n 2. \nDischarged military prisoners; that is, discharged enlisted men en route to their homes or elsewhere after serving sentence as military prisoners.\n\n 3. \nRejected applicants for enlistment in the army; that is, men who having passed the required tests at the recruiting stations and having been forwarded to the recruiting depots for final examination and enlistment, were there rejected and were being returned to the recruiting stations from which they came.\n\n 4. \nAccepted applicants for enlistment in the army; that is, applicants examined at general recruiting stations, found mentally, morally, and physically fit for service, and being forwarded to recruiting depots for final examination and enlistment.\n\n 5. \nRetired soldiers; that is, enlisted men of the army en route to their homes after retirement.\n\n 6. \nFurloughed soldiers; that is, enlisted men of the army on furlough en route back to their proper stations.\n None of these persons traveled as part of a moving army, troop, or body of soldiers; that is, they traveled separately as individuals, and ( with few exceptions) each on a different day and to widely scattered destinations. Under recent acts of Congress and Army Regulations,2 the transportation of persons of some of these classes is paid for by the government.\n In defining the transportation rights secured to the United States, these land grant acts draw a broad distinction between freight and passengers. All 'property' \n\n[249 U.S. 354, 357]\n\u00a0\n of the government, whatever its character and intended use, is to be carried 'free of toll or other charge'; but of the many persons in its service, only 'troops.' The history of the legislation shows that both the broad term, 'any property,' and the narrower one, 'troops,' was adopted deliberately. The earliest land grant act in which the provision appears is that of September 20, 1850 (9 Stat. 466, 467, c. 61,  4), under which the Illinois Central was constructed. The bill as introduced3 provided for the free transportation of 'troops and munitions of war.' It was amended so as to read 'any property or troops.' There had been an earlier act granting land to the state of Illinois for the construction of a canal ( Act March 30, 1822, c. 14, 3 Stat. 659), which was amended (Act March 2, 1833, c. 87, 4 Stat. 662) so as to permit, on the same terms, the use and disposition of the land for railroads. That act provided for the free transportation of 'any property of the United States or persons in their service.'\n In 1850 the word 'troops' had (and it has ever since had) an established meaning namely, 'soldiers collectively-a body of soldiers.' Thus the army appropriation act of that year (Act Sept. 28, 1850, c. 78,  1, 9 Stat. 504, 506) provides for the 'transportation of the army including the baggage of the troops when moving either by land or water' and for 'mileage, or the allowance made to officers for the transportation of themselves and baggage when traveling on duty without troops.' The contemporary legislation draws a clear distinction also between troops, that is, those then having the status of soldiers, and those who once had been in, or were seeking to enter, the military service. Thus the army appropriation act of March 2, 1847 (9 Stat. 149, 151, c. 35), which provides in substantially the \n\n[249 U.S. 354, 358]\n\u00a0\n same terms as that of 1850 for the transportation of troops, makes specific provision for 'forwarding destitute soldiers to their homes,' for the 'comfort of discharged soldiers,' and for 'expenses of recruiting,' which include the cost of transportation. See Army Regulations, 1857,  1321. And the resolution of March 3, 1847, 9 Stat. 206 (No. 7), authorizes the refund of moneys expended by the states and individuals 'in organizing, subsisting, and transporting volunteers previous to their being mustered and received into the service of the United States for the present war, and for subsisting troops in the service of the United States.' In view of the established meaning of the term 'troops' as used by Congress the duty of the court is merely to apply the provisions of the act to the several classes of persons described above.\n First. The first three classes, namely, discharged military prisoners, discharged enlisted men, and rejected applicants for enlistment, are clearly not 'troops of the United States.' Their status is that of the civilian. They form no part of the military establishment. They may go where they please and do what they please, subject to no more interference by the military authorities of the government, than if they had never been, or had never sought to be, connected with the army. They were traveling for their own personal ends. Congress recognizes the distinction between those forming part of the army and those who do not, because they are recruits or have been discharged; and it makes special provision for their transportation. \n4\n Such had formerly been also the opinion of the Comptroller of the Treasury. Compare Digest, Second Comptroller's Decisions, vol. 4,  354 and 355. \n\n[249 U.S. 354, 359]\n\u00a0\n Second. Applicants for enlistment who have been accepted provisionally, but have yet to be subjected to the final examination at the recruiting depots and to take the oath before they become a part of the soldiery of the nation, are not 'troops of the United States.' It is the actual enlistment, the oath of allegiance, that changes the status from a civilian to soldier. Compare In re Grimley, \n137 \nU.S. 147, 156\n, 157 S., 11 Sup. Ct. 54; Tyler v. Pomeroy, 8 Allen (Mass.) 480; 19 Decisions of the Comptroller, 367; Army Regulations, 1913,  847. The officers at the recruiting stations are expressly forbidden to administer this oath. Army Regulations, 1913,  841. Such applicant is then not even a potential soldier; for he may be rejected on final examination. \n5\n And it is the actual and not the potential status that must govern. Compare Alabama Great Southern Railroad Co. v. United States, 49 Ct. Cl. 522, 537. The fact that under the Army Regulations he receives the same rations as an enlisted man, and that he is subject to the same medical attention,6 does not effect a change of status. And the fact that the transportation is for the purposes of the government in connection with its military establishment is immaterial. Workmen in armor plants and civilian clerks in the War Department at Washington travel for purposes of the government, but are obviously not 'troops of the United States' within the meaning of the land-grant legislation. The army appropriation acts make specific provision for the transportation of 'troops' and of 'recruits.' \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[249 U.S. 354, 360]\n\u00a0\n Third. Retired enlisted men en route to their homes after retirement are also not 'troops of the United States.' They travel for their own purposes. Congress has declared that such retired men shall for certain purposes be deemed a part of the army (Act Feb. 2, 1901, c. 192,  1, 31 Stat. 748 [Comp. St.  1717]); but they may be employed only after Congress has authorized the raising of volunteer forces, and not even then for field duty (Act April 25, 1914, c. 71,  11, 38 Stat. 347, 350 [Comp. St.  2026h]). The Army Regulations for 1913 make no provision requiring any service from retired enlisted men. Practically they have retired from, and not simply into a different branch of, the army. Compare Murphy v. United States, 38 Ct. Cl. 511, 522; Army Regulations, 1913, article 20. See also United States v. Tyler, \n105 U.S. 244\n. The fact that they may thereafter be called into the army does not make them 'troops of the United States.' Any male citizen may at some time be called into the service. Compare Alabama Great Southern Railroad Co. v. United States, supra.\n Fourth. The furloughed soldier is, of course, a part of the army or troops of the United States; but his transportation back to the proper station, is not 'transportation of troops' within the meaning of the land grant acts. The furloughed soldier travels for his own purposes. The government merely advances to him the cost of transportation and subsistence while on furlough; and does this, only if the soldier lacks funds to bear the expense himself. The advance must be repaid. Army Regulations, 1913,  110.\n We have no occasion to consider whether persons not enlisted as soldiers, but forming a part of a moving army or detachment are to be deemed 'troops of the United States' within the provision of the land grant acts; nor whether a soldier traveling for the purposes of the government, but not for any purpose connected with war \n\n[249 U.S. 354, 361]\n\u00a0\n or the preparation for war, falls within the provisions. 19 Opinions of the Attorney General, 572.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims granting full compensation for carriage of persons within the six classes considered is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Circular No. 16, Quartermaster General's Office, 1912, entitled 'Schedule of Land-Grant and Bond-Aided Railroads of the United States,' p. 28 et seq. Act Sept. 20, 1850, c. 61,  4, 9 Stat. 466, 467. A few of the acts granting lands in aid of railroads provided that the grant is 'subject to such regulations as Congress may impose restricting the charges for ... government transportation.' Act July 27, 1866, c. 278,  11, 14 Stat. 292, 297. The army appropriation acts make provision for payment under both classes of statutes, payment in neither case to exceed 50 per cent. of the rates charged private parties. See Act July 16, 1892, c. 195, 27 Stat. 174, 180; Act March 2, 1913, c. 93, 37 Stat. 704, 715. Fifty per cent. has been adopted by the War Department as the standard rate of payment. The Union Pacific on May 15, and June 3, 1911, became a party to the so-called 'Land Grant Equalization Agreements' entered into by the Quartermaster General of the United States with most of the important roads of the United States in other than New England or Trunk Line territories. By these agreements, the several roads consented (with certain exceptions) to accept the same net rate on both passenger and freight traffic via their respective lines as are effective via land grant lines.

Its reasoning and conclusions are set out in a written opinion. 253 Fed. 522.\n We are confronted by an uncertain interpretation of an indictment itself couched in rather vague and general language. Counsel differ radically concerning the meaning of the opinion below and there is much room for the controversy between them.\n The indictment runs only against Colgate & Co., a corporation engaged in manufacturing soap and toilet articles and selling them throughout the Union. It makes no reference to monopoly, and proceeds solely upon the theory of an unlawful combination. After setting out defendant's organization, place and character of business, and general methods of selling and distributing products through wholesale and retail merchants, it alleges:\n'During the aforesaid period of time, within the said Eastern district of Virginia and throughout the United States, the defendant knowingly and unlawfully created and engaged in a combination with said wholesale and retail dealers, in the Eastern district of Virginia and throughout the United States, for the purpose and with the effect of procuring adherence on the part of such dealers (in reselling such products sold to them aforesaid) to resale prices fixed by the defendant, and of preventing \n\n[250 U.S. 300, 303]\n\u00a0\n such dealers from reselling such products at lower prices, thus suppressing competition amongst such wholesale dealers, and amongst such retail dealers, in restraint of the aforesaid trade and commerce among the several States, in violation of the act entitled 'An act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies,' approved July 2, 1890.'\n\n Following this is a summary of things done to carry out the purposes of the combination: Distribution among dealers of letters, telegrams, circulars and lists showing uniform prices to be charged; urging them to adhere to such prices and notices, stating that no sales would be made to those who did not; requests, often complied with, for information concerning dealers who had departed from specified prices; investigation and discovery of those not adhering thereto and placing their names upon 'suspended lists;' requests to offending dealers for assurances and promises of future adherence to prices, which were often given; uniform refusals to sell to any who failed to give the same; sales to those who did; similar assurances and promises required of, and given by, other dealers followed by sales to them; unrestricted sales to dealers with established accounts who had observed specified prices, etc.\n Immediately thereafter comes this paragraph:\n'By reason of the foregoing, wholesale dealers in the aforesaid products of the defendant in the Eastern district of Virginia and throughout the United States, with few exceptions, resold, at uniform prices fixed by the defendant, the aforesaid products, sold to them by the defendant, and refused to resell such products at lower prices to retail dealers in the state where the respective wholesale dealers did business and in other states. For the same reason retail dealers in the aforesaid products of the defendant in the Eastern district of Virginia and throughout the United States resold, at uniform prices fixed by \n\n[250 U.S. 300, 304]\n\u00a0\n the defendant, the aforesaid products, sold to them by the defendant and by the aforesaid wholesale dealers, and refused to sell such products at lower prices to the consuming public in the states where the respective retail dealers did business and in other states. Thus competition in the sale of such products, by wholesale dealers to retail dealers, and by retail dealers to the consuming public, was suppressed, and the prices of such products to the retail dealers and to the consuming public in the Eastern district of Virginia and throughout the United States were maintained and enhanced.'\n\n In the course of its opinion the trial court said:\n'No charge is made that any contract was entered into by and on the part of the defendant, and any of its retail customers, in restraint of interstate trade and commerce, the averment being, in effect, that it knowingly and unlawfully created and engaged in a combination with certain of its wholesale and retail customers, to procure adherence on their part, in the sale of its products sold to them, to resale prices fixed by the defendant, and that, in connection therewith, such wholesale and retail customers gave assurances and promises, which resulted in the enhancement and maintenance of such prices, and in the suppression of competition by wholesale dealers and retail dealers, and by the latter to the consuming public. ...\n\n'In the view taken by the court, the indictment here fairly presents the question of whether a manufacturer of products shipped in interstate trade, is subject to criminal prosecution under the Sherman Act, for entering into a combination in restraint of such trade and commerce, because he agrees with his wholesale and retail customers, upon prices claimed by them to be fair and reasonable, at which the same may be resold, and \n\n[250 U.S. 300, 305]\n\u00a0\n declines to sell his products to those who will not thus stipulate as to prices. This, at the threshold, presents for the determination of the court, how far one may control and dispose of his own property; that is to say, whether there is any limitation thereon, if he proceeds in respect thereto in a lawful and bona fide manner. That he may not do so, fraudulently, collusively, and in unlawful combination with others, may be conceded. Eastern States Retail Lumber Dealers' Association v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 600, 614\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 951, L. R. A. 1915A, 788. But it by no means follows that being a manufacturer of a given article, he may not, without incurring any criminal liability, refuse absolutely to sell the same at any price, or to sell at a named sum to a customer, with the understanding that such customer will resell only at an agreed price between them, and should the customer not observe the understanding as to retail prices, exercise his undoubted right to decline further to deal with such person. ...\n\n'The pregnant fact should never be lost sight of that no averment is made of any contract or agreement having been entered into whereby the defendant, the manufacturer, and his customers, bound themselves to enhance and maintain prices, further than is involved in the circumstances that the manufacturer, the defendant here, refused to sell to persons who would not resell at indicated prices, and that certain retailers made purchases on this condition, whereas, inferentially, others declined so to do. No suggestion is made that the defendant, the manufacturer, attempted to reserve or retain any interest in the goods sold, or to restrain the vendee in his right to barter and sell the same without restriction. The retailer, after buying, could, if he chose, give away his purchase or sell it at any price he saw fit, or not sell it at all, his course in these respects being affected only by \n\n[250 U.S. 300, 306]\n\u00a0\n the fact that he might by his action incur the displeasure of the manufacturer who could refuse to make further sales to him, as he had the undoubted right to do. There is no charge that the retailers themselves entered into any combination or agreement with each other, or that the defendant acted other than with his customers individually.'\n\n Our problem is to ascertain, as accurately as may be, what interpretation the trial court placed upon the indictment-not to interpret it ourselves; and then to determine whether, so construed, it fairly charges violation of the Sherman Act. Counsel for the government maintain, in effect, that, as so interpreted, the indictment adequately charges an unlawful combination (within the doctrine of Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. Park & Sons Co., \n220 U.S. 373\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 376) resulting from restrictive agreements between defendant and sundry dealers whereby the latter obligated themselves not to resell except at agreed prices, and to support this position they specifically rely upon the above-quoted sentence in the opinion which begins, 'In the view taken by the court,' etc. On the other hand, defendant maintains that looking at the whole opinion it plainly construes the indictment as alleging only recognition of the manufacturer's undoubted right to specify resale prices and refuse to deal with any one who failed to maintain the same.\n Considering all said in the opinion (notwithstanding some serious doubts) we are unable to accept the construction placed upon it by the government. We cannot, e. g., wholly disregard the statement that--\n'The retailer, after buying, could, if he chose, give away his purchase or sell it at any price he saw fit, or not sell it at all, his course in these respects being affected only by the fact that he might by his action incur the displeasure of the manufacturer who could refuse to make further sales to him, as he had the undoubted right to do.'\n\n And we \n\n[250 U.S. 300, 307]\n\u00a0\n must conclude that, as interpreted below, the indictment does not charge Colgate & Co. with selling its products to dealers under agreements which obligated the latter not to resell except at prices fixed by the company.\n The position of the defendant is more nearly in accord with the whole opinion and must be accepted. And as counsel for the Government were careful to state on the argument that this conclusion would require affirmation of the judgment below, an extended discussion of the principles involved is unnecessary.\n The purpose of the Sherman Act is to prohibit monopolies, contracts and combinations which probably would unduly interfere with the free exercise of their rights by those engaged, or who wish to engage, in trade and commerce-in a word to preserve the right of freedom to trade. In the absence of any purpose to create or maintain a monopoly, the act does not restrict the long recognized right of trader or manufacturer engaged in an entirely private business, freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal; and, of course, he may announce in advance the circumstances under which he will refuse to sell. 'The trader or manufacturer, on the other hand, carries on an entirely private business, and can sell to whom he pleases.' United States v. Trans- Missouri Freight Association, \n166 \nU.S. 290, 320\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 540, 551 (41 L. Ed. 1007).

C., for the United States.\n\n\n[249 U.S. 86, 89]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Doremus was indicted for violating section 2 of the so-called Harrison Narcotic Drug Act. Act Dec. 17, 1914, c. 1, 38 Stat. 785 (6 U. S. Comp. Stat. 1916,  6287g). Upon demurrer to the indictment the District Court held the section unconstitutional for the reason that it was not a revenue measure, and was an invasion of the police power reserved to the state. 246 Fed. 958. The case is here under the Criminal Appeals Act March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246 (Comp. St.  1704). \n\n[249 U.S. 86, 90]\n\u00a0\n There are ten counts in the indictment. The first two were treated by the court below as sufficient to raise the constitutional question decided. The first count in substance charges that: Doremus, a physician, duly registered, and who had paid the tax required by the first section of the act, did unlawfully, fraudulently, and knowingly sell and give away and distribute to one Ameris a certain quantity of heroin, to wit, five hundred one-sixth grain tablets of heroin, a derivative of opium, the sale not being in pursuance of a written order on a form issued on the blank furnished for that purpose by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n The second count charges in substance that: Doremus did unlawfully and knowingly sell, dispense and distribute to one Ameris five hundred one- sixth grain tablets of heroin not in the course of the regular professional practice of Doremus and not for the treatment of any disease from which Ameris was suffering but as was well known by Doremus, Ameris was addicted to the use of the drug as a habit, being a person popularly known as a 'dope fiend,' and that Doremus did sell, dispense, and distribute the drug, heroin, to Ameris for the purpose of gratifying his appetite for the drug as an habitual user thereof.\n Section 1 of the act (section 6287g) requires persons who produce, import, manufacture, compound, deal in, dispense, sell, distribute, or give away opium or cocoa leaves or any compound, manufacture, salt, derivative or preparation thereof, to register with the collector of internal revenue of the district his name or style, place of business, and place or places where such business is to be carried on. At the time of such registry every person who produces, imports, manufactures, compounds, deals in, dispenses, sells, distributes, or gives away any of the said drugs is required to pay to the collector a special tax of $1 per annum. It is made unlawful for any person required to register \n\n[249 U.S. 86, 91]\n\u00a0\n under the terms of the act to produce, import, manufacture, compound, deal in, dispense, sell, distribute, or give away any of the said drugs without having registered and paid the special tax provided in the act.\n Section 2 (section 6287h) provides in part:\n'It shall be unlawful for any person to sell, barter, exchange, or give away any of the aforesaid drugs except in pursuance of a written order of the person to whom such article is sold, bartered, exchanged, or given, on a form to be issued in blank for that purpose by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Every person who shall accept any such order, and in pursuance thereof shall sell, barter, exchange, or give away any of the aforesaid drugs, shall preserve such order for a period of two years in such a way as to be readily accessible to inspection by any officer, agent, or employee of the Treasury Department duly authorized for that purpose, and the state, territorial, district, municipal, and insular officials named in section five of this act. Every person who shall give an order as herein provided to any other person for any of the aforesaid drugs shall, at or before the time of giving such order, make or cause to be made a duplicate thereof on a form to be issued in blank for that purpose by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and in case of the acceptance of such order, shall preserve such duplicate for a period of two years in such a way as to be readily accessible to inspection by the officers, agents, employees, and officials hereinbefore mentioned. Nothing contained in this section shall apply--\n\n'(a) To the dispensing or distribution of any of the aforesaid drugs to a patient by a physician, dentist, or venterinary surgeon regularly registered under this act in the course of his professional practice only: Provided, that such physician, dentist, or veterinary surgeon shall keep a record of all such drugs dispensed or distributed, showing the amount dispensed or distributed, the date and the \n\n[249 U.S. 86, 92]\n\u00a0\n name and address of the patient to whom such drugs are dispensed or distributed, except such as may be dispensed or distributed to a patient upon whom such physician, dentist or veterinary surgeon shall personally attend; and such record shall be kept for a period of two years from the date of dispensing or distributing such drugs, subject to inspection, as provided in this act.\n\n'(b) To the sale, dispensing, or distribution of any of the aforesaid drugs by a dealer to a consumer under and in pursuance of a written prescription issued by a physician, dentist, or veterinary surgeon registered under this act: Provided, however, that such prescription shall be dated as of the day on which signed and shall be signed by the physician, dentist, or veterinary surgeon who shall have issued the same: And provided further, that such dealer shall preserve such prescription for a period of two years from the day on which such prescription is filled in such a way as to be readily accessible to inspection by the officers, agents, employees, and officials hereinbefore mentioned.'\n\n It is made unlawful for any person to obtain the drugs by means of the order forms for any purpose other than the use, sale or distribution thereof by him in the conduct of a lawful business in said drugs, or the legitimate practice of his profession.\n It is apparent that the section makes sales of these drugs unlawful except to persons who have the order forms issued by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and the order is required to be preserved for two years in such way as to be readily accessible to official inspection. But it is not to apply (a) to physicians, etc., dispensing and distributing the drug to patients in the course of professional practice, the physician to keep a record thereof, except in the case of personal attendance upon a patient; and (b) to the sale, dispensing, or distributing of the drugs by a dealer upon a prescription issued by a physician, etc., \n\n[249 U.S. 86, 93]\n\u00a0\n registered under the act. Other exceptions follow which are unnecessary to the consideration of this case.\n Section 9 (section 62870) inflicts a fine or imprisonment, or both, for violation of the act.\n This statute purports to be passed under the authority of the Constitution, article 1,  8, which gives the Congress power 'To lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States; but all duties, imposts, and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States.'\n The only limitation upon the power of Congress to levy excise taxes of the character now under consideration is geographical uniformity throughout the United States. This court has often declared it cannot add others. Subject to such limitation Congress may select the subjects of taxation, and may exercise the power conferred at its discretion. License Tax Cases, 5 Wall. 462, 471. Of course Congress may not in the exercise of federal power exert authority wholly reserved to the states. Many decisions of this court have so declared. And from an early day the court has held that the fact that other motives may impel the exercise of federal taxing power does not authorize the courts to inquire into that subject. If the legislation enacted has some reasonable relation to the exercise of the taxing authority conferred by the Constitution, it cannot be invalidated because of the supposed motives which induced it. Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, 541, in which case this court sustained a tax on a state bank issue of circulating notes. McCray v. United States, \n195 U.S. 27\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 769, 1 Ann. Cas. 561, where the power was thoroughly considered, and an act levying a special tax upon oleomargarine artificially colored was sustained. And see Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107, 147\n, 153 S., 156, 31 Sup. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312, and cases cited.\n Nor is it sufficient to invalidate the taxing authority \n\n[249 U.S. 86, 94]\n\u00a0\n given to the Congress by the Constitution that the same business may be regulated by the police power of the state. License Tax Cases, 5 Wall. 462, supra.\n The act may not be declared unconstitutional because its effect may be to accomplish another purpose as well as the raising of revenue. If the legislation is within the taxing authority of Congress-that is sufficient to sustain it. In re Kollock, \n165 \nU.S. 526, 536\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 444.\n The legislation under consideration was before us in a case concerning section 8 of the act, and in the course of the decision we said:\n'It may be assumed that the statute has a moral end as well as revenue in view, but we are of opinion that the District Court, in treating those ends as to be reached only through a revenue measure and within the limits of a revenue measure, was right.' United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, \n241 \nU.S. 394, 402\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 658, 659, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 854.\n\n Considering the full power of Congress over excise taxation the decisive question here is: Have the provisions in question any relation to the raising of revenue? That Congress might levy an excise tax upon such dealers, and others who are named in section 1 of the act, cannot be successfully disputed. The provisions of section 2, to which we have referred, aim to confine sales to registered dealers and to those dispensing the drugs as physicians, and to those who come to dealers with legitimate prescriptions of physicians. Congress, with full power over the subject, short of arbitrary and unreasonable action which is not to be assumed, inserted these provisions in an act specifically providing for the raising of revenue. Considered of themselves, we think they tend to keep the traffic aboveboard and subject to inspection by those authorized to collect the revenue. They tend to diminish the opportunity of unauthorized persons to obtain the drugs and sell them clandestinely without paying the tax imposed by the federal law. This case well illustrates the possibility which may have induced Congress to insert \n\n[249 U.S. 86, 95]\n\u00a0\n the provisions limiting sales to registered dealers and requiring patients to obtain these drugs as a medicine from physicians or upon regular prescriptions. Ameris, being as the indictment charges, an addict may not have used this great number of doses for himself. He might sell some to others without paying the tax, at least Congress may have deemed it wise to prevent such possible dealings because of their effect upon the collection of the revenue.\n We cannot agree with the contention that the provisions of section 2, controlling the disposition of these drugs in the ways described, can have nothing to do with facilitating the collection of the revenue, as we should be obliged to do if we were to declare this act beyond the power of Congress acting under its constitutional authority to impose excise taxes. It follows that the judgment of the District Court must be reversed.\nREVERSED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE dissents because he is of opinion that the court below correctly held the act of Congress, in so far as it embraced the matters complained of, to be beyond the constitutional power of Congress to enact because to such extent the statute was a mere attempt by Congress to exert a power not delegated, that is, the reserved police power of the states.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, and Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concur in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","220":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. EX REL.

C., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[249 U.S. 367, 369]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Brown, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The relator, on April 30, 1915, filed his petition in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia for a writ of mandamus against Franklin K. Lane, as Secretary of the Interior.\n He alleged: That when serving as the duly appointed superintendent of Crater Lake National Park on June 7, 1913, the defendant requested him to resign; that protesting against such removal from office, he demanded that he be furnished with a statement in writing of the reasons for his removal and that he be given a reasonable time in which to answer; that upon June 28th, he received a telegram from the defendant notifying him that he had been removed, and directing that he should transfer all government property to his successor, who was named; that he refused to relinquish his position or to transfer the property until convinced that the order for his removal was lawful; and that upon July 20, he was forcibly ejected from the government office building and the records and papers of his office were seized by government officials.\n He further averred: That as such superintendent he was in the classified civil service of the government and that he could not lawfully be removed therefrom 'except for such cause as would promote the efficiency' of the service and for reasons stated in writing, which he must \n\n[249 U.S. 367, 370]\n\u00a0\n be given a reasonable opportunity to answer; that on July 1, 1913, he notified the defendant that he was able and willing to perform the duties of his office, that he had so continued to the time of the filing of his petition, and that he had made every reasonable effort to be restored to his position, but without avail.\n His prayer was that the defendant be required to answer his petition and that upon hearing a writ of mandamus should issue requiring the defendant to vacate the order for his dismissal, and to restore him to his former office.\n In response to a rule to show cause the defendant filed an answer, containing, among other things, this paragraph:\n'10. He denies the allegations of paragraph 10 to the extent that the same attempt to show that he has made every reasonable effort to be restored to the office of superintendent as aforesaid, in this: That if relator were improperly or unlawfully removed from said office, under circumstances such as to justify the interference of the courts, such condition existed immediately upon relator's removal from office and upon the Secretary's refusal to continue him in said office, notwithstanding which and notwithstanding that since said time, to wit, July 1, 1913, another person has been appointed to and has discharged the duties of said office and has received the salary and allowance therefor appropriated from time to time by Congress, the relator did not seek recourse to the courts until the lapse of nearly two years, and therein has by his gross laches barred any right to the relief sought if any such right ever existed.'\n\n A demurrer to this answer or return was filed stating as a ground:\n'Because no case is shown in said return why a writ of mandamus should not issue as prayed in the relator's petition.'\n\n This demurrer was overruled, and, the relator electing to stand on his demurrer, his petition was dismissed. \n\n[249 U.S. 367, 371]\n\u00a0\n It will be seen from this statement that although the relator was definitely removed from office as of June 30, 1913, and was forcibly ejected from the government office building on July 20, 1913, he did not file his petition until more than 20 months later, April 30, 1915. His only explanation for this delay is the allegation, which was denied, that he had made every reasonable effort to have his rights in the premises accorded him and to be restored to office, but without avail.\n Without discussion of the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to remove the relator without filing charges against him and giving him an opportunity to answer, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia on the ground of laches, and the case is here on writ of error.\n In this conclusion we fully concur.\n This court has lately said that while mandamus is classed as a legal remedy, it is a remedial process, which is awarded not as a matter of right, but in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion and upon equitable principles. Duncan Town Site v. Lane, Secretary, \n245 U.S. 308\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 99. It is an extraordinary remedy which will not be allowed in cases of doubtful right (In re Life & Fire Ins. Co. v. Wilson's Heirs, 8 Pet. 291, 302), and it is generally regarded as not embraced within statutes of limitation applicable to ordinary actions, but as subject to the equitable doctrine of laches ( Chapman v. County of Doughlas, \n107 \nU.S. 348, 355\n, 2 S. Sup. Ct. 62; Duke v. Turner, \n204 \nU.S. 623, 628\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 316, 9 Ann. Cas. 842).\n The remedy is provided for in a separate chapter (chapter 42) of the Code for the District of Columbia with detailed requirements which differ so greatly from the pleading and practice prescribed for ordinary actions that we cannot doubt that Congress intended to continue the special character which has been given the proceeding from our early judicial history (United States v. Judge Lawrence, 3 Dall. 42; 8 Pet. 291, 302, supra), \n\n[249 U.S. 367, 372]\n\u00a0\n and we cannot discover any intention to include it within the general provisions for the limitation of actions (section 1265).\n When a public official is unlawfully removed from office, whether from disregard of the law by his superior or from mistake as to the facts of his case, obvious considerations of public policy make it of first importance that he should promptly take the action requisite to effectively assert his rights, to the end that if his contention be justified the government service may be disturbed as little as possible and that two salaries shall not be paid for a single service.\n Under circumstances which rendered his return to the service impossible, except under the order of a court, the relator did nothing to effectively assert his claim for reinstatement to office for almost two years. Such a long delay must necessarily result in changes in the branch of the service to which he was attached and in such an accumulation of unearned salary that, when unexplained, the manifest inequity which would result from reinstating him, renders the application of the doctrine of laches to his case peculiarly appropriate in the interests of justice and sound public policy.\n In this conclusion we are in full agreement with many state courts in dealing with similar problems. McCabe v. Police Board, 107 La. 162, 31 South. 662; Stone v. Board of Commissioners, 164 Ky. 640, 176 S. W. 39; Connolly v. Board of Education, 114 App. Div. 1, 99 N. Y. Supp. 737, and cases cited; Clark v. City of Chicago, 233 Ill. 113, 84 N. E. 170.\n We agree with the Court of Appeals that it is entirely unnecessary to consider whether the removal of the relator from office was technically justified or not, since by his own conduct he has forfeited the right to have the action of the Secretary of the Interior reviewed, and the judgment of that court is therefore\n Affirmed \n\n\n\n","221":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. BOARD OF COM'RS OF OSAGE COUNTY, OKL.(1919)\nNo. 309\nArgued: April 16, 1919Decided: December 15, 1919\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. Leslie C. Garnett, of Mathews, Va., for the United States.\n Messrs. Preston A. Shinn and Corbett Cornett, both of Pawhuska, Okl., for appellees. \n\n[251 U.S. 128, 129]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Although the subject was fully stated in McCurdy v. United States, \n246 U.S. 263\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 289, nevertheless, to throw light on this case, we recall the facts concerning the distribution of the land and funds of the Osage Tribe of Indians made under the Act of Congress of June 28, 1906, c. 3572, 34 Stat. 539.\n Of the tribal land there were reserved from allotment certain parcels, some of which were used by the United States or the tribe and others of which were used by individuals for the benefit of the tribe. From the remainder, each member was allotted three tracts of 160 acres each, of which one was to be designated and held as a homestead. Any land which remained was also to be allotted. The funds in trust in the hands of the United States were divided pro rata, to be held subject to the supervision of the United States. The oil, gas, coal, and other mineral rights in all the lands were reserved for the benefit of the tribe. The tract selected as a homestead was made inalienable and nontaxable, subject to the action of Congress. The land embraced by other than the homestead allotment, called surplus land, was made inalienable for a period of 25 years and nontaxable for 3, subject to the action of Congress. Power was conferred, however, on the Secretary of the Interior to give to the allottee a certificate of competency, upon receipt of which the surplus land held by such an allottee become immediately alienable and taxable.\n In September, 1917, the United States District Attorney for the District of Oklahoma, by direction of the Attorney General, commenced this suit in the name of the United States, for the benefit of named noncompetent members of the Osage Tribe and of all other members \n\n[251 U.S. 128, 130]\n\u00a0\n in the same situation, to prevent the enforcement of state and local taxes assessed against the surplus, although taxable, lands of said Indians for the 8 years between 1910 and 1917 inclusive.\n The defendants were the board of county commissioners of Osage county, including the county clerk and county treasurer, officials charged by the laws of the state with the enforcement of the taxes which were assailed. After averring the existence of authority in the United States, in virtue of its guardianship of the Indians and as a result of the terms of the allotment act, to protect and safeguard the interests of the Indians from the enforcement of the illegal taxes complained of, the bill charged that the taxes in issue were--\n'arbitrary, grossly excessive, discriminatory and unfair, and were made in violation of the rights of the said Osage Indians guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the state of Oklahoma; ... that the state board of equalization arbitrarily and systematically increased the assessments on such Indian lands for the year 1911 to an amount approximately nearly double the original amount of such assessments. ...'\n\n It was averred that the tax assessments made on the Indian lands involved--\n'were made without an inspection or examination of the land; ... that the said appraisers in making such appraisements discriminated against the lands of the Osage Indians as a class and systematically overvalued the same and systematically undervalued other property in said county; ... that the assessments so made by said assessors were made in such an arbitrary and capricious manner as to amount to constructive fraud upon the taxpayers; and that the overvaluations made by said assessors were so grossly excessive as to justify the interference of a court of equity. ...'\n\n It was alleged that the assessments complained of were of such a character that the \n\n[251 U.S. 128, 131]\n\u00a0\n Secretary of the Interior had endeavored to have them corrected, but without result; that, in consequence of his having called the attention of Congress to the subject, the Act of March 2, 1917, c. 146,  17, 39 Stat. 983 (Comp. St. 1918, 4137a), was passed authorizing an appraisement by the said Secretary for the purpose of fixing the extent of the overassessment and that such appraisement, which had been virtually completed, sustained the charges set forth in the bill.\n There was annexed to the bill a statement of the result of the appraisement in 36 cases as compared with the assessments complained of. In one case it was alleged that the land of the Indian was assessed at $20 an acre, although by the affidavit of the county clerk it was shown that it was worth $3 per acre. In another case it was alleged that, for the purpose of taxation, the land was shown to be overvalued by 119 per cent. It was further averred that an offer had been made through the Secretary of the Interior to pay all the taxes assessed for all the years assailed upon the basis of the assessment made as the result of the act of Congress, but that the same had been refused, and that process for the sale of the lands for delinquent taxes was immediately threatened. The prayer was for relief by injunction as against the illegal assessments and for action by the court looking to a payment of all delinquent taxes due by noncompetent Osage Indians on the basis of the appraisement made under the act of Congress.\n On motion the court dismissed the bill on the ground--\n'That the lands involved were by the act of Congress, approved June 28, 1906, declared subject to taxation, and that the plaintiff has no interest in said lands, and has no duty or authority to contest the taxes thereof, or the sale of said lands for unpaid taxes. ...'\n\n On appeal the decree was affirmed on the ground that as the state law afforded adequate means to the United States and the noncompetent Indians to correct errors in assessing \n\n[251 U.S. 128, 132]\n\u00a0\n taxes, if any, there was no basis for invoking relief from a court of equity.\n The argument here is exclusively directed to two grounds, the one enforced by the trial court and the other sustained by the court below. The first, however, is in argument here expanded into two points of view, since it challenges not only the authority of the officers of the United States to bring the suit, but the power of the United States to authorize them to do it. So far as the latter aspect is concerned, it proceeds upon the assumption that by the act of 1906 the United States exhausted its power as the protector and guardian of the Osage Indians and as to them had no longer any mission or authority whatever. We pass from this contention without further notice, as it is so obviously opposed to the doctrine upon the subject settled from the beginning and so in conflict with the terms of the act of Congress that nothing more need to be said concerning it. As to the first point of view, the proposition is this: That as the act of 1906 subjected the surplus lands to taxation, it therefore brought them under the taxing laws of the state, and, it is insisted, that having been so brought, it results that until Congress otherwise provides there exists no lawful authority in an officer of the United States to act in the name of the United States for the purpose of attacking the legality of a tax levied upon said lands under the laws of the state. But although the premise upon which the argument proceeds be admitted, that is, that in subjecting the lands to state taxation it was the purpose of Congress to subject them to the methods of levying and collecting the taxes provided by state law, including the remedial processes for the correction of errors, we fail to understand what relation that concession can have to the case in hand, since on the face of the pleadings the action taken by the United States was not to frustrate the act of Congress by preventing the operation of the state \n\n[251 U.S. 128, 133]\n\u00a0\n law, but to prevent the systematic violation of the state law committed for the purpose of destroying the rights created by the act of Congress. The argument therefore disregards the foundation for the relief sought and the proceeds upon the assumption that the exertion of power to prevent a perversion of state laws made to defeat the rights which the act of Congress gave is to be treated as a violation of the act of Congress and a refusal to apply the state law.\n Certain is it that as the United States as guardian of the Indians had the duty to protect them from spoliation and, therefore, the right to prevent their being illegally deprived of the property rights conferred under the act of Congress of 1906, the power existed in the officers of the United States to invoke relief for the accomplishment of the purpose stated. Indeed the act of Congress of 1917, providing for the appraisement of the lands in question, by necessary implication, if not in express terms, treated the power of the officers of the United States to resist the illegal assessments as undoubted.\n And the existence of power in the United States to sue which is thus established disposes of the proposition that because of remedies afforded to individuals under the state law the authority of a court of equity could not be invoked by the United States. This necessarily follows because, in the first place, as the authority of the United States extended to all the noncompetent members of the tribe it obviously resulted that the interposition of a court of equity to prevent the wrong complained of was essential in order to avoid a multiplicity of suits (see Union Pacific Ry. Co. v. Cheyenne, \n113 U.S. 516\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 601; Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466, 517\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 418; Cruickshank v. Bidwell, \n176 \nU.S. 73, 81\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 280; Boise Artesian Water Co. v. Boise City, \n213 \nU.S. 276, 283\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 426; Greene v. Louisville & Interurban R. R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 499, 506\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 673, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 88); in the second place because, as the wrong relied upon was not a mere mistake or error \n\n[251 U.S. 128, 134]\n\u00a0\n committed in the enforcement of the state tax laws, but a systematic and intentional disregard of such laws by the state officers for the purpose of destroying the rights of the whole class of non-competent Indians who were subject to the protection of the United States, it follows that such class wrong and disregard of the state statute gave rise to the right to invoke the interposition of a court of equity in order that an adequate remedy might be afforded (Cummings v.

Andrews, both of Washington, D. C., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a review under Criminal Appeals Act March 2, 1907, 34 Stat. 1246, c. 2564 (Comp. St. 1916,  1704), of a judgment of the District Court sustaining a demurrer to an indictment found under section 215 of the Criminal Code (Act March 4, 1909, 35 Stat. 1088, 1130, c. 321 [Comp. St. 1916,  10385]).\n That section provides:\n'Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, ... shall, for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, or attempting so to do, place, or cause to be placed, any letter ... in any post office, or station thereof, ... to be sent or delivered by the post-office establishment of the United States ... shall be fined, ...' etc.\n\n The indictment contains four counts, but a recital of the first will suffice, since the others adopt by reference that part of its averments upon which is raised the question we have to determine. Omitting formal matters, that count recites that Comyns and Byron had devised a scheme and artifice to defraud nine persons named and \n\n[248 U.S. 349, 351]\n\u00a0\n divers other persons to the grand jurors unknown, that is to say, to obtain from them and each of them their moneys and property by means of divers false and fraudulent pretenses and representations and to induce the victims to give to the defendants and each of them such moneys and property, with the intent on the part of the defendants and each of them to convert the same to their own use, which scheme was as follows: That defendants should represent that Comyns was a lawyer, admitted to practice before the United States Land Office, and that Byron was a locator, 'and that they could locate said parties and secure for them the preference right to purchase from the United States of America under the Timber and Stone Act of June 3, 1878 [20 Stat. 89, c. 151], certain land within the Western district of Washington for the sum of $2.50 per acre, by filing an application to purchase under said act, and that the said property was worth more than that sum,' and that they would agree with the parties to be defrauded that they would charge each of them a fee for locating them and securing for them the title to said land, a part of the fee, called the initial fee, to be paid at the time of making the agreement, and the balance when title to the land was secured, 'and that if said parties to be defrauded failed to get title to said land, then the said defendants and each of them would refund to said parties to be defrauded the amount of the fee already so paid to said defendants'; whereas, as defendants and each of them knew, defendants could not locate said parties and could not secure for them the preference right to purchase the land mentioned for $2. 50 per acre by filing said application, 'and the agreement, as to the land, to be performed in consideration of the payment of said fee was for the purpose of securing the payment of said initial fee and for the purpose of delaying the said parties to be defrauded from demanding the repayment of said initial fee and for the purpose of preventing said \n\n[248 U.S. 349, 352]\n\u00a0\n parties to be defrauded from discovering the fact that they had been defrauded and disclosing said fact to others, and said defendants and each of them intended to appropriate to their own use and the use of each of said defendants said initial fee, and did not intend to refund said initial fee or any part thereof if said parties to be defrauded failed to get title to said land in accordance with said agreement.' Then follows an averment that defendants made use of the mails for the purpose of executing the scheme by causing a letter inclosing a timber and stone application to be sent by mail to the Register of the Land Office.\n At first the demurrer was overruled by the District Court, but at the same time it was ordered that the government should furnish a bill of particulars 'stating the reason why the land in question could not be secured by the applicants.' A bill of particulars was filed setting up, in brief, that the lands could not be secured under the Timber and Stone Act ( a) because they were covered by a list of selections made by the state of Washington in lieu of school sections 16 and 36; and (b) because the statements to be made in the application as to the character of the land were to be made on information and belief, and not from the applicant's personal knowledge after examination of the land as required by the rules of the general land office. The defendants moved to strike out the bill of particulars, and this was treated by the District Court as a petition for a rehearing of the demurrer to the indictment as amplified by the bill of particulars; and thereupon the demurrer was sustained.\n Notwithstanding a contention to the contrary, it seems to us that the decision was based upon a construction of section 215 of the Criminal Code, and hence that we have jurisdiction under the Criminal Appeals Act. United States v. Patten, \n226 \nU.S. 525, 535\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 141, 44 L. R. A. (N. S.) 325; United States v. Nixon, \n235 \nU.S. 231, 235\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 49. \n\n[248 U.S. 349, 353]\n\u00a0\n In reviewing the judgment we shall disregard the bill of particulars, since this forms no part of the record for the purposes of the demurrer. Dunlop v. United States, \n165 \nU.S. 486, 491\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 375.\n In brief, the indictment avers that the scheme of defendants was to induce their intended victims to part with their money by representing to them that certain land (not described except generally as being located in the Western district of Washington) could be purchased from the United States under the Timber and Stone Act for less than its real value if the victims would employ defendants to secure such land and would pay a part of the proposed fee in advance; the defendants agreeing at the same time that in case of nonsuccess the money thus prepaid would be refunded; whereas in truth, as defendants well knew, for some reason not specified they could not carry out the agreement, and the purpose of making it was to secure the payment of the initial fee by the intended victims, which defendants intended to appropriate to their own use and did not intend to refund in case of a failure to secure title in accordance with the agreement.\n In our opinion such a scheme is a 'scheme or artifice to defraud by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises' within the meaning of section 215 of the Criminal Code. To use the mails in order to carry out a scheme for getting money by the making of promises or agreements which, whether known to be impossible of performance or not, there is no intention to perform, is a forbidden use of the facilities of the post office department.

REYNOLDS(1919)\nNo. 591\nArgued: Decided: May 19, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[250 U.S. 104, 105]\n\u00a0\n Mr.Solicitor General Alex. C. King, of Atlanta, Ga., for petitioner.\n Mr. Mark Goode, of Shawnee, Okl., for respondent.\n\n\n[250 U.S. 104, 106]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the court.\n This was a suit brought by the United States in behalf of Claudius Tyner and ten other persons, heirs at law of Stella Washington, deceased, who was a member of the Absentee Shawnee Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma; its object being to cancel a deed made by Tyner to Suda Reynolds on February 17, 1917, purporting to convey an undivided eleventh interest in a tract of land inherited by the 11 heirs from Stella Washington, who was the allottee thereof. The legal title to the tract was held by the United States under a certificate of allotment or 'trust patent,' dated February 6, 1892, containing a provision that the United States did and would hold the land in question in trust for the said Stella and in case of her death for her heirs, for a period of 25 years, at the expiration of which time the United States would convey the same by patent in fee, discharged of the trust, to said Indian or her heirs, unless the trust period had been extended by the President of the United States.\n The allotment was made under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved February 8, 1887 (chapter 119, 24 Stat. 388), as amended by Act of March 3, 1891 (chapter 543, \n\n[250 U.S. 104, 107]\n\u00a0\n 26 Stat. 989, 1019). Section 5 of the Act of 1887 (Comp. St.  4201) provided:\n'That upon the approval of the allotments provided for in this act by the Secretary of the Interior, he shall cause patents to issue therefor in the name of the allottees, which patents shall be of the legal effect, and declare that the United States does and will hold the land thus allotted, for the period of twenty-five years, in trust for the sole use and benefit of the Indian to whom such allotment shall have been made, or, in case of his decease, of his heirs according to the laws of the state or territory where such land is located, and that at the expiration of said period the United States will convey the same by patent to said Indian, or his heirs as aforesaid, in fee, discharged of said trust and free of all charge or incumbrance whatsoever: Provided, that the President of the United States may in any case in his discretion extend the period. And if any conveyance shall be made of the lands set apart and allotted as herein provided, or any contract made touching the same, before the expiration of the time above mentioned, such conveyance or contract shall be absolutely null and void.'\n\n Stella Washington's allotment was approved by the Secretary September 16, 1891; the allotment certificate or trust patent was issued on February 6, 1892. On November 24, 1916, the President by executive order extended the trust period for 10 years. Thereafter, on February 17, 1917, Tyner executed the deed in question to Suda Reynolds.\n The first question presented by the record is whether the original trust period extended for 25 years from February 6, 1892, the date of the trust patent, or from September 16, 1891, the date of the approval of the allotment. If the former, there is no question that the executive order, being made within the original trust period, was valid (subject to an objection as to its form), and had the effect of extending the trust, with resulting \n\n[250 U.S. 104, 108]\n\u00a0\n restriction upon the right of alienation, for the further period of 10 years. If, on the other hand, the original trust period should be dated from the approval of the allotment, it still is insisted by the government that the right of the President to extend the trust period continued beyond the 25 years and until the United States surrendered its trust by conveying the absolute fee-simple title to the Indian allottee or his heirs.\n The District Court sustained the contention of the United States and entered a decree canceling Tyner's deed as void and constituting a cloud upon its title. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decree and directed a dismissal of the bill. 252 Fed. 65.\n The latter decision rests upon the ground that under section 5 of the allotment act the right of the allottee to a preliminary or trust patent became absolute upon the approval of the allotment by the Secretary of the Interior; that her equitable title was then complete, and did not depend upon the delivery of the patent. Ballinger v. Frost, \n216 U.S. 240\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 338, was cited in support of this; but it is not entirely apposite. That case turned upon the effect of a certificate of allotment issued under the Choctaw and Chickasaw Agreement (Act of July 1, 1902, c. 1362, 32 Stat. 641, 644), the twenty-third section of which declared that such certificate should be 'conclusive evidence of the right of any allottee to the tract of land described therein.' The Indian, being a citizen and resident of the Choctaw Nation duly enrolled and entitled to an allotment, selected as such the land in controversy, upon which were her buildings and improvements; this was received by the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes, and, after the expiration of 9 months, the time prescribed by statute for contest, no contest of her right to the designated allotment having been made, a certificate was issued and delivered to her. This court held the allottee's rights had become fixed, the Secretary of the In \n\n[250 U.S. 104, 109]\n\u00a0\n terior thereafter having nothing but the ministerial duty to perform of seeing that a patent was duly executed and delivered, and upon this ground sustained a judgment awarding a writ of mandamus, citing Barney v. Dolph, \n97 U.S. 652\n, 656; Simmons v. Wagner, \n101 U.S. 260\n, 261; Cornelius v. Kessel, \n128 \nU.S. 456, 461\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 122; Orchard v. Alexander, \n157 \nU.S. 372, 383\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 635; and other cases.\n The rule established by these cases is familiar. But we do not think it can be applied so as to give finality to the act of the Secretary in approving the allotment under section 5 of the act of 1887. For does that act contain any such declaration of conclusive effect as is found in section 23 of the Choctaw-Chickasaw Agreement. While the matter is not free from doubt, we have reached the conclusion that by the better construction the trust period begins and dates from the issuance of the trust patent, and not from the approval of the allotment. The Department distinctly so ruled in Klamath Allotments, 38 Land Dec. 559, 561, where it was said, after quoting the pertinent language of section 5 of the act of 1887:\n'Clearly no trust is declared until actual issuance of patent, and the use of a word of the present tense, 'does,' shows that the trust period begins to run only upon such issuance.'\n\n This ruling was made in the year 1910, and may be inconsistent with some previous rulirgs of the Department, as counsel for respondent insists that it is. Nevertheless it is entitled to weight as an administrative interpretation of the act; it comports with our impression of the natural meaning of the language employed by Congress; and it very probably was relied upon by the President when promulgating the order of November 24, 1916, extending the trust period. This order might as well have been made a few months earlier, had it been supposed that the 25-year period was to expire in September.\n This construction of the act of 1887 puts it in agreement \n\n[250 U.S. 104, 110]\n\u00a0\n with other acts for the allotment of Indian lands,1 which, while subsequently passed and perhaps not strictly to be regarded as a legislative interpretation, nevertheless seem to us to indicate the effect that Congress attributed to the act of 1887\n\n\n Some criticism is made by counsel for respondent upon the form of the executive order of November 24, 1916, as being indefinite and not in accordance with the act of Congress. We deem this criticism unfounded, and need spend no time upon it.\n Calculating the 25-year period from February 6, 1892, the date of trust patent for the Stella Washington allotment, it expired on February 5, 1917; but the trust was extended for a further term of ten years, and hence the deed made by Claudius Tyner to Suda Reynolds February \n\n[250 U.S. 104, 111]\n\u00a0\n 17, 1917, was null and void by the terms of section 5 of the act of 1887.\n As the President's order was made within the original 25-year period, it is unnecessary to consider whether he might have acted with like effect at a later time.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of March 2, 1889 (chapter 422, 25 Stat. 1013, 1014), providing for allotments to Peorias and Miamis, contains this provision: 'The land so allotted shall not be subject to alienation for twenty-five years from the date of the issuance of patent therefor.'\n Act of March 2, 1895 (chapter 188, 28 Stat. 876, 907, the Quapaw Act), contains this: 'Provided, that said allotments shall be inalienable for a period of twenty-five years from and after the date of said patents.'\n Act of July 1, 1902 (chapter 1362, 32 Stat. 641, 642, Choctaw- Chickasaw Act), contains the following:\n Section 12, relating to homesteads: 'Shall be inalienable during the lifetime of the allottee, not exceeding twenty-one years from the date of certificate of allotment.'\n Section 13: 'The allotment of each Choctaw and Chickasaw freedman shall be inalienable during the lifetime of the allottee, not exceeding twenty-one years from the date of certificate of allotment.'\n Section 16: 'All lands allotted to the members of said tribes, except such land as is set aside to each for a homestead as herein provided, shall be alienable after issuance of patent as follows: One-fourth in acreage in one year, one-fourth in acreage in three years, and the balance in five years; in each case from date of patent.'\n Cherokee Allotment Act of July 1, 1902 (chapter 1375, 32 Stat. 716), contains similar language in sections 13 and 15. \n\n\n\n\n","224":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNION DRY GOODS CO. v. GEORGIA PUBLIC SERVICE CORP.(1919)\nNo. 87\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1919\n\n\n\n Messrs. R. Douglas Feagin and Rudolph S. Wimberly, both of Macon, Ga., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Roland Ellis, of Macon, Ga., and Thomas W. Hardwick, of Sandersville, Ga., for defendant in error. \n\n[248 U.S. 372, 373]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Georgia Public Service Corporation and the Union Dry Goods Company, both corporations organized under Georgia law and doing business in Macon on July 18, 1912, contracted together in writing for the term of five years, the former to supply electric light and power to the latter, which agreed to pay stipulated rates for the service.\n The contract was performed for almost two years until in April, 1914, when the Dry Goods Company refused to pay a bill for service rendered during March, in which a rate higher than that of the contract was charged. The Service Corporation claimed that this rate was authorized and required by an order of the Railroad Commission of Georgia, entered after investigation and hearing.\n Soon thereafter the Dry Goods Company commenced this suit to compel specific performance of its contract, which had three years yet to run; to enjoin the Service Corporation from charging the higher rate, and from executing a threat to cut it off from a supply of electricity, because of failure to pay the increased rate.\n The trial court and the Supreme Court of Georgia both held against the claims of the Dry Goods Company, and the case is here for review on writ of error.\n The order of the Railroad Commission of Georgia, entered on February 24, 1914, reads:\n'Ordered: That on and after March 1, 1914, and until the further order of the Commission, the following schedule of rates shall be the maximum schedule of rates to be charged by the Georgia Public Service Corporation.'\n\n Then follow the rates complained of.\n No opinion was rendered in this case, but on the same date, in prescribing the same rates in a proceeding instituted by the Macon Railway & Light Company, also of Macon, the Commission said: \n\n[248 U.S. 372, 374]\n\u00a0\n 'The rates prescribed herein are in the opinion of the Commission at this time just and reasonable. We have no power to compel the company to accept less, except as implied in the power to prevent unlawful discrimination. ... All special rates, whether in the form of contracts for definite periods, or informal, in excess of these prescribed rates are illegal.'\n Of the several claims pressed in argument, we need notice only two: That the obligation of the contract of July 18, 1912, was impaired, and that the plaintiff in error was deprived of its property without due process of law, by the decision of the Supreme Court of Georgia, holding that the rates prescribed by the Railroad Commission were valid and superseded those of the contract between the parties.\n Long prior to the contract of 1912 the Railroad Commission was given jurisdiction over, and power to regulate, the rates of electric light and power companies by statutes in form not greatly different from those of many other states, and, since no reason is assigned for assailing their validity, other than the result in this case, they must be accepted as valid laws.\n As we have seen, the rates prescribed by the Commission were declared by it to be reasonable and the Service Company was given authority to charge them. The plaintiff in error did not assert in its pleadings, or offer evidence tending to prove, that these commission rates were unreasonable, but complained, only that they were higher than the contract rates, and for this reason, it argued, that to give effect to the order as the state Supreme Court did, violated the provisions of the Constitution referred to.\n The presumption of law is in favor of the validity of the order, and the plaintiff in error did not deny, as it could not successfully, that capital invested in an electric light and power plant to supply electricity to the inhabitants \n\n[248 U.S. 372, 375]\n\u00a0\n of a city is devoted to a use in which the public has an interest which justifies rate regulation by a state in the exercise of its police power. Munn v. Illinois, \n94 U.S. 113\n; Budd v. New York, \n143 U.S. 517\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 468; German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Lewis, Superintendent of Insurance of the State of Kansas, \n233 \nU.S. 389, 407\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 612, L. R. A. 1915C, 1189\n\n\n Thus it will be seen that the case of the plaintiff in error is narrowed to the claim that reasonable rates, fixed by a state in an appropriate exercise of its police power, are invalid for the reason that if given effect they will supersede the rates designated in the private contract between the parties to the suit, entered into prior to the making of the order by the Railroad Commission.\n Except for the seriousness with which this claim has been asserted and is now pursued into this court, the law with respect to it would be regarded as so settled as not to merit further discussion.\n That private contract rights must yield to the public welfare, where the latter is appropriately declared and defined and the two conflict, has been often decided by this court. Thus in Manugault v. Springs, \n199 \nU.S. 473, 480\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 127, 130 (50 L. Ed. 274), it was declared that:\n'It is the settled law of this court that the interdiction of statutes impairing the obligation of contracts does not prevent the state from properly exercising its police powers 'for the general good of the public, though contracts previously entered into between individuals may thereby be affected.'\n\n This on authority of many cases which are cited.\n In Hudson Water Co. v. McCarter, \n209 \nU.S. 349, 357\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 529, 531 (52 L. Ed. 828, 14 Ann. Cas. 560), it is said that:\n'One whose rights, such as they are, are subject to state restriction, cannot remove them from the power of the state by making a contract about them. The contract will carry with in the infirmity of the subject-matter.' \n\n[248 U.S. 372, 376]\n\u00a0\n In L. & N. R. R. Co. v. Mottley, \n219 \nU.S. 467, 482\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 265, 270 (55 L. Ed. 297, 34 L. R. A. [N. S.] 671), this is quoted with approval from Knox v. Lee, 12 Wall. 457, 550, 551, viz.:\n\n'Contracts must be understood as made in reference to the possible exercise of the rightful authority of the government, and no obligation of a contract can extend to the defeat of legitimate government authority.'\n\n In the same report, in Chicago, B. & Q. R. R. Co. v. McGuire, \n219 U.S. 567\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 259, 262 (55 L. Ed. 328), it is said:\n'There is no absolute freedom to do as one wills or to contract as one chooses. The guaranty of liberty does not withdraw from legislative supervision that wide department of activity which consists of the making of contracts, or deny to government the power to provide restrictive safeguards. Liberty implies the absence of arbitrary restraint, not immunity from reasonable regulations and prohibitions imposed in the interests of the community.'\n\n In Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. Goldsboro, \n232 \nU.S. 548, 558\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 364, 368 (58 L. Ed. 721), the court said:\n'It is settled that neither the 'contract' clause nor the 'due process' clause has the effect of overriding the power of the state to establish all regulations that are reasonably necessary to secure the health, safety, good order, comfort, or general welfare of the community; that this power can neither be abdicated nor bargained away, and is inalienable even by express grant; and that all contract and property rights are held subject to its fair exercise.'\n\n And in Rail & River Coal Co. v. Ohio Industrial Commission, \n236 \nU.S. 338, 349\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 359, 362 (59 L. Ed. 607), the state of the law upon the subject is thus aptly described:\n'This court has so often affirmed the right of the state in the exercise of its police power to place reasonable restraints, like that here involved, upon the freedom of contract, that we need only to refer to some of the cases in passing.' \n\n[248 U.S. 372, 377]\n\u00a0\n These decisions, a few from many to like effect, should suffice to satisfy the most skeptical or belated investigator that the right of private contract must yield to the exigencies of the public welfare when determined in an appropriate manner by the authority of the state, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia must be\n\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","225":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNION FISH CO. v.

We have, then, a maritime contract for services to be performed principally upon the sea and the question is can such engagement be nullified by the local laws of a state, where the contract happens to be entered into, so as to prevent its enforcement in an admiralty court of the United States?\n The Constitution (article 3,  2) extends the judicial power of the United States to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. Admiralty jurisdiction under the federal Constitution 'embraces,' says Mr. Justice Story in his treatise on the Constitution, 'two great classes of cases-one dependent upon locality and the other upon the nature of the contract. In the latter class are embraced maritime contracts and services, rights and duties appertaining to commerce and navigation.' Story on the Constitution (4th Ed.)  1666. \n\n[248 U.S. 308, 313]\n\u00a0\n This court has had occasion to consider the nature and extent of admiralty jurisdiction as it was intended to be conferred by the Constitution. In The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558, the subject was much considered, and Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking for the court, said:\n'One thing, however, is unquestionable; the Constitution must have referred to a system of law coextensive with, and operating uniformly in, the whole country. It certainly could not have been the intention to place the rules and limits of maritime law under the disposal and regulation of the several states.'\n\n This principle was reiterated in Workman v. New York City, \n179 \nU.S. 552, 560\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 212. In that case it was declared that neither local law nor decisions could deprive of redress where a cause of action, maritime in its nature, was prosecuted in a court of admiralty of the United States.\n In the recent case of Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205, 216\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 524, 529 (61 L. Ed. 1086, L. R. A. 1918C, 451, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900), the subject was again considered and the cases in this court reviewed and state legislation was declared invalid 'if it ... works material prejudice to the characteristic features of the general maritime law or interferes with the proper harmony and uniformity of that law in its international and interstate relations.'\n In entering into this contract the parties contemplated no services in California. They were making an engagement for the services of the master of the vessel, the duties to be performed in the waters of Alaska, mainly upon the sea. The maritime law controlled in this respect, and was not subject to limitation because the particular engagement happened to be made in California. The parties must be presumed to have had in contemplation the system of maritime law under which it was made. Watts v. Camors, \n115 \nU.S. 353, 362\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 91.\n In different countries the appointment of masters of \n\n[248 U.S. 308, 314]\n\u00a0\n vessels has been the subject of maritime law which has directed the conduct of 'those who pursue commerce and put to sea.' Their duties and qualifications have been the subject of regulation by the recognized principles of admiralty law. Benedict's Admiralty (4th Ed.)  146. They are regulated by statutes enacted under Federal authority. See U. S. Comp. Stats. of 1916, vol. 12, Index, 'Masters of Vessels.'\n If one state may declare such contracts void for one reason, another may do likewise for another. Thus the local law of a state may deprive one of relief in a case brought in a court of admiralty of the United States upon a maritime contract, and the uniformity of rules governing such contracts may be destroyed by perhaps conflicting rules of the states.\n We think the Circuit Court of Appeals correctly held that this contract was maritime in its nature and an action in admiralty thereon for its breach could not be defeated by the statute of California relied upon by the petitioner.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","226":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNION OIL CO. OF CALIFORNIA v. SMITH(1919)\nNo. 2655\nArgued: Decided: March 31, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[249 U.S. 337, 338]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Lewis W. Andrews and Thomas O. Toland, both of Los Angeles, Cal., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[249 U.S. 337, 342]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents, for the first time in this court, the question of the meaning and effect of an act of Congress approved February 12, 1903 ( 32 Stat. 825, c. 548 [Comp. St.  4636]), which reads as follows:\n'An act defining what shall constitute and providing for assessments on oil mining claims.\n\n'Be it enacted, etc., that where oil lands are located under the provisions of title thirty-two, chapter six, Revised Statutes of the United States, as placer mining claims, the annual assessment labor upon such claims may be done upon any one of a group of claims lying contiguous and owned by the same person or corporation, not exceeding five claims in all: Provided, that said labor will tend to the development or to determine the oil bearing character of such contiguous claims.'\n\n Smith, now defendant in error, being in possession of a placer mining claim known as the 'Schley claim,' comprising a tract of 106 acres of land in the state of California, part of the public domain of the United States, under a location notice posted and recorded by himself and seven other qualified persons who afterwards conveyed their interests to him, and being engaged in the diligent prosecution of work for the purpose of finding oil upon the claim, brought an action in a California state court to determine adverse claims, making the Union Oil Company of California defendant.\n Defendant asserted a superior right of possession under a mineral land location of the same ground under the name of the 'Rawley claim,' made by eight qualified associates in the year 1883, many years before plaintiff's location. No discovery of oil or other minerals had ever been made upon the ground by either of the claimants or by any other person. But at the time plaintiff and his associates located it defendant, although not then \n\n[249 U.S. 337, 343]\n\u00a0\n actually occupying this ground, was in actual occupation of a contiguous claim of 160 acres known as the 'Sampson claim,' upon which it then was drilling and afterwards continued to drill a well for the discovery of oil, the well being 1,000 feet distant from the boundary line of the disputed claim. Defendant claimed the right of possession of five contiguous claims, including the 'Rawley-Schley' and the 'Sampson,' under locations regularly made in all respects save discovery. Defendant pleaded and proved these facts, and also introduced evidence warranting a finding that its boring work on the 'Sampson claim' tended to determine the oil-bearing character of the 'Rawley-Schley claim.'\n It was and is defendant's contention that by virtue of the act of 1903 one who has acquired the possessory rights of locators before discovery in five contiguous claims taken up as oil-bearing lands may preserve and maintain an inchoate right to all of them by means of a continuous actual occupation of one, coupled with diligent prosecution in good faith of a sufficient amount of discovery work thereon, provided such work tends also to determine the oil-bearing character of the other claims.\n The superior court of the county, and, on appeal, the Supreme Court of the state, overruled this contention and gave judgment in favor of the plaintiff (Smith v. Union Oil Co., 166 Cal. 217, 135 Pac. 966), and the case was brought here by writ of error under section 237, Judicial Code ( Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1156), prior to the amendment of September 6, 1916 (39 Stat. 726, c. 448 [Comp. St.  1214]).\n It will be observed that both parties are in the position of prospectors or explorers upon the public domain-locators without discovery; and, in order to appreciate correctly what effect, if any, the act of 1903 has upon their rights, it is important to have in mind what is meant by 'annual assessment labor,' and the part it plays in the operations of miners under the mining laws of the United States. \n\n[249 U.S. 337, 344]\n\u00a0\n By section 2319, Rev. Stat. U. S. (Comp. St.  4614), all valuable mineral deposits in lands belonging to the United States are declared to be--\n'free and open to exploration and purchase, and the lands in which they are found to occupation and purchase, by citizens of the United States and those who have declared their intention to become such, under regulations prescribed by law, and according to the local customs or rules of miners in the several mining districts, so far as the same are applicable and not inconsistent with the laws of the United States.'\n\n By section 2320 (section 4615) it is declared:\n'No location of a mining claim shall be made until the discovery of the vein or lode within the limits of the claim located.'\n\n By section 2322 (sec. 4618) locators of mining locations on the public domain--\n'so long as they comply with the laws of the United States, and with state, territorial, and local regulations not in conflict with the laws of the United States governing their possessory title, shall have the exclusive right of possession and enjoyment of all the surface included within the lines of their locations, and of all veins,' etc.\n\n By section 2324 (section 4620):\n'The miners of each mining district may make regulations not in conflict with the laws of the United States, or with the laws of the state or territory in which the district is situated, governing the location, manner of recording, amount of work necessary to hold possession of a mining claim, subject to the following requirements: The location must be distinctly marked on the ground so that its boundaries can be readily traced. ... On each claim located after the tenth day of May, eighteen hundred and seventy-two, and until a patent has been issued therefor, not less than one hundred dollars' worth of labor shall be performed or improvements made during each year. On all claims located prior to the tenth day of May, eighteen hundred and seventy-two, ten dollars' worth of labor shall be performed or improvements made by the tenth day of June, eighteen hundred and seventy-four, and each year \n\n[249 U.S. 337, 345]\n\u00a0\n thereafter, for each one hundred feet in length along the vein until a patent has been issued therefor; but where such claims are held in common, such expenditure may be made upon any one claim; and upon a failure to comply with these conditions, the claim or mine upon which such failure occurred shall be open to relocation in the same manner as if no location of the same had ever been made, provided that the original locators, their heirs, assigns, or legal representatives, have not resumed work upon the claim after failure and before such location.'\n\n Section 2325 (section 4622) and section following permit a patent to be obtained for a mineral claim, and regulate the procedure. By section 2325 the applicant for patent is required (among other things) to file 'a certificate of the United States surveyor general that five hundred dollars' worth of labor has been expended or improvements made upon the claim by himself or grantors,' and, upon his compliance with this and other requirements, if after publication of notice for 60 days no adverse claim is filed, or (section 2326 [section 4623]) such claim, having been filed, has proceeded to adjudication in a court of competent jurisdiction with result favorable to the applicant, upon a payment of $5 per acre and proper fees a patent is issued for the claim or such portion thereof as has been decided to be in the rightful possession of the applicant. By section 2329 (section 4628) placer claims are made subject to entry and patent under like circumstances and conditions and upon similar proceedings as are provided for vein or lode claims; the purchase price of placer claims being fixed by section 2333 (section 4632) at $2.50 per acre.\n Under this legislation petroleum for many years was regarded as a mineral, although not specially mentioned as such, and claims to oil lands were disposed of by the Land Department under the provisions of law relating to placer claims, with a single exception afterwards overruled. Union Oil Co., 23 L. D. 222, decided August 27, \n\n[249 U.S. 337, 346]\n\u00a0\n 1896; Union Oil Co. (on review) 25 L. D. 351, decided November 6, 1897. It was in order to obviate the effect of the former of these two decisions that Congress passed the act of February 11, 1897 (29 Stat. 526, c. 216 [ Comp. St.  4635]), which declared:\n'That any person authorized to enter lands under the mining laws of the United States may enter and obtain patent to lands containing petroleum or other mineral oils, and chiefly valuable therefor, under the provisions of the laws relating to placer mineral claims'\n\n -with a proviso saving petroleum land theretofore filed upon, claimed or improved as mineral but not yet patented. See House Rep. No. 2655, 54th Cong. 2d Sess.; 29 Cong. Rec. pt. 2, p. 1409; Burke v. Southern Pacific R. R. Co., \n234 \nU.S. 669, 678\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 907\n\n\n Aside from the suggested effect of the act of 1903, it is clear that in order to create valid rights or initiate a title as against the United States a discovery of mineral is essential. Section 2320, Rev. Stat.; Waskey v. Hammer, 223 L. S. 85, 90, 32 Sup. Ct. 187. Nevertheless, section 2319 extends an express invitation to all qualified persons to explore the lands of the United States for valuable mineral deposits, and this and the following sections hold out to one who succeeds in making discovery the promise of a full reward. Those who, being qualified, proceed in good faith to make such explorations and enter peaceably upon vacant lands of the United States for that purpose are not treated as mere trespassers, but as licensees or tenants at will. For since, as a practical matter, exploration must precede the discovery of minerals, and some occupation of the land ordinarily is necessary for adequate and systematic exploration, legal recognition of the pedis possessio of a bona fide and qualified prospector is universally regarded as a necessity. It is held that upon the public domain a miner may hold the place in which he may be working against all others having no better right, and while he remains in possession, diligently working towards discoy ery, \n\n[249 U.S. 337, 347]\n\u00a0\n is entitled-at least for a reasonable time-to be protected against forcible, fraudulent, and clandestine intrusions upon his possession. Zollars v. Evans (C. C.) 5 Fed. 172, 173; Crossman v. Pendery (C. C.) 8 Fed. 693, 694; Johanson v. White, 160 Fed. 901, 88 C. C. A. 83; Hanson v. Craig, 161 Fed. 861, 863, 89 C. C.

Brill, 17 Wyo. 26, 38, 95 Pac. 856.1\n And it has come to be generally recognized that while discovery is the indispensable fact and the marking and recording of the claim dependent upon it, yet the order of time in which these acts occur is not essential to the acquisition from the United States of the exclusive right of possession of the discovered minerals or the obtaining of a patent therefor, but that discovery may follow after location and give validity to the claim as of the time of discovery, provided no rights of third parties have intervened. Mining Co. v. Tunnel Co., \n196 \nU.S. 337, 345\n, 348 S.- 352, 25 Sup. Ct. 266; Weed v. Snook, 144 Cal. 439, 443, 77 Pac. 1023.\n In the California courts the right of a locator before discovery while in possion of his claim and prosecuting exploration work is recognized as a substantial interest, extending not only as far as the pedis possessio but to the limits of the claim as located; so that it a duly qualified person peaceably and in good faith enters upon vacant lands of the United States prior to discovery but for the purpose of discovering oil or other valuable mineral deposits, there being no valid mineral location upon it, such person has the right to maintain possession as against \n\n[249 U.S. 337, 348]\n\u00a0\n violent, fraudulent, and surreptitious intrusions so long as he continues to occupy the land to the exclusion of others and diligently and in good faith prosecutes the work of endeavoring to discover mineral thereon. Miller v. Chrisman, 140 Cal. 440, 447, 73 Pac. 1083, 74 Pac. 444, 98 Am. St. Rep. 63 (case affirmed \n197 U.S. 313\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 468; Weed v. Snook, ubi supra; Merced Oil Mining Co. v. Patterson, 153 Cal. 624, 625, 96 Pac. 90; s. c., 162 Cal. 358, 361, 122 Pac. 950; McLemore v. Express Oil Co., 158 Cal. 559, 562, 112 Pac. 59, 139 Am. St. Rep. 147.\n To what extent the possessory right of an explorer before discovery is to be deduced from the invitation extended in section 2319, to what extent it is to be regarded as a local regulation of the kind recognized by that section and the following ones, and to what extent it derives force from the authority of the mining states to regulate the possession of the public lands in the interest of peace and good order, are questions with which we are not now concerned. Nor need we stop to inquire whether the right is limited to the ground actually occupied in the process of exploration, or extends to the limits of the claim. These questions and others that suggest themselves are not raised by the present record, which concerns itself solely with the rights asserted by the defendant under the act of 1903. Whatever the nature and extent of a possessory right before discovery, all authorities agree that such possession may be maintained only by continued actual occupancy by a qualified locator or his representatives engaged in persistent and diligent prosecution of work looking to the discovery of mineral.\n But, by the provisions of the Revised Statutes above cited, a discovery of mineral by a qualified locator upon unappropriated public land initiates rights much more substantial as against the United States and all the world. If he locates, marks, and records his claim in accordance with section 2324 and the pertinent local laws and regulations, he has, by the terms of section 2322, an exclusive right of pos \n\n[249 U.S. 337, 349]\n\u00a0\n session to the extent of his claim as located, with the right to extract the minerals, even to exhaustion, without paying any royalty to the United States as owner, and without ever applying for a patent or seeking to obtain title to the fee; subject, however, to the performance of the annual labor specified in section 2324, for upon his failure to do this the claim is open to relocation by others at any time before resumption of work upon it by the original locator.\n If not content to rest upon the right conferred by section 2322, the qualified locator may obtain a patent for his claim by complying with the conditions prescribed by sections 2325 and 2326.\n But, even without patent, the possessory right of a qualified locator after discovery of minerals upon the claim is a property right in the full sense, unaffected by the fact that the paramount title to the land is in the United States (Rev. Stat.  910 [Comp. St.  1533]), and it is capable of transfer by conveyance, inheritance, or devise (Forbes v. Gracey, \n94 \nU.S. 762, 763\n, 767 S.; Belk v. Meagher, \n104 \nU.S. 279, 283\n, 285 S.; Del Monte Mining Co. v. Last Chance Mining Co., \n171 \nU.S. 55, 78\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 895; Elder v. Wood, \n208 \nU.S. 226, 232\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 263).\n Actual and continuous occupation of a valid mining location based upon discovery is not essential to the preservation of the possessory right. The right is lost only by abandonment, as by nonperformance of the annual labor required by section 2324. Belk v. Meagher, \n104 \nU.S. 279, 283\n, 284 S.; Black v. Elkhorn Mining Co., \n163 \nU.S. 445, 450\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 1101; Farrell v. Lockhart, \n210 \nU.S. 142, 147\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 681, 16 L. R. A. (N. S.) 162; Bradford v. Morrison, \n212 \nU.S. 389, 394\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 349.\n After this brief review of the mining laws there is little danger of mistaking the true intent and meaning of the act of Congress of February 12, 1903. Title 32, chapter 6, Revised Statutes, therein referred to, embraces the sections we have cited. And \n\n[249 U.S. 337, 350]\n\u00a0\n it is not to be doubted that the terms 'assessments' and 'annual assessment labor' refer to the annual labor required by section 2324, that being commonly called by miners the 'annual assessment' or the 'assessment work,' and so described in many judicial opinions and in at least two acts of Congress, passed respectively November 3, 1893 (28 Stat. 6, c. 12), and July 2, 1898 (30 Stat. 651, c. 563). See El Paso Brick Co. v. McKnight, \n233 \nU.S. 250, 255\n, 256 S., 258, 34 Sup. Ct. 498, L. R. A. 1915A, 1113.\n And it is important to observe that in these acts of Congress, as in the practice of miners, 'assessment work' had nothing to do with locating or holding a claim before discovery. On the contrary it was the condition subsequent prescribed by Congress to be performed in order to preserve the exclusive right to the possession of a valid mineral and location upon which discovery had been made. McLemore v. Express Oil Co., 158 Cal. 559, 563, 112 Pac. 59, 139 Am. St. Rep. 147. Hence the declaration in the act of 1903 that where oil lands are located as placer mining claims 'the annual assessment labor upon such claims may be done upon any one of a group of claims lying contiguous and owned by the same person,' indicates simply the legislative purpose that the necessary assessment work if done upon one of the group should have the same effect as if properly distributed among the several claims; that is to say, the effect of preserving the exclusive right of possession and enjoyment conferred by section 2322 with respect to unpatented claims based upon a previous discovery of oil.\n'Group assessment work' did not originate with the act of 1903. From an early period the economy of operating contiguous mines or claims by a single system was recognized. In section 5 of the act of May 10, 1872, (17 Stat. 92, c. 152), now section 2324, Rev. Stat., it was provided with respect to the annual labor that 'where such claims are held in common, such expenditure may be made upon any one claim.' Questions as to the precise meaning of \n\n[249 U.S. 337, 351]\n\u00a0\n this naturally arese, and it was determined that it applied only to contiguous claims, and that the work must be done for the common benefit or for the purpose of developing all the claims. Smelting Co. v. Kemp, \n104 U.S. 636\n, 655; Jackson v. Roby, \n109 \nU.S. 440, 444\n, 3 S. Sup. Ct. 301; Chambers v. Harrington, \n111 \nU.S. 350, 353\n, 4 S. Sup. Ct. 428; Anvil Hydraulic Co. v. Code, 182 Fed. 205, 206, 105 C. C. A. 45.\n\n It is plain that the draftsman of the act of 1903 had this settled rule in mind, for the bill as introduced, with enacting clause in the same form as finally passed, had this proviso:\n'Provided, that said labor will benefit or tend to the development of such contiguous claims.'\n\n By committee amendment in the House the words 'benefit or' were struck out, and after the word 'development' the following were inserted, 'or to determine the oil bearing character,' presumably regarded as peculiarly appropriate to oil lands. House Rep. No. 2657, 57th Cong. 1st Sess.; Senate Rep. No. 2756, 57th Cong. 2d Sess.; 36 Cong. Record, pt. 1, p. 83; pt. 2, pp. 1561, 1682. The committee report contains this explaination of the object of the bill:\n'The law now requires that upon each mining claim there shall be performed each and every year at least $100 worth of work. The courts have held with reference to lode-mining claims that this annual labor may be done upon any one of a group of mining claims, provided the said work tends to benefit the entire group, but the Land Department of the government seems to be of opinion that the annual labor upon placer-mining claims must be done upon each of said claims. There is good reason for this holding when applied to the ordinary placer claim containing deposits of gold, because in such case the gold lies upon the surface or near the surface, and general development work being upon and near the surface does not tend to benefit other claims than the one upon which the work is actually done, but in the case of oil-mining claims the situation is different. It is neces sary \n\n[249 U.S. 337, 352]\n\u00a0\n to bore wells for great depths in order to determine whether or not oil exists in paying quantities. These wells are expensive, and it is the opinion of the committee that the industry itself will be more benefited by permitting the owner to spend his means in sinking a single well in order to demonstrate the possibilities of the property than it would to require him to distribute his means among several claims. In other words, it is better that $500 should be spent in one place until the character of the oil deposit has been demonstrated than it is to require the same amount of money to be spent in five different places.'\n\n The argument for plaintiff in error, while conceding the general rule to have been established that assessment work could avail nothing except when performed upon or for the benefit of a claim in which a discovery of mineral already had been made, insists that the difficulty and great expense attendant upon the sinking of wells to make discovery of oil made it evident that the application of the doctrine was a great burden upon the oil miner; and that this, having been brought to the attention of Congress was the moving cause of the enactment of the act of February 12, 1903. This contention finds no support in the enacting clause, and but little in the proviso. It gives to the somewhat indefinite language of the proviso an effect that would greatly enlarge instead of confining the meaning of what precedes, and would render the statute a radical departure from the previous policy of the mining laws. The legislative history of the act, as well as its phraseology, fails to support the contention.\n Nor is there great force in the suggestion that with respect to oil claims upon which discovery already had been made there was no need to encourage the doing or work tending to determine their oil-bearing character, because this would already have been established by the antecedent discovery. It hardly is necessary to say that \n\n[249 U.S. 337, 353]\n\u00a0\n the discovery of oil upon several contiguous claims does not render it wholly unimportant that assessment work thereafter done by the common owner upon one of the claims, in order to be credited to him as if it had been distributed among the several claims, shall be of general benefit to the group. This is the object of the act, and except as the proviso specifically declares 'determination of oil-bearing character' to be of benefit to the contiguous claims, little is added to the effect of section 2324, Rev. Stat., respecting group assessment work. But we cannot declare a determination of the 'oil-bearing character' of a claim upon which oil already has been discovered to be a matter so idle as to require us to seek a strained construction of the statute.\n In our opinion the act shows no purpose to dispense with discovery as an essential of a valid oil location or to break down in any wise the recognized distinction between the pedis possessio of a prospector doing work for the purpose of discovering oil and the more substantial right of possession of one who has made a discovery and performs annual development work to maintain his right to the mineral until patent is obtained. Hence the Supreme Court of California did not err in overruling the contention that by force the act discovery work upon the 'Sampson claim' having a tendency to determine the oil-bearing character of the contiguous 'Rawley- Schley claim' conferred upon plaintiff in error inchoate right in the latter claim, of which it was not in possession and upon which it had made no discovery.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Two recent acts of Congress contain recognition of the status of a bona fide occupant of oil-bearing lands in the public domain prior to discovery.

WRIGHT(1919)\nNo. 170\nArgued: Decided: March 24, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[249 U.S. 275, 276]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Douglas Campbell, of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Clifford Walker, of Monroe, Ga., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This cause requires us to consider the power of a state to lay and collect taxes upon instrumentalities of interstate commerce which move both within and without its jurisdiction.\n Union Tank Line-plaintiff in error-an equipment company incorporated in New Jersey which has never carried on business or had an office in Georgia, owns 12,000 tank cars suitable for transporting oil over railroads and rents them to shippers at agreed rates, based on size and capacity. The roads over which they move also pay therefor stipulated compensation. Under definite contract certain of these cars were furnished to the Standard Oil Company of Kentucky and all of those which came into Georgia were being operated by the Oil Company under such agreement. They were not permanently within that state but passed 'in and out.' \n\n[249 U.S. 275, 277]\n\u00a0\n March 16, 1914, the Tank Line made the following tax return to the comptroller general for 1913:\n Name of company Union Tank Line Value of real estate owned by company in or out of Georgia None Number of miles of railroad lines in Georgia over which ... cars are run 6976.5 Total value of ... cars and ... other personal property (in Georgia and elsewhere) $10,518,333.16 Value franchise (in Georgia) No franchise Total number of miles railroad lines over which ... cars are run (in Georgia and elsewhere) 251,999 Total value of property taxable in Georgia $47,310.00 Union Tank Line Company had an average of 57 tank cars in Georgia during 1913, which at a value of $830 per car equals $47,310.00\n\n Defendant in error expressly admitted that the average number of cars in Georgia during 1913 was 57, the value of each being $830-total $47,310; that the owner had paid into the state treasury as taxes the full amount required on such valuation and during that year had no other property in the state. Acting upon information contained in return above quoted, the comptroller general assessed the Tank Line's property for 1913 at $291,196, its franchise at $27,685, and demanded payment. In explanation of this action he wrote to it as follows:\n'As to the return filed, you have furnished the data desired, but have made an error in the application of same. After giving the mileage for the company everywhere \n\n[249 U.S. 275, 278]\n\u00a0\n and for Georgia, you then go ahead and assign 57 tank cars for this state and value them at $830 each, making the total for Georgia $47, 310. This is an incorrect method. If you were to be allowed to merely assign so many cars to the state for taxation there would be no need for the mileage figures to be furnished. The valuation to be assigned to Georgia must be in the same proportion to the valuation for the entire company as the mileage in Georgia bears to the entire mileage everywhere. ... Or to work it out by percentage instead of proportion: 6,976.5 the Georgia mileage, is 2.76846 per cent. of 251, 999, the entire mileage. Georgia is therefore entitled to 2.76846 per cent. of the entire valuation. This per cent. of $10,518,333 is $291, 195.84, or the same sum arrived at by proportion, if we call the 84 cents an even dollar. ... A franchise value should also be returned. And whatever the valuation you place on the franchise for the entire country, 2.76846 per cent. of same must be assigned to Georgia. Thus, if you should value your franchise at $1,000,000, the franchise value to be assigned to Georgia would be $27,685.\n\n'The valuation for Georgia was determined by taking 2.76846 per cent. of the valuation you gave for the entire company, exclusive of franchise. The 2.76846 per cent. is the ratio the Georgia mileage bears to the entire mileage, as explained in a previous letter. The franchise value was obtained by placing your franchise for the entire country at an even million dollars and giving Georgia 2.76846 per cent. thereof.'\n\n Thereupon, plaintiff in error instituted this proceeding in Fulton county superior court alleging invalidity of the assessment, that to enforce the tax would violate the Fourteenth amendment, and asked appropriate relief. The cause was tried upon pleadings and agreed statement of facts. Among other things, the parties stipulated:\n'On April 7, 1914, when the defendant entered an as sessment \n\n[249 U.S. 275, 279]\n\u00a0\n in his office of property and franchise of the plaintiff as shown hereinbefore, he had no other information for any of the years 1907 to 1914 inclusive than was contained in the said return filed by the plaintiff on March 16, 1914, and embraced in this statement and which was refused by the defendant, and did not know what cars defendant had had in Georgia during any of said named years nor did he ascertain the value of such cars, but his action was taken on such information hereinbefore shown; and that the assessment so entered by the defendant in his office against the plaintiff's property during said period for each of said years embraces the valuation of about three hundred cars in excess of what the plaintiff actually had in the state of Georgia, during said years of the approximate value of $ 250,000.00 each year; and that the true value of a tank car is about eight hundred and thirty ($830.00) dollars per car.\n\n'That for the year 1914 the assessment entered against plaintiff by defendant covered the value of at least three hundred and fifty cars in excess of the number of cars plaintiff actually had in the state of Georgia for the time said tax was assessed.\n\n'That defendant in entering said assessment never undertook to ascertain the actual property of plaintiff's located in the state of Georgia during the said years or to assess its property at its real value for taxation, otherwise than by simply ascertaining the percentage of its entire property shown by the ratio of the railroad traversed by its equipment in Georgia and the railroad mileage traversed by its equipment everywhere as shown by its said return filed on March 16, 1914.'\n\n The trial court adjudged the assessment good as to both franchise and physical property. The Supreme Court held no taxable franchise existed, but that the physical property had been assessed as required by statutes not in conflict with either state or federal Constitution. 146 Ga. 489, 91 S. E. 680. It said (Wright v. Union Tank Line, 143 \n\n[249 U.S. 275, 280]\n\u00a0\n Ga. 765, 769, 771, 773, 85 S. E. 994, 996, 997):\n'The case relates to two matters, namely: a tax assessment against tangible property of the company; and second, a claim of right to assess a franchise tax. ... The effort was to tax property in this state, and in doing so to apply the statute designed as a rule to ascertain the property so coming into the state and its proper valuation.'\n\n After quoting sections 989, 990, and 1031 Civil Code of Georgia, copied in the margin,1 the opinion continues: \n\n[249 U.S. 275, 281]\n\u00a0\n 'The several Code sections embody the statutory scheme for taxing cars of equipment companies whose cars are handled over the railroads in this state. Owing to the nature of the business, it is difficult to ascertain the number of cars of equipment companies that come into this state and designate the identity of each car or its value. The purpose of the statute is to provide a reasonable method for determining the fact that cars come into this state and the values thereof, to the end that the equipment companies allowing their cars to come into this state may bear their just proportion of taxes leviable in this state. The scheme of the statute is what is sometimes called the track mileage basis of apportionment, or what in a more general way is termed the unit rule. The comptroller general followed the statute. The unit rule has been upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States, in regard to railroads, telegraph companies, and sleeping car companies. Kentucky Railroad Tax Cases, \n115 U.S. 321\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 57; Western Union Telegraph Company v. Massachusetts, \n125 U.S. 530\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 961; Pullman's Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 U.S. 18\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 876. And this principle of average has been approved in regard to refrigerator cars. American Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Hall, \n174 U.S. 70\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 599; Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Lynch, \n177 U.S. 149\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 631. It has even been held that the unit rule of valuation could properly be applied to the valuation of property of express companies within a certain state, though there was no \n\n[249 U.S. 275, 282]\n\u00a0\n physical connection with property beyond the state. ... It seems to us, therefore, that the case falls within the rule laid down by the Supreme Court of the United States, as above mentioned, and that there are no such circumstances as to bring it within the ruling made in Fargo v. Hart, \n193 U.S. 490\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 498, 48 L. ed. 761.'\n A state may not tax property belonging to a foreign corporation which has never come within its borders-to do so under any formula would violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In so far, however, as movables are regularly and habitually used and employed therein, they may be taxed by the state according to their fair value along with other property subject to its jurisdiction, although devoted to interstate commerce. While the valuation must be just it need not be limited to mere worth of the articles considered separately but may include as well 'the intangible value due to what we have called the organic relation of the property in the state to the whole system.' How to appraise them fairly when the tangibles constitute part of a going concern operating in many states often presents grave difficulties; and absolute accuracy is generally impossible. We have accordingly sustained methods of appraisement producing results approximately correct-for example, the mileage basis in case of a telegraph company (W. U. Tel Co. v. Massachusetts) and the average amount of property habitually brought in and carried out by a car company (American Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Hall). But if the plan pursued is arbitrary and the consequent valuation grossly excessive it must be condemned because of conflict with the commerce clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or both. W. U. Tel. Co. v. Massachusetts, \n125 U.S. 530\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 961; Marye v. B. & O. R. R., \n127 U.S. 117\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 1037; Pullman's Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 \nU.S. 18, 26\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 876 (35 L.

Ct. 604; American Refrigerator \n\n[249 U.S. 275, 283]\n\u00a0\n Transit Co. v. Hall, \n174 U.S. 70\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 599; Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Lynch, \n177 U.S. 149\n, 20 Sup.

Ct. 373.\n In the present case the comptroller general made no effort to assess according to real value or otherwise than upon the ratio which miles of railroad in Georgia over which the cars moved bore to total mileage so traversed in all states. Real values-the essential aim-of property within a state cannot be ascertained with even approximate accuracy by such process; the rule adopted has no necessary relation thereto. During a year two or three cars might pass over every mile of railroad in one state while hundreds constantly employed in another moved over lines of less total length. Fifty-seven was the average number of cars within Georgia during 1913, and each had a 'true' value of $830. Thus the total there subject to taxation amounted to $47,310-the challenged assessment specified $291,196.\n We think plaintiff in error's property was appraised according to an arbitrary method which produced results wholly unreasonable and that to permit enforcement of the proposed tax would deprive it of property without due process of law and also unduly burden interstate commerce.\n Pullman's Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra, relied on by defendant in error, contains the following passage which seems to uphold the Georgia rule:\n'The mode which the state of Pennsylvania adopted, to ascertain the proportion of the company's property upon which it should be taxed in that state, was by taking as a basis of assessment such proportion of the capital stock of the company as the number of miles over which it ran cars within the state bore to the whole number of miles, in that and other states, over which its cars were run. This was a just and equitable method of assessment; and, if \n\n[249 U.S. 275, 284]\n\u00a0\n it were adopted by all the states through which these cars ran, the company would be assessed upon the whole value of its capital stock, and no more.'\n\n But the point therein spoken of was unnecessary to determination of the cause; and so far as the quoted passage sanctions the specified rule for ascertaining values as generally appropriate, just, unobjectionable and productive of conclusive results it must be regarded as obiter dictum, and we cannot now approve or follow it.\n Reference to the original record upon which that case came here will aid in understanding the exact issues presented. Pennsylvania demanded taxes of the Pullman Company, an Illinois corporation, for the years 1870 to 1880 upon such portion of its capital stock as total miles of railroad in Pennsylvania over which its cars moved bore to like total in all states. No statute prescribed the method of valuation; it had been adopted by executive officers. The court of common pleas declared:\n'On the facts defendant claims that no part of its capital stock is invested in this state. The argument is that its cars are personal property, and, as they are not permanently located in this state, but pass into, through, and out of it, this personal property has no taxable situs in Pennsylvania, and could not be taxed specifically in any given locality, and therefore, it is contended, as the tax on capital stock is a tax on the property in which the capital is invested, the latter cannot be taxed. ... We hold, therefore, that the proportion of the capital stock of the defendant invested and used in Pennsylvania is taxable under these acts, and that the amount of the tax may be properly ascertained by taking as a basis the proportion which the number of miles operated by defendant in this state bears to the whole number of miles operated by it, whthout regard to the question where any particular car or cars were used . ... The defendant is liable to tax on the proportion of its capital stock invested in this state, \n\n[249 U.S. 275, 285]\n\u00a0\n as represented by the coaches and cars owned and used by it here . ... Determining the amount of the tax on the principle above stated, it is as follows: Tax for years 1870 to 1880, inclusive, $16, 321.89.'\n\n The Supreme Court affirmed this view, saying:\n'While the tax on the capital stock of the company 'is a tax on its property and assets,' yet the capital stock of a company and its property and assets are not identical. The coaches of the company are its property. They are operated within this state. They are daily passing from one end of the state to the other. They are used in performing the functions for which the corporation was created. The fact that they also are operated in other states cannot wholly exempt them from taxation here. It reduces the value of property in this state justly subject to taxation here. This was recognized in the court below, and we think the [proportion] preference was fixed according to a just and equitable rule.'\n\n In 1870 the Pullman Company's capital stock amounted to $3,000,000; in 1880 it had grown to $6,000,000. All cars actually owned by the company ( leased ones not included) during 1871 numbered 241, and in 1880, 472, their total value being $4,334,000 and $8,588,000 respectively; 100 cars were operated within Pennsylvania during each of the 11 years; total miles of track everywhere passed over by the company cars during 1880 amounted to 57,099; within Pennsylvania, 5,127; and these figures adequately represent the proportion for other years; total tax held due for the 11 years amounted to $16,321.89. While the record does not disclose the precise valuations upon which taxes were computed, enough does appear to show that they were far below (perhaps not one-third) the actual worth of 100 cars.\n The company demanded complete exemption upon the ground that its cars were moving in interstate commerce \n\n[249 U.S. 275, 286]\n\u00a0\n and had no taxable situs in Pennsylvania. The appraisement was not challenged as excessive; if the property was taxable in Pennsylvania the rule adopted may have been decidedly favorable to the owner and the assessment a moderate one. Having failed to challenge amount of the assessment, the company could not well complain of the rule under which this was fixed. In such circumstances reasonableness of the rule was not really in question and what was said of it cannot control here where the very point is presented for decision. Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat, 264, 399; McCormick Machine Co. v. Aultman, \n169 \nU.S. 606, 611\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 443. See, also, Adams Express Co. v. Ohio, supra.\n In other opinions of this court cited below to support the conclusion there reached we upheld the power of a state to tax property actually within its jurisdiction upon a fair valuation considered as part of a going concern-they give no sanction to arbitrary and inflated valuations. Taxes must follow realities, not mere deductions from inadequate or irrelevant data.\n In Fargo v. Hart, supra, we condemned an assessment ostensibly proportioned to mileage where property without the state and unnecessary to the express company's actual business had been included; and we pointed out that under no formula can a state tax things wholly beyond its jurisdiction.\n The same considerations which establish invalidity of the assessment of plaintiff in error's property for 1913 apply to like ones made by the comptroller general for all other years in question.\n Judgment of the court below must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice DAY, in view of the undisputed facts of this case, concurs in the result. \n\n[249 U.S. 275, 287]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY, with whom concurred Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice CLARKE, dissenting.\n During the period in controversy the Union Tank Line, plaintiff in error, a New Jersey corporation, was the owner of many tank cars, aggregating in value more than $10,000,000, and was engaged in the business of renting them out to be employed in transporting oil and similar fluids over railroads throughout the United States extending to more than 250,000 miles. In the course of its business it made a contract with the Standard Oil Company of Kentucky to furnish to that corporation cars for use in the transportation of oils and like fluids from depots at Savannah, Georgia, and Jacksonville, Florida. The oils were brought to those depots chiefly in vessels by sea, and were shipped thence in the Tank Line cars to various destinations whthin and without the state of Georgia; plaintiff in error being compensated in part by rentals paid by the Standard Oil Company, based on size and capacity of cars, and in part by payments received from the railroad companies over whose lines the cars were run; those companies, in lieu of providing their own tank cars, paying to plaintiff in error three-fourths of a cent per mile per car for the car movements.\n Under the provisions of the Georgia statutes (Civil Code,  989, 990, 1031), property taxes were imposed upon plaintiff in error by reason of the habitual use and employment of its rolling stock within that state, based upon a valuation not limited to the value of the tank cars as separate chattels, but considering their value as a part of the entire system of cars owned and operated by plaintiff in error, and regarding these as a part of the equipment of the railroads over which they ran. Thus, it appearing from a return made by the Tank Line to the comptroller general for the year 1913 that the number of miles of railroad lines in Georgia over which its cars \n\n[249 U.S. 275, 288]\n\u00a0\n were run was 6,976.5, and the total number of miles of railroad lines over which its cars were run in Georgia and elsewhere was 251,999, and that the total value of its cars and other personal property in Georgia and elsewhere was $10,518,333.16, the comptroller general assigned to the state of Georgia for taxation the same proportion of the property value of the system of cars that the Georgia rail mileage bore to the total mileage. This gave a valuation of $291,195.84, whereas plaintiff in error had returned that during the same year it had an average of only 57 tank cars in Georgia, amounting, at a valuation of $830 per car, to $47,310.\n The Supreme Court of Georgia sustained the tax on the authority of numerous decisions of this court, cited for the purpose. 143 Ga. 765, 85 S. E. 994, 146 Ga. 489, 91 S. E. 680. This court reverses the judgment, and holds the taxing law unconstitutional, upon reasoning to which I am unable to yield assent.\n In my opinion the Georgia system of taxing movable property of this character when habitually employed in the state, and the decision of the state Supreme Court sustaining the particular taxes in question, are based upon a correct view of the powers of the state under the federal Constitution, and are in entire harmony with principles laid down in authoritative decisions of this court which have remained unchallenged for more than a quarter of a century.

Ct. 631; Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, \n246 \nU.S. 450, 453\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 373. \n\n[249 U.S. 275, 289]\n\u00a0\n The case presents no question of taxing a foreign corporation with respect to personal property that never has come within the borders of the state. According to the agreed state of facts and the petition of the Union Tank Line which is to be read with it, any and all cars of the company were liable to be used indiscriminately, as occasion required, in the transportation of oil within the state of Georgia, and there is nothing to show how many were so used during either of the taxing years in question. Fifty-seven cars simply represent the average number within the state at one and the same time within the year, and is not representative of the number of cars used in the state during the year. This court has declared that a state may lay hold of the average habitual use of movable railroad equipment as a basis of taxation (Marye v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R., \n127 \nU.S. 117, 123\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 1037); but there is nothing in the Constitution of the United States to confine the state to that particular method. It is but a method of approximation. Nor is the state obliged to ignore the special value that rolling stock has because of its organic relation to, and its customary use in connection with, the railroad tracks upon which it runs. Although the equipment be held in separate ownership, it may be regarded in fact as an appurtenance of the railroad and valued in that relation. It is admitted that the revenue derived by plaintiff in error from the use of its cars is in part paid by the railroad companies and proportioned to the mileage covered by the run of the cars.\n The opinion of this court recognizes that plaintiff in error, because its tank cars are regularly and habitually used and employed in the state of Georgia, is taxable according to their fair value along with other property subject to the jurisdiction of the state, although they are devoted to interstate commerce; that while the valuation must be just it need not be limited to the mere value of the cars considered separately, but may include also the \n\n[249 U.S. 275, 290]\n\u00a0\n special value attributable to their organic relation to the entire system; that fair appraisal, in a case like this, where the cars constitute part of a system operating in many states, is a matter of serious difficulty, but that absolute accuracy usually is impossible and therefore is not required by the Constitution; and it seems to be intimated that a valuation based upon the aggregate car mileage within the state during the taxable year would be permissible. But, even assuming that such a basis could be adopted without in effect regulating interstate commerce by varying the burden of taxation in direct proportion to the volume of such commerce, it still is obvious that a valuation according to aggregate car mileage would virtually ignore the particular value due to the relation of the cars to the rail system, would in effect be equivalent to a valuation according to average use, and would be open to the same objection, viz., that its ascertainment would lie wholly within the breast of the taxpayer. For, if the state authorities were required to keep a check either upon the average use or the aggregate mileage covered by the movements of rolling stock within the state, and to supplement this with observations in other states in order to arrive at the due proportion, the cost of administration easily might consume the tax.\n It is because of difficulties such as these that so many of the states have resorted to track mileage-readily ascertained and little subject to change-as an equitable method of ascertaining the proportionate value taxable by a single state, out of the aggregate value of the movables of an equipment company that does business in several states.\n This method was very clearly sustained by this court in Pullman's Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 \nU.S. 18, 26\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 876, a case decided in the year 1891, followed repeatedly, and never questioned in the least until now. The tax laws of the state of Georgia, and doubtless of many other \n\n[249 U.S. 275, 291]\n\u00a0\n states, have been based upon that decision, and I regard it as most unfortunate that at this late date its authority should be overthrown.\n The Pullman Company was a corporation of the state of Illinois, having its principal office in Chicago, and its business was to furnish sleeping coaches and parlor and dining cars to various railroad companies for use as a part of the equipment of passenger trains running in interstate commerce; the railroad companies collecting the usual passenger fares and the Pullman Company separate charges for seats and berths. The company was subjected by the state of Pennsylvania to a tax upon a part of its capital stock bearing the same proportion to the whole as the number of miles of railroad over which its cars were run in Pennsylvania bore to the whole number of miles in that and other states over which they were run. The Pullman Company objected to the taxation of any part of its capital stock by the state of Pennsylvania by reason of its running its cars through that state in the course of their employment in interstate transportation of passengers; and it is obvious that unless the tax was sustainable as being in substance and effect a tax upon property of the company no greater than that which the state had a right to impose it was invalid because amounting in its effect to a burden upon interstate commerce. It was from this point of view that the court tested and sustained the tax, as the following excerpts from the opinion will show. After declaring that the legislative power of every state extends to all property within its borders; that for purposes of taxation personal property may be separated from its owner and the owner taxed on account of it at the place where it is located, although he is not a citizen or resident of the state which imposes it; and that there is nothing in the Constitution or laws of the United States to prevent a state from taxing personal property employed in interstate or foreign commerce \n\n[249 U.S. 275, 292]\n\u00a0\n like other personal property within its jurisdiction, the court, speaking by Mr. Justice Gray, proceeded to say (\n141 \nU.S. 25, 26\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 879):\n'Much reliance is also placed by the plaintiff in error upon the cases in which this court has decided that citizens or corporations of one state cannot be taxed by another state for a license or privilege to carry on interstate or foreign commerce within its limits. But in each of those cases the tax was not upon the property employed in the business, but upon the right to carry on the business at all, and was therefore held to impose a direct burden upon the commerce itself. ... The tax now in question is not a license tax or a privilege tax; it is not a tax on business or occupation; it is not a tax on, or because of, the transportation, or the right of transit, of persons or property through the state to other states or countries. ... The tax on the capital of the corporation, on account of its property within the state, is, in substance and effect, a tax on that property. ... The cars of this company within the state of Pennsylvania are employed in interstate commerce; but their being so employed does not exempt them from taxation by the state; and the state has not taxed them because of their being so employed, but because of their being within its territory and jurisdiction. The cars were continuously and permanently employed in going to and fro upon certain routes of travel. ... The fact that, instead of stopping at the state boundary, they cross that boundary in going out and coming back, cannot affect the power of the state to levy a tax upon them. ... The route over which the cars travel extending beyond the limits of the state, particular cars may not remain within the state; but the company has at all times substantially the same number of cars within the state, and continuously and constantly uses there a portion of its property; and it is distinctly found, as matter of fact, that the company continuously, throughout the periods \n\n[249 U.S. 275, 293]\n\u00a0\n for which these taxes were levied, carried on business in Pennsylvania, and had about one hundred cars within the state.\n\n'The mode which the stage of Pennsylvania adopted, to ascertain the proportion of the company's property upon which it should be taxed in that state, was by taking as a basis of assessment such proportion of the capital stock of the company as the number of miles over which it ran cars within the state bore to the whole number of miles, in that and other states, over which its cars were run. This was a just and equitable method of assessment; and, if it were adopted by all the states through which these cars ran, the company would be assessed upon the whole value of its capital stock, and no more. [Italics mine .] The validity of this mode of apportioning such a tax is sustained by several decisions of this court,' etc.\n\n It was upon this decision, among others, that the Supreme Court of Georgia relied as authority for its judgment. I cannot agree that any part of what I have quoted-least of all the italicized clause which relates to the apportionment of the tax according to track mileage-was obiter dictum or unnecessary for the decision. It was necessary-certainly so this court deemed it-that the disputed tax be vindicated as a property tax in order to relieve it from the criticism that it was an unwarranted interference with interstate commerce; and it could not be sustained as a property tax unless the method of apportionment was fair and equitable. The authority of the case cannot properly be overthrown by showing, even if it could be shown, that the court might have reached the same result upon some other ground than that which in truth it adopted as the basis of its decision. And it seems to me that a considered judgment of this court upon a constitutional question affecting the taxing powers of the states, long acted upon as a guide to state legislation upon this important and difficult matter, ought not to be \n\n[249 U.S. 275, 294]\n\u00a0\n set aside without more cogent reasons than any that are here adduced. Certainly the fact that the established rule of taxation may operate with hardship or even with apparent injustice in a particular case is not sufficient to condemn it.\n The decision referred to, Pullman's Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra, has always been regarded as a leading case, and cited with uniform approval in repeated decisions of this court, not only upon the point that property employed in interstate commerce, and in the ordinary use of it situate sometimes within and sometimes without a state, is subject to state taxation without regard to the place of the owner's domicile, but also and especially in support of the proposition that the mileage basis of apportionment as between the different states may be resorted to in order to determine what tax each state shall lay upon rolling stock used upon interstate railroads, just as it often is resorted to in apportioning the tax upon a railroad as between different taxing districts in the same state.\n The reasoning of the case upon the point now in controversy has never heretofore been regarded as obiter dictum. On the contrary, it was cited in support of the mileage basis of apportionment for the taxation of a railroad in Pittsburgh, etc., Ry. Co. v. Backus, \n154 \nU.S. 421, 431\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 1114, and, in Adams Express Co. v. Ohio, \n165 \nU.S. 194, 221\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 305, to sustain a mileage apportionment with respect to interstate express companies, notwithstanding the absence of physical unity. Adams Exp. Co. v. Ohio, \n166 U.S. 185\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 604. It was quoted from extensively in American Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Hall, \n174 \nU.S. 70, 75\n, 76 S., 19 Sup. Ct. 599, as authority for the apportionment of taxes upon rolling stock according to the track mileage within and without the state; the very part of the opinion now held to be dictum being included in the quotation. See also Western Union Tel. Co. v. Taggart, \n163 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 21 S., 16 Sup. Ct. 1054; Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Lynch, \n177 \nU.S. 149, 152\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 631; Union Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n\n[249 U.S. 275, 295]\n\u00a0\n \n199 \nU.S. 194, 206\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 36, 4 Ann. Cas. 493; Galveston, Harrisburg, etc., Ry. Co. v. Texas, \n210 \nU.S. 217, 225\n, 28 S. Sup.

Cas. 1917E, 97; Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, \n246 \nU.S. 450, 453\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 373. In Fargo v. Hart, \n193 \nU.S. 490, 499\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 498, the court recognized the authority of Pullman's Car Co. v. Pennsylvania as supporting the acknowledged doctrine of organic unity and the reasonableness and constitutionality of the mileage proportion, but found in the particular case an exception to the rule.\n I can see nothing arbitrary or unreasonable in the general rule of mileage apportionment adopted by the state of Georgia, upon the authority of these repeated decisions of this court, for the taxation of railroad cars and other equipment habitually operated on lines extending within and without the state, and hence am convinced that the statute is not repugnant to the federal Constitution. If, for any reason that does not appear, the rule operated unfairly in this particular case, and imposed an unjust and inequitable burden of taxation upon plaintiff in error, it was incumbent upon plaintiff in error to show this by calling for an arbitration upon the question of true value, as permitted by the Georgia statutes (Civil Code,  1045-1046, 1050-1054), or by some appropriate proceeding for relief against the excessive part of the taxes. Having failed to do this although properly notified, it cannot in justice be heard to say that the valuation of its property, made according to a statutory rule that in its general application is just and reasonable, is in the particular case so excessive as to amount to a deprivation of property without due process of law, or an undue burden upon interstate commerce.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice CLARKE concur in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Civil Code of Georgia.\n Sec. 989.

CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN(1919)\nNo. 282\nArgued: March 25, 1919Decided: April 21, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[249 U.S. 517, 518]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Garret W. McEnerney and Wm. M. Abbott, both of San Francisco, Cal., for appellant.\n Messrs. Hiram W. Johnson and Thos. E. Haven, both of San Francisco, Cal., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity brought by the appellant to prevent the construction of a municipal street railway on Market street and adjoining streets in San Francisco with tracks on the two sides of the plaintiff's double track, for more than five blocks, and also to prevent the incidental \n\n[249 U.S. 517, 519]\n\u00a0\n cutting of the plaintiff's tracks. The appellant claims the right by grant and contract to forbid the proposed action and relies upon the Constitution of the United States, upon the State Constitution which provides that private property shall not be taken or damaged for public use without just compensation having first been made, and upon Article XII ,  2, of the charter of the city, requiring it to consider offers for the sale of existing public utilities before constructing new ones. The answer denies that damage to the plaintiff will ensue from the new tracks and denies as matter of law that the plaintiff has the contract or property rights alleged. On application for a preliminary injunction the District Court held that the plaintiff had failed to make out a case for it, and denied it, intimating an opinion against the plaintiff upon the matter of law involved. It then entered what is called a final decree denying all relief to the plaintiff with costs to the defendant. 239 Fed. 987. The present appeal is from that decree.\n The franchise of the plaintiff to maintain, its two tracks on Market street was granted to its predecessor in title in September, 1879. At that time by section 499 of the Civil Code of California, 'two corporations may be permitted to use the same street, each paying an equal portion for the construction of the track; but in no case must two railroad corporations occupy and use the same street or track for a distance of more than five blocks.' The existence of this general law is the first ground relied upon for the assertion of exclusive rights in the street by the plaintiff. The other ground is the order of the Board of Supervisors of San Francisco granting the franchise, and especially section 5 which is as follows:\n'It shall be lawful for the Board of Supervisors of the city and county of San Francisco to grant to one other corporation, and no more, the right to use either of the aforesaid streets for a distance of five blocks, and no more, after the forms and \n\n[249 U.S. 517, 520]\n\u00a0\n conditions specified in the 499th section of the civil code of the State. This section shall apply to persons and companies, as well as corporations.'\n\n We agree with the District Court that these sections did not give to the plaintiff the right it claims.\n The section of the Code would seem to be a limitation of the powers conferred upon the Board of Supervisors by that and the adjoining sections, not a contract by the State, or an authority to the Board to contract, against a larger use of the streets. It most naturally is read as merely a general law declaring the present legislative policy of the State. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co. v. Wheeling Bridge Co., \n138 \nU.S. 287, 292\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 201; Williams v. Wingo, \n177 U.S. 601\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 793; Wisconsin & Michigan Ry. Co. v. Powers, \n191 \nU.S. 379, 387\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 107; San Jose-Los Gatos Interurban Ry. Co. v. San Jose Ry. Co., 156 Fed. 455, 458, 84 C. C. A. 265, 13 Ann. Cas. 571. But however this may be neither that section nor section 5 of the order granting the franchise purports in terms to prevent the city from itself establishing a parallel road. If it be true, as the plaintiff argues, that the grant or contract in section 5 of the order means what the statute means and is to be construed by that, we have suggested what seems to us the natural construction of the act. But in any event it is decided by Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville, \n200 U.S. 22\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 224, that a covenant by a city not to grant to any other person or corporation a privilege similar to that granted to the covenantee does not restrict the city from itself exercising similar power; and it is assumed in that case, that the rinciple already is established as to legislative grants. \n200 U.S. 34\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 224. That is the assumption also of an amendment of section 499 by an Act of April 24, 1911. The city now is given power to establish and operate transportation service by the amendment of section 499 just mentioned and by the Constitution of the State. Article 11,  19. Amendment approved October 10, 1911. The plaintiff took the risk of the \n\n[249 U.S. 517, 521]\n\u00a0\n judicial interpretation of its franchise. and of this possible event. Madera Water Works v. Madera, \n228 U.S. 454\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 571. Of course, so far as the harm to the plaintiff is an inevitable consequence of the city's doing what the plaintiff's franchise did not make it unlawful for the city to do, the infliction of that harm is not a taking of the plaintiff's property that requires a resort to eminent domain.\n We understand that the municipal road now has been built, and the question is whether to retain the bill for a claim of damages. But as that would require new evidence and practically would present a new case, and as further, with such light as we now have, the right to damages seems at least doubtful, we deem it sufficient if the rights of the plaintiff, if any, in that regard, are reserved. The question is raised pointedly by Article I,  14, of the Constitution of 1879. That provides that 'private property shall not be taken or damaged for public use without just compensation having first been made,' etc. The plaintiff seems to argue that this section entitles it to preliminary compensation for any considerable pecuniary detriment that the City may inflict by the establishment of the new road, however lawfully it may act. Courts and judges have differed widely in their interpretation of this class of provisions in statutes of different sorts; but we should suppose, until otherwise instructed by the Supreme Court of the State, that the damage referred to in this section of the State Constitution in the main would be damage resulting from conduct that, like taking, would be tortious unless in proceedings under eminent domain or some law authorizing it on condition that damages be paid.\n As to crossing the plaintiff's tracks we are inclined to agree with the District Court that the plaintiff's franchise must be understood to be subject to this incident and that a taking by eminent doman was not necessary. Market Street Railway Co. v. Central Ry. Co., 51 Cal. \n\n[249 U.S. 517, 522]\n\u00a0\n 583; Consolidated Traction Co. v. South Orange & Maplewood Traction Co., 56 N. J. Eq. 569, 574, et seq., 40 Atl. 15; 3 Dillon, Municipal Corporations (5th Ed.)  1241, p. 1983. If we are wrong and if the crossings or the manner of operating the parallel tracks should give or has given rise to any claim, the decree will be without prejudice to such claim. We assume in accordance with the plaintiff's evidence and argument that the damage may be considerable and we think it just to leave open whatever can be left open, but at present we cannot say that the loss is or will be of such a character that it must be paid for, and we are satisfied that it is not such as to call for equitable relief.\n A general solicitation of offers for sale to the City of any existing street railway in San Francisco was passed by the Board of Supervisors and was ordered to be sent and was sent to the plaintiff, among others. We agree with the District Court that Article XII,  2, of the City Charter does not better the plaintiff's case.\n Decree affirmed without prejudice to further proceedings to recover any damages to which the plaintiff may be entitled. \n\n\n\n","229":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWAGNER v. CITY OF COVINGTON(1919)\nNo. 61\nArgued: Decided: December 8, 1919\n\n\n\n Messrs. Harry Brent Mackoy and W. H. Mackoy, both of Cincinnati, Ohio, for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[251 U.S. 95, 98]\n\u00a0\n Mr. A. E. Stricklett, of Covington, Ky., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action brought by plaintiffs in error in a state court of Kentucky against the city of Covington, a \n\n[251 U.S. 95, 99]\n\u00a0\n municipal corporation of that state, to recover license fees theretofore paid by them under certain ordinances of the city for the conduct of their business in Covington, and to enjoin the enforcement against them of a later ordinance calling for further like payments. The several ordinances, each in its turn, required all persons carrying on certain specified businesses in the city to take out licenses and pay license fees; among others, the business of wholesale dealer in what are known as 'soft drinks.' Plaintiffs were and are manufacturers of such drinks, having their factory and bottling works in the city of Cincinnati, in the state of Ohio, on the opposite side of the Ohio river from Covington. They have carried on and do carry on the business of selling in Covington soft drinks, the product of their manufacture, in the following manner: They have a list of retail dealers in Covington to whom they have been and are in the habit of making sales. Two or three times a week a wagon or other vehicle owned by plaintiffs is loaded at the factory in Cincinnati and sent across the river to Covington, and calls upon the retail dealers mentioned, many of whom have been for years on plaintiffs' list and have purchased their goods under a general understanding that plaintiffs' vehicle would call occasionally and furnish them with such soft drinks as they might need or desire to purchase from plaintiffs. When a customer's place of business is reached by the vehicle the driver goes into the storeroom and either asks or looks to see what amount of drinks is needed or wanted. He then goes out to the vehicle and brings from it the necessary quantity, which he carries into the store and delivers to the customer. Upon his trips to Covington he always carries sufficient drinks to meet the probable demands of the customers, based on past experience; but, with the exception of occasional small amounts carried for delivery in response to particular orders previously received at plaintiff's place of business in Cincinnati, all \n\n[251 U.S. 95, 100]\n\u00a0\n sales in Covington are made from the vehicle by the driver in the manner mentioned. Sometimes the driver succeeds in selling there the entire supply thus carried upon the wagon; sometimes only a part thereof; or he may return after having made but a few sales, or none at all, in which event he carries the unsold supply back to plaintiffs' place of business in Cincinnati. The soft drinks in question are delivered in stopped bottles or siphons, according to their nature, and these are placed (at the bottling works) in separate wooden or metal cases, each case being open at the top and holding a certain number of bottles or siphons, according to the nature of the drinks and the custom of the trade. The filled bottles or siphons are carried upon the vehicle, sold, and delivered in these cases; each case remaining entire and unbroken, and nothing less than a case being sold or delivered. The retail dealers usually pay cash, and purchase only the contents of the bottles, while the bottles and cases remain the property of plaintiffs and are subsequently collected, when empty, by plaintiffs' drivers or agents on their regular visits. There are, however, a few customers who pay for and thereafter own the bottles in which distilled water is delivered. The ordinances were and are respectively applicable to all wholesale dealers in such soft drinks in Covington, whether the goods were or are manufactured within or without the state.\n The trial court, and on appeal, the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, gave judgment for defendant, overruling the contention of plaintiffs that the ordinances as carried into effect against them were repugnant to the 'commerce clause' (article 1,  8) of the Constitution of the United States (177 Ky. 385, 197 S. W. 806), and upon this federal question the case is brought here by writ of error.\n It is important to observe the precise point that we have to determine. It is indisputable that with respect to the goods occasionally carried upon plaintiff's wagon from one \n\n[251 U.S. 95, 101]\n\u00a0\n state to the other in response to orders previously received at their place of business in Cincinnati, plaintiffs are engaged in interstate commerce, not subject to the licensing power of the Kentucky municipality. The Court of Appeals in the present case, in line with its previous decisions in City of Newport v. Wagner, 168 Ky. 641, 646, 182 S. W. 834, Ann. Cas. 1917A, 962, and City of Newport v. French Brothers Bauer Co., 169 Ky. 174, 183 S. W. 532, recognizing the authority of the decisions of this court bearing upon the subject, conceded that this part of plaintiffs' business was not subject to state regulation. 177 Ky. 388, 197 S. W. 806. At the same time the court held that with respect to the remaining and principal part of the business conducted in Covington, that which consists in carrying a supply of goods from place to place upon wagons, exposing them for sale, soliciting and negotiating sales, and immediately delivering the goods sold, plaintiffs were subject to the licensing ordinances; and it is with this alone that we have to deal. If, with respect to this portion of their business, plaintiffs may be subjected to the regulatory power of the state acting through the municipality, we are not concerned with the question whether the general language of the ordinances, if applied with respect to some other method of dealing with goods brought from state to state, might be repugnant to the federal Constitution.\n From the facts recited it is evident that, in essence, that part of plaintiffs' business which is subjected to regulation is the business of itinerant vender or peddler; a traveling from place to place within the state, selling goods that are carried about with the seller for the purpose. Plaintiffs in error insist that this view of the matter is untenable, because the courts of Kentucky have held that sales made to a retail merchant for resale do not constitute peddling within the meaning of the statutes of that state. Standard Oil Co. v. Commonwealth, 107 Ky. 606, 609, 55 S. W. 8; City of Newport v. French Brothers Bauer Co., 169 \n\n[251 U.S. 95, 102]\n\u00a0\n Ky. 174, 185, 183 S. W. 532. These decisions, however, deal merely with a question of statutory definition; and it hardly is necessary to repeat that when this court is called upon to test a state tax by the provisions of the Constitution of the United States, our decision must depend not upon the form of the taxing scheme, or any characterization of it adopted by the courts of the state, but rather upon the practical operation and effect of the tax as applied and enforced. The state court could not render valid, by misdescribing it, a tax law which in substance and effect was repugnant to the federal Constitution; neither can it render unconstitutional a tax, that in its actual effect violates no constitutional provision, by inaccurately defining it. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 362\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 99.\n We have then, a state tax upon the business of an itinerant vender of goods as carried on within the state, a tax applicable alike to all such dealers, irrespective of where their goods are manufactured, and without discrimination against goods manufactured in other states. It is settled by repeated decisions of this court that a license regulation or tax of this nature, imposed by a state with respect to the making of such sales of goods within its borders, is not to be deemed a regulation of or direct burden upon interstate commerce, although enforced impartially with respect to goods manufactured without as well as within the state, and does not conflict with the 'commerce clause.' Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall. 123, 140; Machine Co. v. Gage, \n100 U.S. 676\n; Emert v. Missouri, \n156 U.S. 296\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 367; Baccus v. Louisiana, \n232 U.S. 334\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 439.\n The peddler's license tax considered in Welton v. State of Missouri, \n91 U.S. 275\n, was denounced only because it amounted to a discrimination against the products of other states, and therefore to an interference with commerce among the states. To the same effect, Walling v. Michigan, \n116 \nU.S. 446, 454\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 454. \n\n[251 U.S. 95, 103]\n\u00a0\n Of course the transportation of plaintiffs' goods across the state line is of itself interstate commerce; but it is not this that is taxed by the city of Covington, nor is such commerce a part of the business that is taxed, or anything more than a preparation for it. So far as the itinerant vending is concerned, the goods might just as well have been manufactured within the state of Kentucky; to the extent that plaintiffs dispose of their goods in that kind of sales, they make them the subject of local commerce; and, this being so, they can claim no immunity from local regulation, whether the goods remain in original packages or not.\n The distinction between state regulation of peddlers and the attempt to impose like regulations upon drummers who solicit sales of goods that are to be thereafter transported in interstate commerce has always been recognized. In Robbins v. Shelby Taxing District, \n120 U.S. 489\n, at page 497, 7 Sup. Ct. 592, 596 (30 L. Ed. 694), Mr. Justice Bradley, who spoke for the court, said:\n'When goods are sent from one state to another for sale, or, in consequence of a sale, they become part of its general property, and amenable to its laws, provided that no discrimination be made against them as goods from another state, and that they be not taxed by reason of being brought from another state, but only taxed in the usual way as other goods are. Brown v. Houston, \n114 U.S. 622\n [5 Sup. Ct. 1091]; Machine Co. v. Gage, \n100 U.S. 676\n [25 L. Ed. 754]. But to tax the sale of such goods, or the offer to sell them, before they are brought into the state, is a very different thing, and seems to us clearly a tax on interstate commerce.'\n\n See, also, Crenshaw v. Arkansas, \n227 \nU.S. 389, 399\n, 400 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 294, where the distinction was clearly set forth. And in all the 'drummer cases' the fact has appeared that there was no selling from a stock of goods carried for the purpose but only a solicitation of sales, with or without the exhibition of samples; the goods sold to be thereafter transported from without the state.

Following the shooting, Chaloner suffered a nervous breakdown, and was ordered by his physician to take a long rest. He decided to visit his old friend, Maj. Emry, who, with Chaloner, was instrumental in founding Roanoke Rapids, a manufacturing town 5 miles from Weldon. Chaloner arrived at Weldon after traveling all night and was immediately hurried to Shadeland, where he received medical attention and temporary relief.'\n\n Claiming damages on account of shame, infamy, and disgrace inflicted, respondent brought an action against the publishing company in the Supreme Court, District of Co \n\n[250 U.S. 290, 292]\n\u00a0\n lumbia. He alleged:\n'The said defendant, meaning and intending ... to charge the plaintiff with the crime of murder in the killing of one John Gillard, when on the contrary the fact was, as defendant well knew, that while the plaintiff was engaged in a most laudable effort to prevent the said Gillard from murdering his wife, ... the said Gillard was in fact killed by accidental explosion of a pistol,' and 'contriving and intending to deprive the plaintiff of his said good name, credit, and reputation, and to bring him into scandal and disrepute among his friends, neighbors, and acquaintances, ... falsely and maliciously composed and published and caused to be composed and published of and concerning the plaintiff in a certain newspaper,' etc., the above- quoted item.\n\n Upon respondent's request the trial court charged:\n'The jury are instructed that the words contained in the publication sued on by the plaintiff herein imply that the crime of murder has been committed by the plaintiff and are actionable per se.'\n\n It further said to them:\n'The only question really for you to consider is how much damages the plaintiff should be allowed. You ought to allow him compensation; no special damages have been shown and only general damages can be allowed, but where the libel is published, where words are published of the plaintiff which constituted a libel, which charge him with having committed a crime, for instance, as in this case, the law presumes that the plaintiff has been damaged, without proof of any special damage, because the law takes notice of the fact that a libel travels, and it comes to a great many different readers, and that it would be impossible for a plaintiff to trace out the circulation of the libel, and show by whom it had been read, and how it had affected their opinion of him, and all that; so that the jury are justified in allowing substantial damages to a plaintiff against whom a libel has been published, without proof of any particular or substantial damage to him.' \n\n[250 U.S. 290, 293]\n\u00a0\n Judgment in favor of respondent upon a verdict for $10,000 was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. Chaloner v. Washington Post Co., 36 App. D. C. 231; Washington Post. Co. v. Chaloner, 47 App. D. C. 66.\n\n We think the quoted instructions to the jury were erroneous and harmful to petitioner.\n The applicable rule was tersely stated by the Circuit Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, through Judge Lurton, afterwards of this Court, in Commercial Publishing Co. v. Smith, 149 Fed. 704, 706, 707, 79 C. C. A. 410, 142. Citing supporting authorities, he said:\n'A publication claimed to be defamatory must be read and construed in the sense in which the readers to whom it is addressed would ordinarily underatand it. So the whole item, including display lines, should be read and construed together, and its meaning and signification thus determined. When thus read, if its meaning is so unambiguous as to reasonably bear but one interpretation, it is for the judge to say whether that signification is defamatory or not. If, upon the other hand, it is capable of two meanings, one of which would be libelous and actionable and the other not, it is for the jury to say, under all the circumstances sursounding its publication, including extraneous facts admissible in evidence, which of the two meanings would be attributed to it by those to whom it is addressed or by whom it may be read.'\n\n See Peck v. Tribune Company, \n214 \nU.S. 185, 190\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 554, 16 Ann. Cas. 1075\n\n\n Counsel for respondent admit (and properly so) that, upon the authorities, a published item saying, 'C. shot and killed G.,' without more, would not be libelous per se; it does not set forth the commission of a crime in unambiguous words. And we are unable to conclude that, as matter of law, addition of the words 'while the latter was abusing his wife, who had taken refuge at Merry Mills, Chaloner's home,' would convert such a statement into a definite charge of murder. On the contrary, they might at least suggest to reasonable minds that the homicide was \n\n[250 U.S. 290, 294]\n\u00a0\n without malice. Considering the wide circulation of present-day newspapers and their power for doing injury to reputation, it is highly important that the ancient doctrine 'Whatever a man publishes he publishes at his peril' should be strictly enforced. But this cannot be done properly by taking away from the jury doubtful questions of fact.\n We find no reason to disagree with the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeals in respect of the other errors there assigned.\n A writing entitled 'Answer to Petition for Writ of Certiorari and Discussion of Matters of Fact in Brief for Petitioner,' signed 'John Armstrong Chaloner, Pro Se,' and filed here April 21, 1919, contains much irrelevant and scandalous matter and is unfit for our files. It must be stricken from them.\n The judgment below must be reversed, and the cause remanded to the Supreme Court, with instructions to grant a new trial.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE took no part in the consideration or decision of this cause. \n\n\n\n","231":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWEBB v. U. S.(1919)\nNo. 370\nArgued: January 16, 1919Decided: March 3, 1919\n\n\n\n Messrs. Ralph Davis and Ike W. Crabtree, both of Memphis, Tenn., for Webb and another. \n\n[249 U.S. 96, 97]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Porter, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the provisions of the Harrison Narcotic Drug Act ( Act Dec. 17, 1914, c. 1, 38 Stat. 785; Comp. St.  6287g-6287q), considered in United States v. Doremus (No. 367, just decided: \n249 U.S. 86\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 214. The case comes here upon a certificate from the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. From the certificate it appears that Webb and Goldbaum were convicted and sentenced in the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Tennessee on a charge of conspiracy (section 37, Penal Code [Act March 4, 1909, c. 321, 35 Stat. 1096; Comp. St.  10201]) to violate the Harrison Narcotic Law. While the certificate states that the indictment is inartificial, it is certified to be sufficient to support a prosecution upon the theory that Webb and Goldbaum intended to have the latter violate the law by using the order blanks (section 1 of the act) for a prohibited purpose.\n The certificate states:\n'If section 2, rightly construed, forbids sales to a non-registrable user, and if such prohibition is constitutional, we next meet the question whether such orders as Webb gave to applicants are 'prescription,' within the meaning of exception (b) in section 2.\n\n'We conclude that the case cannot be disposed of without determining the construction and perhaps the constitutionality of the law in certain particulars, and for the purpose of certification, we state the facts as follows-assuming, as for this purpose we must do, that whatever the evidence tended to show, in aid of the prosecution, must be taken as a fact:\n\n'Webb was a practicing physician and Goldbaum a retail druggist, in Memphis. It was Webb's regular cus tom \n\n[249 U.S. 96, 98]\n\u00a0\n and practice to prescribe morphine for habitual users, upon their application to him therefor. He furnished these 'prescriptions,' not after consideration of the applicant's individual case, and in such quantities and with such direction as, in his judgment, would tend to cure the habit, or as might be necessary or helpful in an attempt to break the habit, but with such consideration and rather in such quantities as the applicant desired for the sake of continuing his accustomed use. Goldbaum was familiar with such practice and habitually filled such prescriptions. Webb had duly registered and paid the special tax as required by section 1 of the act. Goldbaum had also registered and paid such tax and kept all records required by the law. Goldbaum had been provided with the blank forms contemplated by section 2 of the act for use in ordering morphine, and, by the use of such blank order forms, had obtained from the wholesalers, in Memphis, a stock of morphine. It had been agreed and understood between Webb and Goldbaum that Goldbaum should, by using such order forms, procure a stock of morphine, which morphine he should and would sell to those who desired to purchase and who came provided with Webb's so-called prescriptions. It was the intent of Webb and Goldbaum that morphine should thus be furnished to the habitual users thereof by Goldbaum and without any physician's prescription issued in the course of a good faith attempt to cure the morphine habit. In order that these facts may have their true color, it should also be stated that within a period of eleven months Goldbaum purchased from wholesalers, in Memphis, thirty times as much morphine as was bought by the average retail druggist doing a larger general business, and he sold narcotic drugs in 6,500 instances; that Webb regularly charged fifty cents for each so-called prescription, and within this period had furnished, and Goldbaum had filled, over four thousand such prescriptions; and that one Rabens, a user of the \n\n[249 U.S. 96, 99]\n\u00a0\n drug, came from another state and applied to Webb for morphine and was given at one time ten so-called prescriptions for one drachm each, which prescriptions were filled at one time by Goldbaum upon Rabens' presentation, although each was made out in a separate and fictitious name.'\n\n Upon these facts the Circuit Court of Appeals propounds to this court three questions:\n\n 1. \n'Does the first sentence of section 2 of the Harrison Act prohibit retail sales of morphine by druggists to persons who have no physician's prescription, who have no order blank therefor and who cannot obtain an order blank because not of the class to which such blanks are allowed to be issued?'\n\n 2. \n'If the answer to question one is in the affirmative, does this construction make unconstitutional the prohibition of such sale?'\n\n 3. \n'If a practicing and registered physician issues an order for morphine to an habitual user thereof, the order not being issued by him in the course of professional treatment in the attempted cure of the habit, but being issued for the purpose of providing the user with morphine sufficient to keep him comfortable by maintaining his customary use, is such order a physician's prescription under exception (b) of section 2?'\n'If question one is answered in the negative, or question two in the affirmative, no answer to question three will be necessary; and if question three is answered in the affirmative, questions one and two become immaterial.'\n\n What we have said of the construction and purpose of the act in No. 367 plainly requires that question one should be answered in the affirmative. Question two should be answered in the negative for the reasons stated in the opinion in No. 367. As to question three-to call such an order for the use of morphine a physician's prescription would be so plain a perversion of meaning that \n\n[249 U.S. 96, 100]\n\u00a0\n no discussion of the subject is required. That question should be answered in the negative.\n Answers directed accordingly.\n For the reasons which prevented him from assenting in No. 367, the Chief Justice also dissents in this case.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concur in the dissent. \n\n\n\n","232":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWEIGLE v. CURTICE BROS. CO.(1919)\nNo. 83\nArgued: December 17, 1918Decided: January 7, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[248 U.S. 285, 286]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Spencer Haven, Atty. Gen., Walter H. Bender, Deputy Atty. Gen., and J. E. Messerschmidt, Asst. Atty. Gen., for appellant.\n Mr. H. O. Fairchild, of Green Bay, Wis., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity brought by Curtice Brothers Company, a New York corporation, to restrain Weigle, the Dairy and Food Commissioner of Wisconsin, from enforcing certain laws of the State, especially Statutes of 1913,  4601g. That section makes it unlawful to sell any article of food that contains benzoic acid or benzoates, with qualifications not material here. The plaintiff makes such articles from fruit, and adds benzoate of soda as a preservative. It put them up in glass bottles and jars properly labelled under the Food and Drugs Act (June 30, 1906, c. 3915, 34 Stat. 768 [Comp. St.  8717-8728]) packs the bottles and jars in wooden cases containing a number of the same, and ships the cases from its factory in New York to customers in Wisconsin among others. Of course the single bottles are sold in the retail trade, and their contents are served to guests in restaurants and hotels. The defendant disavowed any contention that the state laws affected or purported to affect sales by the importer in the unbroken wooden packages containing the bottles and the decree \n\n[248 U.S. 285, 287]\n\u00a0\n treated that subject as taken out of the case. But the bill went farther and setting up a decision, incorporated in a regulation under the Food and Drugs Act, that benzoate of soda is not injurious to health and that objection would not be raised to it under the Act if each container should be plainly labelled, contended that under the Food and Drugs Act and the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, the Wisconsin law was invalid even as applied to domestic retail sales of single bottles or the contents of single bottles of the plaintiff's goods. The defendant stood on a motion to dismiss and the District Court made a decree following the prayer of the bill. The defendant appealed.\n The argument in support of the decree contends in various forms that the sale of the individual bottles when removed from the original package after entering the State, still is a part of commerce among the States, since the Act of Congress as to misbranding applies to them. But the Food and Drugs Act does not change or purport to change the moment at which an object ceases to move in interstate commerce. It imposes an obligation to label the bottles severally, although contained in one original package, as of course it may. Seven Cases of Eckman's Alterative v. United States, \n239 \nU.S. 510, 515\n, 516 S., 36 Sup. Ct. 190, L. R. A. 1916D, 164. It provides for seizure and condemnation of misbranded or adulterated articles that have been transported from one State to another, although the transit is at an end, while the articles remain unsold or in original unbroken packages, as again it may. There is no reason why a lien ex delicto should be lost by the end of the journey in which the wrong was done. The two things have no relation to each other. Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, \n220 \nU.S. 45, 57\n, 58 S., 31 Sup. Ct. 364. Finally the duty to retain the label upon the single bottles does not disappear at once. For reasons stated in McDermott v. Wisconsin, \n228 U.S. 115\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 431, 47 L. R. A. (N. S.) 984, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 39, if the State could require the label to be removed while the bottles remained in the importer's hands unsold it could \n\n[248 U.S. 285, 288]\n\u00a0\n interfere with the means reasonably adopted by Congress to make its regulations obeyed. But all this has nothing to do with the question when interstate commerce is over and the articles carried in it have come under the general power of the State. The law upon that point has undergone no change.\n The Food and Drugs Act indicates its intent to respect the recognized line of distinction between domestic and interstate commerce too clearly to need argument or an examination of its language. It naturally would, as the distinction is constitutional. The fact that a food or drug might be condemned by Congress if it passed from State to State, does not carry an immunity of foods or drugs, making the same passage, that it does not condemn. Neither the silence of Congress nor the decisions of officers of the United States have any authority beyond the domain established by the Constitution. Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co., \n240 \nU.S. 342, 362\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 370, L. R. A. 1917A, 421, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 455. When objects of commerce get within the sphere of State legislation the States may exercise its independent judgment and prohibit what Congress did not see fit to forbid. When they get within that sphere is determined, as we have said, by the old long-established criteria. The Food and Drugs Act does not interfere with State regulation of selling at retail. Armour & Co. v. North Dakota, \n240 \nU.S. 510, 517\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 440, Ann. Cas. 1916D, 548; McDermott v. Wisconsin, \n228 \nU.S. 115, 131\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 43, 47 L. R. A. (N. S.) 984, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 39. Such regulation is not an attempt to supplement the action of Congress in interstate commerce but the exercise of an authority outside of that commerce that always has remained in the States.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","233":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWERK v. PARKER(1919)\nNo. 73\nArgued: November 21, 1918Decided: March 3, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. T. Hart Anderson, of New York City, for petitioners.\n Messrs. John Weaver and Frederick S. Drake, both of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners sued respondents in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for infringement of two divisional patents, Nos. 758,574 and 758,575, granted April 26, 1904, to Robert F. Werk. Defendants answered denying patentable novelty, and also denying infringement. The patents relate to an oil-press mat or cloth for use in the extraction of cotton-seed oil. The claim in issue under the former patent was for: \n\n[249 U.S. 130, 131]\n\u00a0\n 'An oil-press mat or cloth made entirely of long animal hair and consisting of warp and weft threads, said weft-threads being composed exclusively of soft, pliable hair and the warp- threads greatly exceeding the weft-threads in number per square inch.'\n And in the second patent:\n'An oil-press mat or cloth consisting of warp-threads and weft- threads, each composed exclusively of long hair derived from animals' tails and manes, which hair is soft and pliable; the warp-threads exceeding the weft-threads in number per square inch, and the weft- threads being thicker than the warp-threads.'\n\n The District Court dismissed the bill on the ground of noninfringement. 221 Fed. 644. The Circuit Court of Appeals, without discussing this question, affirmed the decree upon the ground that the patent disclosed no such novel information to the oil-pressing art as warranted a grant of the patent monopoly. 231 Fed. 121, 145 C. C. A. 309. At the conclusion of its opinion the court stated (231 Fed. 125, 145 C. C. A. 309) that, in view of the fact that certain references quoted were not given in evidence, the sending down of the mandate would be deferred for a time to permit of an application for reargument or other form of relief to meet such references. Thereupon a petition for a rehearing was filed in behalf of appellants, which, while not disputing the accuracy of the results disclosed by the court's investigation, insisted that there was error in giving effect to the anticipatory matter thus disclosed, and in 'failing to give controlling consideration to the fact that both of the two claims declared upon are laid not only to a particular woven structure of an oil-press mat, but also to an oil-press mat of such particular woven structure, when its threads are composed of animal hair.' The rehearing was refused, after which the present writ of certiorari was allowed. \n242 U.S. 645\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 239.\n In the process of obtaining oil from cotton seed, the \n\n[249 U.S. 130, 132]\n\u00a0\n seeds, having been cleaned and freed from lint, are hulled and chopped up, the meats being separated from the hulls; the meats are passed through a crusher, next cooked in water, and after this are spread upon an oil-press mat or cloth, the ends of which are folded over to cover the upper surface of the cooked meats. The mat with its inclosed mass of meats is then placed in a press and subjected to a pressure of about 4,000 pounds, which has the effect of expressing the oil through the mat as through a strainer.\n One of the patents declares, and the evidence at the hearing indicated, that the highest grade of mat previously in general use was made of camel's hair, and that this was objectionable because of its tendency to pack and felt together when in use to such an extent as to hinder the free flow of the oil, and also because of its want of durability. The use of long animal hair, specifically horse hair, obviated this difficulty to such an extent as materially to reduce the percentage of oil wasted, as well as the cost of the mat in proportion to the product. Defendants accomplished like results with mats woven from human hair.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, while finding that the change from camel's hair to horse-hair mats was sufficient to constitute invention in the art, if this use of horse-hair mats was first disclosed by Werk, nevertheless found, from an examination of standard works, that the patentee's use was but a revival of an old and well-recognized use of such mats in the art of oil extraction. Reference was made to the British Encyclopedia, 9th edition, 1884, the Standard Dictionary of 1894, and a multitude of other publications long antedating the application for the patent.\n It is not questioned that these references abundantly showed that the use of hair cloth, and especially horse-hair cloth, in the making of oil- press mats or cloths, was well known in the art long before the patents in suit.\n Nor is it questioned-indeed, we deem it clear, beyond \n\n[249 U.S. 130, 133]\n\u00a0\n question-that the court was justified in taking judicial notice of facts that appeared so abundantly from standard works accessible in every considerable library. Brown v. Piper, \n91 U.S. 37\n, 42; Terhune v. Phillips, \n99 U.S. 592\n.\n The burden of petitioner's argument in this court, as in the application for a rehearing in the circuit court of appeals, is that there was nothing in these publications to show that the horse-hair cloth so familiar in the art embodied the 'structural characteristics' of the oil- press mats of the patents in suit, referring to the peculiar mode of weaving described in the claims. But at the hearing it was clearly proved, and was conceded to be beyond controversy, that the patents involved no claim of an improvement in the art of weaving, but only the application of that art and a combination of threads of a certain type and character in order to produce a particular result. And this, in our opinion, goes no further than a mere mechanical adaptation of familiar materials and methods, not rising to the dignity of invention. Atlantic Works v.

Ledbetter, of Ardmore, Okl., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a contest between claimants to the ownership of a tract of land now part of Carter county, Oklahoma, and prior to June 21, 1906, a part of the twentieth recording district, Ryan (office of the recording district), Indian Territory. Thereafter it was in the twenty-ninth recording district, Duncan (office of the recording district), Indian Territory.\n The facts so far as pertinent are:\n On the twenty-seventh day of June, 1906, Wilburn Adams, who held title to the land, made and delivered a deed for the same to the plaintiff in error, Whitehead, which deed was filed for record in the office of the twentieth recording dis trict \n\n[249 U.S. 79, 81]\n\u00a0\n at Ryan, Indian Territory, on the twenty-eighth day of June, 1906, and was duly recorded. Afterwards Adams and wife made a warranty deed of the same property to James O. Galloway, dated November 16, 1906, and recorded November 22, 1906, in the office of the twenty-ninth recording district of the Indian Territory at Duncan. Galloway on the 24th day of December, 1906, conveyed the same to Winfield S. Pressgrove and his wife, which deed was recorded at Duncan. Pressgrove and wife executed to the Travelers' Insurance Company of Hartford, Connecticut, a mortgage on the land dated March 22, 1907, recorded April 5, 1907, in the office of the twenty-ninth recording district at Duncan, Indian Territory. Pressgrove and wife executed a mortgage to the Atkinson, Warren & Henley Company dated March 22, 1907, recorded April 24, 1907, in the office of the twenty-ninth recording district at Duncan.\n On June 21, 1906, Congress passed an act (34 Stat. 343):\n'That in addition to the places now provided by law for holding courts in the Southern judicial district of Indian Territory courts shall be held in the town of Duncan, and all laws regulating the holding of the courts in the Indian Territory shall be applicable to the said court hereby created in said town of Duncan. That the territory next hereinafter described shall be known as recording district numbered twenty-nine, beginning at a point where township line between townships two and three north reaches the east boundary line of Oklahoma Territory; thence east on said township line twenty- four miles to where it intersects with range line three and four west; thence south on said range line twelve miles to where it intersects the base line between townships one north and one south; thence east along said base line six miles to the range line between ranges two and three west; thence south twelve miles along said range line to the township line between townships two \n\n[249 U.S. 79, 82]\n\u00a0\n and three south; thence west thirty miles along said township line to where it intersects with the east line of Oklahoma Territory; thence north along said line twenty-four miles to the place of beginning; and the place of recording and holding court in said district shall be Duncan.'\n\n Prior to the passage of this act of Congress the lands involved in this case were located in the twentieth recording district of the Indian Territory, known as the 'Ryan district.' But this act made them a part of the twenty-ninth recording district, known as the 'Duncan recording district.' On June 30, 1906, C. M. Campbell, who was then clerk of the United States Court for the Southern District of the Indian Territory, appointed C. N. Jackson deputy clerk and ex officio recorder for the newly- created twenty-ninth recording district, with headquarters at Duncan. C. N. Jackson took and subscribed the oath of office and filed his bond on June 30, 1906, and his appointment was duly approved by the United States Court at Ardmore on the same day. He arrived at Duncan and first opened his office on July 7, 1906, and the first entry made upon the books was upon that date. No recording office was opened at Duncan prior to July 7, 1906, when C. N. Jackson arrived and opened one.\n From the time of the conveyance of the lands to Pressgrove (December 24, 1906) he has been in the actual possession thereof.\n The lower court and the Supreme Court of Oklahoma decided in favor of Galloway and his successors, holding that the recording of the deed, made to Whitehead, at Ryan, was not constructive notice to the subsequent purchasers. 153 Pac. 1101, rehearing denied without opinion 157 Pac. xxiii.\n At the time of the passage of the statute of June 21, 1906, another statute provided in effect (Act Feb. 19, 1903, c. 707, 32 Stat. 841, 10 Fed. States. [1st Ed.] 130):\n That chapter 27 of the Digest of the Statutes \n\n[249 U.S. 79, 83]\n\u00a0\n of Arkansas of 1884 be extended to the Indian Territory so far as the same is applicable and not inconsistent with any law of Congress; that the clerk or deputy clerk of the United States court of each of the courts of the territory should be ex officio recorder for his district and perform the duties required of the recorder in the chapter of Mansfield's Digest, hereinafter referred to. The duty was placed on each clerk or deputy clerk to record in the books provided for the office all deeds, mortgages, etc. Instruments theretofore recorded with the clerk of the United States Court for the Indian Territory were not required to be again recorded, but should be transferred to the indexes without further cost, and that such records theretofore made should be of full force and effect. That whenever in said chapter (Mansfield's Digest) the word 'county' occurs there should be substituted the word 'district' and wherever the words 'state' or 'state of Arkansas' occur there should be substituted therefor the words 'Indian Territory,' and wherever the words 'clerk' or 'recorder' occur there should be substituted the words 'clerk or deputy clerk of the United States court.' The statute further provides that all instruments of writing, the filing of which is provided by law, should be recorded or filed in the office of the clerk or deputy clerk at the place of holding court in the recording district where said property may be located.\n The provisions of Mansfield's Digest, which Congress extended to the Indian Territory so far as applicable, provide (Mansfield's Digest 1884, c. 27,  671):\n'No deed, bond, or instrument of writing, for the conveyance of any real estate, or by which the title thereto may be affected in law or equity, hereafter made or executed, shall be good or valid against a subsequent purchaser of such real estate for a valuable consideration, without actual notice thereof; or against any creditor of the person executing such deed, bond, or instrument, ob taining \n\n[249 U.S. 79, 84]\n\u00a0\n a judgment or decree, which by law may be a lien upon such real estate, unless such deed, bond, or instrument, duly executed and acknowledged, or approved, as is or may be required by law, shall be filed for record in the office of the clerk and ex officio recorder of the county where such real estate may be situated.'\n\n Congress made no provision whereby deeds to lands in the new district were to be recorded at Ryan in the old district pending the opening of the office in the new district at Duncan. The provision as to transfer of recorded instruments to the new indexes 32 Stat. 842, applied to instruments theretofore recorded. See Bank v. Keys, \n229 U.S. 179\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 642\n\n\n Cases cited by plaintiff in error, where statutes provide for the organization of new counties, and holding that until such new counties are organized the place for recording is the old county where the lands are situated, are not apposite. Congress itself declared and defined the new recording district, and the applicable provisions of Mansfield's Digest provided that no conveyance should be constructive notice against a subsequent purchaser unless such deed should be filed for record in the office of the clerk and ex officio recorder of the district where the real estate was situated. The statute is explicit, and when Whitehead bought from Adams the requirement of the law was plain that the deed should be filed for record at Duncan in the new district. See Astor v. Wells, 4 Wheat. 466. But, it is said, at the time of the conveyance to Whitehead, no office had been established at Duncan. This fact, however, did not continue Ryan as the place for recording deeds for lands in the new district.\n The requirements of the legislation are positive, making Duncan the place for filing the deed in the new recording district where the lands are situated. The plaintiff in error urges that until an office was opened at Duncan it was impossible to record a deed there. This \n\n[249 U.S. 79, 85]\n\u00a0\n fact does present an anomalous situation, not to be remedied, however, by judicial construction in derogation of positive and controlling legislation.\n Moreover, by the agreed statement of facts it appears that a deputy clerk, who became ex officio recorder, was appointed June 30, 1906, and opened his office for the transaction of business at Duncan on July 7, 1906. The conveyance from Adams to Galloway was made on November 16, 1906. Had Whitehead filed his deed for record at Duncan after the recording office was opened there and prior to November 16, 1906, Galloway and the subsequent purchasers would have had constructive notice by means of this record of the prior conveyance. But all that Whitehead did was to file his deed at Ryan after the lands had become part of the Duncan district. After the opening of the Duncan office, it was his duty, if he would charge others with constructive notice, to file his deed in the office at Duncan. Had he done this he would have had a conveyance of record which would have been constructive notice to subsequent purchasers. Such constructive notice was not conveyed to Galloway and the subsequent purchasers by the filing of the deed for record at Ryan in the old district. It results that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","235":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWILLIAMS v. VREELAND(1919)\nNo. 318\nArgued: Decided: June 2, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. Stuart G. Gibboney, of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Pierre P. Garven, of Jersey City, N. J., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Williams, as receiver, sued defendant in error in the United States District Court for New Jersey to enforce \n\n[250 U.S. 295, 296]\n\u00a0\n an assessment against her levied by the Comptroller of the Currency ( section 5151, Rev. Stat.) because she apparently owned certain stock of the First National Bank when it failed, December 6, 1913. She admits that the certificates were made out in her name and at time of the failure were so entered on the bank books. But she claims that, without her knowledge or consent, her husband caused them to be thus issued and entered, and, further, that although she signed blank powers of attorney indorsed thereon and thereby made it possible to transfer the stock from her name, she never really approved, ratified, or acquiesced in the transfer to herself.\n Each side asked for an instructed verdict without more. The trial judge directed one in favor of Mrs. Vreeland, and in support of this action said:\n'Although the burden was upon the defendant to show that she was not in fact the owner of the stock (Finn v. Brown, \n142 \nU.S. 56, 67\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 136), I think that she has borne the burden by proving that the placing of the stock in her name in the first instance was unauthorized-without her knowledge and consent-and that she did not thereafter acquiesce in this act or in any way ratify it . ... I am constrained to hold, therefore, that the defendant is not liable and that a verdict should be directed in her favor.'\n\n Final judgment entered upon the consequent verdict was approved by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 244 Fed. 346, 156 C. C. A. 632.\n In respect of the evidence and its conclusions therefrom the latter court said:\n'The plaintiff proved that the defendant was a shareholder of record and that she did nothing to remove her name as such. This was sufficient to establish prima facie the defendant's liability. Finn v. Brown, supra; Matteson v. Dent, \n176 \nU.S. 521, 530\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 419. The burden then shifted to her (Finn v. Brown) to show that the act of making her a shareholder was in the first in \n\n[250 U.S. 295, 297]\n\u00a0\n stance unauthorized; that it was without her knowledge or consent; and that she has not since acquiesced in or ratified it. That she has sustained the burden upon the first two points is not disputed; therefore the remaining question is as to evidence of her ratification. ... Considering this testimony in connection with corroborating testimony, it appears to us that what Mary A. Vreeland did, in legal effect, was to make a valid execution of a power of attorney for the transfer of stock. That act, in so far as it authorized a transfer of stock, she cannot avoid by pleading ignorance. As the question here does not involve the validity of the act to effect a transfer, but concerns its evidential imputation of the knowledge with which it was done, we are of opinion that the circumstances which attended the act were a part of it, and affected the evidential inferences to be drawn from it. These circumstances show that, before acting, the defendant requested to be informed as to what she was asked to do; this information was denied her. It was denied her under representations and influences which, when she acted, led her to believe she was doing something entirely different from that which she was actually doing; that is, she was made to believe she was correcting a mistake of her husband, a mistake affecting his affairs, not that she was dealing with or assigning away her own property. Therefore we think the circumstances were such as to negative the knowledge, which otherwise it is presumed her act would have imparted. They contradicted the normal imputations of her act, and left her without that knowledge which was a prerequisite to a valid ratification of her husband's unauthorized act.'\n\n It further held:\n'Instead of submitting the case to the jury, however, each party asked the court for binding instructions in his favor, which, under Beuttell v. Magone, \n157 U.S. 154\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 566, is not a submission to the court without the intervention \n\n[250 U.S. 295, 298]\n\u00a0\n of a jury, within the intent of Rev. Stat.  649, 700 (Comp. St.  1587, 1668), but is equivalent to a joint request for a finding of fact by the court, and when the court, acting upon such request, directs the jury to find for one of the parties, both are concluded on its finding. In this case the parties submitted to the court the question of the wife's ratification of her husband's unauthorized act; that question was one of fact; upon it depended her liability. The court's decision, as evidenced by its instruction to the jury that they render a verdict for the defendant, was a finding of fact, which concluded both parties as effectually as if the same fact had been found by the jury.'\n\n The established rule is:\n'Where both parties request a peremptory instruction and do nothing more they thereby assume the facts to be undisputed and, in effect, submit to the trial judge the determination of the inferences proper to be drawn therefrom.'\n\n And upon review a finding of fact by the trial court under such circumstances must stand if the record discloses substantial evidence to support it. Anderson v. Messenger, 158 Fed. 250, 253, 85 C. C. A. 468; Beuttell v. Magone, supra, \n157 U.S. 154\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 566; Empire State Cattle Co. v. Atchison Ry. Co., \n210 \nU.S. 1, 8\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 607, 15 Ann. Cas. 70; Sena v. American Turquoise Co., \n220 \nU.S. 497, 501\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 488; American National Bank v. Miller, \n229 \nU.S. 517, 520\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 883; Mead v. Chesbrough Bldg. Co., 151 Fed. 998, 1002, 81 C. C. A. 184; American National Bank v. Miller, 185 Fed. 338, 341, 107 C. C. A. 456.\n Counsel for the receiver maintained that, when Mrs. Vreeland indorsed the certificates in blank at the request of her husband, who declared this necessary to enable him to correct his mistake, she thereby indisputably ratified his unauthorized transfer of the stock to her and assumed the duty promptly to remove her name from the bank books or suffer the liability imposed upon duly registered shareholders. But we think the courts below rightly held that facts and circumstances concerning this indorsement could be shown in order to negative the inference which \n\n[250 U.S. 295, 299]\n\u00a0\n would have followed if unexplained. Glenn v. Garth, 133 N. Y. 18, 36, 37, 30 N. E. 649, 31 N. E. 344. And as without doubt there is substantial evidence tending to show she had no actual intention to ratify, affirm, or acquiesce in her husband's unauthorized act, we must accept that as finally established.\n In Keyser v. Hitz, \n133 U.S. 138\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 290, which involved the liability of a married woman for an assessment levied against national bank stockholders, speaking through Mr. Justice Harlan, this court approved a charge:\n'If the stock in controversy was transferred upon the books of the German-American Savings Bank to and in the name of the defendant without her knowledge and consent, she was entitled to a verdict, unless she subsequently ratified and confirmed such transfer.'\n\n And it was further said:\n'We must not be understood as saying that the mere transfer of the stocks on the books of the bank to the name of the defendant imposed upon her the individual liability attached by law to the position of shareholder in a national banking association. If the transfers were, in fact, without her knowledge and consent, and she was not informed of what was so done-nothing more appearing-she would not be held to have assumed or incurred liability for the debts, contracts, and engagements of the bank. But if, after the transfers, she joined in the application to convert the savings bank into a national bank, or in any other mode approved, ratified or acquiesced in such transfers, or accepted any of the benefits arising from the ownership of the stock thus put in her name on the books of the bank, she was liable to be treated as a shareholder, with such responsibility as the law imposes upon the shareholders of national banks.'\n\n Approval, ratification, and acquiescence all presuppose the existence of some actual knowledge of the prior action and what amounts to a purpose to abide by it. Owings v. Hull, 9 Pet. 607, 629; Western National Bank v. Armstrong, \n152 \nU.S. 346, 352\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 572; Glenn v. Garth, supra. When \n\n[250 U.S. 295, 300]\n\u00a0\n defendant in error signed blank powers of attorney she did not know what her husband had done, and certainly entertained no purpose to approve transfer of the certificates to herself. She thought she was merely doing something to enable him to correct his avowed mistake and nothing else. Nobody was misled or put in a worse position as the result of her act. 'As between the original parties that could not be deemed a ratification which was accompanied by a refusal to ratify and a declared purpose to undo the unauthorized act. The form adopted, by itself and unexplained, would tend to an inference of ratification, but it is not left unexplained. The actual truth is established, and that truth must prevail over the form adopted as between parties who have not been misled, to their harm, by the form of the transaction as distinguished from its substance.' 'The presumption which might have flowed from the form of the transaction disappears upon the explanation made, and in view of the substantial truth proved by the evidence.' Glenn v. Garth, supra, 133 N. Y. 36, 37, 30 N. E. 651, 652.\n The record reveals no material error, and the judgment below is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","236":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWISE v. U S(1919)\nNo. 214\nArgued: March 11, 1919Decided: March 31, 1919\n\n\n\n Messrs. Wm. B. King and George A. King, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n\n\n[249 U.S. 361, 363]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Brown, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In December, 1904, Stannard, represented in this case by his trustee in bankruptcy, contracted tracted with the United States to erect two laboratory buildings for the Department of Agriculture, in the city of Washington, D. C., for $1,171,000. The buildings were both to be completed in 30 months and for a delay of 101 days beyond the contract period the government deducted from the contract price $200 a day, the amount stipulated in the contract as liquidated damages, a total of $20,200, and the claim made in this court is for the recovery of that amount.\n The Court of Claims dismissed the petition and the case is here on appeal.\n The contract was in writing and the specifications, which the contractor had before him when bidding, were made a part of it. These specifications contain the following:\n'11. Each bidder must submit his proposal with the distinct understanding that, in case of its acceptance, time for the completion of the work shall be considered as \n\n[249 U.S. 361, 364]\n\u00a0\n of the essence of the contract, and that for the cost of all extra inspection and for all amounts paid for rents, salaries and other expenses entailed upon the United States by delay in completing the contract, the United States shall be entitled to the fixed sum of $ 200, as liquidated damages, computed, estimated, and agreed upon, for each and every day's delay not caused by the United States.'\n\n The provision of the contract upon the subject is:\n'3. To complete the said work in all its parts within 30 months from the date of the receipt of the notice referred to in subdivision 2 hereof. Time is to be considered as of the essence of the contract, and in case the completion of said work shall be delayed beyond said period, the party of the second part may, in view of the difficulty of estimating with exactness the damages which will result, deduct as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, the sum of two hundred dollars ($200.00) for each and every day during the continuance of such delay and until such work shall be completed, and such deductions may be made from time to time from any payments due hereunder.'\n\n There is no dispute as to the extent of the delay and the sole contention of the appellant is that, because a single sum in damages is stipulated for, without regard to whether the completion of one or both buildings should be delayed, and because the damage to the government would probably be less in amount if one were completed on time and the other not, than if the completion of both were delayed, the provision of the contract with respect to liquidated damages cannot be considered the result of a genuine pre-estimate of the loss which would be caused by the delay but must be regarded as a penalty which requires proof of damage in any amount to be deducted.\n If it were not for the earnestness with which this claim \n\n[249 U.S. 361, 365]\n\u00a0\n is presented we should content ourselves with the observation that as there was delay in the completion of both buildings, the case falls literally within the terms of the contract of the parties and that a court will refuse to imagine a different state of facts than that before it for the purpose of obtaining a basis for modifying a written agreement, which evidently was entered into with great deliberation.\n The subject of the interpretation of provisions for liquidated damages in contracts, as contradistinguished from such as provide for penalties, was elaborately and comprehensively considered by this court in Sun Printing & Publishing Association v. Moore, \n183 U.S. 642\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 240, applied in United States v. Bethlehem Steel Co., \n205 U.S. 105\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 450, and the result of the modern decisions was determined to be that in such cases courts will endeavor, by a construction of the agreement which the parties have made, to ascertain what their intention was when they inserted such a stipulation for payment, of a designated sum or upon a designated basis, for a breach of a covenant of their contract, precisely as they seek for the intention of the parties in other respects. When that intention is clearly ascertainable from the writing, effect will be given to the provision, as freely as to any other, where the damages are uncertain in nature or amount or are difficult of ascertainment or where the amount stipulated for is not so extravagant, or disproportionate to the amount of property loss, as to show that compensation was not the object aimed at or as to imply fraud, mistake, circumvention or oppression. There is no sound reason why persons competent and free to contract may not agree upon this subject as fully as upon any other, or why their agreement, when fairly and understandingly entered into with a view to just compensation for the anticipated loss, should not be enforced.\n There are, no doubt, decided cases which tend to support \n\n[249 U.S. 361, 366]\n\u00a0\n the contention advanced by appellant, but these decisions were, for the most part, rendered at a time when courts were disposed to look upon such provisions in contracts with disfavor and to construe them strictly, if not astutely, in order that damages, even though termed liquidated, might be treated as penalties, so that only such loss as could be definitely proved could be recovered. The later rule, however, is to look with candor, if not with favor, upon such provisions in contracts when deliberately entered into between parties who have equality of opportunity for understanding and insisting upon their rights, as promoting prompt performance of contracts and because adjusting in advance, and amicably, matters the settlement of which through courts would often involve difficulty, uncertainty, delay and expense.\n The result of the application of the doctrine thus stated to the case before us cannot be doubtful. The character of the contract and the amount involved assures experience and large capacity in the contractor and the parties specifically state that the amount agreed upon as liquidated damages had been 'computed, estimated and agreed upon' between them. It is obvious that the extent of the loss which would result to the government from delay in performance must be uncertain and difficult to determine and it is clear that the amount stipulated for is not excessive, having regard, to the amount of money which the government would have invested in the buildings at the time when such delay would occur, to the expense of securing or continuing in other buildings during such delay, and to the confusion which must necessarily result in the important and extensive laboratory operations of the Department of Agriculture.\n The parties to the contract, with full understanding of the results of delay and before differences or interested views had arisen between them, were much more com petent \n\n[249 U.S. 361, 367]\n\u00a0\n to justly determine what the amount of damage would be, an amount necessarily largely conjectural and resting in estimate, than a court or jury would be, directed to a conclusion, as either must be, after the event, by views and testimony derived from witnesses who would be unusual to a degree if their conclusions were not, in a measure, colored and partisan.\n There is nothing in the contract or in the record to indicate that the parties did not take into consideration, when estimating the amount of damage which would be caused by delay, the prospect of one building being delayed and the other not, and the amount of the damages stipulated, having regard to the circumstances of the case, may well have been adopted with reference to the probability of such a result.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","237":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWITHNELL v. RUECKING CONST CO.(1919)\nNo. 142\nArgued: Decided: March 3, 1919\n\n\n\n\n[249 U.S. 63, 64]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. E. T. Allen and C. B. Allen, both of St. Louis, Mo., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[249 U.S. 63, 65]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank B. Coleman and George M. Block, both of St. Louis, Mo., for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[249 U.S. 63, 67]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The construction company brought suit to enforce the lien of twelve tax bills issued on account of the cost of paving a portion of Broadway in the city of St. Louis. Withnell, plaintiff in error, is the owner of property assessed, fronting on Broadway, being five lots in city block No. 2069, five lots in city block No. 2608, and unplatted property in city blocks Nos. 2620 and 2621\n\n\n The validity of the tax bills was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Missouri. Ruecking Const. Co. v. Withnell, 269 Mo. 546, 191 S. W. 685. The case is here because of alleged violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution in assessing the lien of these tax bills upon plaintiff in error's property. The assessment was levied in accordance with the charter of the city of St. Louis. An assessment for improving other portions of the street than are here involved, made under the terms of the St. Louis charter, was before this court in Gast Realty Company v. Schneider Granite Company, \n240 U.S. 55\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 254. In that case the assessment was held invalid in part. After being remanded to the Supreme Court of Missouri, and a second judgment, the case was again before this court. \n245 U.S. 288\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 125.\n The method of making assessments under the charter of the city of St. Louis, as stated in Gast Realty Company v. Schneider Granite Company, supra, is as follows: One-fourth of the total cost is levied upon all the property fronting upon or adjoining the improvement according to frontage and three-fourths according to area ascertained as follows:\n'A line shall be drawn midway between the street to be improved and the next parallel or converging street on each side of the street to be improved, which line shall be the boundary of the district, except as hereinafter provided, \n\n[249 U.S. 63, 68]\n\u00a0\n namely: If the property adjoining the street to be improved is divided into lots, the district line shall be so drawn as to include the entire depth of all lots fronting on the street to be improved . ... If there is no parallel or converging street on either side of the street improved, the district lines shall be drawn three hundred feet from and parallel to the street to be improved; but if there be a parallel or converging street on one side of the street to be improved to fix and locate the district line, then the district line on the other side shall be drawn parallel to the street to be improved and at the average distance of the opposite district line so fixed and located.'\n\n In the Gast Realty Company Case the area assessment was held invalid because it assessed a large and disproportionate part of the plaintiff in error's property. The memorandum appended to the opinion shows that the foot-front assessment was not disturbed. And see the subsequent consideration of the matter in Schneider Granite Company v. Gast Realty Company, \n245 U.S. 288\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 125, supra.\n In support of the constitutional objection it is contended that the plaintiff in error was not allowed to be heard as to the validity and apportionment of the assessment, and was therefore denied due process of law. The charter provision for notice and hearing is inserted in the margin. \n1\n But whether a property owner is entitled to be \n\n[249 U.S. 63, 69]\n\u00a0\n heard in advance upon the questions of benefit and apportionment depends upon the authority under which the assessment is made. When the assessment is made in accordance with a fixed rule adopted by a legislative act, a property owner is not entitled to be heard in advance on the question of the amount and extent of the assessment and the benefits conferred. French v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co., \n181 U.S. 324\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 625; Embree v. Kansas City Road District, \n240 U.S. 242\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 317; Wagner v. Baltimore, \n239 \nU.S. 207, 217\n, 218 S., 36 Sup. Ct. 66, 60 L. ed. 230, and cases cited. We are of opinion that the assessment made in accordance with the rule of the St. Louis charter was legislative in character and required no previous notice or preliminary hearing as to the nature and extent of benefits in order to maintain its constitutional validity. The charter of the city of St. Louis was adopted by a vote of the people under state constitutional authority. It was under consideration in St. Louis v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n149 U.S. 465\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 990. This court said:\n'As the legislative power of a state is vested in the Legislature, generally that body has the supreme control, \n\n[249 U.S. 63, 70]\n\u00a0\n and it delegates to municipal corporations such measure thereof as it deems best. The city of St. Louis occupies a unique position. It does not, like most cities, derive its powers by grant from the Legislature, but it framed its own charter under express authority from the people of the state, given in the Constitution. Sections 20 and 21 of article 9 of the Constitution of 1875 of the state of Missouri authorized the election of 13 freeholders to prepare a charter to be submitted to the qualified voters of the city which, when ratified by them, was to 'become the organic law of the city.' ... In pursuance of these provisions of the Constitution, a charter was prepared and adopted, and is therefore 'the organic law' of the city of St. Louis, and the powers granted by it, so far as they are in harmony with the Constitution and laws of the state, and have not been set aside by any act of the General Assembly, are the powers vested in the city. This charter is an organic act, so defined in the Constitution, and is to be construed as organic acts are construed. The city is in a very just sense an 'imperium in imperio.' Its powers are self-appointed, and the reserved control existing in the General Assembly does not take away this peculiar feature of its charter.'\n\n The same view has been repeatedly declared by the Supreme Court of Missouri. In Meier v. St. Louis, 180 Mo. 391, 409, 79 S. W. 955, that court declared, citing its previous decisions, that the charter of St. Louis, adopted under the Constitution, had as respects local assessments all the force of legislative acts.\n We reach the conclusion that the attack upon the validity of the assessment for want of advance notice of hearing as to benefits must fail.\n Regarding the front-foot, method of assessment as being unassailable under the previous decisions of this court (240 U. S. and 245 U. S., supra ), we come to consider the area assessment. Objections based on the manner of laying \n\n[249 U.S. 63, 71]\n\u00a0\n out the district, and whether it conforms to the plan outlined in the city charter are conclusively disposed of by the decisions of the state court. We have to deal only with the questions raised as to the alleged denial of the protection afforded by the Fourteenth Amendment. An examination of the plat made part of the record, and reproduced in the briefs of counsel, shows that owing to the curvatures in Broadway and the relation thereto of converging and parallel streets, the assessing district laid out in accordance with the charter is of irregular outline. The lots assessed are by no means uniform in size, nor is their relation to the improvement uniformly alike. Some blocks, including some of the plaintiff in error's, are not subdivided into lots, and are irregular in shape. But we are not prepared to hold that the assessment district was so laid out with reference to plaintiff in error's property as requires this court to declare the application of the area rule a denial of due process of law, or of the equal protection of the laws. That the assessment, owing to the difficulties of the situation, made inequalities inevitable, is apparent. The Supreme Court of the state finds, and we are not prepared to disturb its conclusion, that the property east and west of Broadway, in the subdivision of the same for the purposes of assessment, was treated with fairness and with as much equality as the situation permitted. The attack upon constitutional grounds because of the system which the charter authorized in making the assessment can only succeed if it has produced results as to plaintiff in error's property palpably arbitrary or grossly unequal This system has been sustained in many decisions in the Supreme Court of Missouri, and has long been enforced in practice in that state. Its application in the instance passed upon in Gast Realty Company v. Schneider Granite Company, \n240 U.S. 55\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 254, supra, was found to work so arbitrarily as to require an avoidance of the area assessment upon constitutional grounds. The \n\n[249 U.S. 63, 72]\n\u00a0\n frontage rule of assessment, now generally in use, has been frequently sustained by the decisions of this court. It may and does in some instances work inequalities in benefits conferred upon property assessed. In the present case a calculation found in the brief of the defendant in error, the correctness of which does not seem to be challenged, shows that if the property had been assessed by the front-foot rule, that of the plaintiff in error would have had a larger assessment than the one which resulted from the method employed.\n The Supreme Court of Missouri found that no evidence was offered to sustain the allegations of the cross-bill that the tax-bills were confiscatory or disproportionate to the benefits received in that the city escaped paying its just proportion of the cost of the improvement because of its ownership of property within the district.\n We are not prepared to say that the plaintiff in error, because of arbitrary legislative action or the abuse of power, was denied due process of law or the equal protection of the laws in this assessment.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'No ordinance for the construction or reconstruction of any street, avenue, boulevard, alley or public highway of the city, shall be passed unless recommended by the board of public improvements, as hereinafter provided. The board shall designate a day on which they will hold a public meeting to consider the improvement of any designated streets, avenues, boulevards, alleys or public highways by grading or regrading, by constructing, or reconstructing, by paving or repaving the roadway, including cross-walks and intersections, and shall give two weeks' public notice, in the papers doing the city printing, of the time, place and matter to be considered, stating in such notice the kind of material and manner of construction proposed to be used for the wearing surface of such improvement, naming more than one kind of material or manner of construction, if the board deems it advisable so to do, and also the class of specification and plan for such work, which specification and plan shall be approved by said board, and filed in its office. If within fifteen days after such public meeting, the owners of the major part of the area of the land made taxable by this article for such improvement, shall file in the office of the board of public improvements their written remonstrance against the proposed improvement, or against the material or manner thereof, the board shall consider such remonstrance, and if said board shall, by a twothirds vote, at a regular meeting, approve of the improvement, material or manner remonstrated against, they shall cause an ordinance for the same to be prepared and report the same with the reasons for their action and the remonstrance to the assembly. If such majority fail to remonstrate within fifteen days or shall petition the board for the improvement, said board may by a majority vote approve the same, and shall cause an ordinance to be prepared and reported to the assembly therefor.' \n\n\n\n\n","238":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nYAZOO & M V R. CO. v. MULLINS(1919)\nNo. 273\nArgued: March 21, 1919Decided: April 21, 1919\n\n\n\n Mr. Charles N. Burch, of Memphis, Tenn., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Marion W. Reily, of Meridian, Miss., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Mullins, a flagman on the Yazoo & Mississippi Valley Railroad, was injured while engaged in switching an interstate train. He died within a few hours; and his administratrix brought suit in a state court of Mississippi \n\n[249 U.S. 531, 532]\n\u00a0\n under the federal Employers' Liability Act (Act April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65 [Comp. St.  8657-8665]). At the trial the railroad requested a directed verdict on the ground that there was no evidence of negligence on its part. This request was refused; the case was submitted to the jury under instructions, some of which were objected to; and the verdict was for the plaintiff. Upon appeal from the judgment entered thereon the Supreme Court of Mississippi refused to consider the question of sufficiency of the evidence of negligence, and affirmed the judgment on the ground that the so-called 'Prima Facie Act' of Mississippi (section 1985 of the Code of 1906, as amended by chapter 215, Laws 1912, p. 290), as to which the trial court had given no instruction, applied and relieved the plaintiff of the burden of establishing negligence. 115 Miss. 343, 76 South. 147. The case comes here by writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1156), as amended by the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448,  2, 39 Stat. 726 (Comp. St.  1214).\n Since the decision below, this court has decided that the Mississippi 'Prima Facie Act' cannot be applied to suits under the federal Employers' Liability Act, New Orleans & Northeastern Railroad Co. v. Harris, \n247 U.S. 367\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 535; and the Supreme Court of Mississippi now recognizes this rule, New Orleans & Northeastern Railroad Co. v. Hanna ( Miss.) 78 South. 953. The administratrix contends that, as the trial court did not give any instruction concerning the 'Prima Facie Act,' the error of the Supreme Court in resting its decision on that statute should not prevent an affirmance of the judgment below, because the railroad was not prejudiced by the error.\n It is true generally in cases coming from lower federal courts that the rendering of an erroneous decision on a particular question, Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Courtney, \n186 \nU.S. 342, 351\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 833; West v. Camden, \n135 \nU.S. 507, 521\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 838; or the assignment by the lower court of an erroneous reason for a right decision, Seaboard Air Line Railway v. Moore, \n228 \nU.S. 433, 435\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 580; United States v. One Distillery, \n\n[249 U.S. 531, 533]\n\u00a0\n \n174 \nU.S. 149, 151\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 624, will not entitle the complaining party to reversal, if it is clear that his rights were not prejudiced thereby. And this is likewise true of cases coming from state courts. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Co. v. Wright, \n239 \nU.S. 548, 551\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 185; New York, Philadelphia & Norfolk Railroad Co. v. Peninsular Exchange, \n240 \nU.S. 34, 41\n, 42 S., 36 Sup. Ct. 230, L. R. A. 1917A, 193. See Murdock v. City of Memphis, 20 Wall 590. Whether the case comes from a state court or a federal court, this court will, for the purpose of determining whether the error found may have been prejudicial, examine the whole record; state questions being left to the decision of the state court in cases coming here from those courts.\n But we cannot say here that the rights of the railroad were not prejudiced by the error of the Supreme Court of Mississippi. It may be, as contended by the administratrix, that there was sufficient evidence of negligence to go to the jury, and that the general instructions concerning negligence were proper. But the trial court also instructed the jury that 'it was the absolute duty of the defendant to furnish the deceased with a safe place to perform the duties incident to his employment.' It is clear that, under the circumstances of this case, the duty was not an absolute one; there was merely a duty to use reasonable care. Chicago & Northwestern Railway Co. v. Bower, \n241 U.S. 470\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 624; Seaboard Air Line Railway v. Horton, \n233 U.S. 492\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 635, L.R.A. 1915C, 1, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 475; Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf Railroad Co. v. Tennessee, \n191 \nU.S. 326, 331\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 99. As examination of this record does not convince us that the admitted error was harmless, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Mississippi is reversed. The questions presented being properly here on writ of error, the petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n"}}
