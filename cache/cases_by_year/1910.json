This is a writ of error, and upon such a writ the error to be considered must be confined to error of law.\n The substantial question is as to whether a law which prohibits the exportation of Philippine silver coin from the Philippine Islands is a law which deprives the owner of his property in such coins without due process of law, in violation of that prohibition of the organic act of July 1, 1902, which provides that 'no law shall be enacted in said islands which shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.' 32 Stat. at L. 692, chap. 1369. The authority for the law is found in the act of Congress of July 1, 1902,  76 et seq., 32 Stat. at L. 691, 710, chap. 1369, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 890, which authorized the Philippine government to establish a mint in the city of Manila for coinage purposes and to enact laws for its operation, and for the striking of certain coins. By the later act of Congress of March 2, 1903 (chap. 980, 32 Stat. at L. 952, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 893), it was provided that the gold peso, con- \n\n[218 U.S. 302, 309]\n\u00a0\n sisting of 12.9 grains of gold, nine tenth fine, should be the unit of value in the islands. The second section of that act provided as follows:\n'That in addition to the coinage authorized for use in the Philippine Islands by the act of July first, nineteen hundred and two, entitled, 'An Act Temporarily to Provide for the Administration of the Affairs of Civil Government in the Philippine Islands, and for Other Purposes,' the government of the Philippine Islands is authorized to coin to an amount not exceeding seventy-five million pesos, for use in said islands, a silver coin of the denomination of one peso, and of the weight of four hundred and sixteen grains, and the standard of said silver coins shall be such that of one thousand parts, by weight, nine hundred shall be of pure metal and one hundred of alloy, and the alloy shall be of copper.'\n\n Section 6 of the same act of March 2, 1903, provided:\n'That the coinage authorized by this act shall be subject to the conditions and limitations of the provisions of the act of July first, nineteen hundred and two, entitled, 'An Act Temporarily to Provide for the Administration of the Affairs of Civil Government in the Philippine Islands, and for Other Purposes,' except as herein otherwise provided; and the government of the Philippine Islands may adopt such measures as it may deem proper, not inconsistent with said act of July first, nineteen hundred and two, to maintain the value of the silver Philippine peso at the rate of one gold peso.'\n\n In a subsequent part of the same section, the issuance of certificates of indebtedness, bearing interest, was authorized as a specific measure for maintaining the parity between the silver and gold peso.\n The law of the Philippine Commission, above set out, under which the conviction of the plaintiff in error was secured, must rest upon the provision of  6, above set out, as a means of maintaining 'the value of the sivler \n\n[218 U.S. 302, 310]\n\u00a0\n peso at the rate of one gold peso.' Passing by any consideration of the wisdom of such a law prohibiting the exportation of the Philippine Islands silver pesos as not relevant to the question of power, a substantial reason for such a law is indicated by the fact that the bullion value of such coin in Hong Kong was some 9 per cent greater than its face value. The law was therefore adapted to keep the silver pesos in circulation as a medium of exchange in the islands and at a parity with the gold peso of Philippine mintage.\n The power to 'coin money and regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin,' is a prerogative of sovereignty and a power exclusively vested in the Congress of the United States. The power which the government of the Philippine Islands has in respect to a local coinage is derived from the express act of Congress. Along with the power to strike gold and silver pesos for local circulation in the islands was granted the power to provide such measures as that government should 'deem proper,' not inconsistent with the organic law of July 1, 1902, necessary to maintain the parity between the gold and silver pesos. Although the Philippine act cannot, therefore, be said to overstep the wide legislative discretion in respect of measures to preserve a parity between the gold and silver pesos, yet it is said that if the particular measure resorted to be one which operates to deprive the owner of silver pesos of the difference between their bullion and coin value, he has had his property taken from him without compensation, and, in its wider sense, without that due process of law guaranteed by the fundamental act of July, 1902\n\n\n Conceding the title of the owner of such coins, yet there is attached to such ownership those limitations which public policy may require by reason of their quality as a legal tender and as a medium of exchange. These limitations are due to the fact that public law gives to such coinage a value which does not attach as a mere conse- \n\n[218 U.S. 302, 311]\n\u00a0\n quence of intrinsic value. Their quality as a legal tender is an attribute of law aside from their bullion value. They bear, therefore, the impress of sovereign power which fixes value and authorizes their use in exchange. As an incident, government may punish defacement and mutilation, and constitute any such act, when fraudulently done, a misdemeanor. Rev. Stat .  5189, 5459, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3484, 3684.\n However unwise a law may be, aimed at the exportation of such coins, in the face of the axioms against obstructing the free flow of commerce, there can be no serious doubt but that the power to coin money includes the power to prevent its outflow from the country of its origin. To justify the exercise of such a power it is only necessary that it shall appear that the means are reasonably adapted to conserve the general public interest, and are not an arbitrary interference with private rights of contract or property. The law here in question is plainly within the limits of the police power, and not an arbitrary or unreasonable interference with private rights. If a local coinage was demanded by the general interest of the Philippine Islands, legislation reasonably adequate to maintain such coinage at home as a medium of exchange is not a violation of private right, forbidden by the organic law. Obviously, if the Philippine government had power to prohibit the exportation or melting of Philippine silver pesos, it had the power to make the violation of the prohibition a misdemeanor. The proceedings for the enforcement of the law included the ordinary process in criminal cases lawful in the islands, and not forbidden by the act of July, 1902.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","1":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nALBRIGHT v. SANDOVAL(1910)\nNo. 118\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n Mr. Edward L. Medler for appellant.\n Mr. Neill B. Field for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The appeal involves the same questions as those that have just been decided in Albright v. Sandoval, No. 116. [\n216 U.S. 331\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 318.] In the latter case, the right of Sandoval to recover the fees and emoluments of the office of assessor of Bernalillo county from Albright is decided.\n The case at bar is another action for additional fees received by Albright. The judgment rendered was for the sum of $1,688.84, which, with interest, amounted to the sum of \n\n[216 U.S. 342, 343]\n\u00a0\n $1,813.25. The judgment was affirmed by the supreme court. 94 Pac. 947. This appeal was then taken. A motion is made to dismiss it on the ground that the amount in dispute does not exceed $5,000. To this it is replied that the case involves the validity of an authority exercised under the United States in the passage of the laws by which, it is contended, Albright derived a right to the office.\n The appellant supports this contention by saying that his answer in the trial court raised the 'legal propositions of the power and authority of the territorial legislature to pass the acts creating Sandoval county, and to vest the power of appointement in the county commissioners of Bernalillo county,' and also contained a full record of the quo warranto proceedings in which the same questions were raised. But by reference to the opinion in No. 116 it will be seen that the supreme court rested its decision upon the construction of the statutes, not upon the want of power in the legislature to pass them. As to the acts themselves, the supreme court said: 'It does not seem necessary or profitable in this case to consider the question of the power of the legislature, for the reason that however adequate the power of the legislature might be, if the legislature did not see fit, nor intend to exercise the power to declare the office of assessor of Bernalillo county vacant by the legislation enacted, the legal right of the incumbent elected by the people of the county is not affected by the legislation, and no vacancy existed, to be filled either by election or appointment.' [12 N. M. 304, 78 Pac. 207].\n As to the vacancy alleged to have occurred by the noresidence of Sandoval in Bernalillo county, the court said that it was unable to find any provision of the statutes 'requiring residence in the county as a qualification to hold the office of assessor.' And further said that it was hence led to the logical conclusion 'that even if it was admitted that Sandoval had been for years and was still residing in what would become Sandoval county when the act took effect, that fact would neither disqualify Sandoval from holding his office nor \n\n[216 U.S. 342, 344]\n\u00a0\n have the effect of rendering the office vacant.' And again: 'The legislature acted upon a mistaken view of the law, the result of which was to provide for the election of an officer to an office not vacant, but which, on the contrary, was in the possession of a legally elected and qualified incumbent.' It was also decided that Albright's appointment was made before the law took effect, and necessarily was illegal.\n Upon the second appeal of the case, the court did not enlarge on the ground of its decision. 13 N. M. 64, 79 Pac. 719, 11 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 1165. It follows that as Sandoval's right to the office and Albright's want of right were based upon the construction of the statutes of the territory, not upon power of the legislature to pass them, the motion to dismiss must be granted, and it is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","2":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nALBRIGHT v.

Plaintiff in error received the fees, defendant in error claims the right to them as the duly elected officer.\n There was prior litigation over the right to the office. Proceedings in the nature of quo warranto were instituted against plaintiff in error by the territory, upon the relation of defendant in error, to try the title of plaintiff in error to the office. Judgment went in favor of the latter in the trial court, which was reversed by the supreme court, and the case remanded for further proceedings. 12 N. M. 293, 78 Pac. 204.\n Upon the subsequent proceedings in the trial court, judgment was entered, declaring plaintiff in error not entitled to the office. The judgment also ordered him to deliver to the relator, defendant in error here, the records and the equipments of the office, 'as the lawful custodian thereof.' This part of the judgment was reversed by the supreme court; the other part, as to the title of plaintiff in error to the office, was affirmed. 13 N. M. 64, 79 Pac. 719, 11 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 1165. An appeal was taken to this court and dismissed because the matter in controversy was not 'measurable by some sum or value in money.' As to the fees of the office, it was said: 'The term of office had expired before the rendition of judgment by the territorial supreme court, and as to the effect of the judgment of ouster in a suit to recover emoluments for the past, that is collateral, even though the judgment might be conclusive in such subsequent action. New England Mortg. Secur. Co. v. Gay, \n145 U.S. 123\n, 36 L. ed. 646, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 815; Washington & G. R. Co. v. Ct. Rep. 815; Washington & G. R. Co. v. District of Columbia, \n146 U.S. 227\n, 36 L. ed. 951, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 64.' [\n200 U.S. 12\n, 50 L. ed. 348, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 211.]\n This action was brought for the past fees and emoluments of the office, amounting, it is alleged, to the sum of six thousand, one hundred eighty-four dollars and sixteen cents ($6,184.16).\n The grounds of action are, as alleged, that Sandoval, de- \n\n[216 U.S. 331, 336]\n\u00a0\n fendant in error, was duly elected to the office; that Albright, plaintiff in error, on the 27th of March, 1903, 'usurped the same, and excluded the plaintiff therefrom, and received and appropriated to his own use the fees and emoluments' of the office until 19th of November, 1904, when the plaintiff (defendant in error here), by a judgment in a 'certain proceeding entitled the Territory of New Mexico on the relation of Jesus Maria Sandoval against the said George F. Albright, was restored to the possession of the said office.' The judgment was made part of the complaint.\n A demurrer was filed to the complaint. It was overruled. An answer was then filed which practically admitted the allegations of the complaint, except the legal right of the plaintiff to the fees of the office. It admitted that, in the quo warranto proceeding, it was adjudged that Albright was not entitled to the office, and had usurped the same, and that Sandoval was entitled to it. The answer, however, set up a right to the office in Albright; that, on the 23d of March, 1903, he was appointed assessor of the county by the board of county commissioners of the county, acting under and by virtue of  3 of an act of the legislative assembly of the territory, entitled, 'An Act to Create the County of Sandoval,' approved March 10, 1903, as amended March 12, 1903. That the office of assessor of the county of Bernalillo became vacant by reason of such legislation, Sandoval county having previously been a part of Bernalillo. The validity of such legislation was alleged, and that the power of appointment was vested thereby in the board of commissioners created by the amendatory act of March 12. It is alleged also that 'the office was subject to the control of the legislature, and that a vacancy thereafter was created by said acts.' That Sandoval, at the time Sandoval county was created, was, and had been a long time before, a resident of Bernalillo, and ceased, therefore, upon the passage of the acts creating Sandoval county, to be a resident of Bernalillo, and became disqualified from exercising the duties of the office as assessor thereof, to which \n\n[216 U.S. 331, 337]\n\u00a0\n he had been elected, and that, at the time of the appointment of Albright, the office was and had been vacant from the time of the creation of Sandoval county.\n The answer admitted the receipt of $6,648 on account of fees and emoluments, and alleged that Albright paid out the sum of $2,142.25 for clerical and other expenses necessarily incurred in administering the office, which amount, he alleged, he was 'entitled to receive as a set-off against any demand' against him. And he alleged that the said sum was paid in good faith. There was a demurrer to the answer filed and a replication. The latter accepted the statement of the amount received by Albright, alleged want of information as to the amount expended as expenses of the office, and denied that Albright was an incumbent of the office in good faith.\n The demurrer was sustained to all parts of the answer except those alleging receipt of fees and the payment of expenses. As to them, evidence was submitted to a jury, which, under the direction of the court, returned a verdict for the plaintiff, Sandoval, in the sum of $5,360.53, which was the amount sued for, less the expenses which had been incurred by Albright. Both parties moved for a new trial, the plaintiff on account of the allowance of the expenses, the defendant on account of the recovery against him of the fees and enoluments received by him. Judgment was entered for the amount of the verdict in favor of the plaintiff, and affirmed by the supreme court. 93 Pac. 717. Both parties sued out writs of error. That of Albright (No. 116) is directed to the judgment against him; that of Sandoval (No. 117), to redress the error, which, he contends, was made against him in allowing as a set-off against his demand, the expenses that Albright had incurred in administering the office.\n It is clear that the only questions of fact presented by the pleadings were as to the amount received and the amount expended by Albright. This was the view taken of them by the supreme court. That court said: 'The right of office and that the appellee [defendant in error here] was the de jure \n\n[216 U.S. 331, 338]\n\u00a0\n officer were fully determined in the former suits, and cannot be considered in this; therefore the court below properly sustained the demurrer to all such parts of the answer as sought to raise this issue.' The suits referred to by the court were Territory ex rel. Sandoval v. Albright, 12 N. M. 293, 78 Pac. 205, 13 N. M. 64, 79 Pac. 719, 11 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 1165, \n200 U.S. 9\n, 50 L. ed. 346, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 210.\n The court therefore addressed itself to the two propositions which it conceived were left in the case,-the right of Sandoval to recover the fees received by Albright, and the right of the latter to set off against them his disbursements for expenses. The court, passing on the first proposition, found, it said, no statute of the territory 'governing this subject,' but decided that 'the common law, in the absence of a statute, authorizes a recovery by the officer de jure in such cases.' On the second proposition it found that there could be no question of Albright's good faith, and that it considered the cases made good faith 'the controlling consideration for the allowances of expenses to an ousted de facto officer,' and affirmed the judgment of the trial court.\n Plaintiff in error, however, goes back of the decision of the supreme court, and contends that he is not only an officer de facto, but an officer de jure. In other words, he asserts the correctness of the position taken in his answer, that, by the legislation creating Sandoval county, defendant in error ceased to be the assessor of Bernalillo, to which he was duly elected; that therefore a vacancy existed to which plaintiff in error was duly appointed. The basis of this contention is the power of the legislature to create Sandoval county, and that, by the exercise of the power, defendant in error was made a resident of Sandoval county, and became disqualified to be assessor of Bernalillo. From this it followed, it is argued, a vacancy occurred to which plaintiff in error was appointed under the act amending the act creating Sandoval county. It certainly follows that, if the residence of defendant in error in Sandoval county did not create a vacancy, there was none to fill, unless, as it is \n\n[216 U.S. 331, 339]\n\u00a0\n contended by defendant in error, that the legislature has the power to create a vacancy, and actually exercised the power.\n In Territory ex rel. Sandoval v. Albright, 12 N. M. 293, 78 Pac. 204, the judgment of the trial court, which dismissed the quo warranto proceedings, was reversed, as we have seen. The supreme court said that the trial court, in considering the section of the acts relied on by plaintiff in error, 'arrived at the conclusion that it was the intention of the legislature to declare that office [the office of assessor of Bernalillo county] vacant, and therefore, although those sections do not contain a declaration to that effect, the court was of the opinion that those sections should be given the effect of such a declaration.' But the supreme court added, 'We cannot concur with the trial court in this conclusion,' and proceeded to analyze the legislation, and decided that it did not have the meaning plaintiff in error attributes to it. In other words, did not create a vacancy in the office of assessor of Bernalillo county. And considering the laws of the territory as to the qualification of county officers, decided that residence was not one of them. The court further decided that, when plaintiff in error was appointed, the act under which it is contended that it was done had not taken effect, and that therefore his appointment was unauthorized.\n The court, considering the legislation in view of the powers of the legislature, as limited by the act of Congress of July 30, 1886 (24 Stat. at L. 170, chap. 818), concluded that the legislature had not the power to remove and appoint county officers, as contended, but the decision of the case was put on the other grounds which we have stated. In other words, put upon the construction of the statutes. And that construction we are not disposed to disturb. Fox v. Haarstick, \n156 U.S. 674\n, 39 L. ed. 576, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 457; English v. Arizona, \n214 U.S. 359\n, 53 L. ed. 1030, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 658; Crary v. Dye, \n208 U.S. 515\n, 52 L. ed. 595, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 360.\n Under these views it is not necessary to decide whether the judgment in the quo warranto proceedings is conclusive of the issues in this case, as contended by defendant in error. \n\n[216 U.S. 331, 340]\n\u00a0\n The decision upon the respective rights of the parties arising from the statute of the territory may be rested on the grounds which we have expressed, and we come to the proposition whether Sandoval can recover the fees and emoluments received by Albright, and whether, if he can, may the latter set off his expenses. The first proposition is not controverted by Albright, although he suggests that there are some well-considered cases the other way, and he cites Stuhr v. Curran, 44 N. J. L. 181, 43 Am. Rep. 353. He also cites Taylor v. Beckham, \n178 U.S. 548\n, 44 L. ed. 1187, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 890, 1009; Butler v. Pennsylvania, 10 How. 402, 13 L. ed. 472, for the view that there is no such thing as property in a public office. However, his ultimate concession is that the weight of authority is to the effect that a de jure officer may recover from the de facto officer the emoluments of the office, less the reasonable expenses incurred in earning such fees, when the de facto officer entered into the office in good faith and under color of title. And this was the view of the supreme court of the territory. To sustain the first proposition, the court reviewed Stuhr v. Curran, supra, and cites against it, United States use of Crawford v. Addison, 6 Wall. 291, 18 L. ed. 919; Dolan v. New York, 68 N. Y. 274, 23 Am. Rep. 168; Hunter v. Chandler, 45 Mo. 452; Glascock v. Lyons, 20 Ind. 1, 83 Am. Dec. 299; Douglass v. State, 31 Ind. 429; People ex rel. Benoit v. Miller, 24 Mich. 458, 9 Am. Rep. 131; People ex rel. Dorsey v. Smith, 28 Cal. 21; Nichols v. MacLean, 101 N. Y. 538, 54 Am. Rep. 730, 5 N.

Drake, 2 Salk. 468; Webb's Case, 8 Coke, 45b; 1 Selwyn, N. P. 81; 1 Chitty, Pl. 112. It is not necessary to make a review of these cases. It is enough to say that they sustain the proposition for which they are cited.\n The second question is more debatable; to wit, whether Sandoval was entitled to the gross receipts of the office, as contended by him, or to the net receipts, as contended by Albright, and as decided by the courts below.\n Counsel for Sandoval sees and admits the difficulties which beset the question, and is not insensible to the justice, under \n\n[216 U.S. 331, 341]\n\u00a0\n the circumstances of this case, of the deductions allowed by the courts below.\n There is argument based on the illegality of Albright's occupation of the office, and strength in the contention that a trespasser may not set off the expense he incurred in executing the trespass. It has been held, in a well-considered case, there can be no deduction for the personal services of the intruder. People ex rel. Benoit v. Miller, supra. It was said in that case, however, that 'there may be reason for deducting from any official earnings the actual cost of obtaining them, which would have been entailed on any person who might have held the office.' This may be said of the expenses in controversy in the case at bar. Mayfield v. Moore, 53 Ill. 428, 5 Am. Rep. 52, is the leading case which sustains the right to deduct such expenses. This case is followed by others in the same court, and the same view has been announced by other courts. We think they express the correct rule. It makes the measure of recovery the extent of the injury, and the injury, it is clear, is not the gross earnings of an office, but such earnings less, to use the language of Mr. Chief Justice Campbell in People ex rel. Benoit v. Miller, supra, 'the actual cost of obtaining them, which would have been entailed on any person who might have held the office.'\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","3":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAMERICAN NAT BANK OF WASHINGTON v.

The agreed facts are these: By art. 230 of the state Constitution of 1898, any railroad thereafter constructed before January 1, 1904, was to be exempt from taxation for ten years from completion, upon certain conditions. The plaintiff built its road through the parish of Winn and gained the right to the exemption. The defendant, plaintiff in error, claims its rights under a vote of the same parish on February 1, 1898, granting a tax of 5 mills to a predecessor to whose rights the defendant has sueceeded. This vote was valid, and effective against all taxable property in the parish. James v. Arkansas Southern R. Co. 110 La. 145, 34 So. 337. Act 35,  6, 1886. Const. 1879, art 242. By its terms the grant was for ten years from the completion of the road, the police jury adding a condition that the railroad should be completed into Winnfield within three years from the date of the vote. Afterwards the police jury extended the time to May 1, 1901, on or before which date, and before the acquisition of its right of way and ground by the plaintiff, the road was finished. It was accepted by the police jury and taxes have been levied and paid in accordance with the vote, beginning with the year 1901. The defendant was proceeding to levy on the property of the plaintiff in the parish, and says that if the Constitution of 1898 is construed to confer an exemption from this tax upon the plaintiff, it impairs the obligation of contracts, contrary to art. 1,  10, of the Constitution of the United States.\n The plaintiff says that there is no constitutional question before this court because the supreme court of Louisiana put its decision partly upon the ground that the defendant had not acquired all of its contract rights before the adoption of the Constitution of 1898. Of course, this court must satisfy itself upon that point, and and therefore has jurisdiction. Sullivan v. Texas, \n207 U.S. 416\n, \n\n[218 U.S. 431, 437]\n\u00a0\n 423, 52 L. ed. 274, 277, 28 Sup.

On the other hand, the defendant asks us to review the construction given to the state Constitution as extending the immunity granted by the above-mentioned art. 230 to special taxes like this. Upon that point, equally, of course, we follow the state court. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Kentucky, \n183 \nU.S. 503, 508\n, 46 S. L. ed. 298, 302, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 95; Missouri v. Dockery, \n191 \nU.S. 165, 171\n, 48 S. L. ed. 133, 134, 63 L.R.A. 571, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 53. Leaving these preliminaries behind, we come to the point of the case.\n We shall not consider whether the vote is to be regarded as having been simply an offer at the time of its passage, in consideration of acts to be done thereafter, and as having become a contract only when the road was finished, that is to say, after the Constitution of 1898 went into effect. See Wadsworth v. Eau Claire County, \n102 \nU.S. 534, 538\n, 539 S., 26 L. ed. 221, 223, 224. We shall assume, without deciding, that it became binding at once, by statutory authority, after the analogy of a covenant ( see Wisconsin & M. R. Co. v. Powers, \n191 \nU.S. 379, 386\n, 48 S. L. ed. 229, 231, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 107), although liable to be defeated by the nonperformance of the condition attached. We assume also that the condition was satisfied and the right to the tax earned, and that when earned it had the same validity and force as if it had been gained before the Constitution was adopted. It appears further from what we have stated that when the right to the tax accrued, the land now in the hands of the plaintiff's road was liable to taxation. But these facts and assumptions are not enough to make out the defendant's case.\n No doubt a state might limit its control over the power of a municipal body to tax by authorizing it to make contracts on the faith of its existing powers (Wolff v. New Orleans, 103, U. S. 358, 26 L. ed. 395; Louisiana ex rel. Hubert v. New Orleans, \n215 U.S. 170\n, 54 L. ed. 144, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 40), although, unless it did limit itself with a certain distinctness of implication, a subordinate body would contract subject, not paramount, to the power of the state (Manigault v. Springs, \n199 \nU.S. 473, 480\n, 50 S. L. ed. 274, 278, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 127; Knoxville Water \n\n[218 U.S. 431, 438]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. Knoxville, \n189 \nU.S. 434, 438\n, 47 S. L. ed. 887, 891, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 531). But there is no such limitation by the state, and no contract by the parish that implies it. An authority given by the state to promise and levy a tax in future years on the taxable property in the parish does not purport to limit the power of the state to say what property shall be taxable when the time comes,-at least, by general regulations not aimed at aiding an evasion of the promise it has allowed. A vote by a parish to pay 5 mills on all the taxable property within its boundaries refers on its face to a determination by the sovereign as to what that property shall be. See Arkansas Southern R. Co. v. Wilson, 118 La. 395, 401, 42 So. 976. The notion that the statute and the vote, separately or together, precluded the state from erecting a jail that should be free from such claims, is untenable on its face. The same reasoning allows the state to go farther, as it has done. We agree with the Supreme Court that it did not transgress the Constitution of the United States.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","5":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nATLANTIC COAST LINE R. CO. v. MAZURSKY(1910)\nNo. 58\nArgued: December 9, 1909Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n By the act of the general assembly of the state of South Carolina, entitled, 'An Act to Regulate the Manner in which Common Carriers Doing Business in This State Shall Adjust Freight Charges and Claims for Loss of or Damage to Freight,' approved February 23, 1903 (No. 50, Acts of S. C. 1903, p. 81), it was enacted: \n\n[216 U.S. 122, 123]\n\u00a0\n 'Section 1. Be it enacted by the general assembly of the state of South Carolina, That from and after the passage of this act, all common carriers doing business in this state shall settle their freight charges according to the rate stipulated in the bill of lading: Provided, The rate therein stipulated be in conformity with the classifications and rates made and filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, in case of shipments from without this state, and with those of the railroad commissioners of this state, in case of shipments wholly within this state; by which classifications and rates all consignees shall in all cases be entitled to settle freight charges with such carriers; and it shall be the duty of such common carrier to inform any consignee or consignees of the correct amount due for freight, according to such classifications and rates; and upon payment or tender of the amount due on any shipment, or on any part of any shipment, which has arrived at its destination, according to such classifications or rates, such common carrier shall deliver the freight in question to the consignee or consignees, and any failure or refusal to comply with the provisions hereof shall subject each such carrier so failing or refusing to a penalty of $50 for each such failure or refusal, to be recovered by any consignee or consignees aggrieved by suit in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n'Sec. 2. That every claim for loss of or damage to property while in the possession of such common carrier shall be adjusted and paid within forty days, in case of shipments wholly within this state, and within ninety days, in case of shipments from without this state, after the filing of such claim with the agent of such carrier at the point of destination of such shipment: Provided, That no such claim shall be filed until after the arrival of the shipment or of some part thereof at the point of destination, or until after the lapse of a reasonable time for the arrival thereof. In every case such common carrier shall be liable for the amount of such loss or damage, together with interest thereon from the date of the filing of the claim therefor \n\n[216 U.S. 122, 124]\n\u00a0\n until the payment thereof. Failure to adjust and pay such claim within the periods respectively herein prescribed shall subject each common carrier so failing to a penalty of $50 for each and every such failure, to be recovered by any consignee or consignees aggrieved in any court of competent jurisdiction: Provided, That unless such consignee or consignees recover in such action the full amount claimed, no penalty shall be recovered, but only the actual amount of the loss or damage, with interest as aforesaid: Provided, further, That no common carrier shall be liable under this act for property which never came into its possession, if it complies with the provisions of  1710, vol. 1, of the Code of Laws of South Carolina, 1902.'\n\n Section 1710, volume 1, of the Code of Laws of South Carolina, 1902, is as follows:\n'When under contract for shipment of freight or express over two or more common carriers, the responsibility of each or any of them shall cease upon delivery to the connecting line 'in good order;' and if such freight or express has been lost, damaged, or destroyed, it shall be the duty of the initial, delivering, or terminal road, upon notice of such loss, damage, or destruction being given to it by the shippers, consignee, or their assigns, to adjust such loss or damage with the owners of said goods within forty days, and upon failure to discharge such duty within forty days after such notice, or to trace such freight or express, and inform the said party so notifying when, where, and by which carrier the said freight or express was lost, damaged, or destroyed, within said forty days, then said carrier shall be liable for all such loss, damage, or destruction in the same manner and to the same extent as if such loss, damage, or destruction occurred on its lines: Provided, That if such initial, terminal, or delivering road can prove that, by the exercise of due diligence, it has been unable to trace the line upon which such loss, damage, or destruction occurred, [it] shall thereupon be excused from liability under this section.'\n\n The above-entitled cases were brought to test the validity of \n\n[216 U.S. 122, 125]\n\u00a0\n the provisions of  2 of the act of February, 1903, when applied to claims for loss or damage to interstate freight.\n In each case the objection that that section was unconstitutional and invalid was seasonably made. In each case the objection was overruled and judgment given in favor of the respective claimants, plaintiffs, for the value of the undelivered freight, with the full penalty of $50 added.\n The opinion of the supreme court of South Carolina, construing and applying the provisions of the state statute, appears in the printed transcript of the record in case No. 60 (Charles v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. 78 S. C. 36, 125 Am. St. Rep. 762, 58 S. E. 927). In each of the other cases the principles assumed to have been settled in and by that opinion were made the basis of the judgment of the state supreme court.\n The cases were submitted to this court December 9, 1909, as one case, and argued as such on one side only. On the 20th of December, this court entered an order that notice of the pendency of these cases should be given to the attorney general of South Carolina, and leave was given to him to file a brief as amicus curioe on or before the 3d day of January, if he should be so advised. The attorney general filed a brief accordingly January 3, 1910; Townsend was with him on the brief.\n Messrs. Frederic D. McKenney, P. Willcox, F. L. Willcox, Henry E. Davis, and J. P. K. Bryan for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[216 U.S. 122, 129]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. Fraser Lyon and W. H. Townsend, as amici curioe.\n No counsel for defendants in error.\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n In No. 60 (Charles v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co.), which was assumed by the supreme court of South Carolina to settle all the others, and to have been made the basis for the judgment of that court in all the cases, the state court found, as matter of fact, 'the evidence showed that defendant was in possession of the goods lost,' and held as matter of law 'that the statute in question, as it affects carriers doing business in this state who fail or refuse to adjust and pay the loss of or damage to goods while in their possession, is no unlawful interference with interstate commerce, even as applied to an interstate shipment.'\n It is thus apparent that the statute is construed by the court as only concerning property lost or damaged while in the possession of a carrier in the state of South Carolina.\n It is this conclusion of law that the plaintiff in error asks this court to review.\n In Venning v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. 78 S. C. 55, 12 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1217, 125 Am. St. Rep 768, 58 S. E. 983, it was expressly decided that the act did not apply to claims \n\n[216 U.S. 122, 130]\n\u00a0\n for loss of property which never came into the possession of the defendant. In that case the state supreme court considered an act of May, 1903, and held it, for the reason given, to be unconstitutional, not as obnoxious to the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of South Carolina, but as amounting to an illegal attempt to regulate interstate commerce. And that 'on principle, as well as under the authority of Central R. Co. v. Murphey, \n196 U.S. 194\n, 49 L. ed. 444, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 218, 2 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 514, it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the act of May, 1903, here under consideration, is unconstitutional.' And further, that it was evident from the complaint that the action was intended to rest on the invalidity, under the act of May, 1903, of such a contract as  1710 contemplates, and that therefore that section could have no application.\n The court then considered the act of February, 1903, and said:\n'The section of main importance here is the second, which provides for the recovery for loss of or damage to freight, and penalties for failure to adjust and pay such loss or damage within a certain time. The question vital to this case is whether the statute can be construed to impose upon one connecting carrier, liability for the default of another, unless such carrier obtains and gives the information, or uses due diligence to obtain it, as provided in  1710 of the Civil Code. We do not think it can be so construed.\n\n'The main enactment as to the recovery of damages and penalties thus begins in  2: 'That every claim for loss of or damage to property while in the possession of such common carrier shall be adjusted and paid within forty days,' etc. The words we have italicized clearly limit the loss and damage which a carrier is required to adjust and pay for to that which befalls while the goods are in the possession of such carrier, and excludes the idea of liability for loss or damage to the goods while in the possession of another carrier.\n\n'It is true there is a proviso at the end of this section, 'that \n\n[216 U.S. 122, 131]\n\u00a0\n no common carrier shall be liable under this act for property which never came into its possession, if it complies with the provisions of  1710, vol. 1, of the Code of Laws of South Carolina, 1902.' But as the body of the act does not make the carrier liable at all 'for goods which never came into its possession,' a proviso which exempts from liability for loss of or damage to such goods on certain conditions can have no effect. The act imposes no liability to which the exemption can be applied.\n\n'The rule is that all parts of a statute, including provisos, are to be construed together, and effect given, if possible, to all. But it is contrary to reason as well as authority to extend by implication a proviso to cover that which is opposed to the express language of the main enactment. Southgate v. Goldthwaite, 1 Bail. L. 367; United States v. Dickson, 15 Pet. 141, 10 L. ed. 689; The Irresistible, 7 Wheat. 551, 5 L. ed. 520; 26 Am. & Eng. Enc. Law, p. 681; Endlich, Interpretation of Statutes,  184, 185. The fact that the statute is penal adds force to this conclusion. We are of the opinion that the proviso of  2 has no effect, and the act only imposes penalties upon the carrier for failing to adjust claims for loss occurring while the goods are in its own possession.\n\n'It follows, the plaintiff in this case cannot sustain his recovery on the ground that the defendant was liable, under the act of February, 1903, for goods lost by a connecting carrier, because it failed to obtain and give information of the kind required in cases falling under that act, or to use due diligence to obtain such information.\n\n'This penalty act of February will apply to the case, if the finding on the new trial should be that the loss occurred on the defendant's road, but not otherwise. It is attacked as unconstitutional under the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States. That question is discussed and decided against the defendants contention in Charles v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. 78 S. C. 36, 125 Am. St. Rep. 762, 58 S. E. 927.'\n\n In Charles v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. supra, the action was brought in a magistrate court to recover the value of four \n\n[216 U.S. 122, 132]\n\u00a0\n sacks of rice, alleged to have been shipped from New Orleans, Louisiana, by Martin J. Wynne, to the plaintiff at Timmonsville, South Carolina, and to have been lost while in the possession of the defendant carrier, and also to recover $50 penalty for failure to adjust and pay the claim within ninety days, as prescribed by the act of February 23, 1903. The magistrate gave judgment against defendant for the amount claimed, and that judgment, on appeal, was affirmed by the circuit court, and then again by the supreme court of the state in this case. The supreme court held that the last proviso of the 2d section of the act of February, 1903, had no application to carriers into whose possession the goods had come, and referred to the opinion of the court in Seegers Bros. v. Seaboard Air Line R. Co. 73 S. C. 71, 73, 121 Am. St. Rep. 921, 52 S. E. 797, where it was said: 'The duty to make prompt settlement for loss or damage to goods is but an incident of the duty to transport and deliver safely and with reasonable diligence. The statute in question was designed to effectuate an important public purpose; viz., to compel the common carrier to perform with reasonable diligence the duty which peculiarly appertains to his business as a carrier of freight. The penalty is but a means to that end.' And see same case, \n207 U.S. 73\n, 52 L. ed. 108, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 28.\n The supreme court, after making that quotation, thus proceeded:\n'While it is not easy to define the exact limits of the operation of state laws as affecting interstate commerce, we have no hesitation in saying that the statute in question, as it affects carriers doing business in this state, who fail or refuse to adjust and pay the loss of or damage to goods while in their possession, is no unlawful interference with interstate commerce, even as applied to an interstate shipment. The penalty imposed is for a delict of duty appertaining to the business of a common carrier; and in so far as it may affect interstate commerce, it is an aid thereto by its tendency to promote safe and prompt delivery of goods, or its legal equivalent-prompt settlement of proper claim for damages. No penalty can at- \n\n[216 U.S. 122, 133]\n\u00a0\n tach except upon the establishment in a court of a default of duty inposed by statute. The statute does not attempt to regulate interstate commerce, and imposes no tax or burden thereon. It is supported by the general principle declared in Sherlock v. Alling, \n93 \nU.S. 99, 104\n, 23 S. L. ed. 819, 820, and enforced in Smith v. Alabama, \n124 U.S. 465\n, 31 L. ed. 508, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 804, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 564, and Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Alabama, \n128 U.S. 96\n, 32 L. ed. 352, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 238, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 28, that state legislation 'relating to the rights, duties, and liabilities of citizens, and only indirectly and remotely affecting the operations of commerce, is of obligatory force upon citizens within the territorial jurisdiction, whether on land or water, or engaged in commerce, foreign or interstate, or in any other pursuit.\"\n\n In the case of Western U. Teleg. Co. v. James, \n162 U.S. 650\n, 40 L. ed. 1105, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 934, a statute of Georgia requiring telegraph companies to transmit and deliver dispatches with impartiality, good faith, and diligence, under penalty of $100 in each case, in the absence of legislation by Congress on the subject, was held not to be an unwarrantable interference with interstate commerce as to messages without the state, and Mr. Justice Peckham, delivering the opinion of the court, said, p. 660:\n'The statute in question is of a nature that is in aid of the performance of a duty of the company that would exist in the absence of any such statute, and it is in nowise obstructive of its duty as a telegraph company. It imposes a penalty for the purpose of enforcing this general duty of the company. The direction that the delivery of the message shall be made with impartiality and in good faith and with due diligence is not an addition to the duty which it would owe in the absence of such a statute. Can it be said that the imposition of a penalty for the violation of a duty which the company owed by the general law of the land is a regulation of or an obstruction to interstate commerce, within the meaning of that clause of the Federal Constitution under discussion? We think not.'\n\n And see Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. v. Solan, \n169 U.S. 137\n, 42 L. ed. 692, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 289; Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Hughes, \n191 U.S. 491\n, 48 L. ed. 273, 24 Sup. Ct.

GOVERNMENT OF PHILIPPINE ISLANDS(1910)\nNo. 64\nArgued: December 6, 1910Decided: December 19, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[219 U.S. 17, 18]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James Russell Soley and Howard C. Dickinson for appellant and plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[219 U.S. 17, 19]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Denison for appellee and defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[219 U.S. 17, 20]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action upon a contract for an extension to the Luneta of the city of Manila. Both courts below decided for the government, the defendant, upon demurrer to the complaint. Abridged, the allegations are these: A contract for the work was made on July 24, 1905. On May 1, 1906, about 200 feet of bulkhead and rock revetment were displaced by pressure from the inside fill and moved about 20 feet into the bay of Manila, so that a large quantity of the fill that had been pumped behind the bulkhead escaped into the bay. On May 18, before the break could be repaired, a severe typhoon occurred, and the bulkhead and rock revetment, being without the support of the inside fill, were destroyed for about 1800 feet by the pressure of the rock revetment and the wind and waves from the outside, and a large additional quantity of the inside fill escaped. The question is which party must bear the last-mentioned loss. If the first break had not happened, no damage would have been done by the typhoon. The plaintiff sets forth the cost of repairing the damages of May 18, and seeks to recover it in this suit.\n The specifications of the contract contain the following:\n'5. The contractor will be responsible for damages to the bulkhead and revetment, arising from wave action or from pressure of the revetment against the timber structure; but if a break is caused by pressure resulting from \n\n[219 U.S. 17, 21]\n\u00a0\n the mud fill, the repairs to the structure will be paid for by the government at the prices specified in the contract; provided that the specifications have been fully complied with.'\n\n'12. . . . All losses of dredged material from the fills, excepting those due to failure of the bulkheads from pressure of the mud fill, as stated in article 5, will be measured as carefully as conditions will permit, and the computed amounts deducted from the statement for the final payment.'\n\n On May 24 a supplemental contract was signed. It recited that the repairs made necessary by the break of May 1 ought to be paid for by the government; that the original project was modified so as to fill the space that had given way with rock, with clay etc., for the interstices; and that the change would either increase or diminish the cost. It then agreed that the plaintiff should make the repairs, and the government would pay the actual and reasonable cost, with certain qualifications, plus 15 per centum, which last was to cover all other items, including profit. This referred to the first damage only. On the next day, May 25, the government director telegraphed to Commissioner Forbes: 'for most of typhoon damage I hold contractor responsible; they claim government responsible for all, on account delay repairing first break, but wish to make repairs in manner authorized for first break, leaving settlement of liability to be determined later. Repairs should be made at once, but in view of contract requirement . . . do not see how contractors can be authorized proceed before determination of liability.' The answer approved 'authorizing contractors to proceed immediately to make repairs on lines indicated, with the understanding that all rights reserved in regard to adjudication of liabilities.' These telegrams were communicated to the plaintiff, and it was authorized to proceed to make repairs in the manner outlined in the agreement \n\n[219 U.S. 17, 22]\n\u00a0\n of May 24. It did so, and the government now refuses to pay.\n It will be understood that this case is in no way concerned with the possible difference in cost between the mode of repair adopted and that which might have been followed under the original contract. The question here is which party is responsible for the repairs, assuming no such difference to exist. We need not consider whether the effect of all that we have recited was or was not to substitute the new mode and new cost for the old, as that which the parties left at risk when they agreed that the plaintiffs should go on and do the work. If the plaintiff should have any claim for the excess alone, if any, over the cost that would have been incurred under the original plan, it is not suing for it here.\n Both sides found their case on the division of losses made by the specification quoted. On the one hand, the accident would not have happened but for the pressure from the mud fill; on the other, the more immediate cause was wave action and the pressure of the revetment against the timber structure, the effects of which the contractor was to bear. We agree with the court below that the contractor must bear the loss. The question is not whether the responsibility of the government might not have extended to the later consequences had it originally been a wrongdoer, and had it been sued in tort. The question is to what extent did the government assume a risk which, but for the contract, would not have fallen upon it at all. The contract qualified the relation only cautiously and in part. If the break was caused by pressure from the mud fill, the government agreed to pay for repairs to the structure. That was all.\n But for the addition in 12, quoted above, it might be doubted whether 'structure' meant anything but the bulkhead and revetment. But article 12 extends the government liability to loss of dredged materials due to \n\n[219 U.S. 17, 23]\n\u00a0\n such a break. It is suggested that the reason for the government undertaking was that the plan was made by the government engineers. It may have been. But the plaintiff was content to work upon that plan; it, not the government, was doing the work, and it took the risk so far as the contract did not make a change. The government could not be charged by it with negligence or with causing the first break. That was only something for repairing which the government had promised to pay. Whatever the government had not promised to pay for, the contractor had to do, in order to offer the completed work which it had agreed to furnish. The case is stronger for the government than those upon policies of insurance, where courts refuse to look behind the immediate cause to remoter negligence of the insured. General Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sherwood, 14 How. 352, 366, 14 L. ed. 452, 458; Orient Mut. Ins. Co. v. Adams, \n123 U.S. 67\n, 31 L. ed. 63, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 68; Dudgeon v. Pembroke, L. R. 2 App. Cas. 284, 295, 14 Eng. Rul. Cas. 105. Here, as we have said, the plaintiff cannot charge the defendant with negligence; the immediate event was one of which the plaintiff took the risk; on general principles of contract it took that risk unless it was agreed otherwise, and it does not matter to the result whether we say that we cannot look farther back than the immediate cause, or that the undertaking of the government did not extend to ulterior consequences, not specified, of the break for repairing which it undertook to pay, but which it did not cause.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","7":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBABBITT v. DUTCHER(1910)\nNo. 39\nArgued: November 29, 1909Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n The Randolph-Macon Coal Company was a Missouri corporation, and was duly adjudicated a bankrupt March 26, 1907, in proceedings instituted in the district court of the United States, in and for the eastern division of the eastern judicial district of Missouri. Byron F. Babbitt was duly appointed trustee in bankruptcy for the corporation May 10, 1907, and duly qualified by giving bond on that day.\n He thereafter made demand upon the president of the company for the delivery to him of the corporate records and stock books of the bankrupt company, which were kept in the office maintained by the company in New York city. This request was refused by letter of the president of the company, dated September 24, 1907, in which he says that he is advised 'that such records and stock books are not documents relating to the property of the bankrupt, and therefore you, as trustee in bankruptcy, are not entitled to their possession.'\n Thereupon the trustee made application to the district court in and for the southern district of New York, by peti- \n\n[216 U.S. 102, 103]\n\u00a0\n tion, for an order directing James T. Gardiner, the president, and Howard Dutcher, the secretary, of the company, or either of them, to deliver to him the stock-certificate book, the corporation minute book, and the stock register of said company, together with all other records and documents belonging to said company, in their possession or under their control. Gardiner and Dutcher were within the jurisdiction of the district court for the southern district of New York, and the books and papers referred to were within their custody there, and the trustee alleged that the stock- certificate book, the corporation minute book, and the stock register book were necessary to the trustee in his administration and settlement of the affairs of the company.\n Thereafter a hearing was had on the petition, the order to show cause, and return thereto, and the district judge (Holt, J.) indorsed on the petition: 'I am obliged to deny this motion on the authority of Re Von Hartz, 74 C. C. A. 58, 142 Fed. 726,' and ordered that the motion be denied on the ground that the court was without jurisdiction to entertain the proceeding or to grant the relief prayed for, and the district judge also certified that the order denying the motion and refusing to grant the relief was based solely on the ground that the court was without jurisdiction 'to entertain proceedings instituted by a trustee in bankruptcy duly appointed in a bankruptcy proceeding pending in another district, to compel the officers of the bankrupt to deliver to such trustee the documents in their possession relating to the business of the bankrupt.'\n This appeal was then allowed and duly proscuted.\n Messrs. William B. Hornblower and Morgan M. Mann for appellant. \n\n[216 U.S. 102, 104]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry W. Taft for appellees.\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 102, 105]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n Subdivision 1 of  70 of the bankruptcy act of 1898 (30 Stat. at L. 565, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3451) provides that the trustee of the estate of a bankrupt shall be vested by operation of law, as of the date of the adjudication, with the title of the bankrupt (a 1) to all 'documents relating to his property,' and subdivision 13 of  1 of the act provides that \"documents' shall include any book, deed, or instrument in writing.'\n Appellees, as officers of the bankrupt company, asserted no adverse claim, but denied that the corporate records and stock books were 'documents relating to the property of the bankrupt,' and asserted that therefore the trustee in bankruptcy was not entitled to their possession.\n We have no doubt that the books and records in question passed, on adjudication, to the trustee, and belong in the custody of the bankruptcy court, and, there being no adverse holding, that the bankruptcy court had power, upon a petition and rule to show cause, to compel their delivery to the trustee.

Wenman, \n198 U.S. 539\n, 49 L. ed. 1157, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 778.\n This brings us to the real question in the case, and upon which the decision was rendered; namely, whether the district \n\n[216 U.S. 102, 106]\n\u00a0\n court of the United States in and for the southern district of New York had jurisdiction to entertain this particular proceeding and grant the relief prayed for.\n In Ex parte Martin, Fed. Cas. No. 9,149, decided in 1842, Mr. Justice Story, sitting on circuit, held that the equity jurisdiction of the district courts, under the bankruptcy act of 1841 (5 Stat. at L. 440, chap. 9), was not confined to cases originally arising and pending in the particular court where the relief was sought, and where a creditor living in Massachusetts commenced suits in several states other than Pennsylvania, where proceedings were pending against the bankrupt for an adjudication, that an injunction would issue against the Massachusetts creditor, enjoining him from proceeding in the suits. Mr. Justice Story said:\n'The language of the 6th section of the act is: 'That the district court in every district shall have jurisdiction in all matters and proceedings in bankruptcy arising under the act,' the said jurisdiction to be exercised summarily, in the nature of summary proceedings in equity. The act then goes on to enumerate certain specific cases and controversies, to what the jurisdiction extends (which I deem merely affirmative, and not restrictive, of the preceding clause); and then it extends the jurisdiction 'to all acts, matters, and things to be done under and in virtue of the bankruptcy, until the final distribution and settlement of the estate of the bankrupt, and the close of the proceedings in bankruptcy.' Now, this language is exceedingly broad and general; and it is not in terms, or by fair implication, necessarily confined to cases of bankruptcy originally instituted and pending in the particular district court where the relief is sought. On the contrary, it is not unnatural to presume that, as cases originally instituted and pending in one district may apply to reach persons and property situate in other districts, and require auxiliary proceedings therein to perfect and accomplish the objects of the act, the intention of Congress was that the district courts in every district should be mutually \n\n[216 U.S. 102, 107]\n\u00a0\n anxiliary to each other for such purposes and proceedings. The language of the act is sufficiently comprehensive to cover such cases; and I can perceive no solid ground of objection to such an interpretation of it.'\n\n Section 1 of the bankruptcy act of 1867 (14 Stat. at L. 517, chap. 176), and  2 of the bankruptcy act of 1898, are substantially identical as to the jurisdiction of the district courts sitting as courts of bankruptcy, as will appear from the following comparison:\n Section 1 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1867\n\n\n That the several district courts of the United States be, and they hereby are, constituted courts of bankruptcy, and they shall have original jurisdiction in their respective districts in all matters and proceedings in bankruptcy, and they are hereby authorized to hear and adjudicate upon the same according to the provisions of this act . . . .\n And the jurisdiction hereby conferred shall extend. . . .\n To the collection of all the assets of the bankrupt . . . and to all acts, matters, and things to be done under and in virtue of the bankruptcy, until the final distribution and settlement of the estate of the bankrupt, and the close of the proceedings in bankruptcy.\n Section 2 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898.\n That the courts of bankruptcy as hereinbefore definied, viz., the district courts of the United States in the several states, the supreme court of the District of Columbia, the district courts of the several territories, and the United States courts in the Indian territory and the district of Alaska, are hereby made courts of bankruptcy, and are hereby invested, within their respective territorial limits, as now established, or as they may be hereafter changed, with such jurisdiction at law and in equity as will enable them to exercise original jurisdiction in bankruptcy proceedings, in vacation, in chambers, and during their respective terms, as they are now or may be hereafter \n\n[216 U.S. 102, 108]\n\u00a0\n held, to . . . (7) cause the estates of bankrupts to be collected, reduced to money, and distributed, and determine controversies in relation thereto, except as herein otherwise provided; . . . (15) make such orders, issue such process, and enter such judgments in addition to those specifically provided for as may be necessary for the enforcement of the provisions of this act; . . .\n Nothing in this section contained shall be construed to deprive a court of bankruptcy of any power it would possess were certain specific powers not herein enumerated.\n In Sherman v. Bingham, 3 Cliff. 552, Fed. Cas. No. 12,762, Mr. Justice Clifford, sitting on circuit, and construing the act of 1867, reversed the judgment of the district court, which held that an assignee in bankruptcy of a person declared a bankrupt in one district court could not maintain an action to recover moneys paid the defendants, residents of another district, in the district court of such district. And Mr. Justice Clifford said:\n'District courts have original jurisdiction in their respective districts in all matters and proceedings in bankruptcy, and the argument is, that inasmuch as the jurisdiction must be exercised in the district for which the district judge is appointed, the district court, sitting as a court of bankruptcy, cannot exercise jurisdiction in any case except in the district \n\n[216 U.S. 102, 109]\n\u00a0\n where the bankruptcy proceedings are pending; but  1 of the bankrupt act contains no such limitation, nor does it contain any words which, properly considered, justify any such conclusion.\n\n'General superintendence and jurisdiction of all cases and questions under the act are conferred upon the several circuit courts, except where special provision is otherwise made by the first clause of  2 of the act; but the subsequent language of the same clause makes it clear that the jurisdiction conferred by that clause can only be exercised within and for the district 'where the proceedings in bankruptcy shall be pending.' No such limitation, however, is found in the clause of  1, conferring jurisdiction upon the district courts as courts of bankruptcy. Judges of the district courts must sit undoubtedly in the districts for which they are respectively appointed, and no doubt is entertained that the process of the court in proceedings in bankruptcy cases is restricted to the territorial limits of the district; but the language of  1 of the bankrupt act describing the jurisdiction of the district courts, sitting as courts of bankruptcy, is, that they shall have original jurisdiction in their respective districts, 'in all matters and proceedings in bankruptcy,' showing unquestionably that they can only sit and exercise jurisdiction in their own districts; but the limitation that the proceedings in bankruptcy must in all cases be pending in that district is not found in that clause of  1 of the act. On the contrary, the same section provides that the jurisdiction conferred, that is, the jurisdiction of the several district courts, shall extend to all cases and controversies arising between the bankrupt and any creditor or creditors who shall claim any debt or demand under the bankruptcy act, and also to the collection of all the assets of the bankrupt, to the ascertainment and liquidation of the liens, and other specific claims thereon, to the adjustment of the various priorities and conflicting interests of all parties, and to the marshaling and disposition of all the different funds and assets, so as to secure the rights of all \n\n[216 U.S. 102, 110]\n\u00a0\n parties, and the due distribution of the assets among all the creditors, and to all acts, matters, and things to be done under and in virtue of the bankruptcy.'\n\n In Lathrop v. Drake, \n91 U.S. 516\n, 23 L. ed. 414, the question of the ancillary jurisdiction of the district court under the act of 1867 was considered, and the decision in Sherman v. Bingham approved. Mr. Justice Bradley, delivering the opinion, said:\n'Their jurisdiction is confined to their respective districts, it is true; but it extends to all matters and proceedings in bankruptcy without limit. When the act says that they shall have jurisdiction in their respective districts, it means that the jurisdiction is to be exercised in their respective districts. Each court, within its own district, may exercise the powers conferred; but those powers extend to all matters of bankruptcy, without limitation. There are, it is true, limitations elsewhere in the act; but they affect only the matters to which they relate. Thus, by  11, the petition in bankruptcy, and, by consequence, the proceedings thereon, must be addressed to the judge of the judicial district in which the debtor has resided, or carried on business, for the six months next preceding; and the district court of that district, being entitled to and having acquired jurisdiction of the particular case, necessarily has such jurisdiction exclusive of all other district courts, so far as the proceedings in bankruptcy are concerned. But the exclusion of other district courts from jurisdiction over these proceedings does not prevent them from exercising jurisdiction in matters growing out of or connected with that identical bankruptcy, so far as it does not trench upon or conflict with the jurisdiction of the court in which the case is pending. Proceedings ancillary to and in aid of the proceedings in bankruptcy may be necessary in other districts where the principal court cannot exercise jurisdiction; and it may be necessary for the assignee to institute suits in other districts for the recovery of assets of the bankrupt. That the courts of such other districts may exercise jurisdiction in such cases would seem to be the nec- \n\n[216 U.S. 102, 111]\n\u00a0\n essary result of the general jurisdiction conferred upon them, and is in harmony with the scope and design of the act. The state courts may undoubtedly be resorted to in cases of ordinary suits for the possession of property or the collection of debts; and it is not to be presumed that embarrassments would be encountered in those courts in the way of a prompt and fair administration of justice. But a uniform system of bankruptcy, national in its character, ought to be capable of execution in the national tribunals, without dependence upon those of the states, in which it is possible that embarrassments might arise. The question has been quite fully and satisfactorily discussed by a member of this court in the first circuit, in the case of Sherman v. Bingham, 3 Cliff. 552, 7 Nat. Bankr. Reg. 490, Fed. Cas. No. 12,762; and we concur in the opinion there expressed, that the several district courts have jurisdiction of suits brought by assignees appointed by other district courts in cases in bankruptcy.'\n\n The same question was considered in Goodall v. Tuttle, 3 Biss. 219, Fed. Cas. No. 5,833, which arose under the act of 1867, and the same conclusion reached, as also in M'Gehee v. Hentz, Fed. Cas. No. 8,794, and Re Tifft, Fed. Cas. No. 14,034. On the authority of these decisions it must be and is conceded that, under the bankruptcy acts of 1841 and 1867, ancillary jurisdiction, both in summary proceedings and in plenary suits, existed in all district courts within their respective districts; and the question really is whether the provisions of the act of 1898 are to the contrary, or, as appellee's counsel puts it, show an intention on the part of Congress to restrict such jurisdiction so as to cut off the inferences drawn from the language of the earlier acts.\n But neither the act of 1867, nor the act of 1898, expressly confers or expressly negatives ancillary jurisdiction in courts other than the court of adjudication. The provisions as to summary jurisdiction in the two acts are substantially identical, and it appears to us should receive the same construction. \n\n[216 U.S. 102, 112]\n\u00a0\n Re Benedict, 140 Fed. 55; Re Peiser, 115 Fed. 199; Re Sutter Bros. 131 Fed. 654; Re John L. Nelson & Bro. Co. 149 Fed. 590.\n It is, however, urged that the act of 1898 contains restrictive provisions as to the jurisdiction of both the circuit and district courts which weaken the force of the reasoning of the decisions based upon the general language of the earlier statutes. Subdivision 7 of  2 of the act of 1898 confers power to 'cause the estates of bankrupts to be collected, reduced to money, and distributed, and determine controversies in relation thereto, except as herein otherwise provided.' And it is said that the following provisions of  23 should be regarded as coming within the exception and operating to restrict the jurisdiction:\n'a. The United States circuit courts shall have jurisdiction of all controversies at law and in equity, as distinguished from proceedings in bankruptcy, between trustees, as such, and adverse claimants, concerning the property acquired or claimed by the trustees, in the same manner and to the same extent only as though bankruptcy proceedings had not been instituted, and such controversies had been between the bankrupts and such adverse claimants.' [30 Stat. at L. 552, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3431.]\n\n'b. Suits by the trustee shall only be brought or prosecuted in the courts where the bankrupt whose estate is being administered by such trustee might have brought or prosecuted them if proceedings in bankruptcy had not been instituted, unless by consent of the proposed defendant, except suits for the recovery of property under section 60, subdivision b, and section sixtyseven, subdivision e.' [Act of 1898, as amended by act Feb. 5, 1903, 32 Stat. at L. 798, chap. 487, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 1312]\n\n Section 60, subdivision b, refers to preferences given within four months before the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, and provides that they may be recovered by the trustee, and further: 'And, for the purpose of such recovery, any court of bankruptcy, as hereinbefore defined, and any state court which would have had jurisdiction if bankruptcy had not intervened, shall have concurrent jurisdiction.' \n\n[216 U.S. 102, 113]\n\u00a0\n Section 67, subdivision e, provides that conveyances in fraud of creditors shall be null and void, and that it shall be the duty of the trustee to sue to recover the property conveyed, and that, 'for the purpose of such recovery, any court of bankruptcy, as hereinbefore defined, and any state court which would have had jurisdiction if bankruptcy had not intervened, shall have concurrent jurisdiction.' [32 Stat. at L. 800, chap. 487, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, pp. 1315, 1316.]\n But the general jurisdiction was not restricted by these provisions, though they operated to mitigate the rigor of the rule laid down in the Bardes Case.\n There are two classes of cases arising under the act of 1898, and controlled by different principles. The first class is where there is a claim of adverse title to property of the bankrupt, based upon a transfer antedating the bankruptcy. The other class is where there is no claim of adverse title based on any transfer prior to the bankruptcy, but where the property is in the physical possession of a third party or of an agent of the bankrupt, or of an officer of a bankrupt corporation, who refuses to deliver it to the trustee in bankruptcy.\n In the former class of cases a plenary suit must be brought, either at law or in equity, by the trustee, in which the adverse claim of title can be tried and adjudicated.\n In the latter class it is not necessary to bring a plenary suit, but the bankruptcy court may act summarily, and may make an order in a summary proceeding for the delivery of the property to the trustee, without the formality of a formal litigation.\n The former class falls within the ruling in the case of Bardes v. First Nat. Bank, \n178 U.S. 524\n, 44 L. ed. 1175, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. Rep. 1000, and in the case of Jaquith v. Rowley, \n188 U.S. 620\n, 47 L. ed. 620, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 369, which hold that such a suit can be brought only in a court which would have had jurisdiction of a suit by the bankrupt against the adverse claimant, except where the defendant consents to be sued elsewhere.\n In the latter class of cases a plenary suit is not necessary, but the case falls within the rule laid down in Bryan v. Bernheimer, \n181 U.S. 188\n, 45 L. ed. 814, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 557, and Mueller v. Nugent, \n184 U.S. 1\n, 46 L. ed. 405, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 269 \n\n[216 U.S. 102, 114]\n\u00a0\n which held that the bankruptcy court could act summarily. The question was not discussed as to whether a court other than the court of adjudication could exercise this summary jurisdiction.\n The precise question before us on the present appeal is whether, in a case in which the original court of bankruptcy could act summarily, another court of bankruptcy, sitting in another district, can do so in aid of the court of original jurisdiction.\n Judge Holt, after expressing an opinion upholding ancillary jurisdiction, felt compelled to decide otherwise in this case, on the authority of Re Von Hartz, 74 C. C. A. 58, 142 Fed. 726, decided by the United States circuit court of appeals for the second circuit. It appears from the statement of the case in the opinion of the court in the matter of Von Hartz that the proceeding was a summary application, in which the appellant had been directed to turn over to the trustee in bankruptcy a policy of life insurance upon the life of the bankrupt, which 'had theretofore been assigned by Von Hartz to appellant.' It was not stated in the opinion whether the assignment was prior or subsequent to the proceedings in bankruptcy. If prior thereto, then neither the court where the bankruptcy proceedings were pending nor any other court could grant a summary order disposing of the title of the adverse claimant claiming title to the policy by assignment. That could only be determined in a plenary suit, and would fall within the rule in the Bardes and Jaquith Cases. But if the assignment was subsequent to the bankruptcy proceedings, then it would be a nullity, and would be disregarded by the bankruptcy court, and possession could be given to the trustee by a summary order, as in the Bryan and Mueller Cases.\n There is no decision of this court adverse to the ancillary jurisdiction of the district courts, as asked to be exercised in this case.\n Upon the whole, we are of opinion that the District Court for the Southern District of New York had jurisdiction of the \n\n[216 U.S. 102, 115]\n\u00a0\n petition below and to grant the relief therein prayed for, and therefore we reverse the order of that court denying the petition, and remand the cause for further proceedings in conformity with law. \n\n\n\n","8":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBALLINGER v. U S EX REL FROST(1910)\nNo. 54\nArgued: December 8, 1909Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 240, 241]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorneys General Harr and Lawler for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 240, 243]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles H. Merillat, Charles J. Kappler, H. C. Potterf, and E. A. Walker for defendant in error.\n\n\n[216 U.S. 240, 244]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The defendant in error, a citizen and resident of the Choctaw Nation in the Indian territory, whose enrolment had been approved by the Secretary of the Interior, and who was entitled to an allotment under the acts of Congress, on December 20, 1906, filed her petition in the supreme court of the District of Columbia for a mandamus compelling the Secretary of the Interior to deliver, or cause to be delivered, to her a patent to a tract of land consisting of 40 acres, located in the Choctaw Nation in the Indian territory, and which she had selected in accordance with law. The then Secretary of the Interior, Ethan A. Hitchcock, filed an answer, giving his reasons for declining to issue that patent. Subsequently, James R. Garfield, becoming Secretary of the Interior, was substituted as defendant, and filed an amended answer. A demurrer to the amended answer having been sustained, \n\n[216 U.S. 240, 245]\n\u00a0\n judgment was entered as prayed for, which was affirmed by the court of appeals of the District, and thereupon the case was brought to this court. After the record had been filed in this court, and during the present term, Richard A. Ballinger, the successor of Secretary Garfield, was substituted for him as plaintiff in error.\n The facts essential to a decision are briefly these: By treaty between the Choctaw Nation and the United States, dated September 27, 1830 ( 7 Stat. at L. 333), and the proclamation of the President of the United States of February 24, 1831, the United States caused 'to be conveyed to the Choctaw Nation a tract of country west of the Mississippi river, in fee simple to them and their descendants, to inure to them while they shall exist as a nation and live on it.' By subsequent treaties and agreements the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations were consolidated. The nations have not become extinct, and are still resident on the lands. The act of June 28, 1898 (30 Stat. at L. 495, chap. 517), authorized the allotment of the land to the Choctaws and Chickasaws in fair and equal proportions, and provided that this should be done under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior; also, that as soon as practicable after the completion of the said allotment, the principal chief of the Choctaw Nation and the governor of the Chickasaw Nation should jointly execute, under their hands and the seals of their respective nations, and deliver to their allottees, patents conveying to them all the right, title, and interest of the Indians in and to the lands allotted. The act of May 31, 1900 (31 Stat. at L. 221, chap. 598), also authorized the Secretary of the Interior to lay out, survey, and plat the sites of such towns as then had a population of two hundred or more, and that he might, upon the recommendation of the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes, at any time before the allotment, set aside and reserve, not exceeding 160 acres in any one tract, at such stations as were or should be established on the line of any railway which should be constructed or be in process of construction in or through either of said nations \n\n[216 U.S. 240, 246]\n\u00a0\n prior to the allotment of the lands therein. These town-site provisions were incorporated into the act of March 1, 1901 (31 Stat. at L. 848, 851, chap. 675).\n On October 26, 1900, the town site of Mill Creek, containing 155.45 acres, on which there was a railway station, was designated and laid out. The land in controversy is adjacent to that town site. Section 45 of the act of July 1, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 641, chap. 1362), authorized an addition to such town sites on the recommendation of the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes, not exceeding 640 acres, and the appropriation act of March 3, 1903 (32 Stat. at L. 982, 996, chap. 994), appropriated $25, 000 to pay the town-site expenses, with this proviso:\n'That the money hereby appropriated shall be applied only to the expenses incident to the survey, platting, and appraisement of town sites heretofore set aside and reserved from allotment: And provided further, That nothing herein contained shall prevent the survey and platting at their own expense of town sites by private parties where stations are located along the lines of railroads, nor the unrestricted alienation of lands for such purposes, when recommended by the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes and approved by the Secretary of the Interior.'\n\n On February 17, 1903, the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes made recommendation that this adjacent land be scgregated as an addition to Mill Creek, under the provisions of the act of July 1, 1902, supra. This recommendation, having been approved by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, was by him transmitted to the Secretary of the Interior, who, on March 18, 1903, addressed a letter to the Commission, reciting the segregation of Mill Creek town site on October 26, 1900, and the recommendation of the Commission, approved by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and said: 'The Department does not deem it advisable to make the recommendation, in view of the act of March 3, 1903.' On July 23, 1903, the relator selected as her allotment the land in controversy, upon \n\n[216 U.S. 240, 247]\n\u00a0\n which were her buildings and improvements. This was received by the Commission, and nine months thereafter, the time prescribed by statute for contest (act of July 1, 1902, supra) having elapsed, and no contest of her right to the designated allotment having been made, a certificate of allotment was issued and delivered to her. Thereafter the principal chief of the Choctaw Nation and the governor of the Chickasaw Nation jointly executed a patent under the seals of their respective nations, conveying to her the title of said nations in and to said 40 acres of land. Sections 23 and 24 of the act of July 1, 1902, supra, read as follows:\n'Sec. 23. Allotment certificates issued by the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes shall be conclusive evidence of the right of any allottee to the tract of land described therein; and the United States Indian agent at the Union Agency shall, upon the application of the allottee, place him in possession of his allotment, and shall remove therefrom all persons objectionable to such allottee, and the acts of the Indian agent hereunder shall not be controlled by the writ or process of any court.\n\n'Sec. 24. Exclusive jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes to determine, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, all matters relating to the allotment of land.'\n\n The Secretary alleged in his answer that after the issue of the allotment to relator, and on or about March 11, 1905, his predecessor in office was advised that the land had then, and prior to its selection by petitioner, been under urban occupancy, and on June 19, 1905, he ordered an investigation, and finding such to be the fact, and that the inhabitants had expended large sums in building upon and improving their tracts, and were entitled to be protected, he did, on October 23, 1905, by virtue of the powers in him vested, segregate the lands for townsite purposes, and cancel petitioner's allotment thereof, with leave to select other lands to fill her right to tribal lands in severalty. The patent that had previously been exe- \n\n[216 U.S. 240, 248]\n\u00a0\n cuted for delivery to her was returned, and remained on file in the office of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, to be canceled.\n The Interior Department has general control over the affairs of the Indians,-wards of the government. In addition, the Secretary of the Interior was by these several acts specially charged with the duty of supervising the action of the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes in making the allotments authorized by those acts. On both of these grounds he claims authority to have done what he did, and that his acts in that respect are not subject to review by the courts. We have no disposition to minimize the authority or control of the Secretary of the Interior, and the court should be reluctant to interfere with his action. But, as said by Mr. Justice Field in Cornelius v. Kessel, \n128 \nU.S. 456, 461\n, 32 S. L. ed. 482, 483, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 122, 124:\n'The power of supervision and correction is not an unlimited or an arbitrary power. It can be exerted only when the entry was made upon false testimony, or without authority of law. It cannot be exercised so as to deprive any person of land lawfully entered and paid for. By such entry and payment the purchaser secures a vested interest in the property and a right to a patent therefor, and can no more be deprived of it by order of the Commissioner than he can be deprived by such order of any other lawfully acquired property. Any attempted deprivation in that way of such interest will be corrected whenever the matter is presented so that the judiciary can act upon it.'\n\n See also Orchard v. Alexander, \n157 \nU.S. 372, 383\n, 39 S. L. ed. 737, 741, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 635, 639, in which it was declared:\n'Of course, this power of reviewing and setting aside the action of the local land officers is, as was decided in Cornelius v. Kessel, \n128 U.S. 456\n, 32 L. ed. 482, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 122, not arbitrary and unlimited. It does not prevent judicial inquiry. Johnson v. Towsley, 13 Wall. 72, 20 L. ed. 485. The party who makes proofs which are accepted by the local land officers, and pays his money for the land, has \n\n[216 U.S. 240, 249]\n\u00a0\n acquired an interest of which he cannot be arbitrarily dispossessed.'\n\n Whenever, in pursuance of the legislation of Congress, rights have become vested, it becomes the duty of the courts to see that those rights are not disturbed by any action of an executive officer, even the Secretary of the Interior, the head of a department. However laudable may be the motives of the Secretary, he, as all others, is bound by the provisions of congressional legislation. It must be borne in mind that this allotment provided by Congress contemplated a distribution among the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians of the lands that belonged to them to common. They were the principal beneficiaries, and their titles to the lands they selected should be protected against the efforts of outsiders to secure them. White men settling on town sites were not the principal beneficiaries. Congress, it is true, authorized town sites, and the town of Mill Creek was established in compliance with the statute. It further provided for an enlargement of any town site upon the recommendation of the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes. That recommendation was made in respect to the town of Mill Creek, but disapproved by the Secretary of the Interior. Thereafter the relator selected the land in controversy, a tract of 40 acres, on which were her improvements. Notice was given, as required, and the time in which contest could be made-nine months-elapsed. Thereupon, as provided by the statute, the title of the allottee to the land selected became fixed and absolute, and the chief authorities of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations executed to her a patent, as required, of the land selected. The fact that there may have been persons on the land is immaterial. They were given nine months to contest the right of the applicant. They failed to make contest, and her rights became fixed. Thereafter the Secretary of the Interior, had nothing but the ministerial duty of seeing that a patent was duly executed and delivered.\n That the performance of a ministerial duty can be com- \n\n[216 U.S. 240, 250]\n\u00a0\n pelled by mandamus has been often adjudged. As said by Mr. Justice Peckham, in Roberts v. United States, \n176 \nU.S. 221, 229\n, 44 S. L. ed. 443, 446, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 376, 379:\n'The law relating to mandamus against a public officer is well settled in the abstract, the only doubt which arises being whether the facts regarding any particular case bring it within the law which permits the writ to issue where a mere ministerial duty is imposed upon an executive officer, which duty he is bound to perform without any further question. If he refuse under such circumstances, mandamus will lie to compel him to perform his duty.'\n\n See also Noble v. Union River Logging Co. \n147 U.S. 165\n, 37 L. ed. 123, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 271, in which Mr. Justice Brown cites many cases and draws distinctions between them.\n But the authorities come more closely to the facts in this case. In Barney v. Dolph, \n97 \nU.S. 652, 656\n, 24 S. L. ed. 1063, 1064, Mr. Chief Justice Waite said:\n'The execution and delivery of the patent after the right to it is complete are the mere ministerial acts of the officer charged with that duty.'\n\n In Simmons v. Wagner, \n101 \nU.S. 260, 261\n, 25 S. L. ed. 910, 911, the same chief justice repeated the proposition in these words:\n Where the right to a patent has once become vested in a purchaser of public lands, it is equivalent, so far as the government is concerned, to a patent actually issued. The execution and delivery of the patent after the right to it has become complete are the mere ministerial acts of the officers charged with that duty. Barney v. Dolph, \n97 U.S. 652\n, 24 L. ed. 1063; Stark v. Starr, 6 Wall. 402, 18 L. ed. 925.'\n In United States v. Schurz, \n102 \nU.S. 378, 403\n, 26 S. L. ed. 167, 174, Mr. Justice Miller, delivering the opinion of the court, said:\n'No further authority to consider the patentee's case remains in the land office. No right to consider whether he ought, in equity or on new information, to have the title or receive the patent. There remains the duty, simply ministerial, to deliver the patent to the owner,-a duty which, \n\n[216 U.S. 240, 251]\n\u00a0\n within all the definitions, can be enforced by the writ of mandamus.'\n\n We think the judgment of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of the District, was right, and it is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","9":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBALTIMORE & O S W R.

As an incident to this general question, we would further be required to consider the relations, irrespective of its mere attributes and duties as a common carrier, of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad with various coal mines along the line of its road, and the relation with or control over some, if not all, of these coal mines by other mines or mine operators, and, in \n\n[215 U.S. 481, 483]\n\u00a0\n addition, to consider the relation of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad with the Cumberland & Pennsylvania Railroad. This road taps the main track of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad at Cumberland, Maryland, proceeds thence to the state line between Maryland and Pennsylvania, where it strikes the Pennsylvania Railroad, and passing thence through a country rich in bituminous coal deposits, and containing coal mines, it reaches Piedmont, West Virginia, where its tracks again connect with those of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad. As an additional incident, we might also be required to consider the relation or control, direct or indirect, if any, which the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad exerted over some, if not all, of the coal mines along the line of the Cumberland & Pennsylvania road. Some, therefore, of the underlying questions involved in the cause, if we may consider them, are similar to the issues which were passed upon by us in the case of the Interstate Commerce Commission v. Illinois C. R. Co., which we have just decided. [\n215 U.S. 452\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 155.] While referring to the general situation as depicted in that case, we think, in addition, a mere outline sketch of the conditions existing prior to the commencement of this suit, as regards the matters with which it is concerned, will serve to render clear the reasons which control us in deciding it.\n The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, a corporation existing under the laws of Maryland, owned and operated a railroad or railroads in the states of Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and other states, and, as a common carrier, was engaged in interstate commerce between such states. The main line of said road west of Cumberland, Maryland, passes through a bituminous coal field, which is worked by many coal operators, the product of whose mines depends for its movement to market in interstate commerce on the facilities for such movement which the Baltimore & Ohio affords. For the purpose of this case, the coal mines referred to may be treated as situated in what is described as the Monongah district of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad. \n\n[215 U.S. 481, 484]\n\u00a0\n Regulations of the Baltimore more & Ohio Railroad, by which mines were rated in order to fix the basis for a pro rata distribution of coal cars in case of car shortage, had their peculiarities differing from other roads. They were based, first, upon the capacity of the mines; second, upon the previous shipments by the mines for a period of two years the capacity counting as one and the previous shipments as two. The capacity was ascertained by considering the number of working places, etc., modified by taking into account the facilities for moving the coal out of the mine, such as tracks, tipple, etc. The previous shipments were taken from the records of the company during periods when there was no car shortage. Upon the basis of the capacity thus ascertained, the regulations of the company for giving each mine owner in the case of shortage its percentage of cars, stated in the most summary way, were briefly these: In the first place, there were assigned, out of the general mass of cars before the distribution was made, such cars as it was deemed the Cumberland & Pennsylvania Railroad was entitled to. This was done by no fixed rule, but, in the discretion of the traffic manager, generally upon the basis of the percentage of shipments of coal hauled in the two previous years by that road. The estimated mass remaining after the deliveries to the Cumberland & Pennsylvania Railroad were subjected to certain arbitrary assignments, and the remainder, after such assignments had been taken out, were equally distributed among the mine operators, according to their capacity rating. The arbitrary deductions which were made, as we have just stated, were these:\n\n 1. \nBaltimore & Ohio Railroad cars placed at mines for Baltimore & Ohio fuel coal.\n\n 2. \nNew mines are allotted an arbitrary number of cars daily or weekly for development. In cases where the inspection shows a marked increase in the capacity of certain mines, and it is not practicable to change the percentage of the whole district, proper arbitraries are applied pending a general revision. \n\n[215 U.S. 481, 485]\n\u00a0\n 3. Cars of foreign railroads, assigned by them to their own fuel trade.\n\n 4. \nCars of individual companies, placed at mines owned by such companies, and cars owned by individual consumers, placed at mines for their coal.\n There are also certain exceptions of a local character, as follows:\n\n 1. \nCurtis Bay premium. Whenever a shipper on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad handles cars at Curtis Bay promptly in any one month, he is allowed in the succeeding month a premium of 50 per cent of the number of cars so handled, in addition to his regular percentage. This in lieu of an assignment of cars to the Curtis Bay trade.\n\n 2. \nAt certain points, noted on the percentage sheets, an arbitrary number of cars is assigned to mines on fire.\n\n 3. \nAt certain mines in the immediate vicinity of industries, empty cars intended for loading at such industries are first sent into the mines for loading coal for such industries.\n\n 4. \nWhen annual contracts are placed for foreign railroad fuel coal with mines on the Baltimore & Ohio, arrangements are made that, if the foreign railroads' cars are furnished for this fuel coal, the Baltimore & Ohio will allow the mines shipping the coal a number of Baltimore & Ohio cars equal to the foreign cars furnished.\n\n 5. \nWhen mines are connected with foreign railroads as well as with the Baltimore & Ohio, their rating is reduced 50 per cent. A similar reduction is made in cases where mines are located near rivers and are equipped for loading boats.\n Where mines needed box and stock cars for the shipment of coal, as to which class of cars shortage rarely arose, there was a special rule which we need not notice.\n With the system just referred to in force on the 19th of January, 1907, the Pitcairn Coal Company, a West Virginia corporation owning a coal mine on the line of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in West Virginia, filed its petition in mandamus in the United States circuit court for the district of \n\n[215 U.S. 481, 486]\n\u00a0\n Maryland. The defendants were the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, the Fairmont Coal Company, the Clarksburg Fuel Company, the Pittsburg & Fairmont Fuel Company, and the Southern Coal & Transportation Company, these four coal companies operating coal mines located in West Virginia on the Monogah division of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad. Along with these there were also made defendants two other corporations, the Consolidation Coal Company, located on the Cumberland & Pennsylvania Railroad in Maryland, and the Somerest Coal Company, located on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in Pennsylvania. All of these coal companies were charged to be substantially one in interest and were generally described as the Fairmont Companies. In addition, thirty-one other coal companies, alleged to be independent companies, operating coal mines on the line of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, were also made defendants. Rearranging somewhat the order of the averments as contained in the bill, the prayer for relief was substantially based upon the following grounds: The Pitcairn Coal Company, it was averred, was entitled to an equal distribution of the coal cars of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in times of shortage, in order to move its output of coal in interstate commerce; that the railroad company had refused, after demand, to give it the share of cars to which it was entitled; and that its not doing so had been seriously prejudicial to the business of the company, had curtailed its production, and interfered with the moving of the coal produced in interstate commerce, and that the conduct of the railroad in the premises had amounted to the giving of an undue preference to the Fairmont Coal Company and its affiliated companies, to the prejudice of the Pitcairn Company and all other independent companies. The method pursued by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad for rating mines by the consideration of both capacity and previous shipments was alleged, and it was charged that, on the basis of capacity of the mine as rated by that system, the Pitcairn Company was entitled to 7\/10 per cent \n\n[215 U.S. 481, 487]\n\u00a0\n of the cars for distribution in the Monongah division. General averments were, however, made concerning the method of rating, which, in effect, charged that such method was discriminatory and preferential, and was put in force so as to operate in favor of the Fairmont Coal Company and the companies affiliated with it, to the prejudice of the Pitcairn Company and other independent coal operators, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad being interested, it was charged, directly or indirectly, in the Fairmont and its affiliated companies. The method of deduction from the mass of cars for the benefit of the Cumberland & Pennsylvania Railroad was also charged to be discriminatory and preferential, and to have been devised for the purpose of favoring mines on the line of the Cumberland & Pennsylvania, which were affiliated with the Fairmont. The failure to charge against the mines which had received them, individual or private cars, foreign railroad cars, and company fuel cars, as well as the other arbitrary allotments of cars provided for in the regulations to which we have referred, including the Curtis Bay regulation, were all assailed as preferential and discriminatory, it being alleged that, in many instances, the individual cars had been virtually paid for by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, and that the failure to charge them was in effect a mere means resorted to in order to give a preference contrary to the act to regulate commerce. The prayer was for an alternative writ of mandamus, commanding an equal distribution in accordance with the averments of the petition in effect for the undoing of the regulations referred to, and for the establishment of regulations conformable to the rights which the petition asserted. As the scope of the prayer is important in the view we take of the case, it is excerpted in the margin. \n First. That in the event of scarcity of cars to be furnished by defendant Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, to shippers of coal on the Monongah division of said road, that defendant the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company be required to furnish to relator one and seven tenths (1. 7) per cent, until such percentage shall properly \n\n[215 U.S. 481, 488]\n\u00a0\n It suffices for the present purposes to say that the answer of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad traversed every averment as to preference and discrimination, asserted the validity of the method of rating and the rules of distribution to which we have referred. In great detail the origin and history of the operation of private or individual cars was set out, various contracts on that subject were annexed to the bill, and a decree rendered by the circuit court of the United States for the northern district of West Virginia in favor of the Fairmont Coal Company, perpetually enjoining the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company to deliver certain private cars to the\nbe increased, of the total number of cars in service, or supplied to all the shippers on the Monongah division of said road, without deducting from said number of cars 'individual cars,' or any arbitrary allotment of cars to other shippers, and without deducting from the total number of cars on all the lines of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad the 'individual cars,' claimed by the Somerset Coal Company, or the cars arbitrarily assigned to the Cumberland & Pennsylvania Railroad Company, or the Consolidation Coal Company, before making the percentage distribution to the Monongah division.\n Second. That writ of mandamus may be issued against the said Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, defendant, to command and require it to cease to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to Fairmont Coal Company, Consolidation Coal Company, Cumberland & Pennsylvania Railroad Company, Somerset Coal Company, Southern Coal & Transportation Company, Clarksburg Fuel Company, or Pittsburg & Fairmont Fuel Company, or either of them, in the shipping and transportation of their coal, and to cease from subjecting the relator, Pitcairn Coal Company, or any other independent shipper of coal on the Monongah division aforesaid, to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in the shipping and transportation of coal, or in any respect whatsoever, and to move and transport the traffic of relator, Pitcairn Coal Company, and the other independent coal companies on the Monongah division aforesaid, without discrimination or preference, and to furnish the said Pitcairn Coal Company and the other independent shippers of coal on the Monongah division, without preference or discrimination, and upon conditions as favorable to it or them as is given by the said railroad company to the said Fairmont Coal Company, Consolidation Coal Company, Somerset Coal Company, Clarksburg \n\n[215 U.S. 481, 489]\n\u00a0\n Fairmont Company, was referred to and made part of the bill. The Cumberland & Pennsylvania Railroad Company, the Fairmont Coal Company, and the five coal companies alleged in the bill to be affiliated with the Fairmont Coal Company, applied for leave to answer, on the ground that, although the alternative rule for mandamus had not been served upon them, and they had only been summoned to 'do whatever they deemed proper to protect their interest in the premises,' they desired to answer, because the questions involved 'are extremely important and of unusual interest, not only to your petitioners and the railroad against whom the mandamus is\nFuel Company, Southern Coal & Transportation Company, and Pittsburg & Fairmont Fuel Company, or for like traffic, under similar conditions, to any other shipper, its fair and reasonable percentage of all cars on the line of said railroad and to shippers of like traffic along its railroad line, based upon the system of distribution of cars in effect on said railroad as aforesaid, or upon any fair, reasonable, and equitable basis, and to furnish to the said Pitcairn Coal Company, for the transportation of its coal, without discrimination, exception, or limitation, and upon conditions as favorable as those given to other shippers, the percentage of the total car supply on said railroad at this time properly distributable by said railroad company to the said Monongah division, and thereon distributed among the relator and the other shippers of coal thereon as aforesaid.\n Third. That in ascertaining and fixing the number of cars to which relator, Pitcairn Coal Company, and the other coal companies on the Monongah division aforesaid are entitled, the said Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company shall take into consideration and include in the estimate or calculation of the number of cars, to be divided in the proportion to which the percentages of each mine entitles the owner thereof to cars, all cars, whether owned by individual operators, shippers, other railroad companies, or by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, and which may be upon the road of said Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, and shall also take into consideration, and include in the estimate or calculation of the number of cars to be divided upon the percentages aforesaid, all cars, whether furnished or used for fuel or supply coal for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, or for any other railroad company, and shall not deduct, before dividing the cars upon the percentages aforesaid, any cars for premiums at Curtis Bay, or other arbitrary allotments. \n\n[215 U.S. 481, 490]\n\u00a0\n asked, but to the whole body of transportation companies engaged in interstate commerce, and that the importance of the questions involved is so great that your petitioners feel that they are making but a reasonable request when they ask for a reasonable time to thoroughly present the facts which the court ought to be in possession of for a full and complete determination of the question.' The right to answer having been given, and delay for that purpose having been accorded, these companies answered. Without at all going into detail, we think it suffices to say that the answer traversed all the averments as to preference and discrimination alleged in the bill. It specially asserted the legality of the operation on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad of private or individual cars; made copious reference to the acts or contracts from which the right to operate said cars had arisen; charged that to take said cars from the service of the persons who owned them would be confiscatory, and in substance asserted the validity of the system of rating and of distribution enforced by the regulations of the company which we have previously referred to. Fourteen out of the thirty-one corporations referred to in the petition as independent companies briefly answered, adopting the averments of the petition, and praying for the awarding of the relief therein asked. Sixteen did not answer, and one of said companies substantially joined in the defenses of the railroad company, except as to the individual cars, concerning which it averred that it was the duty of the railroad to purchase said cars from the persons owning them, and to operate them as part of the railroad equipment. By stipulation the cause was heard by the court without a jury.\n There was voluminous testimony and a protracted trial, each side requesting findings and instructions embodying their respective contentions, and excepting in so far as they were overruled. The court considered all the contentions raised by the pleadings except several which were not pressed at bar. It held that, in view of the relations which the Cumberland & Pennsylvania Railroad had to the Baltimore & Ohio, and \n\n[215 U.S. 481, 491]\n\u00a0\n the origin of those relations, the method by which coal cars were turned over to the Cumberland road was not preferential or discriminatory. It decided that however amenable, abstractly considered, to criticism, if at all, might be the system of rating, and especially the inclusion therein of the amount of coal shipments, and the large influence attributed to that fact, yet, when the particular facts concerning the Monongah district and the relations of the Baltimore & Ohio to that district were given their proper weight, the system was a just one and ought not to be interfered with. The complaint as to the Curtis Bay premium was also decided to be without merit; and so also was the complaint as to consumer's cars, as to foreign railway fuel cars and company fuel cars. Considering the private cars belonging to mine operators, and, without at all going into the relation of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad with the owners of such cars, it was decided that while there was a right on the part of the railroad to move the cars, and it would be confiscation to deprive the owners of the right to use them, yet the duty was on the railroad to take account of the cars in fixing the percentage in case of shortage. The court declined to consider the decree which has been rendered in favor of the Fairmont Company against the Baltimore & Ohio in the previous case, which was pleaded, as well as that in another cause, which was relied upon in argument to the same effect as controlling. The mandamus prayed, therefore, was refused as to every item embraced in the petition but that particular item, and, as to it, the writ was awarded. 154 Fed. 108.\n The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, the Fairmont Companies, and the Pitcairn Coal Company prosecuted error. The circuit court of appeals held as follows: (a) that the system of rating, so far as taking into view the shipments and percentages based thereon was considered, was discriminatory and preferential; (b) that while the right to allot cars to the Cumberland & Pennsylvania Railroad under the facts found below was lawful, the methods by which the allotment \n\n[215 U.S. 481, 492]\n\u00a0\n was made was also discriminatory and preferential; (c) that the practice as to the Curtis Bay regulation was also amenable to the same criticism;(d) that the duty existed to take into account the individual cars, the foreign railway fuel cars, and the company fuel cars in making a pro rata division in case of car shortage, and that not to do so would give rise to undue preferences and unlawful discriminations forbidden by the act to regulate commerce. Concluding that the various subjects embraced in the complaint with which it thus dealt were all controlled by the act to regulate commerce, it was expressly decided that the right to rectify the wrongs by the issue of the writ of mandamus as prayed for was sanctioned by the twenty-third section of the act to regulate commerce, and the case was remanded to the court below, with directions to allow the writ of peremptory mandamus, in accordance with the opinion. 91 C. C. A. 147, 165 Fed. 113. The case is here upon error prosecuted by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad and the Fairmont Coal Companies.\n One of the assignments of error assails the correctness of the conclusion of the court below to the effect that, compatibly with the act to regulate commerce, there was power, under the circumstances disclosed by the record, to consider the subject-matters which were complained of, and to award the relief concerning them which was prayed. Indeed, the nature of the controversy and the relief which it requires is such that, even without the assigned error, to which we have referred, the question at the very threshold necessarily arises and commands our attention as to whether there was power in the courts, under the circumstances disclosed by the record, to grant the relief prayed consistently with the provisions of the act to regulate commerce, and to that subject we therefore at once come.\n To a consideration of this question it is essential to at once summarily and accurately fix the subject-matter of the alleged grievances and the precise character of the relief, required in order to remedy the evils complained of upon the \n\n[215 U.S. 481, 493]\n\u00a0\n assumption of their existence. As to the first, it is patent that the grievances involve acts of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, regulations adopted by that company, and alleged dealings by the other corporations, all of which, it is asserted, concern interstate commerce, and all of which, it is alleged, are in direct violation of the duty imposed upon the railroad company by the provisions of the act to regulate commerce. As to the second, in view of the nature and character of the acts assailed, of the prayer for relief which we have previously excerpted. and of the relief which the court below directed to be awarded, it is equally clear that a prohibition, by way of mandamus, against the act, is sought, and an order, by way of mandamus, was invoked and was allowed, which must operate, by judicial decree, upon all the numerous parties and various interests as a rule or regulation as to the matters complained of for the conduct of interstate commerce in the future. When the situation is thus defined we see no escape from the conclusion that the grievances complained of were primarily within the administrative competency of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and not subject to be judicially enforced; at least, until that body, clothed by the statute with authority on the subject, had been afforded, by a complaint made to it, the opportunity to exert its administrative functions.\n The controversy is controlled by the considerations which governed the ruling made in Texas & P. R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co. \n204 U.S. 426\n, 51 L. ed. 553, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 350, 9 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 1075. In that case suit was brought in a court of the state of Texas to recover, because of an exaction by a carrier, on an interstate shipment, of an alleged unreasonable rate, although the rate charged was that stated in the schedules duly filed and published in accordance with the act to regulate commerce. After great consideration, it was held that the relief prayed was inconsistent with the act to regulate commerce, since by that act the rates, as filed, were controlling until they had been declared to be unreasonable by the Interstate Commerce Commission on a complaint made to that body. It was pointed out that any other view would give \n\n[215 U.S. 481, 494]\n\u00a0\n rise to inextricable confusion, would create unjust preferences and undue discriminations, would frustrate the purposes of the act, and, in effect, cause the act to destroy itself. The ruling there made dealt with the provisions of the act as they existed prior to the amendments adopted in 1906, and when those amendments are considered they render, if possible, more imperative the construction given to the act by that ruling, since, by  4, as enacted by the amendment of June 29, 1906 [34 Stat. at L. 589, chap. 3591, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 1158] the Commission is empowered, indeed it is made its duty, in disposing of a complaint, not only to determine the legality of the practice alleged to give rise to an unjust preference or undue discrimination, and to forbid the same, but, moreover, to direct the practice to be followed as to such subject for a future period, not exceeding two years, with power in the Commission, if it finds reason to do so, to suspend, modify, or set aside the same, the order, however, to become operative without judicial action. In considering  4 in the case of Illinois C. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, just decided, it was pointed out that the effect of the section was to cause it to come to pass that courts, in determining whether an order of the Commission should be suspended or enjoined, were without power to invade the administrative functions vested in the Commission, and therefore could not set aside an order duly made on a mere exercise of judgment as to its wisdom or expediency. Under these circumstances it is apparent, as we have said, that these amendments add to the cogency of the reasoning which led to the conclusion in the Abilene Case, that the primary interference of the courts with the administrative functions of the Commission was wholly incompatible with the act to regulate commerce. This result is easily illustrated. A particular regulation of a carrier engaged in interstate commerce is assailed in the courts as unjustly preferential and discriminatory. Upon the facts found, the complaint is declared to be well founded. The administrative powers of the Commission are invoked concerning a regulation of like character upon a similar \n\n[215 U.S. 481, 495]\n\u00a0\n complaint. The Commission finds, from the evidence before it, that the regulation is not unjustly discriminatory. Which would prevail? If both, then discrimination and preference would result from the very prevalence of the two methods of procedure. If, on the contrary, the Commission was bound to follow the previous action of the courts, then it is apparent that its power to perform its administrative functions would be curtailed, if not destroyed. On the other hand, if the action of the Commission were to prevail, then the function exercised by the court would not have been judicial in character, since its final conclusion would be susceptible of being set aside by the action of a mere administrative body. That these illustrations are not imaginary is established not only by this record, but by the record in the case of the Illinois C. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission.\n We say this record, because, as has been pointed out, one of the questions which we would be called upon to decide if the merits were open is whether the court below was right in holding that if anything but the physical capacity of a mine was taken into consideration by a railroad company in rating the mine for car distribution in time of car shortage, the act to regulate commerce would be violated, and therefore the system adopted by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company was repugnant to the act, because it made not alone the physical capacity, but past shipments, factors to be considered. But the reports of the Interstate Commerce Commission show that, on a complaint made to that body on the subject of the system of mine rating of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, the Commission, before the decision of the circuit court of appeals in this case was announced, had expressly refused to hold that the system was either preferential or prejudicial within the act to regulate commerce. In that report, speaking of the Baltimore & Ohio system of mine rating, it was said (14 Inters. Com. Rep. p. 94): \n\n[215 U.S. 481, 496]\n\u00a0\n 'This method of rating mines was adopted by the defendant in 1902, after a careful examination of the various systems in force on other lines. It was intended as a compromise between ratings based on physical capacity only and ratings based on commercial capacity only.'\n And after elaborately weighing the matter, it was said (p. 95):\n'In combining the two systems, the defendant has adopted a middle ground, apparently upon the thought that neither the physical nor the commercial capacity is always a fair test. We are not prepared, on this record, to say that there is no force in that view, and that a system of mine rating based upon a combination of the physical and commercial capacities of the several mines does not more closely approximate the actual car requirements of the mines than a system based upon physical capacity only.'\n\n We say also the Illinois Central Case, since it is shown in that case that when the railroad company changed its regulations, presumably to have them conform to the administrative ruling made by the Commission in the Hocking Valley Case [12 Inters. Com. Rep. 398], such change was prevented from going into effect by an injunction issued by the circuit court of the United States for the northern district of Illinois in the Majestic Coal Co. Case [162 Fed. 810]. And when the Commission came to discharge its duty upon the complaint made to it in the Illinois Central Case, it was put to the alternative of either abdicating its administrative duties or making an order in violation of the injunction.\n And the destructive effect upon the system of regulation devised by the act to regulate commerce, which these illustrations show must be the result of construing that act as giving authority to the courts, without the preliminary action of the Commission, to consider and pass upon the administrative questions which the statute has primarily confided to that body, may be greatly multiplied. This is shown by the opinion of the Commission in the Baltimore & Ohio Case, to which we have already referred, where the decisions of \n\n[215 U.S. 481, 497]\n\u00a0\n other lower courts are referred to in conflict with the opinion of the court below in this case as to mine rating, and not in harmony with the views expressed by the Commission in the Baltimore & Ohio Case.\n The court below deemed that it was its duty to award to the coal company the relief by mandamus which was prayed, upon the theory that  10 of the act to regulate commerce [March 2, 1889, 25 Stat. at L. 862, chap. 382, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3172] rendered it imperative to do so, this conclusion being specially based upon the provision of that section authorizing the remedy of mandamus to compel carriers 'to furnish cars or other facilities for transportation for the party applying for the writ.'\n The section in question is as follows:\n'Sec. 10. That the circuit and district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction, upon the relation of any person or persons, firm or corporation, alleging such violation by a common carrier of any of the provisions of the act of which this is a supplement, and all acts amendatory thereof, as prevents the relator from having interstate traffic moved by said common carrier at the same rates as are charged, or upon terms or conditions as favorable as those given, by said common carrier for like traffic under similar conditions to any other shipper, to issue a writ or writs of mandamus against said common carrier, commanding such common carrier to move and transport the traffic, or to furnish cars or other facilities for transportation for the party applying for the writ: Provided, That if any question of fact as to the proper compensation to the common carrier for the service to be enforced by the writ is raised by the pleadings, the writ of peremptory mandamus may issue, notwithstanding such question of fact is undetermined, upon such terms as to security, payment of money into the court, or otherwise, as the court may think proper, pending the determination of the question of fact: Provided, that the remedy hereby given by writ of mandamus shall be cumulative, and shall not be held \n\n[215 U.S. 481, 498]\n\u00a0\n to exclude or interfere with other remedies provided by this act or the act to which it is a supplement.'\n\n That it is not necessary to point out that there is ample scope for giving effect to and applying the remedy embraced in  10, if that section be construed in harmony with the act of which it forms a part, and not as destructive of one of the main purposes of the act is, we think, obvious. It is to be observed that the section, besides empowering the use of the writ of mandamus to compel the furnishing of cars and other facilities for transportation, also authorizes the use of that writ for the purpose of compelling the movement of traffic 'at the same rates as are charged, or upon terms or conditions as favorable as those given, by said common carrier for like traffic under similar conditions to any other shipper.' As it was settled in the Abilene Case that the right to question in the courts the rates established in accordance with the act to regulate commerce without previous resort, by complaint, to the Commission, in order to determine their unreasonableness, would be destructive of the act, and therefore was not permissible, that ruling is equally applicable to the provision as to furnishing cars, contained in  10, which is here relied upon, But as we are required, for the determination of the case now before us, to consider the scope of the act to regulate commerce as now existing, as a result of the amendments of 1906, we shall not rest our conclusion alone upon the persuasive force, of the reasoning which constrained to the conclusion announced in the Abilene Case. Speaking generally, it is true to say that, prior to 1889, although the prohibitions of the act to regulate commerce as to preferences and discriminations were far-reaching, the mechanism provided by the statute for the enforcement of orders of the Commission on the subject, as well as those concerning a finding as to unreasonable rates, were deemed to be in many respects ineffective, or at least tardy in operation or unsatisfactory in prompt remedial results, and this because immediate effect was not given to the orders of the Commission, but the aid \n\n[215 U.S. 481, 499]\n\u00a0\n of judicial authority was required as a prerequisite for such result. Section 10, here relied upon, was not part of the original act, but, as we have said, was added thereto on March 2, 1889, for the obvious purpose of making the remedial processes of the act more speedy and efficacious. Now, it cannot in reason be questioned that among the purposes contemplated by the amendments adopted in 1906 was the curing of the presumed remedial inefficiency of the act by supplying efficient means for giving effect to the orders of the Commission, made in the exertion of the authority conferred upon that body. To that end, one of the amendments,  4, gives operative effect to the orders of the Commission without the sanction of previous judicial authority, and endows that body with the power, not only as to unreasonable rates, but as to practices found upon complaint to be unduly prejudicial and unjustly discriminatory, to correct the same by its order, which order should have effect within the period fixed in the statute, and, to enforce these provisions, penalties and forfeitures are provided. Sec. 5. It being demonstrable, as we have seen, that to give to  10 the broad meaning which the court below fixed to it would be to destroy or render inefficacious the remedial purposes of the amendments enacted in 1906, it must follow that such construction cannot be adopted, since to do so would compel us to hold that the wide and far-reaching remedies created by the amendments of 1906 were, in effect, destroyed by the narrower remedial processes which had been previously enacted in 1889. This conclusion being in reason impossible, it must follow that, construing the provisions of  10 in the light of and in harmony with the amendments adopted in 1906, the remedy afforded by that section, in the cases which it embraces, must be limited either to the performance of duties which are so plain and so independent of previous administrative action of the Commission as not to require a prerequisite exertion of power by that body, or to compelling the performance of duties which plainly arise from the \n\n[215 U.S. 481, 500]\n\u00a0\n obligatory force which the statute attaches to orders of the Commission, rendered within the lawful scope of its authority, until such orders are set aside by the Commission or enjoined by the courts.\n Nor is there anything in the contention that the decision in Southern R. Co. v. Tift, \n206 U.S. 428\n, 51 L. ed. 1124, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 709, 11 A . & E. Ann. Cas. 846, qualifies the ruling in the Abilene Case, and is an authority supporting the right to resort to the courts in advance of action by the Commission for relief against unreasonable rates or unjust discriminatory practices which, from their nature, primarily require action by the Commission. While it is true that the original bill in the Tift Case sought relief from alleged unreasonable rates before action by the Commission, yet, as said by this court (p. 437):\n'The circuit court granted no relief prejudicial to appellants on the original bill. It sent the parties to the Interstate Commerce Commission, where, upon sufficient pleadings, identical with those before the court, and upon testimony adduced upon the issues made, the decision was adverse to the appellants. This action of the Commission, with its findings and conclusions, was presented to the circuit court, and it was upon these, in effect, the decree of the court was rendered. There was no demurrer to that petition, and the testimony taken before the Commission was stipulated into the case, and the opinion of the court recites that, 'with equal meritorious purpose, counsel for the respective parties agreed that this would stand for and be the hearing for final decree in equity.\"\n\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals peals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the Circuit Court with directions to set aside its judgment, and enter judgment dismissing the petition.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Brewer dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.

WILLIAM OPENHYM & SONS(1910)\nNo. 71\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 322, 323]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edwin A. Krauthoff, Alexander New, Samuel Feller, Arthur Miller, and J. V. C. Karnes for appellant.\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 322, 324]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Benjamin N. Cardozo, I. J. Ringolsky, Morris J. Hirsch, and David I. White for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This appeal was taken to review the decree of the circuit court of appeals, reversing the disallowance of a debt due to \n\n[216 U.S. 322, 325]\n\u00a0\n Openhym & Sons as a preferential claim against the estate of Walkeen-Lewis Millinery Company (we shall call it the millinery company).\n A motion to dismiss is made on the ground that the question involved is not one which could be brought here on writ of error from the highest court of a state, and that no justice of this court has certified that a determination of the question is essential to a uniform construction of the bankrupt act throughout the United States.\n The facts, which we condense somewhat from the findings of the court of appeals, are, that the millinery company, then being in the millinery business at Kansas City, Missouri, obtained, by false representations of its liabilities, goods of the value of $3,125.70 from Openhym & Sons, of New York city. Subsequently, a suit was brought against the millinery company by another creditor, and a receiver was appointed of all its property. The receiver of the property forthwith took possession, and, under the orders of the court, continued its sale. A few days afterwards, certain other creditors of the millinery company filed a petition in the district court of the western district of Missouri, to have the company declared a bankrupt. Four days later, the company admitted its insolvency, and consented that it be declared a bankrupt.\n Openhym & Sons, the appellees, asserting that their goods had been obtained from them by the millinery company by false representations of its solvency, demanded possession of the goods from the state court's receiver. Possession was refused, and Openhym & Sons, having obtained from the state court permission to do so, brought an action of replevin against the receiver and the millinery company. 'Process was duly served on both defendants. In the execution of the replevin writ but $2,582.80 worth of the goods obtained from Openhym & Sons were found. The sheriff, in executing the writ, separated the goods so found from the remainder of the \n\n[216 U.S. 322, 326]\n\u00a0\n stock then in possession of the state court receiver, and took them into his own possession. The receiver thereupon gave a redelivery bond, resumed possession of the goods, put them back into the stock, and continued sales therefrom.'\n On September 23, 1905, the millinery company was adjudged a bankrupt. Before the date of the adjudication, no receiver had been appointed by the district court, and no order had been made affecting the property in the possession of the state court or the continuance of the sales thereof by the state court receiver. On the day of the adjudication of bankruptcy, Daniel F. Blake, appellant, was appointed receiver in bankruptcy, and was directed to apply to the state court for an order on its receiver for the possession of the property. He was further directed that, before taking possession, to request the state court to fix and determine the liabilities which its own receiver had incurred for the benefit of the estate. 'The order of direction to the receiver in bankruptcy contained this clause: 'The liabilities incurred by the said receiver appointed by the state court shall be assumed and paid by the receiver herein.\"\n On September 25, 1905, the state court stated the liabilities incurred by its receiver, and, in addition thereto, recited the proceedings in the replevin action brought by Openhym & Sons, and found that whatever liability had been incurred under the redelivery bond had been incurred for the benefit of the estate. The court then ordered the delivery of the property to the receiver in bankruptcy upon the conditions that the latter should assume and pay the liabilities recited and the liability arising under the redelivery bond. It was not shown what part of the goods in controversy actually passed into the possession of the receiver in bankruptcy, but it was shown that all of the stock remaining unsold, and all of the proceeds of sales by the state court receiver, largely in the form of customers' accounts, were, less expense of conducting the business, turned over to the receiver in bankruptcy. \n\n[216 U.S. 322, 327]\n\u00a0\n October 2, 1905, the receiver in bankruptcy sold all of the property of the millinery company; on the 13th, the receiver was selected as trustee; on the 27th, the district court ruled Openhym & Sons to show cause why they should not be enjoined from prosecuting the action of replevin, and temporarily enjoined them from doing so; December 1 the temporary injunction was made permanent.\n On December 10, 1905, a dividend upon the claims against the estate of the millinery company was declared, but its payment left the greater portion of the estate in the hands of the trustee. Up to that time, Openhym & Sons had not intervened and presented their claim for preferential payment but this fact had no effect upon the declaration of the dividend, and no creditor was prejudiced thereby.\n December 21, 1905, Openhym & Sons intervened and presented their claim for $2,582.80 as a preferred one. On March 24, 1906, it was found by the referee to be entitled to be allowed as such. Upon petition for review, the district court reversed the finding. Upon appeal, the circuit court of appeals substantially found the above facts, and reversed the decree of the district court, 87 C. C. A. 122, 157 Fed. 536.\n The conclusions of law of the circuit court of appeals were as follows:\n'1. There were sufficient grounds for a rescission of the sale by Openhym & Sons, the right of rescission was seasonably asserted, and the right was not impaired or destroyed by the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings against the vendee, who obtained the goods by fraud. The receiver and trustee in bankruptcy had no greater right or title to the goods in controversy than the bankrupt had.\n\n'2. It was competent for the bankruptcy court to permit the prosecution of the replevin action in the state court for the recovery of the goods. The continuance of such prosecution was lawful up to the time it was forbidden by the injunction of the bankruptcy court. The commencement and prosecution of that action, though subsequently enjoined, was avail- \n\n[216 U.S. 322, 328]\n\u00a0\n able to Openhym & Sons as an act of rescission, and the proceedings therein could properly be resorted to in ascertaining what part of the goods sued for was in the possession of the state court, and afterwards, with proceeds of sales, went into the possession of the bankruptcy court.\n\n'3. There was no such delay by Openhym & Sons in intervening in the bankruptcy proceedings as estopped them from asserting their right to a preferential claim for the value of their goods.\n\n'4. Openhym & Sons are entitled to an order that the trustee pay their claim out of funds in his hands before making further payments to general creditors.'\n\n The contention of appellee upon the motion is that the bankrupt law limits the right of appeal to two classes of cases, in neither of which, it is further contended, the case at bar falls: (1) where the amount in controversy exceeds a thousand dollars and the question involved is one that might have been taken on appeal or writ of error from the highest court of a state to the Supreme Court of the United States; (2) where a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States shall certify that the determination of the question involved is essential to a uniform construction of the act throughout the United States.\n The consideration of the second ground we can immediately dismiss, as there is no such certificate. Of the other, or first ground, it is urged that Chapman v. Bowen, \n207 U.S. 89\n, 52 L. ed. 116, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 32, is decisive. In that case the facts were that there was borrowed from Bowen, on two different occasions, the sum of $5,000, for which two promissory notes were given, signed by the firm of A. McCoy & Company and by the individual names of Alfred McCoy and Thomas McCoy, the proceeds of the transactions going into the partnership business. The firm and the individuals became bankrupt, and the notes were presented as claims against the firm, and allowed to the extent of 30 per cent. A claim was presented for the balance against the estate of Alfred McCoy, and dis- \n\n[216 U.S. 322, 329]\n\u00a0\n allowed by the referee, whose decision was affirmed by the district court. The decision was reversed by the circuit court of appeals, 80 C. C A. 60, 150 Fed. 106. An appeal was allowed to this court by a judge of the circuit court of appeals, which, on motion, was dismissed, on the ground that a writ of error from the highest court of the state to this court could not be maintained, because no validity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under, the United States, was drawn in question; nor the validity of a statute of, or any authority exercised under, any state, on the ground of repugnancy to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States; nor was any treaty, right, privilege, or immunity claimed under the Constitution or any treaty or statute or commission held or authority exercised under the United States, and decided against it. It was further said that 'the decision below proceeded on wellsettled principles of general law, broad enough to sustain it without reference to provisions of the bankruptcy act.'\n We think that case controls this, and that the cases cited by appellant, of which this court took jurisdiction, are not apposite. The determining facts in the case at bar are that the goods were obtained by the millinery company by fraud, and that the sale was seasonably rescinded on that ground. In the decision of this there was involved no provision of the bankruptcy law. Nor is any provision of the bankruptcy law involved in the consideration of the question whether the goods turned over by the state court to the receiver in bankruptcy could be identified as the goods obtained from Openhym & Sons. Surely, as decided by the court of appeals, the proceedings in the state court 'could properly be resorted to in ascertaining what part of the goods sued for was in the possession of the state court, and afterwards what proceeds of sales went into possession of the bankruptcy court.' To these facts must be added the important one that the goods were ordered by the state court to be delivered to the receiver in bankruptcy upon the express condition, and they were \n\n[216 U.S. 322, 330]\n\u00a0\n received by him subject to the condition, that he should assume and pay the liabilities incurred in that court, that court finding 'that whatever liability was incurred under the redelivery bond was incurred for the benefit of the estate.'\n It was from these facts that the court of appeals concluded that Openhym & Sons were 'entitled to an order that the trustee pay their claims out of funds in his hands before making further payments to general creditors.' In this conclusion we cannot see that any provision of the bankruptcy law was involved, so that, if the decision had been made by a state court, it would have been reviewable here on writ of error.\n It is the contention of appellant, however, that the writ of replevin brought by Openhym & Sons and the levy under it 'were unlawful and unauthorized acts,' and that Openhym & Sons 'could not, and did not, conserve any rights thereby.' And, further, the appellant says, 'it will be observed at the outset that this question goes directly to the jurisdicton of the bankruptcy court over the res of the bankrupt after the filing of the involuntary petition in bankruptcy.'\n Putting it another way, appellant says that 'the question in the case is as to the force and effect of a proceeding in bankruptcy followed by a subsequent petition in replevin.' And it is insisted that the result reached by the court of appeals 'depended upon the force and effect given to the action in replevin,' and that, therefore, a Federal question is presented. This, however, proceeds from a misapprehension of the opinion of the court of appeals. The paramount jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court was conceded. The replevin suit was considered as showing the purpose of Openhym & Sons to rescind the sale of the goods and as a means of their identification, as we have already pointed out. In holding it competent for those purposes we cannot see how any provision of the bankrupt law was involved.\n The motion to dismiss must therefore be granted.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","12":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOARD OF ASSESSORS OF THE PARISH OF ORLEANS v. NEW YORK LIFE INS(1910)\nNo. 112\nArgued: January 27, 1910Decided: February 28, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. George H. Terriberry, H. Garland land Dupre, and Harry P. Sneed for appellants.[ Bd. of Assr. of the Parish of Orleans v. New York Life Ins Co. \n216 U.S. 517\n (1910) ]\n\n\n[216 U.S. 517, 520]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James H. McIntosh, Charles S. Rice, and Richard B. Montgomery for appellee.\n\n\n[216 U.S. 517, 521]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill in equity to restrain the collection of a tax from the plaintiff, the appellee, on the ground that the tax is contrary to the 14th Amendment. The plaintiff had a decree and the defendants appeal to this court. 158 Fed. 462. The tax is based upon an assessment of the plaintiff for credits amounting to $568,900, whereas the plaintiff says that it has no credits in the state; and for money on deposit, distinct from what the plaintiff admits to be taxable, amounting to $50,700. There is no dispute about the facts, and the issue as to each sum is upon matter of law.\n The so-called credits arise out of transactions denominated policy loans and premium lien note loans, which are explained at length by the judge below, but which may be summed up more shortly here. When the plaintiff's policies have run a certain length of time and the premiums have been paid as due, the plaintiff becomes bound ultimately to pay what is called their reserve value, whether the payment of premiums is kept up or not; and this reserve value increases as the payments of premiums go on. A policy holder desiring to keep his policy on foot, and yet to profit by the reserve value that it has acquired, may be allowed, at the plaintiff's \n\n[216 U.S. 517, 522]\n\u00a0\n discretion, to receive a sum not exceeding that present value, on the terms that, on the settlement of any claim under the policy, the sum so received shall be deducted with interest (the interest representing what it is estimated that the sum would have earned if retained by the plaintiff); and that, on failure to pay any premium or the above-mentioned interest, the sum received shall be deducted from the reserve value at once.\n This is called a loan. It is represented by what is called a note, which contains a promise to pay the money. But as the plaintiff never advances more than it already is absolutely bound for under the policy, it has no interest in creating a personal liability, and therefore the contract on the face of the note goes on to provide that if the note is not paid when due, it shall be extinguished automatically by the counter credit for what we have called the reserve value of the policy. In short, the claim of the policy holder on the one side and of the company on the other are brought into an account current by the very act that creates the latter. The socalled liability of the policy holder never exists as a personal liability, it never is a debt, but is merely a deduction in account from the sum that the plaintiffs ultimately must pay. In settling that account, interest will be computed on the item for the reason that we have mentioned; but the item never could be sued for, any more than any other single item of a mutual account that always shows a balance against the would-be plaintiff. In form it subsists as an item until the settlement, because interest must be charged on it. In substance it is extinct from the beginning, because, as was said by the judge below, it is a payment, not a loan. A collateral illustration of the principle will be found in Starratt v. Mullen, 148 Mass. 570, 2 L.R.A. 697, 20 N. E. 178, and cases there cited.\n Instead of receiving an advance, the policy holder may draw upon the reserve value for a premium due, again giving a note; but the transaction is similar in legal characteristics to that which we have described. It is unnecessary to set out the documents at length, because, although the same language \n\n[216 U.S. 517, 523]\n\u00a0\n is not used in all, there is no nice question of construction, no doubt possible as to the effect and import of the contracts. In none of the cases is there a loan, and therefore there are no credits to be taxed. In Metropolitan L. Ins. Co. v. New Orleans, \n205 U.S. 395\n, 51 L. ed. 853, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 499, so far as appeared, the insurance company made loans, properly so called, to its policy holders, and the question now before the court was not raised or discussed.\n What we have said disposes of the item of $568,900. The other consists of a bank account of $50,700, kept separate from a small account for current expenses, admitted to be taxable. The account in question consists of deposits made solely for transmission to New York, and not used or drawn against by anyone in Louisiana. We shall not inquire whether it would or would not be within the constitutional possibilities for a state to tax a person outside its jurisdiction for a bank deposit that only became his or came into existence as property at the moment of beginning a transit to him, and that thereafter left the state forthwith. It is enough to say we should not readily believe that the supreme court of the state would interpret the statutes of Louisiana as having that intent. See State, metropolitan L. Ins. Co., Prosecutor, v. Newark, 62 N. J. L. 74, 40 Atl. 573. The Louisiana cases cited as contrary, and as showing the purpose of the legislature to reach such a deposit as this, do not seem to us to sustain the appellant's point. Bluefields Banana Co. v. Board of Assessors, 49 La. Ann. 43, 21 So. 627; Parker v. Strauss, 49 La. Ann. 1173, 22 So. 329. The statute purports to levy a tax upon all property within the state, and enumerates different kinds. Act 170 of 1898. We see no indication that it intended to include under that head property that becomes such only to leave the state at once.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Brewer dissents, believing that the case is controlled by the decision in Metropolitan L. Ins. Co. v. New Orleans, \n205 U.S. 395\n, 51 L. ed. 853, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 499. \n\n\n\n","13":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOSTON CHAMBER OF COMMERCE v.

The chamber of commerce had a building at the base of the triangle, and owned the fee of the land taken. The Central Wharf & Wet Dock Corporation, which owned other land abutting on the new street, had an easement of way, light, and air over the land in question, and the Boston Five Cents Savings Bank held a mortgage on the same, subject to the easement. These three were the only parties having any interests in the land. They filed an agreement in the case that the damages might be assessed in a lump sum, the city of Boston refusing to assent, and they contended that it was their right, as matter of law, under the Massachusetts statute, Rev. Laws chap. 48,  20-22, and the 14th Amendment, to recover the full value of the land taken, considered as an unrestricted fee. The city, on the other hand, offered to show that the restriction being of great value to the Central Wharf & Wet Dock Corporation, the damage to the market value of the estate of the chamber of commerce was little or nothing, and contended that the damages must be assessed according to the condition of the title at act date of the order laying out the street. It contended that the jury could consider the improbability of the easement being released, as it might affect the mind of a possible purchaser of the servient estate, and that the dominant owner could recover nothing, as it lost nothing by the superposition of a public easement upon its own. The parties agreed that if the petitioners were right, the damages should be assessed at $60,000, without interest; but, if the city was right, they should be $5,000. The judge before whom the case was tried ruled in favor of the city, and this ruling was sustained by the supreme \n\n[217 U.S. 189, 194]\n\u00a0\n judicial court, upon report. 195 Mass. 338, 81 N. E. 244. A judgment was entered in the court where the record remained, and then the case was brought here.\n We assume in favor of the petitioners, the plaintiffs in error, that their only remedy was under the statute; and we give them the benefit of the doubt in interpreting the decision of the court, so far as to take it to mean that the statutes of Massachusets authorize the taking of land held as this was, with no other compensation than according to the principle laid down. In short, we assume in their favor that the constitutional question is open, and that the case properly is not to be dismissed. But we are of opinion that upon the only possible question before us here the decision was right.\n Of course, we accept the construction given to the Massachusetts statute by the state court. Maiorano v. Baltimore & O. R. Co. \n213 \nU.S. 268, 272\n, 53 S. L. ed. 792, 795, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 424. The only question to be considered is whether, when a man's land is taken, he is entitled, by the 14th Amendment, to recover more than the value of it as it stood at the time. For it is to be observed that the petitioners did not merely contend that they were entitled to have the jury consider the chance of getting a release, for whatever it might add to the market value of the land, as the city merely contended that the jury should consider the chance of not getting one. The petitioners contended that they had a right, as matter of law, under the Constitution, after the taking was complete and all rights were fixed, to obtain the connivance or concurrence of the dominant owner, and by means of that to enlarge a recovery that otherwise would be limited to a relatively small sum. It might be perfectly clear that the dominant owner never would have released short of a purchase of the dominant estate,-in other words, that the servitude must have been maintained in the interest of lands not before the court,-but still, according to the contention, by a simple joinder of parties after the taking, the city could be made to pay for a loss of theoretical creaton, suffered by no one in fact,\n The statement of the contention seems to us to be enough. \n\n[217 U.S. 189, 195]\n\u00a0\n It is true that the mere mode of occupation does not necessarily limit the right of an owner's recovery. Mississippi & R. River Boom Co. v. Patterson, \n98 \nU.S. 403, 408\n, 25 S. L. ed. 206, 208; Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Barber Asphalt Pav. Co. \n197 \nU.S. 430, 435\n, 49 S. L. ed. 819, 822, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 466. But the Constitution does not require a disregard of the mode of ownership,-of the state of the title. It does not require a parcel of land to be valued as an unencumbered whole when it is not held as an unencumbered whole. It merely requires that an owner of property taken should be paid for what is taken from him. It deals with persons, not with tracts of land. And the question is, What has the owner lost? not, What has the taker gained? We regard it as entirely plain that the petitioners were not entitled, as matter of law, to have the damages estimated as if the land was the sole property of one owner, and therefore are not entitled to $60,000 under their agreement. See Bartlett v. Bangor, 67 Me. 460, 468; Walker v. Manchester, 58 N. H. 438, 441; Gamble v. Philadelphia, 162 Pa. 413, 29 Atl. 739; Re Adams, 141 N. Y. 297, 36 N. E. 318; Olean v. Steyner, 135 N. Y. 341, 346, 17 L.R.A. 640, 32 N. E. 9; Crowell v. Beverly, 134 Mass. 98. There is some subordinate criticism under the alternative agreement, giving them only $5,000. It is noticed that this was conditioned upon the petitioners not being entitled, as just stated, and upon the admissibility of the evidence offered by the city, and upon the substantial correctness of the requests for rulings; and it is said that the evidence was not admissible. It seems to us that the worst objection to it was that it was offered to prove the obvious. But, taking the agreement fairly, we think it meant only to contrast broadly the position of the two sides, and made the result depend upon which was right.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","14":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBRADY v.

This plea was demurred to and the demurrer sustained by the court. The case then proceeded to trial, and the jury found him guilty of murder, whereupon he was sentenced to life imprisonment. He moved for new trial, which motion was overruled, and thereupon he appealed to the supreme court of the state of Georgia, which affirmed the judgment of the lower court. 132 Ga. 573, 22 L.R.A.(N.S.) 959, 64 S.

The suit is brought against a party that is alleged to have used the patented device, but it is defended by the Peckham Manufacturing Company, the vendor, which is a successor by purchase to the Peckham Motor Truck & Wheel Company. The principal claim now relied upon was declared void in North Jersey Street R. Co. v. Brill, 67 C. C. A. 380, 134 Fed. 580, reversing the decision of the circuit court, 124 Fed. 778, 125 Fed. 526, a suit brought by the same plaintiff, and said to have been defended by the Peckham Motor & Truck Company. (On the authority of that case a preliminary injunction against the present defendant was refused in 68 C. C. A. 486, 135 Fed. 784.) If the first Peckham Company was privy to the decree declaring the patent void, there would be great force in the argument that that decree established, as against the plaintiff, the right of the Peckham Manufacturing Company to make and sell the patented article, and that the right ought to be recognized in a suit against its customer, defended by it. Kessler v. Eldred, \n206 U.S. 285\n, 288, \n\n[215 U.S. 527, 529]\n\u00a0\n 289, 51 L. ed. 1065, 1067, 1068, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 611. It is unnecessary to decide that question, because the formal proofs are wanting; but, on the obvious facts, we should be unwilling to come to a different conclusion from that reached in the earlier litigation and again in the present suit, unless it was impossible to avoid the result. With these preliminaries we proceed to the merits of the case.\n The present form of car used on the electric street railways is a long car, resting by pivots upon two four-wheeled trucks. The plaintiff makes a truck of this sort and has a parent and a divisional patent for 'Improvements in Car Trucks for Motor Propulsion and the Like,' dated June 27, 1899, and numbered respectively 627,898 and 627, 900. The arrangement in actual use may be described as follows, nearly in the plaintiff's words: The side frames are connected near the middle by two parallel metal crosspieces or transoms, having space enough between them to allow another parallel piece, called the bolster, to move vertically, occupying the space between with but slight play. The car body rests on a pivot in the middle of the bolster. The ends of the bolster rest on the top of semielliptic springs parallel to and below the sides of the truck. The ends of the springs in their turn rest on two spring links hanging from the sides of the truck, near the axles. More specifically, they are supported on the bottom of metal bands or stirrups which surround and hang by their tops on spiral springs each of which is attached underneath to a metal bolt running up through its middle and connected at the top with the frame of the truck by a ball-and-socket joint. That is to say, the pin passes up through the frame, in which is a conoidal aperture to give it play in all directions, and the head of the pin is hemispherical, seated in a like recess in the frame.\n The claims relied upon are the following: In number 627,898, the parent patent,\n'13. The combination in a car truck of the side frames, the semielliptic springs movably and resiliently suspended from the side frames, and a bolster secured to said springs, substantially as described.' \n\n[215 U.S. 527, 530]\n\u00a0\n\n'81. The combination in a car truck of the side frames, the semielliptic springs, a cross bolster resting on the semielliptic springs, links, and springs combined with said links, said links deriving their support from the side frames, and connecting the ends of the semielliptic springs with the side frames, substantially as described.'\n\n\n In 627,900, the divisional patent,\n'13. In a car truck, the combination with the side frames of the links comprising bolts pivoted between their ends, said links being pivotally suspended from the side frames, longitudinally-disposed semielliptic springs secured to the lower end of said bolts, a cross bolster resting on said springs, and further springs included in the link suspension of said semielliptic springs, substantially as described.\n\n'14. In a car truck, the combination with the side frames of the cross bolster suspended below the side frames by semielliptic springs and pivotal links, said links comprising a plurality of sections pivotally secured together, and further springs combined with said links to elastically suspend said semielliptic springs from the side frames, substantially as described.\n\n'15. In a car truck, the combination with the side frames of the cross bolster suspended below the side frames by semielliptic springs and articulated and pivotal links, said links comprising a plurality of sections pivotally secured together, and spiral springs about and combined with said links to elastically suspend said semielliptic springs from the side frames, substantially as described.'\n\n'17. The combination in a car truck having an upper chord, of the longitudinally-disposed semielliptic springs, a transverse bolster supported upon said springs, links depending from and flexibly supported on said upper chord and passing through enlarged apertures therein, said links being articulated between their ends, the ends of the semielliptic springs being supported upon the lower articulation of said links, substantially as described.' \n\n[215 U.S. 527, 531]\n\u00a0\n The parent patent contains the following disclaimer:\n\n'The location of the semielliptic springs outside of the wheel gage on each side of the truck, together with the location of the links for supporting the semielliptics closely adjacent to the axle boxes, and the swinging of said springs from the truck frame from such points, gives a better support for the car body than does the usual link-hung bolster supported from the truck transoms within the wheel gage. These general features of construction, however, are embraced in an application filed by Samuel M. Curwen and myself on the 3d of November, 1896, Serial No. 610, 902, and therefore I do not claim the same herein.'\n\n The answer denies the validity of the patents, setting up a large number of earlier ones, and also denies infringement. There was a trial in the supreme court of the District, upon which a decree was rendered dismissing the bill. The decree was affirmed by the court of appeals, 30 App. D. C. 255, and an appeal was taken to this court.\n It is difficult to put one's finger with certainty upon what the plaintiff claims. It certainly is not the total combination of a successful truck. Mr. Bill, the inventor and the plaintiff's assignor, is pictured as playing a large part in the development of street railway trucks, but whether that be true or not, his share in the invention of the truck that we have described, so far as the present patent, at least, is concerned, must be at best but very small. It is insisted to be sure, that the case is not affected by inventions for use with steam railroad cars, because of the different requirements upon street roads. Cars for the latter use must be low hung to make getting in and out easy, must accommodate the motors hung upon the axles, must be adapted to short curves, and so forth. But these differences are not of universal effect; indeed, this patent is not confined to street cars. The suspension of the car body upon a semielliptic spring hung from the side frame of the truck by a jointed hanger, with most of the characteristics of the present patent, as disclosed in a patent to Thyng in 1845, was \n\n[215 U.S. 527, 532]\n\u00a0\n obviously as available for street as for steam railways, and the use of these features by Brill was not a patentable invention. The use, on the modern long car, of two four-wheeled pivotal trucks with a short wheel base and wheels of equal diameter, which support the car body by a pivot on a bolster between the axles, resting on semielliptic springs, was not peculiar to Brill. It was described in a patent to Taylor, October 31, 1895, No. 507,855. Brill's specification disclaims at the outset the general features of the truck it describes. Indeed, it hardly is denied that every element in the combination was well known in the construction of railway cars.\n We are not dealing with a new type of trucks, but with certain features only. At the argument it was admitted that the plaintiff's case must stand or fall on claim 13 of No. 627,898. In that claim the only possible element of novelty is the mode in which the semielliptic springs are suspended from the side frames. In practice the links are elastic and the pins on which the whole combination hangs have a universal ball-and- socket movement, although the claim only says 'movably and resiliently suspended . . . substantially as described.' Neither 'movably' nor 'resiliently' indicates the ball-and-socket arrangement, but it is described in the specification, and we give the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt. We agree, however, with the circuit court of appeals, that the substitution of a ball-and-socket movement for the movement in one direction of the Thyng link, coupled, as it was, with a slight longitudinal play, required a minimum of invention. A link having universal movement was patented by Beach in 1876. The plaintiff's witness, Akarman, says that there always has been provision made for lateral and longitudinal motion in every well-constructed truck. Spring links to support semielliptic springs were old; it is unnecessary to recite the patents in which they appear. The mention of 'the usual link-hung bolster' in the disclaimer indicates the indisputable fact. We also agree with the other court that the disclaimer in favor of Brill and Curwen is a solemn admission of the priority of the \n\n[215 U.S. 527, 533]\n\u00a0\n devices claimed by them. It certainly covers the collocation of the spring links and semielliptic springs. One of the claims of Brill and Curwen is: '12. The combination in a car truck of the side frames, the equalizing- bars movably and resiliently suspended from the side frames, and a bolster supported on said equalizing-bars, substantially as described.' It is said that the Brill patent did not follow the Thyng invention for more than fifty years. The answer is that for most of that time it was not wanted. Very soon after the change in street railway travel required it, it came.\n If the plaintiff's claim could be sustained, which we cannot admit, it would be confined to the specific form of link described. There would be little room for the doctrine of equivalents. The defendant's device does not use a ball and socket, but uses a rigid link supported by a relatively unyielding spiral spring in the frame of the truck, and does not infringe the very narrow claim which is the most that, in any view, could be allowed.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McKenna dissents. \n\n\n\n","17":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBROWN-FORMAN CO. v. COM. OF KENTUCKY(1910)\n\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 563, 564]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Levi Cooke, W. M. Hough, A. B. Hayes, and Hough, Hough, & Walker for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 563, 567]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James S. Morris, James Breathitt, and Charles H. Morris for defendant in error.\n\n\n[217 U.S. 563, 568]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Lurton delivered the opinion of the court:\n The commonwealth of Kentucky instituted this proceeding to collect an occupation tax imposed by an act of the general assembly of that state of March 28, 1906, \n\n[217 U.S. 563, 569]\n\u00a0\n whereby every corporation or person engaged in the state 'in the business or occupation of compounding, rectifying, adulterating, or blending distilled spirits' is required to pay 'a license tax of 1 1\/4 cent upon every wine gallon of such compounded, rectified, blended, or adulterated distilled spirits.' The defenses presented were, first, that the plaintiff in error had paid the tax due for the rectification of 'single-stamp spirits,' and that the act does not cover 'double-stamp spirits,' used as a basis for its operations; second, that the act was requgnant to the Constitution of the state; and, third, that the act is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, in that it is a regulation of interstate commerce, and operates as a denial of the equal protection of the law. The questions concerning the validity of the act under the state Constitution, and as to the liability of the plaintiff in error under the act as construed and enforced by the highest court of Kentucky, may be laid on one side, for the only contentions which concern us under this writ of error to the state court are those which arise under the Constitution of the United States.\n The two sections of the act which need be examined are the first and seventh, which are set out in the margin. \n Sec. 1. Every corporation, association, company, copartnership, or individual engaged in this state in the business or occupation of compounding, rectifying, adulterating, or blending distilled spirits, known and designated as single-stamp spirits, shall pay to the commonwealth of Kentucky a license tax of 1 1\/4 cent upon every wine gallon of such compounded, rectified, blended, or adulterated distilled spirits.\n Sec. 7. Any corporation, association, company, copartnership, or individual who shall ship any compounded, rectified, blended, or adulterated distilled spirits, known and designated as single-stamp spirits, into this state, for the purpose of labeling, branding, marking, or stamping the same as Kentucky whisky, product or spirits, or which, before shipment into this state, shall have been, or may thereafter be, labeled, branded, marked, or stamped as Kentucky whisky, product or spirits, shall be deemed compounders, rectifiers, blenders, or adulterators under the provisions of this act, and shall pay the license tax imposed herein on compounders, rectifiers, blenders, or adulterators of such spirts in this state, and shall make the report required herein to the auditor of public accounts. Any corporation, association, company, copartnership, or individual who shall violate this section of this act shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and fined in any sum not less than $500 nor more than $1,000. Each shipment shall be deemed a separate offense. The Franklin circuit court shall have jurisdiction of all offenses committed under this act. \n\n[217 U.S. 563, 570]\n\u00a0\n The other sections provide for reports, and impose penalties for delinquencies in reporting or paying.\n It is said that the 7th section of the act imposes a license tax upon the business of shipping into the state of goods like those made by the plaintiff in error, when deceptively marked or labeled 'as Kentucky whisky,' or intended to be so deceptively branded or labeled when received in the state; and that such a burden is illegal as a regulation of interstate commerce. But as plaintiff in error concedes that it is not engaged in bringing into the state spirits deceptively marked as a Kentucky product, nor intended to be so branded, and has not been proceeded against under that section, it is clear, the section being a separable provision, that we need not deal with either of these objections, save only as the presence of that section in the act may have a bearing upon the question of discrimination between the domestic and foreign product, which is the real question in the case.\n The question upon which the case must turn comes to this: Has the state denied to the plaintiff in error the equal protection of the law, guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, by the imposition of the tax provided under the 1st section of the act? It is urged that that section falls under the condemnation of the provision of the Federal Constitution, because, to quote from the brief of counsel, it 'creates an unjust discrimination against \n\n[217 U.S. 563, 571]\n\u00a0\n Kentucky rectifiers and blenders included within the provisions of the act, in favor of the three other classes engaged in the same business, to wit: ( 1) Kentucky distillers who vend unrectified and unblended spirits; (2) distillers of other states or countries who vend in Kentucky unrectified and unblended spirits; and (3) rectifiers and blenders of other states or countries who vend in Kentucky untaxed rectified or blended spirits, in direct competition with the spirits of Kentucky rectifiers or blenders, subject to the tax.'\n It has been urged that the tax is not imposed as a license upon the doing of business, but is laid upon the goods produced, and is therefore arbitrary and discriminatory as one not imposed upon all other like kinds of liquor, whether produced in or out of the state. This contention, if good, would only carry the case back to the underlying objection that the classification is arbitrary and unreasonable, and therefore void, as denying the equal protection of the law,-a question which at last must be answered, whether the tax be an occupation or a property tax. But the Kentucky court of appeals has construed the act as not a property tax, but as one imposing a license or occupation tax upon the business. Speaking by Judge Hobson, the Kentucky court of appeals said: 'A license tax is imposed. The amount of the license tax is determined by the amount of spirits produced. The tax is not upon the spirits. It is a license tax upon the business. To hold it a tax upon the property, we must disregard the word 'license' in both the title and the body of the act. That a license tax was contemplated is also shown by  3, which requires that notice shall be given to the auditor, stating certain facts, before the business shall be engaged in; by  4, that upon such notice the auditor shall thereupon issue to each applicant a certificate showing that he has complied with the act, and by  5, that upon the payment of the license tax to the \n\n[217 U.S. 563, 572]\n\u00a0\n treasurer, the auditor shall issue to such persons authority to continue in the business, if such authority is desired. Under the statute, a man may not legally engage in the business without giving the notice and having the certificate from the auditor. The payment of the tax at the times required by the statute is the condition upon which authority to continue in the business is made to depend. This is manifestly a tax on the business, and not upon the property. The amount of the tax is simply regulated by the amount of the product, but it is a license tax upon the business. To hold otherwise would be to say that the legislature cannot impose a graduated license tax based upon the amount of product manufactured.' [125 Ky. 414, 101 S. W. 323.] Such a construction and interpretation of the statute here involved, by the highest court of the state, should be accepted as definitely determining that the tax complained of is not a property tax, but a license tax imposed upon the doing of a particular business plainly subject to the regulating power of the state.\n We come, then, to the question as to whether this act makes an arbitrary and illegal discrimination in favor of other persons or corporations engaged in the same business. The question is at last one of classification of subjects, trades, or pursuits, for the purpose of taxation, and concerns the power of the states to exercise discretion in the methods, subjects, and rates of taxation. Fundamental to the very existence of the governmental power of the states as is this function of taxation, it is nevertheless subject to the beneficent restriction that it shall not be so exercised as to deny to any the equal protection of the law. But this restriction does not compel the adoption of 'an iron rule of equal taxation,' nor prevent variety in methods of taxation, or discretion in the selection of subjects, or classification for purposes of taxation of either properties, businesses, trades, callings, or occupations. This much has been over and over announced by this court. \n\n[217 U.S. 563, 573]\n\u00a0\n Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 U.S. 232\n, 33 L. ed. 892, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 533; W. W.

Texas, \n217 U.S. 114\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 496.\n The answer of the plaintiff in error concedes that it is 'doing business in this state, and engaged in the business or occupation of compounding, rectifying, adulterating, or blending distilled spirits, known and designated as single-stamp spirits.' Plaintiff in error now says that it has been arbitrarily singled out and its business or occupation taxed, thereby discriminating in favor of 'three other classes engaged in the same business.' The first class which is named as favored are distillers who neither rectify, compound, adulterate, nor blend their products. Manifestly there is nothing capricious in putting the occupation carried on by the plaintiff in error in a class distinct from that of the whisky distillers whose straight product is the basis for the manipulated product of those engaged in the taxed business. A very wide discretion must be conceded to the legislative power of the state in the classification of trades, callings, businesses, or occupations which may be subjected to special forms of regulation or taxation through an excise or license tax. If the selection or classification is neither capricious nor arbitrary, and rests upon some reasonable consideration of difference or policy, there is no denial of the equal protection of the law. The reasons for discriminating between distillers and rectifiers is not obscure, and a classification which includes one and omits the other is by no means arbitrary or unreasonable. In American Sugar Ref. Co. v. Louisiana, cited above, a license tax imposed upon the business of refining sugar and molasses was sustained, although planters grinding and refining their own sugar were excluded. In W. W. Cargill Co. v. Minnesota, \n180 \nU.S. 452, 469\n, 45 S. L. ed. 619, 627, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 423, 429, a state statute requiring elevator com- \n\n[217 U.S. 563, 574]\n\u00a0\n panies operating elevators situated upon railway rights of way to take out a license, without requiring those not so situated to do so, was held not to be an illegal discrimination. This court there said, in reference to the insistence that the discrimination was a denial of the equal protection of the law, that 'no such judgment could be properly rendered unless the classification was merely arbitrary, or was devoid of those elements that are inherent in the distinction implied in classification. We cannot perceive that the requirement of a license is not based upon some reasonable ground,-some difference that bears a proper relation to the classification made by the statute.' In Williams v. Arkansas, cited above, a classification in a state statute which prohibited drumming on trains for business for any hotel, lodging house, bath house, physicians, etc., was sustained as not a capricious classification, although it did not apply to drumming for other business not mentioned, but distinguishable by reason of local conditions. In Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, supra, it was held that an occupation tax on all wholesale dealers in certain articles did not deny to the class taxed the equal protection of the law because a similar occupation tax was not imposed on wholesale dealers in other articles.\n It is next said that 'distillers of other states and countries who vend in Kentucky unrectified and unblended spirits' are untouched by the law. This is answered by what we have said as to such distillers manufacturing within the state, as well as by the obviousness of the fact that the state of Kentucky had no more right to impose an occupation tax upon a business conducted outside of the state than it had to lay a property tax upon property outside of the state.\n Finally, it is said that 'rectifiers and blenders of other states or countries who vend in Kentucky untaxed rectified or blended spirits, in direct competition with the \n\n[217 U.S. 563, 575]\n\u00a0\n spirits of Kentucky rectifiers or blenders, are not subject to the tax.'\n The contention comes to this: A state may not impose a tax upon the privilege of carrying on a particular business or occupation in the state, unless it can impose a similar tax upon the same business or occupation carried on outside of the state, if the latter may, through interstate commerce, compete by shipments into the state with the product of the taxed resident. A system of taxation discriminating in favor of residents and domestic products, and against nonresidents and foreign products, might result in commercial nonintercourse between the states, and as a regulation of interstate commerce would clearly be invalid. The objection, however, would not apply to a uniform tax upon goods which does not discriminate in favor of residents or products of the state. Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall. 123, 19 L. ed. 382; Hinson v. Lott, 8 Wall. 148, 19 L. ed. 387; Emert v. Missouri, \n156 U.S. 296\n, 39 L. ed. 430, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 68, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 367.\n There is no pretense here that there has been any discrimination in favor of either the residents or the products of Kentucky, but the reverse, in that the resident rectifier is discriminated against because the product of the untaxed nonresident rectifier meets those of the taxed rectifier in competition for the trade of Kentucky. But counsel say that discrimination against residents or products of the state is as much a denial of the equal protection of the law as any other method of unequal taxation, and cite State v. Hoyt, 71 Vt. 59, 64, 42 Atl. 973. That was a case involving the validity of a license tax by the state of Vermont upon peddlers of goods, 'the manufacture of this state.' The Vermont court held that when a business consists in selling goods, the exaction of a license for its pursuit was in effect a tax upon the goods themselves; and that as this tax discriminated arbitrarily against the products of the state, it was void, as denying the equal protection of the law. But the ground of \n\n[217 U.S. 563, 576]\n\u00a0\n the decision was that the discrimination against the goods of the state, and in favor of the products of other states, both classes of goods being within and subject to the taxing power of the state, was an illegal discrimination, as arbitrary and capricious. The court said:\n'The question, therefore, is one of classification. If, in the case supposed, the resident and the nonresident manufacturer or their goods can be differently classed, the statute can be sustained; otherwise not. The rule on this subject is, that the mere fact of classification is not enough to exempt a statute from the operation of the equality clause of said Amendment, but that in all cases it must appear, not only that a classification has been made, but that it is one based on some reasonable ground,-some difference that bears a just and proper relation to the attempted classification, and is not a mere arbitrary selection. Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Ellis, \n165 U.S. 150\n, 41 L. ed. 666, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 255.'\n\n The case has no bearing upon the present case. In that case, the license might have been exacted from one peddling in Vermont, whether he peddled domestic or foreign goods. Here the exaction is not upon the product at all, but upon the business of producing the product in the state. The same business carried on beyond the state could not have been subjected to a like tax. There has therefore been no arbitrary or capricious discrimination against the resident rectifier.\n There is no error in the judgment, and it is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","18":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCALDER v. PEOPLE OF STATE OF MICHIGAN(1910)\nNo. 58\nArgued: Decided: December 12, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. Henry A. Forster, Willard Kingsley, and John E. More for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[218 U.S. 591, 596]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Moses Taggart, Ganson Taggart, Franz Kuhn, and John E. Bird for defendants in error. \n\n[218 U.S. 591, 597]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The judgment upon which this writ of error is based ousts the defendants (plaintiffs in error) from acting as a body corporate under the name of the Grand Rapids \n\n[218 U.S. 591, 598]\n\u00a0\n Hydraulic Company. It was rendered, upon an information in the nature of quo warranto, by a county court, and was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. 153 Mich. 724, 126 Am. St. Rep. 550, 117 N. W. 314. The case was heard on demurrer. The defendants pleaded that in 1849 the legislature incorporated the Grnad Rapids Hydraulic Company, and that they were directors of the company; that the company had constructed and was maintaining an elaborate system of water supply; that in 1905 the legislature purported to repeal this charter, but that, owing to the manner in which the repeal was passed, as well as to the contents of the act purporting to effect it, the repeal was void under article 1,  10, and the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. Seemingly in aid of this contention, the defendants alleged the issue of bonds and a mortgage of the company's plant, including its franchise to own and operate the same, that still are outstanding. To this plea the state demurred.\n As to the manner in which the repeal was obtained and passed, the plea alleged that the city of Grand Rapids was a rival of the company in furnishing water, and that the mayor and city authorities carried out an unfair scheme for getting the repeal hurried through the legislature without notice to the company. It set out the particulars with much detail. The defendants now, on the ground that there are limits even to the operation of a reserved power to repeal, argue that we should consider these allegations. But we do not inquire into the knowledge, negligence, methods, or motives of the legislature if, as in this case, the repeal was passed in due form. United States v. Des Moines Nav. & R. Co. \n142 \nU.S. 510, 544\n, 35 S. L. ed. 1099, 1109, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 308. The only question that we can consider is whether there is anything relevant to the present case in the terms or effect of the repeal that goes beyond the power that the charter expressly reserves.\n The charter provides that 'the legislature may, at any \n\n[218 U.S. 591, 599]\n\u00a0\n time hereafter, amend or repeal this act.' Laws of 1849, act No. 223,  11. Now, in the first place, with regard to the reference in argument to the bondholders, it is enough to say that they are not before the court. The defendants do not represent them; the defendants represent the debtors, not the creditors. By making a contract or incurring a debt, the defendants, so far as they are concerned, could not get rid of an infirmity inherent in the corporation. They contracted subject, not paramount, to the proviso for repeal, as is shown by a long line of cases. Greenwood v. Union Freight R. Co. \n105 U.S. 13\n, 26 L. ed. 961; Newport & C. Bridge Co. v. United States, \n105 U.S. 470\n, 26 L. ed. 1143; Chicago L. Ins. Co. v. Needles, \n113 U.S. 574\n, 28 L. ed. 1084, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 681; Monongahela Nav. Co. v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 313, 338\n, 340 S., 37 L. ed. 463, 472, 473, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 622; New Orleans Waterworks Co. v. Louisiana, \n185 \nU.S. 336, 353\n, 354 S., 46 L. ed. 936, 944, 945, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 691; Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville, \n189 \nU.S. 434, 437\n, 438 S., 47 L. ed. 887, 891, 892, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 531; Manigault v. Springs, \n199 \nU.S. 473, 480\n, 50 S. L. ed. 274, 278, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 127. It would be a waste of words to try to make clearer than it is on its face the meaning and effect of this reservation of the power to repeal.\n But the legislature did not content itself with a bare repeal, and leave the consequences to the law. Act No. 492 of the Local Acts of 1905, after repealing the charter, provides that the company, at any time before January, 1906, may present a claim to the city of Grand Rapids for the value of its real and tangible estate, 'not including franchise,' and transfer the property to the city. If the parties do not agree, an action of assumpsit may be brought, with the usual incidents, and the amount of the final judgment is made a claim against the city, to be paid like other claims. If the company does not elect this course, it may remove the property, first giving bond, to be approved by the common council, to protect the city for any damages caused thereby, and is to leave the streets in as good condition as before. It is argued that these provisions are void, and the argument may perhaps be abridged \n\n[218 U.S. 591, 600]\n\u00a0\n as follows: Corporations with existence limited in time may take a fee simple or a franchise of longer duration than themselves. Minneapolis v. Minneapolis Street R. Co. \n215 \nU.S. 417, 430\n, 54 S. L. ed. 259, 269, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 118; Detroit v. Detroit Citizens' Street R. Co. \n184 \nU.S. 368, 394\n, 395 S., 46 L. ed. 592, 610, 611, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 410. There is a distinction between the franchise to be a corporation and that to operate its plant. Vicksburg v. Vicksburg Waterworks Co. \n202 \nU.S. 453, 464\n, 50 S. L. ed. 1102, 1109, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 660, 6 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 253. As the corporation had been authorized to lay its pipes, and lawfully had mortgaged not only its pipes, but its franchise to own and operate them, it must be taken to have given a security not limited or terminable by anything short of payment. The attempt to extinguish the corporation, if successful, would render the security and continuing franchise unavailable, and is void. It is argued further that the exclusion of 'franchise' ( assumed to embrace the supposed franchise to operate the works) from the valuation is unconstitutional.\n We express no opinion as to whether the premises of the foregoing argument are justified by anything appearing in the present record. In any event, the conclusion cannot be maintained. If the city gave the privilege of using the streets to the corporation forever, it could not enlarge the right of the corporation to continue in existence as against the sovereign power, as sufficiently appears from the cases already cited. See also Arkansas Southern R. Co. v. Louisiana & A. R. Co. \n218 U.S. 431\n, 54 L. ed. 1097, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 56 (November 28, 1910.) The only question before us now is the validity of the judgment ousting the defendants from 'assuming to act as a body corporate, and particularly under the name and style of the Grand Rapids Hydraulic Company.' This really is too plain to require the argument that we have spent upon it. We may add that it is a matter upon which the bondholders have nothing to say. Moreover, the question of parties is not open here. New Orleans Waterworks Co. v. Louisiana, supra; Com. v. Tenth Massachusetts Turnp. Corp. \n\n[218 U.S. 591, 601]\n\u00a0\n 5 Cush. 509, 511. Also, whether the provisions as to valuation do the bondholders or members of the corporation wrong is not before the court.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","19":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCENTRAL TRUST CO. v. CENTRAL TRUST CO. OF ILLINOIS(1910)\nNo. 86\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n On June 22, 1906, the Central Trust Company, a corpora \n\n[216 U.S. 251, 252]\n\u00a0\n tion engaged in the mining, promoting, real estate, and trust business, filed its bill in the circuit court of the United States for the northern district of Illinois to compel the defendant Frederick A. Busse, postmaster at Chicago, to deliver to it certain mail matter which it claims it was entitled to receive, and which he wrongfully delivered to the defendant the Central Trust Company of Illinois. Demurrers to the bill were filed, which were sustained, and the bill dismissed. On appeal to the United States, circuit court of appeals for the seventh circuit, the decree of dismissal was affirmed, and thereupon the case was brought here on appeal.\n The allegations in the bill are that on or about April 17, 1897, the complainant was created a corporation by the state of South Dakota under the name and title of 'Central Trust Company,' and was authorized by said state to establish an office and hold directors' meetings in Chicago; that on or about that date it established an office in Chicago on the corner of Monroe and La Salle streets, and began to carry on its business, though without any express authority from the state of Illinois, and continued to do so up to and including February 7, 1903; that in August, 1902, it applied to the secretary of state of Illinois for a license to do business within that state, and complied with all the statutory requirements for foreign corporations desiring to do business within the state; that owing to a contest made before the secretary of state by the Central Trust Company of Illinois, the granting of said license was delayed until February 7, 1903, at which time it was granted, and that from that date complainant has continuously conducted its business in Chicago at the office and under the above-stated name; that ever since its coming to Chicago it has received through the postoffice a large amount of mail matter addressed to it by simply its name.\n The bill further alleges that the defendant the Central Trust Company of Illinois is a corporation chartered by the state of Illinois on or about July, 1902, and engaged in a general banking and trust business at No. 142 Monroe street, in \n\n[216 U.S. 251, 253]\n\u00a0\n Chicago; that its first place of business was at the corner of Dearborn and Monroe streets, but, about the beginning of the year 1906, it removed to No. 142 Monroe street, where it has ever since remained.\n The bill still further alleges that from 1897 to 1901 the name of complainant appeared in the Lakeside directory, a directory of general circulation in Chicago, and recognized as a reliable and authoritative publication; that while its name was omitted from the directory for 1902, the omission was due to a mere error by the publishers of the directory, and was through no fault of the complainant; that said directory for 1902 was not published and issued until after defendant the Central Trust Company of Illinois had filed its articles of incorporation.\n It also appears that complaint having been made to the Postmaster General of the action of the postmaster at Chicago in reference to the delivery of the mail received at Chicago, an order was made by the First Assistant Postmaster General in these words:\n January 10, 1903\n\n\n The Postmaster,\n Chicago, Ill.\n Sir:--\n I am in receipt of information to the effect that a letter was delivered to Mr. Pfau, a representative of the Central Trust Company of South Dakota, which contained remittances intended to protect checks drawn on the Central Trust Company of Illinois; that Mr. Pfau, instead of returning the letter promptly to the postoffice for delivery to the trust company for which it was intended, returned it to the sender, thereby jeopardizing his credit. Mr. Pfau well knew that the deposit was intended for the Central Trust Company of Illinois.\n You are hereby directed to deliver mail addressed 'Central Trust Co., Chicago, Ill.,' without the addition of the street, box, or other designation to indicate that it is intended for the South Dakota Company, to the Central Trust Company of Illinois, and request that company to return to you promptly for delivery to the Central Trust Company of South Dakota all \n\n[216 U.S. 251, 254]\n\u00a0\n letters falling into their hands intended for the company represented by Mr. Pfau.\n Very respectfully,\n (Signed) R. J. Wynne,\n First Assistant Postmaster General.\n The prayer of the bill is that the defendant Busse be restrained 'from delivering mail addressed 'Central Trust Company' without the street address of this complainant thereon, or some other mark thereon indicating for whom the same is intended, or with the street address 'corner of La Salle and Monroe streets,' to the defendant Central Trust Company of Illinois, and restraining the Central Trust Company of Illinois and its cashier, the defendant William R. Dawes, from receiving and opening said mail so described.\n Messrs. W. H. Sears, Daniel McCaskill, and O. L. McCaskill for appellant.\n\n\n[216 U.S. 251, 257]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Max Pam, Stephen A. Day, and Pam & Hurd for appellees.\n\n\n[216 U.S. 251, 259]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The management of the great postoffice business of the country is placed in the hands of the Postmaster General and assistants. Rev. Stat.  388, 389, 396, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 218, 224. In the discharge of his duties as Postmaster General, he has assigned to the First Assistant Postmaster General 'the preparation of decisions as to delivery of ordinary mail, the ownership of which is in dispute.' Postal Laws and Regulations, 1902,  17, 9. The question here presented is whether, the First Assistant Postmaster General having directed the postmaster at Chicago to deliver to the 'Central Trust Company of Illinois,' defendant herein, mail matter addressed 'Central Trust Company, Chicago, Ill.,' without any further designation of the party for whom it was intended, the courts are, upon the facts as presented, justified in setting aside that order and directing the delivery of such mail to the complainant. It is not always easy to determine for whom a letter is intended. In furtherance of the effort to secure delivery of mail matter to the proper party, 3 and 4,  634, and 4 and 5,  645, of Postal Laws and Regulations, provide:\n'Sec. 634, par. 3. When a postmaster is in doubt as to the identity of the addressee, he may require proof, and should exercise great care, especially where mail matter appears to be of value, to make proper delivery.\n\n'Par. 4. Where two or more persons of the same name receive mail at the same office, the postmaster should advise them to adopt some address or means by which their mail may be distinguished. Postmasters will deliver such matter according to their best judgment, and will not return it to the mailing office for better description of the addressee until, after inquiry, they are unable to determine to whom it should be delivered.' \n\n[216 U.S. 251, 260]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 645, par. 4. Attempts to secure the mail of an established house, firm, or corporation through the adoption of a similar name should not be recognized. Where disputes arise between individuals, firms, or corporations as to the use of a name or designation, matter addressed to a street, number, or building should be delivered according cording to such address. When not so addressed, the mail will be delivered to the firm or corporation which first adopted the name of the address at that place.\n\n'Par. 5. When in doubt as to the firm or corporation for which any mail matter is intended, and claim therefor is disputed, postmasters will withhold delivery, and report the facts and any statements made by either claimant to the First Assistant Postmaster General, for advice.'\n\n Appellant contends that its legal name is 'Central Trust Company' while the legal name of defendant is 'Central Trust Company of Illinois;' that therefore it has a right to have mail directed to 'Central Trust Company, Chicago,' without further designation, delivered to it rather than to defendant. The argument primarily is that every corporation is entitled to the legal benefit of its own name; that when that name appears on mail matter as the party addressed, and nothing else is shown, the postmaster has simply the ministerial duty of making a delivery to that corporation, and that a failure to discharge this ministerial duty can be corrected by the courts.\n While in a certain sense it is true that the benefit of one's legal name belongs to every party, individual or corporation, yet that may not be the name by which it is customarily known or addressed, and of course the object is and must be to deliver the mail matter to the party for whom it is intended. In the determination of this it may often be necessary to look beyond the exact legal name. Many things may have to be considered, and the action of an officer charged with that duty should not lightly be disturbed by the courts, and only when it is clear that a mistake has been made or a wrong \n\n[216 U.S. 251, 261]\n\u00a0\n done. Initials are often used, abbreviations made, words left out. The number of letters delivered to the respective parties and the disposition made by each of those received may cast some light upon the question, for while a party for whom a single letter is intended has a right to receive it, yet the number of letters, taken in connection with the amount of business apparently done by the recipient, may well suggest for whom any given letter was intended, and the action taken by the recipient, when, as here, each knows of the existence of the other, may show its good or bad faith in dealing with the postoffice. So, also, the character of the business done may be considered. Where a corporation is engaged in the banking business, letters from other banks will point to it as the intended recipient, while, if it is a real estate corporation, letters from real estate firms will indicate differently. And so we might go on and mention other things which, while by not means conclusive, tend to throw light on the matter.\n We have had occasion to consider the effect of findings of fact by officers in charge of the several departments of government, and the accepted rule is that those findings are conclusive unless palpable error appears. Bates & G. Co. v. Payne, \n194 U.S. 106\n, 48 L. ed. 894, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 595, and cases cited in the opinion; United States ex rel. Parish v. MacVeagh, \n214 U.S. 124\n-131, 53 L. ed. 936-938, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 556. In National L. Ins. Co. v. National L. Ins. Co. \n209 U.S. 317\n, 52 L. ed. 808, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 541, it appeared that the Postoffice Department had made a special order in reference to the delivery of mail, and the court was asked to correct that order. In denying this application, the court, by Mr. Justice Peckham, said (p. 325):\n'The appeal made by the complainant to the Department was really nothing but an appeal to its discretion. . . . Assuming that the court in some cases has the power to, in effect, review the determination of the Department, we do not think this is an occasion for its exercise. The complaint is really appealing from the discretion of the Department to the discretion of the court, and the complainant has no clear \n\n[216 U.S. 251, 262]\n\u00a0\n legal right to obtain the order sought. See Bates & G. Co. v. Payne, \n194 U.S. 106\n-108, 48 L. ed. 894, 895, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 595.\n\n'A court in such case ought not to interfere in the administration of a great department like that of the Postoffice by an injunction, which directs the Department how to conduct the business thereof, where the party asking for the injunction has no clear right to it.'\n\n We do not deem it necessary to consider other questions discussed by counsel, for, upon the facts presented and for the reasons stated, we are of opinion that there is not enough to show such clear right in the complainant as justifies the setting aside of the order of the First Assistant Postmaster General.\n The decree is therefore affirmed. \n\n\n\n","20":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHANTANGCO v. ABAROA(1910)\nNo. 16\nArgued: Decided: November 28, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 476, 477]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Aldis B. Browne, Alexander Britton, Evans Browne, and W. A. Kincaid for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 476, 479]\n\u00a0\n No brief was filed for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Lurton delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a writ of error to the supreme court of the Philippine Islands to review a judgment affirming a judgment of the court of the first instance in favor of the defendant.\n The action was to recover indemnification of damages for the destruction of a storehouse and a stock of merchandise therein, valued at $ 58,473.49, Mexican, which the complaint alleged was 'burned maliciously or unlawfully by Eduardo Abaroa,' the defendant to the complaint, and defendant in error here.\n The defense was, first, a general denial, and second, that the defendant, in a criminal action for the same burning and damage alleged, had been acquitted and held not guilty of the malicious burning now alleged, and in consequence of such judgment was not liable in a civil action for any damage to the plaintiff. The judgment in the criminal proceeding referred to was in these words:\n'The evidence introduced by the prosecution indicates \n\n[218 U.S. 476, 480]\n\u00a0\n that the defendant might have been the author of the crime, but it is not conclusive. All persons charged with crime are presumed to be innocent until they are proven otherwise. There being in my mind some doubt as to the guilt of the defendant, I should and do hereby acquit him, with the costs of these proceedings de officio, and the attachment heretofore levied on his property is hereby vacated, reserving to the complaining witness whatever right he may have to bring a civil action against the said Eduardo Abaroa.'\n\n Upon a final hearing upon all of the proofs, the court of first instance adjudged that the cause of action alleged and proved was one arising from the criminal act which was the subject of the former criminal proceeding; and that the defendant, having been acquitted in the criminal action, was not civilly liable. This judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the Philippine Islands upon an elaborate opinion.\n We have not had the benefit of either brief or argument for the defendant in this writ of error, but have found much assistance in the opinions of each of the Philippine courts, as well from very helpful briefs filed by learned counsel for the plaintiffs in error. The contention which has been very forcibly pressed is that the judgment of acquittal in the criminal action does not operate as a bar to a subsequent civil action for indemnification of damages resulting from the same malicious or unlawful burning of the house and goods of the plaintiff, which was charged in the criminal action.\n The proposition upon which the supreme court of the Philippine Islands grounded its judgment affirming that of the lower court in favor of the defendant Abaroa was, 'that it has not been alleged or shown by the plaintiffs, as a cause of action instituted civilly against the defendant, that the aforesaid fire was caused through any fault or negligence on the part of the defendant, nor is there \n\n[218 U.S. 476, 481]\n\u00a0\n shown any motive or cause distinct from that, the subject of the case already terminated in accordance with the provisions of articles 1093, 1902, and 1903 of the Civil Code; and second, that one who is not criminally responsible for a crime or misdemeanor cannot be made civilly responsible for the crime of which he has been acquitted.'\n The general rule of the common law is that a judgment in a criminal proceeding cannot be read in evidence in a civil action to establish any fact there determined. The reason for this rule is, primarily, that the parties are not the same, and, secondarily, that different rules of evidence are applicable. In the old case of Jones v. White, 1 Strange, 67, 68, Eyre, J., said: 'If a verdict be given in evidence, it must be between the same parties; and therefore an indictment, which is at the suit of the King, cannot be read in an action which is at the suit of the party.' The requisite of mutual estoppel is essential to make a judgment in one action obligatory in another, although the point in issue is the same in each case. Unless the parties are the same, the matter is res inter alios. Buller, N. P. 233; 1 Wharton, Ev. & 776; Dyer County v. Chesapeake, O. & S. W. R. Co. 87 Tenn. 712, 11 S. W. 943.\n Neither will identity of parties always operate to make a judgment in a criminal action admissible in evidence in a civil action. There must be identity of issue. Thus, in Stone v. United States, \n167 \nU.S. 178, 187\n, 42 S. L. ed. 127, 131, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 778, Stone was sued by the United States to recover the value of timber alleged to have been cut by him from public lands. He had been theretofore indicted, tried, and acquitted for unlawfully cutting the same timber from the public lands, and pleaded this judgment as a bar to a suit for civil liability. This was held to be no defense, and Coffey v. United States, \n116 U.S. 436\n, 29 L. ed. 684, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 437, distinguished as having been placed upon the ground 'that the facts ascertained in the criminal case, as between the United States and the claimant, could \n\n[218 U.S. 476, 482]\n\u00a0\n not be 'again litigated between them, as the basis of any statutory punishment denounced as a consequence of the existence of the facts.\" With respect to the application of Coffey's Case, Mr. Justice Harlan, for the court, said:\n'In the present case the action against Stone is purely civil. It depends entirely upon the ownership of certain personal property. The rule established in Coffey's Case can have no application in a civil case not involving any question of criminal intent or of forfeiture for prohibited acts, but turning wholly upon an issue as to the ownership of property. In the criminal case, the government sought to punish a criminal offense, while in the civil case it only seeks, in its capacity as owner of property illegally converted, to recover its value. In the criminal case his acquittal may have been due to the fact that the government failed to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of some fact essential to establish the offense charged, while the same evidence in a civil action brought to recover the value of the property illegally converted might have been sufficient to entitle the government to a verdict. Not only was a greater degree of proof requisite to support the indictment than is sufficient to sustain a civil action, but an essential fact had to be proved in the criminal case, which was not necessary to be proved in the present suit. In order to convict the defendant upon the indictment for unlawfully, wilfully, and feloniously cutting and removing timber from lands of the United States, it was necessary to prove a criminal intent on his part, or, at least, that he knew the timber to be the property of the United States.

But the present action for the conversion of the timber would be supported by proof that it was in fact the property of the United States, whether the de- \n\n[218 U.S. 476, 483]\n\u00a0\n fendant knew that fact or not. E. E. Bolles Woodenware Co. v. United States, \n106 U.S. 432\n, 27 L. ed. 230, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 398. An honest mistake of the defendant as to his title in the property would be a defense to the indictment, but not to the civil action. Broom's Legal Maxims, 5th ed. 366, 367. It cannot be said that any fact was conclusively established in the criminal case, except that the defendant was not guilty of the public offense with which he was charged. We cannot agree that the failure or inability of the United States to prove in the criminal case that the defendant had been guilty of a crime either forfeited its right of property in the timber or its right in this civil action, upon a preponderance of proof, to recover the value of such property.'\n\n There are peculiarities about the character of the action now under consideration which, as will appear later, may bring it under the principles of Coffey v. United States, supra, rather than Stone v. United States, the indemnification here sought being a part of the punishment attached to the offense of which the defendant has been acquitted.\n The case is, however, one which we conceive must be governed by the local law of the Philippine Islands, and the single question to which we need address ourselves is as to whether that law was rightly applied by the local tribunals.\n Article 1902 of the Civil Code in force in the Philippine Islands reads thus: 'A person who, by an act or omission, causes damage to another when there is fault or negligence, shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.' By  1092 and 1093 of the same Code provision is made for the enforcement of civil liability, varying in character according to the origin of the liability. Thus,  1092 provides that civil obligations arising from crimes and misdemeanors shall be governed by the provisions of the Penal Code. On the other hand,  1093 provides that 'those arising from acts or omissions, in which fault or negligence, not punished by law, occurs, shall \n\n[218 U.S. 476, 484]\n\u00a0\n be subject to the provisions of chapter second of title sixteen of this book.' The action here involved comes directly under  1092, above set out, and is not an action arising from 'fault or negligence, not punished by law.' The complaint alleges that the act of burning was 'malicious and unlawful,' and not that it was the result of any 'fault or negligence.' This was the construction placed upon the complaint by both the courts below, and is a construction not challenged here. It follows that we must turn to the Penal Code to discover when a civil action arises out of a crime or misdemeanor, and the procedure of the enforcement of such civil liability. Article 17 of the Penal Code reads as follows: 'Every person criminally liable for a crime or misdemanor is also civilly liable.' May this civil liability be enforced without a prior legal determination of the fact of the defendant's guilt of crime? Does civil liability exist at all if the defendant has been found not guilty of the acts out of which the civil liability arises? The opinion of the court below was that a judgment of conviction was essential to an action for indemnification under the applicable local law. To this conclusion we assent, upon the following considerations:\n First, by the positive legislation of the Philippine Codes, civil and criminal, a distinction is drawn between a civil liability which results from the mere negligence of the defendant and a liability for the civil consequences of a crime by which another has sustained loss or injury.\n Second, the plain inference from article 17, above set out, is that civil liability springs out of and is dependent upon facts which, if true, would constitute a crime or misdemeanor.\n Third, the Philippine Code of Procedure plainly contemplates that the civil liability of the defendant shall be ascertained and declared in the criminal proceedings.\n Thus,  742 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, after \n\n[218 U.S. 476, 485]\n\u00a0\n requiring that, in a criminal proceeding, all of the minor or incidental offenses included in the principal crime shall be decided, adds: 'All questions relating to the civil liability which may have been the subject- matter of the charge shall be decided in the sentence.'\n By  108 of the same Code the prosecuting official is required to prosecute the right of the injured person to restitution or indemnity, unless such person renounces the right.\n By  112 of the same Code the civil action is held to be part of the criminal action, 'unless the person prejudiced or injured renounces the same, or expressly reserves the right to institute it after the conclusion of the criminal action.'\n In United States v. Catequista, 1 Philippine, 537, 538, the court below failed to determine the liability of the defendant to indemnify the person injured by the misdemeanor of which he had been convicted. Concerning this, Ladd J., for the court, said:\n'The court also erred in not determining in the judgment the civil liability of the fendant for the danos and perjuicios, which resulted from the criminal act. Such civil liability is a necessary consequence of criminal responsibility (Penal Code, art. 17), and is to be declared and enforced in the criminal proceeding, except where the injured party reserves his right to avail himself of it in a distinct civil action. Code of Criminal Procedure of Spain, article 112, Provisional Law for the Application of the Penal Code in the Philippines, article 51, No. 4. No such waiver or reservation is disclosed by the record here.'\n\n It is true that one of the plaintiffs in the present case reserved whatever right he may have had to bring a civil action. This was obviously of no avail, inasmuch as there resulted a judgment for the defendant, and the plain inference from the foregoing is that a verdict of ac- \n\n[218 U.S. 476, 486]\n\u00a0\n quittal must carry with it exemption from civil responsibility.\n The effect of the application of the substantive law of the Philippine Islands, given by the court below, not only in the present case, but in the prior cases cited above, accords with the interpretation of identical provisions in the law of Spain by the Supreme Court of that kingdom, as shown by citations from the Spanish Supreme Court Reports. Some of these we have not been able to verify. We have, however, examined the decision of that court cited as of January 3, 1877. In that case the defendant had been tried and acquitted upon a criminal complaint. Notwithstanding this result, the trial court gave a judgment indemnifying the injured person for a loss supposed to have been suffered by him as a consequence of the crime of which the defendant had been acquitted. This judgment was annulled. Upon this point the court, in substance, said that indemnity for damages in penal cases was a consequence of the commission of a crime. The defendant was therefore not liable civilly, inasmuch as he had been found not liable criminally.\n The foregoing considerations eliminate any question of the effect of such a judgment of acquittal under the principles of the common law and require an affirmance of the judgment of the court below as properly based upon the applicable substantive law of the Philippine Islands, which has not been superseded by legislation since the establishment of the present Philippine government.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","21":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO GREAT WESTERN RY. CO. v. STATE OF MINNESOTA(1910)\nNo. 377\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n This suit, like that of the Great Northern R. Co. v. Minnesota, just decided [\n216 U.S. 206\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 344] involves the constitutionality, as applied to the plaintiff in error, of chapter 253, General Laws of Minnesota of 1903, requiring every railroad company owning or operating any line of railway in that state to pay an annual tax, commencing with 1905, equal to 4 per cent of the gross earnings derived from the operation of such line within the state.\n The gross earnings received by the defendant company during the year 1905 amounted to $1,248,890.93, 4 per cent of which is $49,959.24. The state alleges that the defendant refused to pay and has paid only $24,979. 62, leaving a balance of $24,979.62, for which amount the state asked judgment. \n\n[216 U.S. 234, 235]\n\u00a0\n The court of original jurisdiction sustained the company's contention that it was liable only to a sum equal to 2 per cent of its gross earnings, and gave judgment for the defendant. That court was of opinion that a certain statute of the territory of Minnesota, approved March 1st, 1856 ( Laws of 1856, chap. 47), constituted a valid contract between the territory and state of Minnesota, on one side, and the Minnesota & Northwestern Railroad Company, on the other, and fixed the lawful rate of taxation to be paid by that company at 2 per cent of its gross earnings; that said contract was never forfeited or lost by the company, but was transferred and passed, first to the Chicago, St. Paul, & Kansas City Railway, and subsequently to the defendant herein; and that the statute of 1903, fixing the tax at 4 per cent of the company's gross earnings, was unconstitutional when applied to the defendant herein. The judgment was reversed by the supreme court of Minnesota, with directions to enter judgment in favor of the state for the full amount stated in its complaint. 106 Minn. 300, 119 N. W. 211.\n The facts and issues are so fully and accurately set forth by the supreme court of Minnesota that we take from its opinion the following statement of the case: 'This action, like that of State v. Great Northern R. Co. 106 Minn. 303, 119 N. W. 202 [filed herewith], involves the validity of chapter 253, p. 375, General Laws 1903, increasing the rate of the gross earnings tax upon railroad companies in this state to 4 per cent. As in the Great Northern Case, defendant asserts an irrepealable contract, under which it claims the right forever to discharge its tax liability by the payment of a 2 per cent rate. The fixed rate claimed by the Great Northern Company was 3 per cent. The determination of the case involves, as in the other case, the construction of an old territorial railroad charter, the facts with reference to which are as follows:\n'By chap. 47, p. 121, Territorial Laws 1854, the Minnesota & \n\n[216 U.S. 234, 236]\n\u00a0\n Northwestern Railroad Company was duly incorporated and authorized to construct a railroad within the limits of the territory, the line of which road, in a general way, was therein designated. The act was accepted by the persons named as incorporators, but no effort was made by them to construct the road. By chap. 58, p. 148, Laws of 1855, the act incorporating the company was amended by adding thereto, among other things, a provision requiring the company to construct and equip 50 miles of its road within three years after the passage of the amendment, and the entire line within six years, in default of which, the act provided, the charter of the company and all grants and rights thereby conferred 'shall cease and be void.' This act also contained a clause reserving to the legislature the right of amendment after the expiration of twenty years. In the original charter, and also in the amendment just mentioned, the company was required to pay into the treasury of the territory or future state 7 per cent of its net earnings. Whether this was intended as a substitute for taxes to be levied and collected in the usual way was not expressly stated. But in 1856, by chap. 47 of the laws of that year (p. 76 ), the charter was again amended by imposing a 2 per cent gross earnings tax in lieu of all other taxes. It is upon this act and the rate of taxation therein in imposed that defendant relies in support of its defense. Defendant claims to have succeeded to all the rights of this old company, including the right to an irrepealable 2 per cent tax contract. The facts leading up to this asserted succession are as follows: The old company, though fully organized, wholly failed to construct its railroad within the time prescribed by its charter, and did nothing in that direction until some time in 1884, thirty years after its organization, and twenty-four years after the time limited for the completion of the road. By this failure the company forfeited all its rights under the charter, and all grants thereby conferred 'ceased and were void.' But by chap. 83, p. 221, Special Laws, 1883, the legislature of the state recognized the existence of the corporation, and in effect waived the default in the construction of \n\n[216 U.S. 234, 237]\n\u00a0\n the road by authorizing the consolidation of 'its stocks, franchises, rights, and property with that of any other railroad company which will undertake the construction and operation of the railroad which the said Minnesota & Northwestern Railroad Company is authorized to construct and operate.' Sec. 2 of that act amended  7 of the original charter by authorizing the construction of a line of road differing somewhat from that authorized by the old charter. The company was thus revived from its extended slumbers and proceeded to construct its road, and completed it sometime in the year 1885. It thereafter operated the same until December of 1887, when it conveyed all its property, 'contracts, rights, privileges, and immunities,' to the Chicago, St. Paul, & Kansas City Railroad Company, a corporation created, organized, and existing under the laws of the state of Iowa. Counsel for defendant treat this transfer as a consolidation of the two companies, authorized by the act of 1883. But, as we read the documents by which the transfer was effected, the transaction took the from of an absolute and unconditional sale by the Northwestern Company. The Kansas City Company took possession of the road, and thereafter continued its operation until June, 1892, when it leased the line and all property connected therewith to the Chicago Great Western Railway Company, defendant herein, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of Illinois. Subsequently, in September, 1893, the Kansas City Company conveyed the property so leased, and all contracts, franchises, and immunities, to its lessee, the Great Western Company, since which time the latter has continued in the operation of the road. Again, counsel claims that the conveyance by the Kansas City Company to defendant was a consolidation and authorized by law. This, however, is not important. The fact remains that the transaction resulted in an absolute transfer of the railroad property to defendant, and inasmuch as both those companies were foreign corporations, the laws of this state would not control their dealings, and this state could neither authorize nor prohibit their consolidation. \n\n[216 U.S. 234, 238]\n\u00a0\n But that question in no way controls the result in this case. The old Northwestern Company, after the completion of its road in 1885, commuted its taxes by the payment of the 2 per cent rate imposed by the amendment of its charter in 1856, and the succeeding roads, including defendant, have paid the same rate.\n\n'Defendant having refused to pay the rate prescribed by the statute under consideration, this action was brought to recover the amount of the increased rate. It is the contention of defendant that the terms of the old Northwestern charter, fixing a 2 per cent rate, constituted a contract between the company and the territory or future state, irrevocable and irrepealable, to which defendant has succeeded, and that to enforce the new rate would impair the terms of the contract, in violation of both the state and the Federal Constitutions. Defendant does not contend that the new rate is unreasonable or unfair, or at all disproportionate to the rate paid by other taxpayers, but stands squarely upon its asserted legal right to a perpetual 2 per cent rate. The trial court sustained this view, ordered judgment for defendant, and the state appealed.\n\n'The charter of this road has never heretofore been before the court for construction. No question has ever been raised relative to the rights of defendant or its predecessors upon the subject of taxation; and the construction of the old charter and amendatory acts, and right of the state to change the rate of taxation thereby imposed, are before us for the first time. Most of the questions involved were presented in the Great Northern Case, where they were fully considered, and disposed of adversely to the contentions of defendant. We there held, among other things, that the charter provisions of the old Minnesota & Pacific Company, upon which the Great Northern Company relied, did not constitute an irrepealable contract which passed unimpaired to the successors of that company; and further, that the gross earnings tax system first came into the legal existence in this state by force of the \n\n[216 U.S. 234, 239]\n\u00a0\n constitutional amendment of 1871 (Laws 1871, chap. 18, p. 41), and that it then became subject to the reserved right of the state to amend or repeal the same, as public interests might justify or require. The language of the charter under consideration, in so far as it imposes this form of taxation, is, for all practical purposes, the same as that construed in the Great Northern Case, and the conclusions there reached fully apply at bar, and we adopt and follow them.'\n\n Messrs. Frank B. Kellogg, Cordenio A. Severance, A. G. Briggs, Robert E. Olds, and John Barton Payne for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. George W. Peterson and George T. Simpson for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n The rights of the plaintiff in error depend primarily upon the construction of the act incorporating the Minnesota & Northwestern Railroad Company (Territorial Laws, 1854, chap. 47, the amendatory act of 1855, chap. 58, the amendatory act of 1856, chap. 47, and the act of 1883, Special Laws, chap. 83). That act of 1856 imposed a 2 per cent gross earnings tax in lieu of all other taxes. The supreme court of the state observed that until the present case arose it had never had occasion to construe the charter of the original company, and the acts amendatory thereof, nor determine whether the state could change the rate of taxation thereby imposed. It was of opinion that the question of taxation here involved was substantially the same as the one involved in Great Northern R. Co. v. Minnesota [\n216 U.S. 206\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 344]. That court consequently adjudged, upon the authority of that case, that the defendant, as a successor in interest of the Minnesota & Northwestern Railroad \n\n[216 U.S. 234, 240]\n\u00a0\n Company, could not claim the benefit of an irrepealable, unchangeable contract relating to taxation that passed or could, under the state Constitution, have passed, unimpaired from the old company to a successor in interest, or that prevented the state from enacting the statute of 1903, chapter 253, General Laws of 1903. Without repeating what was said in the former case, we hold, upon the grounds set forth in the opinion in that case, that the state court rightly held that the state was not prevented by contract from passing the gross earnings tax law of 1903, and it properly reversed the judgment of the court of original jurisdiction, with directions to enter judgment in favor of the state for the amount claimed in its complaint. The judgment herein must be affirmed.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","22":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO, ST P, M & O R. CO. v. U S(1910)\nNo. 133\nArgued: Decided: April 4, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. Samuel A. Putman and Charles W. Bunn for appellant.\n Assistant Attorney General John Q. Thompson and Mr. Philip M. Ashford for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The question in this case is the legality of certain deductions made by the Postmaster General from the amount \n\n[217 U.S. 180, 181]\n\u00a0\n which, it is contended, is due appellant for carrying the mails between Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Sioux City, Iowa, over postal route No. 121, 045. The appellant sought to recover the sum of forty thousand dollars ($ 40,000). The court of claims gave judgment for only thirty-three hundred eight-nine dollars and fifty three cents ($3,389.53), rejecting the balance of the claim on the authority of Astoria & C. River R. Co. v. United States, 41 Ct. Cl. 284.\n The controversy turns upon the application of certain acts of Congress, granting parts of the public domain to appellant and to companies with which it has agreements. The acts provide that the United States mail shall be transported on such roads at such rates as Congress may by law direct. Act of May 15, 1856, 11 Stat. at L. 9, chap. 28; act of March 3, 1857, 11 Stat. at L. 195, chap. 99. Subsequently it was provided as follows:\n'Sec. 13. That railroad companies whose railroad was constructed in whole or in part by a land grant made by Congress on the condition that the mails should be transported over their road at such price as Congress should by law direct shall receive only eighty per centum of the compensation authorized by this act.' Act of July 12, 1876, 19 Stat. at L. 82 chap. 179, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2722\n\n\n\n The postal route begins at Minneapolis and consists of land-aided and non-land-aided roads. The following diagram, taken from the government's brief, though not drawn to any scale of measurement, exhibits with enough accuracy for illustration the aided and non-aided parts of the route and the companies which received aid: [See opposite page.]\n It will be observed that appellant is the direct beneficiary of the road from St. Paul south 237.81 miles to a point north from a place marked as Le Mars. It used the other parts of the route under the contracts with the other companies, and it is found that from some time prior to October 1, 1900, appellant used the tracks of such other companies to 'form a continuous route for the operation of its mail trains, made up of its own rolling stock, and controlled and operated by its \n\n[217 U.S. 180, 182]\n\u00a0\n own servants, between Minneapolis and Sioux City, except that within the last-named city it did not use the station of the Illinois Central Company, but had a station of its own.' It is also\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfound that appellant operated its trains over the tracks of the Great Northern Company under a contract in writing with the predecessor of the latter company, the St. Paul, Minneapolis, & Manitoba Railway Company, and operated its trains over the Illinois Central Company under a contract with the predecessor of that company, the Iowa Falls & Sioux City Railroad Company. By the first contract, appellant is given 'the \n\n[217 U.S. 180, 183]\n\u00a0\n right and privilege to run such of its locomotives, engines, cars, and trains, handled by its own employees, as shall be reasonaby necessary for the efficient and full transaction of its business to and from the city of Minneapolis, and all points on the second party's road, east of St. Paul, over the main track of the first party, as now constructed.' It was provided that the amount of the monthly rental should be a sum of money equal to one-twelfth part of the annual interest at the rate of 6 1\/2 per cent per annum on one half the value of the property of the first party, which the second party is entitled to use under the contract. And in addition, such proportion of cost of maintaining and repairing the properties, 'as the number of wheels per mile' appellant should 'run over the said property or any part thereof, bears to the whole number of wheels per mile run over the same.' It was provided that the earnings of all local business done by appellant over the railroad should belong to the party of the first part, but the appellant was not obliged to do such business. The contract was to continue twenty-five years.\n The contract of the appellant with the Iowa Falls & Sioux City Railway Company may be said, as far as the question in the case is concerned, to be substantially the same. Its provision as to the use of tracks is more comprehensive. It permits also appellant to do local business, 60 per cent of the gross receipts of which, however, are to be paid to the Iowa Falls Company. There is a provision for maintenance and repairs, based on car mileage. The rental stipulated is $450 per mile for the use of each mile of main track.\n It is found that appellant had no part in the construction of the tracks of the Great Northern Company or of the Illinois Central Company, and received no benefit on account of their construction by grants of land or otherwise; that ever since the construction of the tracks the respective companies owning them have operated trains and transported United States mails over them, and that the use of the tracks by those companies does not appear to have been limited by appellant \n\n[217 U.S. 180, 184]\n\u00a0\n using them; that the tracks of the Great Northern Company between University Switch and St. Paul are a portion of postal route No. 141,004 between St. Paul and Fargo, North Dakota, and those belonging to the Illinois Central between Le Mars and Sioux City are a portion of postal route No. 143,021 between Dubuque and Sioux City, Iowa. That prior to October 1, 1900, the Postmaster General designated the line of railroad between Minneapolis and Sioux City as postal route No. 141,025, and has maintained it ever since, and that between that date and September 30, 1906, appellant has carried mails over such route, but the Postmaster General has allowed for the whole of the route only 80 per cent of the compensation allowed and fixed by law for similar service for non-land- granted roads. A table of reductions is given, showing the deductions for the periods mentioned, amounting in all to $33,301.17.\n The contentions of the parties are foreshadowed by the facts which we have recited. It may be conceded, appellant says, that the grants of land to the companies to which they were made 'completed contracts between them and the United States,' and it may be further conceded, it is said, 'that by these contracts privity was established between the United States and these various railroad companies.' But succession to the obligation of the contract is denied because appellant 'has not succeeded to the title or any part of the title of these respective roads, nor has it in any way, directly or indirectly, received any benefit from the respective grants, or done any other thing which creates privity of contract between it and the United States, or which makes it, in the language of the 13th section of the act of 1876, a railroad company 'whose railroad was constructed in whole or in part by a grant of land,\" etc.\n This distinction is earnestly insisted on and is made the foundation of the argument of the appellant. It makes irrelevant, it is urged, the consideration of the obligations of the other companies, and by overlooking it the court of \n\n[217 U.S. 180, 185]\n\u00a0\n claims fell into error in Astoria & C. River R. Co. v. United States, supra, and continued the error in its judgment in the case at bar. But did the court of claims overlook it? It was urged in Astoria & C. River R. Co. v. United States, as it is urged in this, to justify the distinction that the 'owning and aided companies,' to adopt counsel's designation, are and always have been 'ready to perform all the service due them under the terms of their contract with the United States,' and it seems to us that the court of claims did not misunderstand or overlook the contention. A court does not overlook a contention because it rests its decision upon a proposition which, if true, the contention is not true. To bring forward a proposition upon which the question to be proved depends answers necessarily opposing propositions. And this is what the court of claims did. It decided that the power reserved to Congress was over the property, not alone over the companies who owned it, and extended to every use of it, whether by the owning companies or any company who received a right from them. That proposition, if true, necessarily determined the judgment against the Astoria & Columbia River Railway Company in the cited case. It is opposed to the proposition decided in that case by the circuit court of the United States for the district of Oregon, and which is relied upon by appellant in this case. That case was brought by the United States to enjoin the Astoria & Columbia River Railway Company for charging for the transportation of army supplies from Portland, carried by that company over the tracks of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, which it used under a contract with the latter company. The suit was based on the fact that the Northern Pacific was a land-aided road. The injunction was refused. The court sustained the contention which was made (and which was repeated in the court of claims and is repeated here), that the power reserved to Congress attached in effect to the company, not to the property. The circuit court said: 'The defendant's use of the Northern Pacific Railroad track \n\n[217 U.S. 180, 186]\n\u00a0\n between Portland and Goble does not affect the transportation due from the latter company to the plaintiff. It is still open to the latter to have its freight carried over every part of the railroad of the land-grant company at 50 per cent of the regular rate. This is the extent of its right. And this right, as already appears, has not been affected by the use of a part of that company's track by the defendant company. It is a matter of no consequence to the plaintiff [United States] how many railroads use this particular track of the Northern Pacific Company, nor what their traffic rates are, so long as the latter company continues to afford all the facilities for transportation over every part of its road required by the plaintiff.' 131 Fed. 1006.\n The order denying application for injunction was pleaded in the court of claims, as it appears from the opinion of the court, as res judicata of the 'subject-matter' there involved, and therefore the full breadth of the contentions of the railroad company in the circuit court, and of the decision of that court was considered by the court of claims, and all of the elements of decision and all the distinctions which depended upon them the court must have taken into account in rendering its decision.\n We are brought, then, to the question whether the decision of the court was right. Certain concessions are made by appellant at the outset of the argument. It is conceded that the acceptance of the land grants by the 'owned and aided companies' completed a contract between them and the United States, and that privity was established between them and the United States. That is, privity (we use the word, as we presume that counsel does, in the sense of party for the United States, and the companies are parties, not successors, to rights or obligations) of contract,-a personal obligation-that is, not an obligation which attached to the property and covered every use of it. This is necessarily what appellant means, though it is confused in discussion. \n\n[217 U.S. 180, 187]\n\u00a0\n Appellant quotes the statute to show that the obligation is on the companies, not on the roads, as follows: 'That railroad companies whose railroad was constructed . . . by grant of land . . . shall receive only eighty per centum of the compensation authorized by this act.'\n And further, it points out, as we have seen, that it has not succeeded 'to the title or any part of the title' of the roads, nor 'directly or indirectly receives any benefit from the respective grants.' And, finally, it urges that if appellant 'is a mere licensee, owing no contractual duty as a corporate individual to the government, owning no railroad property which is pledged to the government as security for the performance of any duty, and operating its trains on the joint track in such manner as to interfere in no wise with its licensor in the transaction of its business and the performance of its contractual duty to the government, it is difficult to understand how appellant can be held to fall within the terms of the 13th section of the act of 1876, or why it does not stand upon the same footing as any other company without privity with the United States.'\n This is stating by periphrase the simple proposition that there is a contract only between the United States and each of the aided companies, in which such company 'has bound itself' [we quote from appellant's brief] 'to operate trains for the transportation of the government business.' And 'whenever,' appellant says, 'one of these companies shall fail to perform its duty, whatever relief the United States may be entitled to must be sought by appropriate proceedings directed against the delinquent company.' Appellant joins to this as a concession that the 'railroad property' of an aided company 'is pledged to secure the performance' of its obligation. In what way is not pointed out, or how the security can be availed of.\n The opposite contention to that of appellant is, therefore, what it was decided to be by the court of claims,-that the obligation is upon the property of an aided company, and \n\n[217 U.S. 180, 188]\n\u00a0\n attaches to all of the uses of the property, whether by the 'owned and aided companies' or any other company. We concur with the decision of the court of claims, and we think further discussion is not necessary, except to notice some of the reasons urged against the decision.\n We have noticed and commented on one concession of appellant. Another is made, which we quote with its qualifications, as follows: 'We do not contend that a land-aided road can be sold, either in whole or in part, so as to avoid its obligations to the government. To this extent we concede that the obligation runs with the railroad aided by land grant, but the act does not say that companies permitted simply to run trains on the road shall suffer reductions. They receive no aid from the grant, and are neither within the terms or the reason of the statute.' Of course, the statute did not deal with other companies or with deductions. It would be very strange if it had. It either imposed a service on the companies or on the road as well. If on the companies alone, there would necessarily be exclusion of all others. If on the roads as well, it would comprehend all that used them. If a difference in degree of use, or a participation in the use by other companies than the aided ones, had been intended, it would have been expressed. The concession as to the effect of the sale or lease of the road is fatal. As we have already said, the obligation is either upon the aided companies, to be enforced by remedies against them, or it is on the property as well; and if on the property, necessarily on it by whatever company or person it is used.\n It is further contended in the brief filed for the Great Northern that the condition of earning its grant was the building of a single track, and it or its grantors, it is said, has provided several. It has therefore, it is further said, 'a surplus of track capacity, and, by contract, permits the Omaha [appellant] and other companies to run their trains over its tracks.' To this it is only necessary to reply that the service that the government reserved was coextensive with \n\n[217 U.S. 180, 189]\n\u00a0\n the road as constituted under the grant, and attached to as many tracks as should be used.\n Again, it is urged that if the Omaha company had built its own road, there would be no assertion of a right to deduct from its mail pay, and that it is to run over the Great Northern, the latter not being made thereby less useful or efficient, is for its purpose equivalent to building its own road. An answer to this is contained in what we have said. We may add, however, that the appellant no doubt considered the advantages and disadvantages of the alternative presented before making its selection, but it could not have supposed, nor can we admit, that it could lessen rights in property because it could acquire like property for itself.\n Union P.

MCCLAUGHRY(1910)\nNo. 110\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n The Oklahoma enabling act was approved June 16, 1906 (34 Stat. at L. 267, chap. 3335); November 16, 1907, the state was admitted into the Union ( 35 Stat. at L. 2160).\n Childers was indicted October 21, 1906, in the United States court for the northern district of the Indian territory, for having, on August 6, 1906, and within the jurisdiction of said court, murdered one Lena Atwood. He was tried and convicted, and on June 17, 1907, sentenced to 'be imprisoned in the penitentiary situated at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, for the term and period of his natural life, at hard labor.' He was committed accordingly, and received at the United States penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas, by the warden, R. W. McClaughry, June 21, 1907\n\n\n November 29, 1907, Childers filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States district court for the district of Kansas. \n\n[216 U.S. 139, 140]\n\u00a0\n The principal contention was that the United States court in the Indian territory had no jurisdiction of the offense committed by Childers during the interim between the passage of the Oklahoma enabling act and the admission of the state, in view of the language of the enabling act, and especially of  14. Some minor errors, not jurisdictional, were assigned. The district court considered the terms of the act, construed  14, and denied the petition, and from that judgment an appeal was taken directly to this court.\n The Oklahoma enabling act, approved June 16, 1906, provided:\n'Sec. 13.

And all cases in which final judgment has been rendered in such territorial appellate courts, which appeals or writs of error might be had except for the admission of such state, may still be sued out, taken, and prosecuted to the Supreme Court of the United States or the United States circuit court of appeals under the provisions of existing laws. . . .\n\n'Sec. 16.

O. L. Rider and Luman F. Parker, Jr., for appellant.\n Assistant Attorney General Harr for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n The jurisdiction of the district court was not in issue, nor, properly speaking, was the construction or application of the Constitution involved in this case. The real question before the district court was whether the United States court for the northern district of the Indian territory had jurisdiction of the offense for which Childers was undergoing punishment, in view of the provisions of the Oklahoma enabling act. The allegation in the petition, that Childers had been deprived of his liberty without due process of law, was based entirely upon the alleged want of jurisdiction in the United States court of the Indian territory to try him for the offense. The question before the lower court was simply one of statutory construction, and not of the unconstitutionality of the statute in question.\n In the case of Re Lennon, \n150 U.S. 393\n, 37 L. ed. 1120, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 123, Lennon had been committed for contempt by the circuit court for the northern district of Ohio, and thereupon applied to the same court for a writ of habeas corpus, the petition alleging, as in this case, that he was restrained of his liberty in violation of the Constitution, and that the circuit court had no jurisdiction to commit him. The writ was refused, and a direct appeal was taken to this court. \n\n[216 U.S. 139, 145]\n\u00a0\n After pointing out that the jurisdiction of the circuit court to issue a writ of habeas corpus was not in issue, but that jurisdiction was entertained, this court said:\n'Nor can the attempt be successfully made to bring the case within the class of cases in which the construction or application of the Constitution is involved in the sense of the statute, on the contention that the petitioner was deprived of his liberty without due process of law. The petition does not proceed on any such theory, but entirely on the ground of want of jurisdiction in the prior case over the subject-matter and over the person of petitioner, in respect of inquiry into which the jurisdiction of the circuit court was sought. If, in the opinion of that court, the restraining order had been absolutely void, or the petitioner were not bound by it, he would have been discharged, not because he would otherwise be deprived of due process, but because of the invalidity of the proceedings for want of jurisdiction. The opinion of the circuit court was that jurisdiction in the prior suit and proceedings existed, and the discharge was refused; but an appeal from that judgment directly to this court would not, therefore, lie on the ground that the application of the Constitution was involved as a consequence of an alleged erroneous determination of the questions actually put in issue by the petitioner.'\n\n Carey v.

Alexander Chiles, in propria persona, Albert S. White, W. L. Ricks, and B. E. Smith for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. John T. Shelby, Henry T. Wickham, and Henry Taylor, Jr., for defendant in error. \n\n[218 U.S. 71, 72]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Plaintiff in error is a colored man. He bought a first-class ticket from defendant in error, a corporation engaged in operating a line of railroad from the city of Louisville, state of Kentucky, and the city of Cincinnati, state of Ohio, to the city of Washington, District of Columbia. The ticket entitled him to ride from Washington to Lexington, Kentucky.\n The train which he took at Washington did not run through to Lexington, and he changed to another train at Ashland, Kentucky, going into a car which, it is alleged, under the rules and regulations of defendant in error, was set apart exclusively for white persons. From this car he was required to remove to a car set apart exclusively for the transportation of colored persons.\n He removed under protest, and only after a police officer had been summoned by defendant in error. Subsequently he brought this action in the circuit court of Fayette county, Kentucky. The case was tried to a jury, which rendered a verdict against him. A motion for a new trial was overruled. He appealed to the court of appeals of the state, and the action and judgment of the trial court were affirmed.\n The assignments of error in this court depend upon the contention that plaintiff in error was an interstate passenger, and was entitled to a first-class passage from Washington to Lexington, and that therefore the act of defendant in error, in causing him to be removed from the car at Ashland, was a violation of his rights, and subjected the railroad company to damages.\n The court of appeals of the state made the case turn on a narrow ground; to wit, the right which, it was decided, a railroad company had 'to establish such rules and regulations as will require white and colored passengers, \n\n[218 U.S. 71, 73]\n\u00a0\n although they may be interstate, to occupy separate compartments upon the train.' The court, however, said that there could be no discrimination in the accommodations.\n The court found the facts of the removal of plaintiff, and the character of the car to which he was required to remove, as follows:\n'This Lexington train is made up of four coaches: the first, and the one nearest the engine, being a combined baggage, mail, and express car; the second is a passenger coach, divided by board partitions into three compartments; one of these compartments, located in the end of the car, is set apart for colored passengers; the middle compartment is for the use of colored passengers who smoke; and the end compartment is for the accommodation of white persons who smoke; the third car is a passenger coach intended for the use of white ladies and gentlemen; the fourth car is a sleeping car that runs through from Washington to Lexington. Appellant, when he attempted to get on the Lexington train, was told by the brakeman to go in the colored apartment. This he declined to do, and walked in and took a seat in the third coach, set apart for the exclusive use of white passengers. In a few moments the conductor came in and asked the appellant, in obedience to a rule of the company, to go forward in the apartment set apart for colored passengers, but he refused to do so, stating that he had bought a through first-class ticket from Washington to Lexington, and was an interstate passenger who knew his rights, and that the separate-coach law of Kentucky did not apply to him, and declared his intention of retaining the seat he occupied. Thereupon the conductor summoned a policeman, who also requested appellant to go in the other car, and, upon his refusal, he was informed that he would be compelled to leave the car in which he was seated. Appellant, yet insisting upon his right to remain in the \n\n[218 U.S. 71, 74]\n\u00a0\n car in which he was, followed the policeman into the colored passenger coach.' [125 Ky. 302, 101 S. W. 386.]\n\n The court further said:\n'There is really no material issue of fact involved in the case. No force or violence, or rude or oppressive conduct, was employed by the agents of appellee in removing appellant from the car in which he was seated to the car set apart for colored persons. And except that the car into which he was removed is divided by partitions into three compartments, it was substantially equal in quality, convenience, and accommodation to the car in which he first seated himself, and the compartment into which appellant was directed to go was clean and ample for his accommodation, and equipped with the same convenience as the other passenger coach on the train from which he was ejected.'\n\n In this the court came to the same conclusion as the jury. Plaintiff in error insists that this conclusion put out of view his rights as an interstate commerce passenger. Both courts ignored such rights, he contends, the trial court, in refusing instructions that were requested and in its ruling on the trial, and the court of appeals, in affirming the judgment which was based upon the verdict.\n We need not set out the instructions nor the rulings. The complaint of the action of the court rests upon the contention that, as against an interstate passenger, the regulation of the company in providing different cars for the white and colored races is void. There is a statute of Kentucky which requires railroad companies to furnish separate coaches for white and colored passengers, but the court of appeals of the state put the statute out of consideration, declaring that it had no application to interstate trains, and defendant in error does not rest its defense upon that statute, but upon its rules and regulations. Plaintiff in error makes some effort to keep the statute in the case, and says that the trial court, by its ruling upon \n\n[218 U.S. 71, 75]\n\u00a0\n testimony and by its instructions, confined 'the jury only to the lesser motive' of defendant's 'wrongful act.' In other words, as we understand plaintiff in error, confined the jury to the consideration of the regulations of the railroad company, and withdrew from its consideration the effect of the statute under which, it is said, the conductor declared he acted. But by this we understand plaintiff in error to illustrate that his rights as an interstate passenger were denied. We are, therefore, brought back to the question what his rights as such passenger were.\n The elements of that question have been considered and passed on in a number of cases. And we must keep in mind that we are not dealing with the law of a state attempting a regulation of interstate commerce beyond its power to make. We are dealing with the act of a private person, to wit, the railroad company; and the distinction between state and interstate commerce we think is unimportant.\n In Hall v. DeCuir, \n95 U.S. 485\n, 24 L. ed. 547, the court passed on an act of the state of Louisiana, which required those engaged in the transportation of passengers among the states to give all passengers traveling within that state, upon vessels employed in such business, equal rights and privileges in all parts of the vessel, without distinction on account of race or color, and subjected to an action for damages the owner of such vessel who excluded colored passengers on account of their color from the cabin set apart for whites during the passage. It was held that the act was a regulation of interstate commerce and was void. The court said, by Chief Justice Waite, after stating that the power of regulating interstate commerce was exclusively in Congress, 'This power of regulation may be exercised without legislation as well as with it.' And that, 'by refraining from action, Congress, in effect, adopts as its own regulations those which the common \n\n[218 U.S. 71, 76]\n\u00a0\n law or the civil law, where that prevails, has provided for the government of such business.' The court further said, quoting from Welton v. Missouri, \n91 U.S. 282\n, 23 L. ed. 350, that 'inaction [by Congress] . . . is equivalent to a declaration that interstate commerce shall remain free and untrammeled.' And added: 'Applying that principle to the circumstances of this case, congressional inaction left Beason [the shipowner] at liberty to adopt such reasonable rules and regulations for the disposition of passengers upon his boat while pursuing her voyage within Louisiana or without as seemed to him most for the interest of all concerned.' This language is pertinent to the case at bar, and demonstrates that the contention of the plaintiff in error is untenable. In other words, demonstrates that the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution does not constrain the action of carriers, but, on the contrary, leaves them to adopt rules and regulations for the government of their business, free from any interference except by Congress. Such rules and regulations, of course, must be reasonable, but whether they be such cannot depend upon a passenger being state or interstate. This also is manifest from the cited case. There, as we have seen, an interstate colored passenger was excluded from the privileges of the cabin set apart for white persons by a regulation of the carrier, and where the colored passenger's right to be was attempted to be provided by a state statute. The statute was declared invalid, because it attempted to force a carrier to do the very thing which plaintiff in error complains was not done in the case at bar; to wit, permit him to ride in the place set apart for white passengers. In other words, the statute was struck down because it interfered with the regulations of the carrier as to interstate passengers. This court commented on the case subsequently in Louisville, N. O. & T. R. Co. v. Mississippi, \n133 \nU.S. 587, 590\n, 33 S. L. ed. 784, 785, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 801, 802, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 348, 349, and siad: 'Obviously, whether interstate passengers of one race should, in any portion \n\n[218 U.S. 71, 77]\n\u00a0\n of their journey, be compelled to share their cabin accommodations with passengers of another race, was a question of interstate commerce, and to be determined by Congress alone.' We have seen that it was decided in Hall v. DeCuir that the inaction of Congress was equivalent to the declaration that a carrier could, by regulations, separate colored and white interstate passengers.\n In Plessy v. Ferguson, \n163 U.S. 540\n, 41 L. ed. 257, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1138, a statute of Louisiana which required railroad companies to provide separate accommodations for the white and colored races was considered. The statute was attacked on the ground that it violated the 13th and 14th Amendments of the Constitution of the United States. The opinion of the court, which was by Mr. Justice Brown, reviewed prior cases, and not only sustained the law, but justified as reasonable the distinction between the races on account of which the statute was passed and enforced. It is true the power of a legislature to recognize a racial distinction was the subject considered, but if the test of reasonableness in legislation be, as it was declared to be, 'the established usages, customs, and traditions of the people,' and the 'promotion of their comfort and the preservation of the public peace and good order,' this must also be the test of the reasonableness of the regulations of a carrier, made for like purpose and to secure like results. Regulations which are induced by the general sentiment of the community for whom they are made and upon whom they operate cannot be said to be unreasonable. See also Chesapeake & O. R. Co. v. Kentucky, \n179 U.S. 388\n, 45 L. ed. 244, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 101.\n The extent of the difference based upon the distinction between the white and colored races which may be observed in legislation or in the regulations of carriers has been discussed so much that we are relieved from further enlargement upon it. We may refer to Mr. Justice Clifford's concurring opinion in Hall v. DeCuir for a review \n\n[218 U.S. 71, 78]\n\u00a0\n of the cases. They are also cited in Plessy v. Ferguson at page 550. We think the judgment should be affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice Harlan dissents from the opinion and judgment. \n\n\n\n","25":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCINCINNATI, I. & W. RY.

McKee for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n The common council of Connersville, Indiana, adopted a resolution declaring that a railway embankment maintained by the Cincinnati, Indianapolis, & Western Railway Company, the plaintiff in error, across Grand avenue, in that city, obstructed passage between the north and south ends of the avenue; also, that such avenue should, as a matter of public necessity, be opened as a public street through said railroad embankment. \n\n[218 U.S. 336, 341]\n\u00a0\n The question of the expediency, advisability, and public utility of opening up the avenue through the embankment was thereupon referred to the city commissioners, and to the council's committee on streets, alleys, and bridges, for action. Upon consideration of the matter at a time of which public notice was duly given, and after an examination of the ground sought to be appropriated, the commissioners reported that the opening of the avenue through the railroad embankment would be of public utility. The report stated that the real estate to be appropriated by the opening of the avenue was so much of the railroad embankment as extended the entire width of the avenue, as then used and opened, immediately north and south of such embankment. The tract sought to be appropriated was 66 feet square and was occupied by the embankment. The commissioners found and reported that no real estate would be damaged by the proposed opening other than that sought to be appropriated, and that the real estate abutting on both sides of the avenue would be benefited by the proposed opening of the street. There was a hearing-after due notice to all parties concerned, including the railroad company-of the question of injuries and benefits to the property to be appropriated, and of the benefits and damages to all real estate resulting from the opening of the avenue. The result of the hearing was a report by the city commissioners in favor of the opening, and the value of the real estate sought to be appropriated was estimated at $150.\n The city council adopted the report of the commissioners, and appropriated for the purpose of opening Grand avenue the real estate described in the report as necessary to such opening,-the property here in question being a part of that to be appropriated. The council also directed that a certified copy of so much of the report as assessed benefits and damages be delivered to the \n\n[218 U.S. 336, 342]\n\u00a0\n treasurer of the city, and copied in full on the records of the council, with the minute of the adoption of the resolution describing the real estate appropriated.\n There were various exceptions by the railway company and by the city, followed by a trial before a jury, which found for the railway company and assessed its damages at $800. A motion by the company for a new trial having been overruled, and a judgment entered for the defendant company, in the state court of original jurisdiction, the case was carried to the supreme court of Indiana (which affirmed the judgment), and it is now here for a re-examination as to certain Federal questions raised by the railway company.\n It was not disputed at the trial that the improvement of Grand avenue, as ordered by the city of Connersville, made it necessary to construct a bridge over and across the avenue as reconstructed.\n The trial court gave the following, among other, instructions to the jury: 'It being the duty of the defendant railroad company to construct and keep in safe and good condition all highway crossings, the defendant in this action would not be entitled to any damages for constructing the necessary erossing nor abutments and bridge for supporting its railroad over and across said street when constructed.'\n It refused to give this instruction asked by the railway company: 'If the appropriation of the defendant's property under the proceedings set forth in this case will necessarily and proximately cause expense to the defendant in constructing a bridge to carry its railroad over the proposed street, in order that its railroad tracks may have support and its railroad may be operated as such, and as an entire line, and such construction of said bridge will be required for no other purpose, then, in determining the defendant's damages, you should consider the expense of constructing such bridge.' \n\n[218 U.S. 336, 343]\n\u00a0\n The railway company duly excepted to this action of the trial court, but the supreme court of Indiana held that there was no error.\n There are twenty assignments of error, accompanied by an extended brief of argument. In addition, a great many authorities are cited by the learned counsel for the railway company. If we should deal with each assignment and argument separately, and enter upon a critical examination of the authorities cited, this opinion would be of undue length. We think the case is within a very narrow compass. This seems to be the view of learned counsel of the plaintiff in error, for, after a general reference to various questions raised at the trial, counsel say that 'the case, upon final analysis, reduces itself to the question whether the police power [ of the state] can be so applied as to require the railroad company to build the bridge without compensation.'\n If the railway company was not entitled to compensation on account of the construction of this bridge,-whether regard be had to the 5th or the 14th Amendments of the Constitution, or to the general reserved police power of the state,-then it is clear that the jury were not misdirected as to what should be considered by them in estimating the damages which, under the law, the railway company was entitled to recover.\n The question as to the right of the railway company to be reimbursed for any moneys necessarily expended in constructing the bridge in question is, we think, concluded by former decisions of this court; particularly by Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Illinois, \n200 \nU.S. 562, 582\n, 584 S., 591, 50 L. ed. 601, 605, 606, 608, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 341, 4 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 1175; New Orleans Gaslight Co. v.

United States, \n204 U.S. 364\n, 51 L. ed. 523, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 367. The railway company accepted its franchise from the state, \n\n[218 U.S. 336, 344]\n\u00a0\n subject necessarily to the condition that it would conform at its own expense to any regulations, not arbitrary in their character, as to the opening or use of streets, which had for their object the safety of the public, or the promotion of the public convenience, and which might, from time to time, be established by the municipality, when proceeding under legislative authority, within whose limits the company's business was conducted. This court has said that 'the power, whether called police, governmental, or legislative, exists in each state, by appropriate enactments not forbidden by its own Constitution or by the Constitution of the United States, to regulate the relative rights and duties of all persons and corporations within its jurisdiction, and therefore to provide for the public convenience and the public good.'

Rep. 465, 470.\n Without further discussion, and without referring to other matters mentioned by counsel, we adjudge, upon the authority of former cases, that there was no error in holding that the city could not be compelled to reimburse the railway company for the cost of the bridge in question.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","26":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCINCINNATI, N.O. & T.P. RY. CO. v. SLADE(1910)\nNo. 79\nArgued: January 14, 1910Decided: January 31, 1910\n\n\n\n The Cincinnati, New Orleans, & Texas Pacific Railway Company- hereafter referred to as the railway company-is a corporation organized under the laws of Ohio, and operates lines of railroad in several states other than Georgia.\n On May 14, 1907, Pless & Slade, a partnership, asserting a claim against the railway company, resulting from the alleged negligent carriage of a car load of horses and mules, received at a point in Kentucky, for through carriage to Pless & Slade, at Cordele, Georgia, procured an attachment to be issued from the city court of Cordele, under which a box car belonging to the company was seized. The railway company gave 'a replevy bond, or a bond to release the attachment . . . and on the filing of such bond the attachment became dissolved.' The railway company, specially entering its appear- \n\n[216 U.S. 78, 79]\n\u00a0\n ance, moved to quash, first, upon the ground that it was a foreign corporation, and had no agent, office, or place of business, and transacted no business, in the state of Georgia, and was not susceptible of being therein sued; and, second, because the box car came into the state under a contract of interstate shipment, and could not be attached in Georgia without imposing a direct burden upon interstate commerce, in violation of the laws of the United States regulating that subject. On July 26, 1907, the plaintiffs demurred to the motion to quash, and filed an answer to the same, and on the same day filed their declaration in attachment. On August 3, 1907, the railway company, appearing only for that purpose, filed a formal plea to the jurisdiction of the court. In this plea, with great elaboration, the grounds previously asserted in the motion to quash were reiterated. The plaintiffs demurred to this plea, and also answered the same. Both demurrers, the one to the motion to quash and the other to the plea to the jurisdiction, were heard together. The demurrers were sustained, and exceptions were only reserved. Thereupon the railway company both demurred to and answered the declaration in attachment. The demurrer challenged the sufficiency of the declaration to show jurisdiction in the court, because it was not averred that the railway company was transacting business or had an office, agent, or place of business in the county where the suit was brought or in the state of Georgia; that it was not charged that the acts of negligence for which recovery was sought had been committed in the state of Georgia; and because, on the contrary, the contract relied upon in the declaration was stated therein to have been made in Kentucky. The answer, after reserving the benefit of the demurrer, traversed the declaration on the merits, and, as a special defense, again set up that the railway company had no line of road in the state, or agent therein, and transacted no business in Georgia, and therefore was not subject to be therein sued. Concerning the box car which had been attached, it was specially set up that, in order to save breaking bulk and re- \n\n[216 U.S. 78, 80]\n\u00a0\n loading at connecting points, the railway company had an agreement with connecting carriers by which its cars, when loaded on its line with freight for points in Georgia, should not be unloaded at the terminus of the company's road, but should be transferred to the connecting carrier for delivery in Georgia, such carrier coming under an obligation to return the cars with all possible despatch. It was alleged that the car in question was delivered under these circumstances, and was hence not subject to attachment in Georgia.\n The demurrer was overruled. The court also sustained a demurrer filed on behalf of the plaintiffs to the special defenses set up by the railway company in its answer, to which we have previously adverted. To these rulings of the court exceptions were noted by the railway company and made part of the record. The case went to trial upon the merits, and at the close of the evidence the court directed a verdict for the plaintiffs. The case was taken to the court of appeals of Georgia, where the judgment was affirmed. 3 Ga. App. 400, 60 S. E. 8. This writ of error to the court of appeals was allowed by the chief judge upon the ground that the court of appeals was the highest court of the state in which a decision in the suit could be had, and upon the averments made in the petition for the allowance of a writ of error, that grounds of Federal cognizance were presented by the record.\n Messrs. D. A. R. Crum and J. Gordon Jones for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Joseph T. Hill for defendants in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice White:\n\n Mr. Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n In the trial on the merits it was shown that a shipment of live stock had been made from a point in Kentucky under a \n\n[216 U.S. 78, 81]\n\u00a0\n contract with the railway company for delivery at Cordele, Georgia, the contract contemplating the movement of the shipment over the line of the railway company, and the transfer by it of the car to connecting carriers for delivery at the point of destination. It was this contract of shipment out of which it was alleged the claim arose which was the basis of the attachment. The railway company offered in evidence the written contract, and then rested its defense. This contract of shipment contained various provisions limiting the common-law liability of the railway company. Thereupon the record recites as follows:\n'Mr. Hill offers in evidence for plaintiff  196 of the Constitution of the state of Kentucky, as follows:\n\n\"Transportation of freight and passengers by railroad, steamboat, or other carrier, shall be so regulated by general law as to prevent unjust discrimination. No common carrier shall be permitted to contract for relief from its common-law liability.'\n\n'Mr. Jones [for railway company] objects that the regulation as provided for in this section should accompany it, and unless it does it is irrelevant and inadmissible; that it is merely a paragraph of the Constitution of the state giving the legislature and laws. He further objects to it on the ground that this suit is brought under the Georgia laws, and is not a suit on a Kentucky contract.\n\n'Objection overruled.\n\n'Plaintiff announces closed.\n\n'Mr. Hill moves the court to direct a verdict for plaintiff for the amount sued for.\n\n'Mr. Jones [for railway company] insists that the contract offered is a legal contract, and forms an issue for the jury to pass upon.'\n\n Concerning the questions of jurisdiction raised by the pleadings, the court of appeals, to which the case was taken, held as follows: 1st. That by the requirements of  1475 of the Georgia Civil Code, and by the application of the law of the \n\n[216 U.S. 78, 82]\n\u00a0\n state as expounded in repeated decisions of the supreme court, 'the giving of the replevy bond was a general appearance by the defendant, dissolving the attachment, and converting it from an action in rem into an action in personam.' 2d. That, under the law of the state, 'the filing of a general demurrer or an answer, not under protestation, and without expressly reserving the special appearance, waives the special appearance.' Applying these general propositions, it was decided that 'the defendant having, by filing a replevy bond, a demurrer, and an answer, submitted itself personally to the jurisdiction of the court, with the right to make only such defenses as it could have made if it had been personally served with process, and the surety on the replevy bond making no complaint against the judgment, it becomes immaterial whether the levy of the attachment was regular or not, or whether the property seized was subject to levy; and these questions are therefore not for decision. King v. Randall, 95 Ga. 449, 22 S. E. 683. The defendant had the right to replevy, irrespective of whether the property was subject or not subject to the levy. Swift v. Tatner, 89 Ga. 660, 673, 32 Am. St. Rep. 101, 15 S. E. 842. In affirming the judgment on the merits, the contract of shipment out of which the controversy arose was treated as a Kentucky contract. Certain limitations therein were held to be void under the laws of that state, and other provisions which were held not to be repugnant to those laws were decided not to exempt the railway company from liability.\n The assignments of error are eleven in number, but when the reiterations which they contain are put out of view, it is apparent on their face that, in their broadest aspect, they embrace only two questions of a Federal nature: First, that the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over the railway company, as the levy upon the box car was a direct burden upon, and, at all events, was repugnant to the legislation of Congress on the subject of, interstate commerce; and, second, that a right under the same legislation to the benefit of the laws of the United States in construing the contract of shipment upon \n\n[216 U.S. 78, 83]\n\u00a0\n which the cause of action arose was denied by the decision of the state court. But, as we have previously shown, on the face of the record it is apparent that the court of appeals did not pass upon the question whether the levy of the attachment was regular, or whether the property seized was subject to levy. It held, construing the statutes of Georgia relating to attachments and the decisions of the highest court of the state, that it was unnecessary to decide those questions, because they had been waived by the conduct of the railway company in giving a replevy bond and answering, etc., without protestation. It follows that no Federal question is presented as to the issue concerning jurisdiction, since the ruling below was based exclusively upon a non-Federal ground broad enough to sustain it without considering or referring to the alleged Federal question. It is besides to be observed that the plaintiff in error in argument does not question the correctness of the deductions drawn by the court below from the prior decisions of the supreme court of the state of Georgia. Indeed, there is nothing in the record showing that any question was raised below as to the repugnancy to the Constitution of the United States of the statute of Georgia concerning the giving of a bond to release attached property, as construed by the supreme court of Georgia. See, in this connection, the cases of York v. Texas, \n137 \nU.S. 15, 20\n, 34 S. L. ed. 604, 605, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 9; Kauffman v. Wootters, \n138 U.S. 285\n, 34 L. ed. 962, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 298; and Mexican C. R. Co. v. Pinkney, \n149 \nU.S. 194, 205\n, 37 S. L. ed. 699, 703, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 859.\n The second proposition is that, as the court below construed the contract of shipment upon which the cause of action depended by the law of Kentucky, where it was made, instead of by the laws of the United States regulating interstate commerce, thereby a Federal right was denied. But this contention is at once disposed of by saying that the assertion of Federal right upon which it rests finds no support in the record, as it does not appear to have been urged below, or called to the attention of, or decided by, the appellate court. On the contrary, as we have previously shown, the contention made at the trial by the railway company was not that the contract of \n\n[216 U.S. 78, 84]\n\u00a0\n shipment was to be governed by the laws of the United States, but that it should be treated as a Georgia, and not as a Kentucky, contract.\n From these considerations it results that the record presents no Federal question, and the writ of error is therefore dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n Dismissed. \n\n\n\n","27":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITIZENS' CENTRAL NAT BANK OF NEW YORK v. APPLETON(1910)\nNo. 113\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. John A. Garver and James M. Beck for plaintiff in error.[ Citizens' Central Nat Bank of New York v. Appleton \n216 U.S. 196\n (1910) ]\n\n\n[216 U.S. 196, 198]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Hutchinson, Jr., Julius M. Mayer, and H. Snowden Marshall for defendant in error.\n\n\n[216 U.S. 196, 200]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n This action was commenced in the Supreme court of New York by the receiver of the Cooper Exchange Bank, a New York corporation, against the Citizens' Central National Bank of New York, a national bank corporation formed by the consolidation (Rev. Stat.  5220 and 5221, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3503), of the Central National Bank of the city of New York with the National Citizens' Bank of the same city. The action was dismissed on demurrer to the complaint, and that judgment was affirmed in the appellate division. 116 App. Div. 404, 101 N. Y. Supp. 1027. But on writ of error to the highest court of New York, the judgment was reversed (190 N. Y. 417, 83 N. E. 470), and the cause was remitted to the supreme court of that state for judgment in accordance with the opinion of the former court.\n The complaint alleges--\n That the defendant, the Citizens' Central National Bank of New York, by the consolidation referred to, acquired all the assets and became subject to the liabilities of the Central National Bank of that city.\n That on and prior to January 4th, 1904, one Michael Samuels was indebted to the Central National Bank in the sum of $10,000.\n That 'at the instance and request of Samuels, trading under the name of Mikael Samuels & Company, and the Central National Bank of the city of New York,' the Cooper Exchange Bank loaned and advanced to the former the sum of $12,000, Samuels executing his written obligation, dated January 4th, \n\n[216 U.S. 196, 201]\n\u00a0\n 1904, to return or repay the same on or before four months after date with interest, and at the same time, the Central National Bank of the city of New York, under seal, executed a written guaranty for the payment of the debt, as follows: 'For and in consideration of $1 and other good and valuable considerations, the Central National Bank of the city of New York hereby guarantees to the Cooper Exchange Bank the payment at maturity of a loan of $12,000, made this day to Mikael Samuels & Company by the Cooper Exchange Bank.'\n That previous to the obtaining of said loan of $12,000, Samuels 'agreed with the said Central National Bank to pay to it the said sum of $ 10,000 of the said $12,000 so obtained, and the said loan was obtained by the said Mikael Samuels and was graranteed by the said Central National Bank in order that the said Central National Bank might obtain the said sum of $10,000, which it did receive and which was owed to it by the said Samuels.'\n That previous to the maturity of the loan, namely, on January 30th, 1904, only a few weeks after the loan was made, Samuels was adjudged a bankrupt. And--\n That no part of said loan had ever been paid, except $1,000, which was paid April 7th, 1906\n\n\n The court of appeals of New York-Cullen, Ch. J., delivering the opinion-held and the counsel for the Cooper Exchange Bank conceded in that court, that no recovery could be had against the guaranteeing bank in excess of the amount actually received by it out of the $12,000 loaned, as above stated. 190 N. Y. 417, 83 N. E. 470. The case being remitted to the inferior state court, judgment was therefor rendered against the defendant only for $10,000, with interest from January 4th, 1904, with costs in all courts.\n The plaintiff in error insists that the guaranty given by the Central National Bank to the Cooper Exchange Bank was beyond its power, was in violation of the national banking act, and, therefore, could not be made the foundation of an \n\n[216 U.S. 196, 202]\n\u00a0\n action against the grarantor bank. But this action need not be regarded as one on the written contract of guaranty, but as based on an implied contract between the Cooper Exchange Bank and the Central National Bank, whereby the latter, under the circumstances disclosed by the record, came under a duty to account to the former for the $10,000 of the $12,000 actually paid to Samuels at its request and on its guaranty. The law would be very impotent to do justice if it could not, under those circumstances, and without violating established legal principles, compel the Central National Bank to recognize and discharge that duty. Samuels owed the Central National Bank $10,000, and-with knowledge, perhaps, of his financial condition-he was put forward by that bank to obtain $12,000 from the Cooper Exchange Bank, so that it could get $10,000 out of that sum, for its own use. The circumstances show that the latter bank would not have loaned the money to Samuels except at the request and on the guaranty of the Central National Bank. All this, it may be observed, occurred under a previous agreement between the Central National Bank and Samuels, that that bank was to have $10,000 of the $12,000 in discharge of its claim upon him. In short, the Central National Bank, by means of the device mentioned, got $10,000 of the money of the Cooper Exchange Bank for its own use, and having used it for its own benefit, it now seeks to avoid liability therefor, upon the ground that it was not allowed by the law of its creation to execute the guaranty in question. We know of no adjudged case that stands in the way of relief being granted as asked by the plaintiff. But there are many that will authorize such relief.\n In Logan County Nat. Bank v. Townsend, \n139 \nU.S. 67, 74\n, 35 S. L. ed. 107, 110, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 496, it appears that a national bank purchased, at a stipulated price, certain municipal bonds, which it agreed to return to the seller upon demand, or replace them at the same or a less price. Demand was subsequently made on the bank to return or replace the bonds according to the agreement. But it failed to do either, and when sued for the value of the bonds it \n\n[216 U.S. 196, 203]\n\u00a0\n pleaded, as a defense, the absence, under the law of its creation, of any authority or power on its part to make the above contract. This court said: 'If it be assumed, in accordance with the bank's contention, that it was without power to purchase these bonds, to be replaced to the plaintiff, on demand, the question would still remain, whether, notwithstanding the act of Congress defining and limiting its powers, it was exempt from liability to the plaintiff for the value of the bonds, if it refused, upon demand, to replace or surrender them at the same or a less price. . . . And from the time of such demand and its refusal to return the bonds to the vendor or owner, it becomes liable for their value upon grounds apart from the contract under which it obtained them. It could not rightfully hold them under or by virtue of the contract, and, at the same time, refuse to comply with the terms of purchase. If the bank's want of power, under the statute, to make such a contract of purchase, may be pleaded in bar of all claims against it based upon the contract,-and we are assuming, for the purposes of this case, that it may be,-it is bound, upon demand, accompanied by a tender back of the price it paid, to surrender the bonds to its vendor. The bank, in this case, insisting that it obtained the bonds of the plaintiff in violation of the act of Congress, is bound, upon being made whole, to return them to him. No exemption or immunity from this principle of right and duty is given by the national banking act. 'The obligation to do justice,' this court said in Marsh v. Fulton County, 10 Wall. 676, 684, 19 L. ed. 1040, 1043, 'rests upon all persons, natural and artificial; and if a county obtains the money or property of others without authority, the law, independently of any statute, will compel restitution or compensation.\"\n The case of Aldrich v. Chemical Nat. Bank, \n176 U.S. 618\n, 44 L. ed. 611, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 498, is equally in point. A vice president of a national bank, without authority from it, borrowed money from another national bank, and placed the amount in still another bank to the credit of the bank which he assumed to represent in the transaction. The national bank in whose name the \n\n[216 U.S. 196, 204]\n\u00a0\n money was deposited drew the money out by check and applied it in discharge of its own valid obligations; and when it was sought to hold it liable, the defense, in part, was that the original borrowing was not only unauthorized by it, but was in violation of the national banking act. Upon an extended review of the authorities, this court said: 'As the money of the Chemical Bank was obtained under a loan negotiated by the vice president of the Fidelity Bank, who assumed to represent it in the transaction, and, as the Fidelity Bank used the money so obtained in its banking business and for its own benefit, the latter bank, having enjoyed the fruits of the transaction, cannot avoid accountability to the New York bank, even if it were true, as contended, that the Fidelity Bank could not, consistently with the law of its creation, have itself borrowed the money . . . . If the latter bank in this way used the money obtained from the Chemical Bank, it is under an implied obligation to pay it back or account for it to the New York bank. It cannot escape liability on the ground merely that it was not permitted by its charter to obtain money from another bank. Suppose the Fidelity Bank, by its check upon the Chemical Bank, had drawn the whole $300,000 at one time, and now had the money in its possession, unused? It would not be allowed to hold the money even if it were without power, under its charter, to have borrowed it from the Chemical Bank for use in its business. Or suppose a national bank, in violation of the act of Congress, takes as security for a loan made by it a deed of trust of real estate, and subsequently causes the property to be sold and the proceeds applied in payment of its claim against the borrower, a surplus being left in its hands, which it uses in its business or in discharge of its obligations. If sued by the borrower for the amount of such surplus, could the bank successfully resist payment upon the ground that the statute forbade it to make a loan of money on real estate security? Common honesty requires this question to be answered in the negative. But it could not be so answered if it be true that the Fidelity Bank could \n\n[216 U.S. 196, 205]\n\u00a0\n use in its business and for its benefit money obtained by one of its officers from another bank, under the pretense of a loan, and be discharged from liability therefor upon the ground that it could not itself have directly borrowed from the other bank the money so obtained and used. There is nothing in the acts of Congress authorizing or permitting a national bank to appropriate and use the money or property of others for its benefit without liability for so doing.'\n These views are supported by many other adjudged cases. In Central Transp. Co. v. Pullman's Palace Car Co. \n139 \nU.S. 24, 60\n, 35 S. L. ed. 55, 68, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 478, the court, speaking by Mr. Justice Gray, said: 'A contract ultra vires being unlawful and void, not because it is in itself immoral, but because the corporation, by the law of its creation, is incapable of making it, the courts, while refusing to maintain any action upon the unlawful contract, have always striven to do justice between the parties, so far as could be done consistently with adherence to law, by permitting property or money, parted with on the faith of the unlawful contract, to be recovered back, or compensation to be made for it. In such case, however, the action is not maintained upon the unlawful contract, nor according to its terms, but on an implied contract of the defendant to return, or, failing to do that, to make compensation for, property or money which it has no right to retain. To maintain such an action is not to affirm, but to disaffirm, the unlawful contract.' So, in Pullman's Car Co. v. Central Transp. Co. \n171 \nU.S. 138, 151\n, 43 S. L. ed. 108, 114, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 808, the court, speaking by Mr. Justice Peckham, said: 'The right to a recovery of the property transferred under an illegal contract is founded upon the implied promise to return or to make compensation for it.' Other cases are cited in the margin. \n Merchants' Nat. Bank v. State Nat. Bank, 10 Wall 604, 644, 19 L. ed. 1008, 1018; United States v. State Nat. Bank, \n96 \nU.S. 30, 36\n, 24 S.

It is entirely clear that the judgment against the defendant bank-which came into the possession of the property, and was subject to the liabilities, of the Central National Bank-was consistent with sound legal principles and was intrinsically right, even if the guaranty in question was beyond the power of the guaranteeing bank, under the national banking statutes. Whatever may be said as to the validity of the written guaranty, now alleged to be illegal, the judgment can be supported as based wholly on the implied contract, which made it the duty of the Central National Bank, under the facts disclosed, to account to the Cooper Exchange Bank for the money obtained from the latter in execution of the agreement made by the former with the borrower.\n The judgment must be affirmed.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","28":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITIZENS' NAT BANK v. KENTUCKY(1910)\nNo. 135\nArgued: March 10, 1910Decided: May 2, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 443, 444]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert Taylor Quisenberry for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 443, 447]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John W. Yerkes for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Lurton delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was a proceeding under the law of Kentucky to back assess the shares of stock in the Citizens National Bank as property omitted from the tax list. After much petitioning, pleading, and demurring, and two appeals to the court of appeals of the state of Kentucky, 1,473 shares were assessed for the taxes of 1896, 1897, and 1898, and 990 shares for the taxes of 1899, with a penalty of 20 per cent added to the tax each year. The proceeding under which this result has been reached was started in the county court of Boyle county, Kentucky, in March, 1901, by a petition filed by the sheriff of the county for the purpose of causing the shares of the bank to be assessed as property omitted by the assessor. The authority under which the petition was filed is found in  4241, Kentucky Statutes, and the Kentucky act of March 21, 1900. As the validity of this later act is challenged, we set it out in the margin. \n Whereas the Supreme Court of the United Sattes has lately decided that article three (3), CHAPTER 103, of the acts of 1891-1892-1893, is void and of no effect in so far as the same provides for taxation of the franchise of national banks, in consequence of which decision there is not now and has not been, since the adoption of said article in 1892, any adequate mode of taxing national banks, while state banks are now, and have been, ever since 1892, taxable for all purposes, state and local, therefore\n Be it enacted by the general assembly of the commonwealth of Kentucky:\n Sec. 1. That the shares of stock in each national bank of this state shall be subject to taxation for all state purposes, and shall be subject to taxation for the purposes of each county, city, town, and taxing district in which the bank is located.\n Sec. 2. For the purposes of the taxation provided for by the next preceding section, it shall be the duty of the president and the cashier of the bank to list the said shares of stock with the assessing officers authorized to assess real estate for taxation, and the bank shall be and remain liable to the state, county, city, town, and district for the taxes upon said shares of stock.\n Sec. 3. When any of said shares of stock have not been listed for taxation for any of said purposes, under levy or levies of any year since the adoption of the revenue law of 1892, it shall be the duty of the president and the cashier to list the same for taxation under said levy or levies: Provided, That where any national bank has heretofore, for any year or years, paid taxes upon its franchise, as provided in article three ( 3) of the revenue law of 1892, said bank shall be excepted from the operation of this section as to said year or years: And provided further, That where any national bank has heretofore, for any year or years, paid state taxes under the Hewitt bill in excess of the state taxes required by this act for the same year or years, said bank shall be entitled to credit by said excess upon its state taxes required by this act. \n\n[217 U.S. 443, 448]\n\u00a0\n In the case of the Owensboro Nat. Bank v. Owensboro, \n173 U.S. 664\n, 43 L. ed. 850, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 537, this court held invalid certain legislation of the state of Kentucky, providing for the taxation of national banks, as laying a tax, not upon shares, which was permissible, but upon the property and franchises of such banks, which was \n\n[217 U.S. 443, 449]\n\u00a0\n inadmissible under the restrictions of  5219, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3502). In consequence of this decision, this act of March 21, 1900, was passed, as shown both by its subject-matter and the recital in the preamble. The act is both prospective and retrospective. Of its prospective features, we need say nothing. The 3d section is retrospective, in that provides for the return of shares in national banks which, during the years of the operation of the legislation held invalid by this court, had not been returned for taxation, by making it the duty of certain officers of such banks to list for taxation for the years between 1892 and 1899, all shares in such banks which had not been returned, and by requiring all such banks to pay the tax and penalty upon all such omitted shares, subject, however, to certain deductions and credits on account of taxes paid by such banks under the act held invalid, as well as under the prior Hewitt act.\n In Covington v. First Nat. Bank, \n198 U.S. 100\n, 49 L. ed. 963, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 562, this court was required to consider the effect of the 3d section of the act in imposing upon national banks a liability for the taxes and penalties upon such omitted shares, which, during the years covered by this section, had been held by persons not domiciled within the state of Kentucky. The question arose under a bill filed in a circuit court of the United States \n\n[217 U.S. 443, 450]\n\u00a0\n to enjoin the imposition of liability upon a national bank for taxes and penalties upon shares held between 1892 and 1900 by persons who were not domiciled in Kentucky, it being alleged that the purpose of the proceeding against the bank was to charge the bank, without discrimination between domestic and foreign-held shares. Prior to this act of March 21, 1900, there was no law requiring a return for taxation of bank shares held by owners not domiciled within the state, either by such holder or by the bank in which such shares were held. For this reason we held in the case referred to that this act imposed, for the years prior to its passage, a liability upon national banks for taxes upon shareholders domiciled outside of the state, which was not borne by other incorporated moneyed institutions. Upon this subject, the court, speaking by Mr. Justice Day, said:\n'Without considering the question of constitutional power to tax nonresident shareholders by means of this retroactive law, it seems to us that, in imposing upon the bank the liability for the past years, for taxes and penalty, upon stock held without the state, and which, before the taking effect of the act under consideration, it was not required to return, there has been imposed upon national banks in this retroactive feature of the law a burden not borne by other moneyed capital in the state. This law makes a bank liable for taxes upon property beyond the jurisdiction of the state, not required to be returned by the bank as agent for the shareholders, by a statute passed in pursuance of the authority delegated in  5219, thus imposing a burden not borne by other moneyed capital within the state.'\n\n In the case now before us for consideration, a liability has been imposed upon the Citizens Bank, the plaintiff in error, not for taxes and penalties upon shares of the bank held by shareholders domiciled beyond the state,-as was attempted in Covington v. First Nat. Bank, supra,-but exclusively upon shareholders domiciled within the state. The liability is limited to the tax and penalty upon shares owned \n\n[217 U.S. 443, 451]\n\u00a0\n by shareholders domiciled within the state, the name, residence, and amount due from each such shareholders being distinctly set down in the decree.\n Neither is the act lacking in due process if, as we shall assume for the moment is the case, the procedure under the 3d section is but a new remedy for a tax liability imposed by prior law of the state upon resident holders of shares of the bank.\n Sec. 5210, Rev. Stat., requires every such bank to keep a correct list of its shareholders accessible to taxing officers, and by  5219, Rev. Stat., the legislature of each state may, for itself, determine the manner and method for taxing shares in such banks, subject only to the restrictions named therein. In making the bank the agent for its own shareholders in proceedings brought to compel a return and secure an assessment, and in imposing upon the bank a liability for the tax so assessed against the shareholders, the act only follows the wellsettled procedure sanctioned in First Nat. Bank v. Kentucky, 9 Wall. 353, 19 L. ed. 701; Van Slyke v. Wisconsin, \n154 U.S. 581\n, and 20 L. ed. 240, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1168; and First Nat. Bank v. Chehalis County, \n166 U.S. 440\n, 41 L. ed. 1069, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 629.\n That the 3d section does not impose a liability upon either the domestic shareholders or the bank which did not exist before, under the prior law of the state, was settled by the case of Scobee v. Bean, 109 Ky. 526, 59 S. W. 860. In that case the shares of certain resident shareholders had been assessed for taxes laid for years prior to this act of 1900, and it was urged that since the special legislation for the taxation of such shares had been held void by this court in Owensboro Nat. Bank v. Owensboro that there was no law of the state under which these shares could be assessed. But the Kentucky court, after an elaborate review of the general taxing law of the state, held that there was full prior statutory authority for the taxation of such shares, and that under that law, if the bank failed to return and pay the tax upon such shares, it was the duty of the shareholders to do so. That case has been followed in a number of other cases by the same court, and it is the basis upon \n\n[217 U.S. 443, 452]\n\u00a0\n which the 3d section of this act of March 21, 1900, was upheld in the present case as not imposing a new liability, but as simply providing another method for the assessment of shares which had escaped assessment under the prior law, because neither the shareholders nor the bank had returned them for taxation. In Covington v. First Nat. Bank, \n198 \nU.S. 100, 111\n, 49 S. L. ed. 963, 968, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 562, 565, this court, speaking by Mr. Justice Day, accepted this as the interpretation of the statutory law of Kentucky by the highest court of the state, saying:\n'Following the state court in the interpretation of its own statutes, it may be said that, as to shareholders residing in Kentucky and over whom the state has jurisdiction, the supreme court of that state has construed its statutes as requiring shareholders in national banks for the years 1893 to 1900, inclusive, to return their shares for taxation; and if they did not make the return, the duty was required of the corporation. In this view of the law it may be that, as to local shareholders, the act of March 21, 1900, as held by the supreme court of Kentucky, created no new right of taxation, but gave simply a new remedy, which, by the law, is operative to enforce pre-existing obligations. It may be admitted that  5219 permits the state to require the bank to pay the tax for the shareholders. First Nat. Bank v. Kentucky; Van Slyke v. Wisconsin; and First Nat. Bank v. Chehalis County,-supra.\n\n This construction of the prior law and of the act of 1900 was reaffirmed upon the first appeal of the present case, where the court said:\n'The act of March 21, 1900, did not, therefore, make that taxable whch was not taxable before, but simply provided another mode for the assessment of the shares of stock and the payment of the taxes. It was the duty of the assessor to make the assessment. It was also the duty of the president and cashier of the bank to list the shares of stock with the assessor; but when the assessment was not made, the property was simply omitted from the tax list, and the sheriff is authorized \n\n[217 U.S. 443, 453]\n\u00a0\n by  4241, Ky. Stat. 1903, to institute the proceeding to have any omitted property assessed. A penalty may be properly imposed in the proceeding because the property was not listed with the assessor, as required by law, and stood as any other property for the assessment of which a proceeding under  4241 may be instituted. While neither the bank nor its president nor its cashier is the owner of the shares of stock, the bank is made by the act the agent of the shareholders, and the notice to it is notice to his agent, within the meaning of  4241. The president and cashier were properly made defendants because it is made their duty by the statute to list the stock. The bank is required to keep a list of its shareholders, and therefore knows who they are. Notice to the agent in an assessment of property is sufficient notice to his principal.' Com. v. Citizens' Nat. Bank, 117 Ky. 946, 957, 80 S. W. 158.\n\n But it is said that in Covington v. First Nat. Bank this court held the 3d section broad enough to include liability for omitted returns of shares held by nonresident shareholders, and for that reason discriminated against national banks. But in that case the proceeding enjoined was one for the purpose of fixing liability upon the bank without discriminating between resident and nonresident shareholders. But in the present case the state court has not imposed liability upon the bank for taxes or penalties upon shareholders who were nonresidents, but has applied it as affording a valid remedy for the collection of taxes and penalties upon residents who had not made return, as required under the prior law. As thus applied, the bank has neither been deprived of any rights nor compelled to bear any burden in conflict with  5219, Rev. Stat., upon which it relies for protection. But if it be assumed-an assumption not sustained by any decision of the Kentucky court of appeals-that the 3d section is broad enough to include liability for delinquent taxes claimed from both resident and nonresident stockholders, none of the latter class are here complaining, and such an objection cannot be \n\n[217 U.S. 443, 454]\n\u00a0\n made by one unaffected by the alleged invalid feature. Austin v. Boston, 7 Wall. 694, 19 L. ed. 224; Albany County v. Stanley, \n105 U.S. 305\n, 25 L. ed. 1044; The Winnebago (Iroquois Transp. Co. v. De Laney Forge & Iron Co.) \n205 U.S. 354\n, 51 L. ed. 836, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 509.\n That the body of shareholders in 1901, when the proceeding was started, was not composed of the same individuals as the body during the years for which the taxes were due, is doubtless true. But the shares pass from one holder to another, subject to the burden of taxes; and if not returned by either the shareholder or the bank, as required by the prior law, the liability remains to be enforced until barred by limitation of time. The liability of the bank is that of the shareholder, and its reimbursement must come from those who hold the shares when the bank liability is enfored. In Seattle v. Kelleher, \n195 U.S. 351\n, 49 L. ed. 232, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 44, it is said that liability for a tax is not subject to the rules applicable to the vendor's equity. 'A man cannot get rid of his liability to a tax by buying without notice.' The liability of the purchaser of shares for taxes not paid, and of the bank, as agent for its shareholders, is one of the notorious and necessary consequences of the long-sanctioned right of the states to compel such banks to return their shares for taxation, and to pay the assessment thereon if the shareholder does not. The legality of this method was reasoned out in First Nat. Bank v. Kentucky, supra,-a case arising under the Kentucky law imposing liability upon banks for the tax upon shareholders. This answers the objection that in 1898 a reduction in the number of shares had occurred. That only means that each share of $1,000 was reduced to a share of $666. 66; the shareholders remained the same, the proportion held by each in the capital being the same as before the reduction. The tax upon the share before it was reduced rested upon the same share after it had been reduced. None of the shares taxed had in fact gone out of existence before the proceeding to compel returns for purposes of taxation. The original 1,500 shares were represented by the outstanding 1,000 shares, and were in the hands of the same general body of shareholders. \n\n[217 U.S. 443, 455]\n\u00a0\n The objection made that the act violates the supposed contract under the Hewitt act is answered by Citizens' Sav. Bank v. Owensboro, \n173 U.S. 636\n, 43 L. ed. 840, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 530, 571, and Covington v. First Nat. Bank, \n198 U.S. 100\n, 49 L. ed. 963, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 562.\n The other assignments present no question which need be more particularly answered.\n Judgment affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice White, dissenting:\n I am constrained to dissent because I think, in substance and effect, the retroactive tax now upheld is a tax on the bank and its assets, and is therefore void. The power to tax is controlled by  5219, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3502), and as, in may judgment, the tax which is now sustained is in conflict with that section, in my opinion there should be a judgment of reversal. \n\nFootnotes\n Sec. 4. All assessments of shares of stock contemplated by this act shall be entered upon the assessor's books, verified and reported by the officers as assessments of real estate are entered, certified, and reported, and the same shall be certified to the proper collecting officer for collection as assessments of real estate are certified for collection of taxes thereon.\n Sec. 5. The assessments of said shares of stock and collection of taxes thereon, as contemplated by this act, may be enforced as assessments of real estate and collection of taxes thereon may be enforced.\n Sec. 6. The purpose of this act is to place national banks of this state, with respect to taxation, upon the same footing as state banks, as nearly as may be, consistently with said article three (3) of the revenue law and said decision of the Supreme Court.\n Sec. 7. Whereas, it is important that state banks and national banks should be taxed equally for all purposes, an emergency exists, and this act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage.\n Approved March 21, 1900. \n\n\n\n\n","29":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY OF COLUMBUS v. MERCANTILE TRUST & DEPOSIT COMPANY OF(1910)\nNo. 41\nArgued: Decided: December 12, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 645, 646]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William A. Wimbish, T. T. Miller, and J. H. Martin for appellant.\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 645, 647]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Joseph Packard and A. Morris Tyson for appellees.\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 645, 649]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Lurton delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill by the trustee under a mortgage made by the Columbus Water Works Company upon its plant and franchise to secure an issue of bonds, to enjoin the municipal authorities of Columbus, Georgia, from constructing and operating a municipal water system, thereby impairing the obligation of a contract between the city and the waterworks company, granting to the latter for a term of thirty years an exclusive right to maintain a waterworks system in the streets of the city.\n The bill, in substance, avers, and the answer admits, that the city has procured from the legislature of Georgia authority to construct and operate a municipal water plant, and to issue the bonds of the city for that purpose, and that, in pursuance of this legislative authority, ordinances have been passed providing for the construction \n\n[218 U.S. 645, 650]\n\u00a0\n of such waterworks, and for the issuance of bonds to provide the means, and that notice of that purpose, and that the city no longer regards the contract with the Columbus Water Works Company as binding or obligatory, has been given.\n The material defenses are, first, that the city had no power to make an exclusive contract; second, that the contract for rental of hydrants created an aggregate indebtedness prohibited by the Constitution of the state; and, third, that the waterworks company had not kept its contract in respect of the character or capacity of the plant it was to provide and maintain, and has failed in its obligation to furnish an abundant and constant supply of pure and wholesome water, thus compelling the municipality to construct a system of its own for the protection of the health and property of its inhabitants.\n These defenses were relied upon in the answer of the city as a defense against the injunction sought by the complainant, and were made the subject of a cross bill against the complainant and the waterworks company, praying relief against the contract as having been first broken by the company.\n Prior to the filing of this bill, the same complainant had filed its original bill in the same court against the Columbus Water Works Company, praying a foreclosure of its mortgage, a default having occurred. The bill referred to was filed December 22, 1902. The present bill was not filed until July 30, 1903. One of the allegations of the foreclosure bill was 'that during the continuance of this deed in trust, the said party of the first part will not do or suffer to be done any act or acts whereby the security of the said bondholders shall be in any way or manner or in any amount impaired, and that the said party of the first part will at all times preserve, maintain, and keep its waterworks, pumps, machinery, reservoirs, piping, hydrants, and equipments in good repair, working order, and condition, \n\n[218 U.S. 645, 651]\n\u00a0\n and supplied with all the machinery, equipments, and appliances for providing water to the city of Columbus and vicinity, and shall and will, from time to time, make all needful and proper repairs, renewals, and replacements, and useful and proper alterations, additions, betterments, and improvements.\n'3. That your orator is informed that for more than six months last past the Columbus Water Works Company has suffered the security of the bondholders to become impaired by not maintaining and keeping its water works supplied with all the machinery, equipments, and appliances for providing water to the city of Columbus and vicinity, and by not making useful and proper additions, betterments, and improvements to said waterworks. Further explaining the foregoing allegation, your orator states that, owing to an unprecedented and protracted drought, the sources of supply of water for the said waterworks have to a large extent failed for the time being; that it is within the power of the said waterworks company to provide for such a contingency by seeking and availing itself of other sources of supply, but that, as your orator is informed, owing to the attitude of the City of Columbus, which now is taking steps to provide a water supply of its own, the Columbus Water Works Company is unable to sell its bonds reserved in its treasury for such purposes, and which could have been sold except for the attitude of the said city, and therefore is unable to carry out the betterments and improvements in its water supply above mentioned.'\n\n Under that bill, which was unopposed, a receiver was appointed, who has ever since been in possession and is still operating said works. Upon application of the mortgage trustee, and by consent of the bondholders and of the company, receiver's certificates have been issued to the extent of $ 50,000, and expended in repairing and improving the supply of water and the distributing system. \n\n[218 U.S. 645, 652]\n\u00a0\n There has never been any consolidation of the two suits, but by an amended bill in the present case, filed October 15, 1903, the fact of the pendency of the aforementioned foreclosure bill and the action had thereunder was stated. It was also averred in this amendment that by means of the receiver's certificates issued in the foreclosure case, such improvements and enlargements had been made in the plant of the company that the receiver was then supplying an abundance of wholesome water, and that the trustee, by direction of the bondholders, was willing to expend such other sums as should be found necessary to enable the mortgagor company to carry out its contract.\n Upon the bill as thus amended, the answer and cross bill and the answer thereto, and upon ex parte affidavits, the court heard a motion for an injunction pendente lite. Upon that hearing the court disposed of two legal defenses arising upon the face of the contract; namely, whether a contract extending over thirty years for the rental of hydrants was the creation of an indebtedness for the aggregate of the rental, and second, whether the city had power to make an exclusive contract. Both of these questions were decided by Judge Newman against the city. On November 19, 1903, an injunction pending the suit was allowed, and the cause referred to a special master to take proof and report his findings of law and fact in respect to the issues with reference to the failure of the waterworks company to comply with its contract. See 130 Fed. 180.\n On January 23, 1904, the city filed its petition praying a dissolution of this injunction, alleging that a great amount of evidence had been taken by the special master, and that the reservoir had again failed, and that water was now being taken from the Chattahoochee river, and that the water at the intake was polluted by reason of the fact that one of the city's sewers emptied into the stream \n\n[218 U.S. 645, 653]\n\u00a0\n a short distance above the intake, and also that a polluted branch which drained a suburb of the city emptied into the river a short distance above the river intake. Thereupon, on January 25, 1904, the preliminary injunction was dissolved.\n The special master, on November 19, 1904, filed a full, elaborate, and able report, with findings of fact and law. Upon the material questions he found in favor of the contentions of the city in respect to both fact and law. His findings of fact, as condensed by him, which are material to be here set out, are as follows:\n'I have found that acceptance by the city was based on statement of the water company that the system had been completed in compliance with the contract, and upon assurances by the company that the water would be wholesome, abundant, and lasting.\n\n'I have found that the system as accepted by the city in 1882 had not met the general requirements of the contract, and that on complaints to the company the system had been improved to such an extent that in 1889 the service was at that time accepted as satisfactory to the city.\n\n'That from 1889 to May, 1900, there was dissatisfaction and complaints on the part of the city because of insufficiency of water supply, and especially with the unsupplied needs of the city for water in its newly acquired territory; that the company had notice of this, and recognized the necessity of increased water supply; that during this period the city, through its council, twice made an effort to repudiate the contract, but were not sustained by the requisite popular vote on submission of the question to the people; that the company in good faith endeavored to adjust the differences by offer to arbitrate, and the city declined the offer; and that finally the city accepted the existing conditions, and concluded a supplemental agreement by which the company was given an opportunity to test its ability to carry out the requirements of the contract; that \n\n[218 U.S. 645, 654]\n\u00a0\n the company failed in this, and that in 1902 both the council and the people determined to no longer depend upon the water company.\n\n'That the water company has at no time complied with  3, requiring a reservoir of 125 million gallons available supply, and from 1884 it has failed to comply with the requirements of  12 as to the construction and maintenance of the reservoir.\n\n'That paragraph 11 as to filtration has not been complied with on the part of the company.\n\n'That the company has failed to comply with  5 of the contract as to distribution in not connecting together the ends of its system, and placing mains sufficiently large to at all times give full supply of water.\n\n'With reference to the supply of water, I have found that the company has failed to comply with  1 and 10, in that sufficient supply of wholesome, constant, and ample water has not and cannot be furnished from the source of supply as selected, nor is the same sufficient to meet the wants of the city and private consumers for present and future requirements.\n\n'I have found that the company has not complied with  4 as to supply main.\n\n'That as to pressure from 1893 to 1902, the pressure was varible and uncertain; that the gravity plan could not sustain it to the requirements of the contract, and that the standpipe and pumping devices adopted to assist it, while practically beneficial, were not at all times satisfactory; that the company has not met the requirements of  27 in maintaining pressure at 32 pounds, nor supplemental contract requirement of 40 pounds, and that in fires of any magnitude the pressure and water supply is insufficient, and that the supply is not ample for fire protection, as required by  9, and that the receiver, by improvement of the pumping station, has greatly bettered conditions. \n\n[218 U.S. 645, 655]\n\u00a0\n 'With reference to the wholesomeness of the water, as required by  10, I have found that the reservoir water, when available, is, under normal conditions, a wholesome water, but when the water is low it is not wholesome; that prior to July, 1902, the water furnished by the company was, with few exceptions, within the requirements of the contract, and in these exceptions the city has not availed itself of the provisions of  13 of the contract to correct impurities; that since July, 1902, the company has not furnished a constant supply of wholesome water, nor has the receiver been able to do so; that the Chattahoochee river cannot be relied on as a constant source of supply for wholesome water, but only so when, on a normal flow of the river, water is taken from points above all possibility of contamination, and properly filtered.\n\n'That the company has not been able, for want of available funds, to maintain and improve its system as the growth of the city demanded, and that extensions since 1891 have, from time to time, been, with the exception of a small amount, paid for by a necessary increase of a bonded indebtedness originally out of all proportion to the earning capacity of the system, and constantly growing further beyond the ability of the system to maintain; that the system has not been reinforced and strengthened as its needs require, and that the owners of the bonds of the company recognized this fact.\n\n'That the actual amount expended by the receiver to January, 1904, on betterments, is $42,220.85.'\n\n To the findings of fact the complainant excepted.\n Upon a final hearing, the court, while not fully agreeing with the master as to the effect of the original acceptance of the works as constructed, and as to the effect of subsequent acceptance of enlargements, repairs, and improvements made by the company, from time to time, to meet complaints as to quantity and quality of water, concurred fully in the master's report that the company had not \n\n[218 U.S. 645, 656]\n\u00a0\n complied with its obligation to construct and maintain adequate means for continuously furnishing an ample and wholesome supply of water for public and domestic purposes. Among other things, upon this vital aspect of the case, Judge Newman said:\n'In my judgment, the facts in evidence were sufficient to justify the master in finding that there was a failure on the part of the company to furnish an abundant supply of pure and wholesome water, as provided in the contract, and finding the company at fault in this respect. It is a serious matter to undertake to supply the inhabitants of a city with an ample supply of good and wholesome water, and persons entering into a contract to do this necessarily must do so with an understanding of the important character of the undertaking. This is particularly true of a growing city. Taking this whole record together, and considering all the evidence, the master, as has been stated, was justified in reaching the conclusion that there was a failure to comply with the contract in this respect.' [161 Fed. 147.]\n\n Although there was a concensus of finding by master and court that there was an obligation upon the water works company to furnish an adequate and continuous supply of pure water, and that the waterworks company had therefore broken this vital part of its agreement, yet the court ruled that the city should be denied rescission under its cross bill, and affirmatively restrained from establishing its own system, unless it 'should do equity to the bondholders,' by whose money the plant had been constructed, by purchasing 'so much of the waterworks plant as may be hereafter determined, at a fair valuation, as a condition of and before entering a decree in its favor finally denying an injunction in the case against the issuance by the city of its waterworks bonds.' Time was given the city to determine whether it would accept the conditions imposed by purchasing at a fair valuation \n\n[218 U.S. 645, 657]\n\u00a0\n such parts of the system as the court should determine were usable by the city, at a price to be fixed by a subsequent decree. The city declining to assent to such a condition, an injunction was granted permanently restraining the city from the construction of its own plant, and dismissing the cross bill, and taxing all of the costs to the city.\n Pretermitting any opinion as to whether the contract for rental of hydrants for a term of thirty years constituted an aggregate indebtedness prohibited by the Constitution of the state of Georgia, as well as the question of the power of the city to obligate itself by a contract excluding it from constructing and operating its own waterworks, and assuming, for the purposes of this case, that the contract between the city and the waterworks company was perfectly valid, we come at once to the question of whether the court below was right in denying relief under the cross bill, and in granting the relief prayed by the original bill, because the city declined to purchase at a price fixed by the court or by arbitration the usable parts of the waterworks system.\n The primary and vital obligation of the company was to furnish an adequate and constant supply of water for both public and private use, which should be pure and wholesome. By the first and second clauses of the contract the company obligated itself to provide 'all the real estate, rights of way, water rights, and water that shall be found requisite for the successful prosecution and operation of the waterworks,' and to supply 'dams and embankements of ample size and strength, good and durable quality, that may be required for the works.' By the third clause it bound itself to construct 'a storage reservoir having an available capacity for the storage and supply of not less than 125 million gallons.' This, in passing, we may observe, was never done, and the insufficiency of the reservoir capacity was one of the fac- \n\n[218 U.S. 645, 658]\n\u00a0\n tors in the subsequent failure to furnish at all times an adequate supply of water. By the tenth clause of the contract it was provided that 'the source of water supply shall be determined by Thos. R. White (who assigned to the Columbus Water Works Company), he guaranteeing, however, that the supply of water, both in quality and amount, shall be wholesome, constant, and amply sufficient to meet the wants of the city and private consumers for future and present requirements.' The eleventh and twelfth clauses related to the construction and maintenance of a filter, and to the maintenance of wholesome conditions at the storage reservoir.\n The single object of the agreement was to obtain a constant and adequate supply of wholesome water. This was guaranteed in express terms, to say nothing of the necessary implication from the character of the contract. This guaranty was a continuing one, and dominated every other detail of the agreement. The company selected its own source of supply, and was under the highest obligation to continuously furnish an ample supply for all purposes of water which should be wholesome; that is, clean, pure, and fit for domestic use. This supply was to be adequate not only for the demands of the present, but ample to meet the demands of the future.\n No higher police duty rests upon municipal authority than that of furnishing an ample supply of pure and wholesome water for public and domestic uses. The preservation of the health of the community is best obtained by the discharge of this duty, to say nothing of the preservation of property from fire, so constant an attendant upon crowded conditions of municipal life. If a municipality elect to contract with another for the discharge of this function, it is under the greatest obligation to require that the contractor shall engage to construct and maintain adequate means and furnish an adequate supply, in quality and quantity, to at all times meet the public ne- \n\n[218 U.S. 645, 659]\n\u00a0\n cessity. So, too, the contractor must satisfy himself as to the sufficiency and qualify of the source of supply, and maintain adequate storage and distributing instrumentalities to meet conditions. That his source of supply is at times adequate and wholesome is not enough. The wants of the public must, under all conditions, be supplied. We do not take account of temporary and unusual conditions which cannot be reasonably foreseen. But that which can be and should be foreseen must be taken into account by a private contractor who undertakes so vital a function as that of supplying water to a growing community.\n The continuing character of the obligation to furnish an adequate supply of wholesome water, as we have before suggested, is not met by showing that such a supply has been furnished at times, nor is the nonperformance of the agreement excused by the occurrence of conditions which are likely to occur in a climate of long, dry summers. Nor is such a contract fulfilled by showing that, at the time of completion of the works, the company was able to carry out the contract. Ability to carry out the agreement must be maintained. From time to time during the operation of the works, specific complaints were made by the city in consequence of the failure of the water company to furnish an adequate supply of water, or on account of the quality of the water or insufficient pressure. These complaints generally resulted in an effort to remedy the matter, and more than one change and improvement made seemed to produce good results, leading the municipality to accept for the time the repair, or enlargement, or change as meeting the necessities of the particular exigency, and giving promises of ability to carry out the contract. In consequence of such efforts to improve the service in quantity and quality of water supplied, the electorate of the municipality twice voted against a bond issue to construct a municipal plant, manifesting thereby \n\n[218 U.S. 645, 660]\n\u00a0\n a willingness that further opportunity should be given the company to show its ability to bring its plant up to the requirements of the contract. Indeed, the attitude of the city and its people toward the water company, as shown by the record, seems to have been forbearing and generous. This acceptance of improved conditions resulting from complaints has been relied upon as estopping the city. But no such result may rightfully follow, unless such improved conditions resulted in the maintenance thereafter of a continuous, adequate supply of wholesome water. This was not the case. Want of capital may have been the cause for adoption by the company of expedients to meet a particular exigency which were inadequate to permanently overcome a radically insufficient source of supply, as well as insufficient storage and filtration instrumentalities. The relief resulting from all that was done by the company or its receiver was not abiding nor the character of the water permanently improved. That the works were not able to come up to the requirements of the contract, and not able to meet the reasonable necessities of the city, was a question of fact, upon which the master and the court have agreed. The contract to furnish an adequate supply of water of good, usable quality was, as we have already said, a continuing and vital part of the contract. Touching a similar contract, this court, in Farmers' Loan & T. Co. v. Galesburg, \n133 \nU.S. 156, 170\n, 33 S. L. ed. 573, 579, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 316, 321, said:\n'Whether or not the water company was able to furnish the required quantity of water every twenty-four hours, and whether or not its quality as to purity and goodness for domestic and other uses was in compliance with the ordinance, must rest upon facts as proved to exist. Moreover, the estoppel, so far as it did exist, was not a continuing one. The obligation of the water company to furnish the quantity and quality of water required by the contract was a continuing obligation, and was not \n\n[218 U.S. 645, 661]\n\u00a0\n met once for all by a compliance with the fire test of December 6, 1883. The right of the company to enjoy the consideration of the contract was thereafter to depend upon its continuing to perform it. There was not and could not be a final and absolute acceptance of the waterworks by the city, without regard to a future compliance on the part of the water company with the requirements of the contract. The case was not one of works constructed for the city, and to become its property upon acceptance; and the acceptance related merely to the sufficiency of the structures for fire service at the time.'\n\n There remains, then, the simple question as to whether the circuit court was justified, upon a finding that the water company had not and was not able to do what it agreed to do, in restraining the city from meeting the plain necessities of the case by constructing and operating its own plant, because the city would not accept as a condition the purchase at a price fixed by the court of so much of the waterworks plant as the court should be of opinion it could use in its own system. If, as is manifestly the case, the waterworks company has not complied with its contract in vital particulars, the city had the legal right to say, as it did in substance say, 'You have failed to maintain a continuous and adequate supply of water fit for domestic purposes, as you were bound to do. Public considerations of the highest obligation require that the city and its inhabitants shall have a continuous water service adequate to the preservation of the public health and the public safety. We therefore shall treat the contract as at an end, and undertake this function by means of a municipal plant.'\n However serious the result to the water company or its creditors, the plain law of the case was with the city. The bondholders had neither legal nor equitable rights superior to the contract between the city and the water company. If the latter had not complied with the con- \n\n[218 U.S. 645, 662]\n\u00a0\n tract after repeated experiments and much indulgence by the city, what is the equitable foundation for the enforcement of a broken and continuing obligation by enjoining the city from doing what it had a plain legal right to do if the water company was unable to carry out the contract upon its part? Nevertheless, the learned judge, after reaching and announcing the conclusions already stated as to the facts of the case, granted to the complainant the full equitable relief sought, because the city declined to agree to conditions imposed. The court justified the imposition of conditions under the maxim that he who seeks equity must do equity. But this maxim is one which applies to him who affirmatively seeks equitable relief.\n The complainant had, beyond serious doubt, failed to make a case entitling it to relief. But the court in substance said to the city that unless the city would agree to mitigate the injury and loss which must come to the creditors of the defaulting company by buying so much of the company's plant as the court should think adapted to use in the plant to be constructed by the city, that a decree should go for the complainant, although it had failed to make a case entitling it to the enforcement of the contract between the company and the city.\n Manifestly the maxim cannot vest in the chancellor the power which has been exercised. It is true that the city by a cross bill asked to have the contract declared at an end for nonperformance. But this was defensive relief. If the complainant had shown a valid contract which was impaired by the legislation providing for a construction of rival waterworks, it was clearly entitled to a decree enjoining the city from proceeding with the construction of a municipal system. In that event the cross bill would be dismissed as a necessary result of such decree upon the original bill. But if complainant failed to show a state of facts which entitled it to restrain the city from \n\n[218 U.S. 645, 663]\n\u00a0\n doing anything in impairment of the contract between it and the mortgagor water company, the only logical result was a decree dismissing the original bill because the city had not kept its contract, and a decree under the cross bill, declaring the contract abrogated rightfully by the city as a consequence of its breach in vital particulars.\n A consideration of the consequence to creditors of the contracting company is not an answer to the legal rights of the city. Considerations of hardship cannot prevail to set up and enforce a broken agreement, which in law results in giving to the opposite party a right to treat the agreement as ended. Hamilton Gaslight & Coke Co. v. Hamilton, \n146 U.S. 258\n, 36 L. ed. 963, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 90; Atty. Gen. v. Birmingham, 4 Kay & J. 539; Kneeland v. American Loan & T. Co. \n136 U.S. 89\n, 34 L. ed. 379, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 950. In the case of Atty. Gen. v. Birmingham, the vice chancellor said: 'I am not sitting here as a committee of public safety, armed with arbitrary power to prevent what it is said will be a great injury not to Birmingham only, but to the whole of England; that is not my function.'\n The city should be left its freedom of contract in respect to buying such parts of the company's plant as it can profitably use.\n The remedy by an action for damages was wholly inadequate to the city. The city had a right to treat the contract as terminated, and to invoke the aid of a court of equity to enforce its rescission. \n133 U.S. 156\n, 179.\n Reverse the decree and remand, with direction to dismiss the bill and grant the relief as prayed in the cross bill.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","30":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY OF MEMPHIS v. CUMBERLAND TELEPHONE & TELEGRAPH CO(1910)\nNo. 42\nArgued: Decided: December 12, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 624, 625]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles M. Bryan and Marion G. Evans for appellant.\n Messrs. William L. Granbery, Luke E. Wright, and Eldridge E. Wright for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n We are met at the threshold of this case with a challenge of the appellate jurisdiction of this court. The case was begun in the circuit court of the United States for the western district of Tennessee by a bill filed by the Cumberland Telephone & Telegraph Company against the city of Memphis, seeking to enjoin the enforcement of the provisions of an ordinance of that city, passed September 24, 1907, regulating charges by telephone companies in the city.\n The bill averred that the complainant was a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of Kentucky, and that the respondent, the city of Memphis, was a municipal corporation, created and existing under the laws of Tennessee. The jurisdiction of the circuit court, therefore, might rest upon diverse citizenship. Concerning the ordinance regulating the charges of telephone rates, the enforcement of which it was the object of the suit to enjoin, it was averred to be null and \n\n[218 U.S. 624, 626]\n\u00a0\n void, for the reason that the city of Memphis was incorporated under a legislative act of the state of Tennessee, with certain powers and authority which nowhere included, either by express terms or necessary implication, a power to fix and regulate telephone charges, and that the attempt to do so was an abuse of power, and an attempt to exercise a power which the city wholly lacked.\n The bill also charged that the ordinance was null and void because it was unjust, inequitable, and unreasonable, because the tariff rates were fixed so low that complainant could not operate its exchange without actual loss of money; that said ordinance was, in truth and effect, confiscatory; and that it totally destroyed the value of the complainant's plant in the city of Memphis for profitable use as a telephone exchange. The prayer of the bill was for an injunction against the enforcement of the ordinance in question.\n A preliminary injunction was granted, the judge holding the circuit court at that time delivering an opinion announcing the conclusion that the ordinance in question was passed by the city without legislative authority, the court saying that was all which was necessary to decide at that time, but beyond that, he thought the city estopped by a certain contract which was set up in the bill from adopting the ordinance in question, and a preliminary injunction was granted.\n The answer took issue upon the allegations of the bill, a considerable amount of testimony was taken as to the reasonableness of the rates fixed in the ordinance, and the judge who heard the case upon the merits reached the conclusion that the rates fixed in the ordinance were confiscatory, and said: 'That result seems to us to be destructive of the complainant's rights under the Constitution of the United States.'\n Adverting to the opinion delivered upon the granting of the temporary injunction, the court rendering the final \n\n[218 U.S. 624, 627]\n\u00a0\n decree stated that the former decision was based upon a want of authority in the city to pass the ordinance, and the estoppel of the contract set up in the bill, adding: 'We are not to be considered as dissenting from either of these views. We have not had time to examine either proposition, or inclination to do so, because we are entirely content to decide the case upon final hearing upon the one ground herein discussed.'\n As was said by Mr. Justice Moody, speaking for the court in MacFadden v. United States, \n213 U.S. 288\n, 53 L. ed. 801, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 490, a right to review the judgments of the circuit courts of appeals and of the circuit and district courts of the United States rests upon different grounds, and that unless this fact is borne in mind, confusion is liable to result. The appellate jurisdiction from the circuit court of appeals to this court, as Mr. Justice Moody pointed out, is determined by the sources of jurisdiction of the trial court, and depends upon the finality of the judgment of the circuit court of appeals, as under  6 of the court of appeals act in all other cases there is a right of review in this court if the amount in controversy exceeds $1,000. [26 Stat. at L. 828, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 550.] The right to come directly to this court by appeal or writ of error from the district or circuit courts of the United States arises under  5 of the court of appeals act, and so far as the case now under consideration is concerned, depends upon the case being within the class of cases mentioned in that section; namely, 'in any case in which the Constitution or law of a state is claimed to be in contravention of the Constitution of the United States.'\n The right to take jurisdiction of a case in the circuit court of the United States, arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, must appear in the allegations of the bill or petition with such distinct averments as to show that it is such. Under  5 of the court of appeals act, the right to come to this court by direct \n\n[218 U.S. 624, 628]\n\u00a0\n appeal is given in any case in which it is 'claimed' that a Constitution or law of a state is in contravention of the Constitution of the United States. It is thus apparent that the claim, to give a right of appeal under this section, need not necessarily be in the pleading of the party invoking the jurisdiction of the court. It is sufficient if such right is duly claimed in the case. The statute is silent as to how this claim shall be made. The subject was under consideration in Loeb v. Columbia Twp. \n179 U.S. 472\n, 45 L. ed. 280, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174, and the distinctions between the requirements of jurisdiction in an appeal to the circuit court of appeals and an appeal direct to this court were pointed out. In that case it was held that where the defendant brought the constitutional question into the record by demurrer, and the opinion of the circuit court showed that it had considered and determined that question, the proper basis for jurisdiction by direct appeal to this court was shown.\n In saying that the opinion of the circuit court might be looked to when annexed and transmitted as part of the record, to ascertain whether either party claimed that a state statute was in contravention of the Constitution of the United States, this court, in the Loeb Case, added: 'By this [view], however, we must not be understood as saying that the opinion below may be examined in order to ascertain that which, under proper practice, should be made to appear in a bill of exceptions, or by an agreed statement of facts, or by the pleadings.'\n In Lampasas v. Bell, \n180 U.S. 276\n, 45 L. ed. 527, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 368, a suit was brought against the city of Lampasas to recover upon certain bonds, and the jurisdiction rested upon diverse citizenship. The defendant sought to introduce a constitutional question into the record in the contention set up in the answer, that the residents of certain territory incorporated into the city had not been given an opportunity to be heard as to whether they should be included in and \n\n[218 U.S. 624, 629]\n\u00a0\n be subject to taxation in the proposed incorporation. It was therefore contended that the bonds were void, and an attempt to levy and collect taxes to pay them was in violation of  1 of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. This court dismissed the writ of error, saying:\n'This court has only jurisdiction by appeal or writ of error directly from the circuit court in certain cases, one of which is when 'the Constitution or law of a state is claimed to be in contravention of the Constitution of the United States.' Sec. 5 of the judiciary act of March 3, 1891, chap. 517, 26 Stat. at L. 826, 828, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 488, 549. But the claim must be real and substantial. A mere claim in words is not enough. We said by the chief justice in Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Ann Arbor R. Co. \n178 U.S. 239\n, 44 L. ed. 1052, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 867: 'When a suit does not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy as to the effect or construction of the Constitution or laws of the United States, upon the determination of which the result depends, it is not a suit arising under the Constitution or laws. And it must appear on the record by a statement in legal and logical form, such as is required in good pleading, that the suit is one which does really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy as to a right which depends on the construction of the Constitution or some law or treaty of the United States before jurisdiction can be maintained on this ground. Little York Goldwashing & Water Co. v. Keyes, \n96 U.S. 199\n, 24 L. ed. 656; Blackburn v. Portland Gold Min. Co. \n175 U.S. 571\n, 44 L. ed. 276, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 222; 20 Mor. Min. Rep. 358.'\n\n In this case a perusal of the bill, answer, and testimony in the case makes it apparent that if brought into the record at all, the alleged claim of a violation of the Federal Constitution by a state law must be found in the bill itself. It appears from an examination of the bill that it is distinctly charged therein that the ordinance was passed without authority of the state, and its attempted passage, \n\n[218 U.S. 624, 630]\n\u00a0\n it is alleged, was an abuse of power by the city. There is no reference in the bill to any provision of the Federal Constitution. If any can be said to be violated, it must be the 14th Amendment. It is hardly necessary to say that that Amendment is aimed at state action, in the provision that no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The bill, therefore, so far from charging a violation of the 14th Amendment by an authorized action of the state, distinctly and in terms avers that the ordinance was passed without state authority. That such municipal legislation does not lay the foundation of Federal jurisdiction has been repeatedly held in this court. Hamilton Gaslight & Coke Co. v. Hamilton, \n146 U.S. 258\n, 36 L. ed. 963, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 90, in which many of the previous cases in this court are cited. In that case Mr. Justice Harland, speaking for the court, said of an ordinance passed without legislative authority: 'A suit to prevent the enforcement of such an ordinance would not, therefore, be one arising under the Constitution of the United States.'\n In Barney v. New York, \n193 U.S. 430\n, 48 L. ed. 737, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 502, the bill invoked the jurisdiction of the circuit court of the United States upon the ground that the plaintiff was deprived of his property without due process of law; other allegations of the bill showed that the matters complained of were not only not authorized, but were forbidden by the legislation of the state; hence, the action did not invoke the protection of the 14th Amendment because of action by the state of New York, and therefore it was held the bill was properly dismissed for want of jurisdiction. In that case some of the previous cases in this court, to the same effect, are reviewed by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, who delivered the opinion of the court.\n A question closely analogous to the one at bar came before the court of appeals of the sixth circuit, Judge Lurton delivering the opinion of the court. Louisville \n\n[218 U.S. 624, 631]\n\u00a0\n v. Cumberland Teleph. & Teleg. Co. 84 C. C. A. 151, 155 Fed. 725, 12 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 500. In that case the jurisdiction of the circuit court was invoked on the ground that the ordinance of the city of Louisville regulating rates was in violation of a contract between the complainant and the city; also on the ground that the rates were unreasonable, unjust, and confiscatory, depriving the complainant of property without due process of law, in violation of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. In that case the bill was dismissed upon the ground that the allegations of the complaint showed that the case was not one arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States. This was held to be so because of other statements of the bill, which was held negatived state action, which alone could lay the foundation of jurisdiction, in that it averred that no power to regulate the rates charged by the complainant had been granted by the state of Kentucky to the municipality which had undertaken to pass the regulating ordinance, and that the attempt to pass such ordinance was an unwarranted and unfounded assumption of power upon the part of the city.\n The claim that the jurisdiction should be sustained because the common council of the city of Louisville had assumed to act under authority of the legislature of the commonwealth of Kentucky, which was averred in the bill, was answered by the court saying that the existence of such regulating power was distinctly negatived by the allegation of the bill that the city had acted in the premises wholly without authority.\n So, in the present case, the statements of the bill are clear and distinct that the passage of the ordinance was without power, and a usurpation on the part of the city; and the allegations of the bill as to the confiscatory character of the ordinance can, consistently with the other averments of the bill, be referred only to the state Constitution, which, as well as the Federal Constitution, in- \n\n[218 U.S. 624, 632]\n\u00a0\n hibits attempts to take property without due process of law. Harbinson v. Knoxville Iron Co. 103 Tenn. 421, 56 L.R.A. 316, 76 Am. St. Rep. 682, 53 S. W. 955.\n It is suggested that the bill, when properly construed, may have a twofold aspect, one of which charges that the city acted without authority of law, and the other that, conceding the city to act with authority, the rates fixed were confiscatory, in violation of the Federal Constitution. Assuming that a bill might be framed in this manner, it is sufficient to say of the present bill that it is not one of that character. There is nothing in it qualifying the allegation as to the action of the city without authority of the state, and, as we have said, the allegations as to the confiscatory character of the ordinance are to be referred, as they can be, consistently with the other allegations of the bill, to the state Constitution, which would be violated if such allegations were true. This construction harmonizes the bill and does violence to none of its averments.\n The case, then, is this: The first and only reference to the Federal Constitution is in the final opinion of the circuit judge who heard the case upon the merits, in the part of the opinion above quoted, to the effect that the rates fixed are in violation of the complainant's rights under the Federal Constitution. This observation was doubtless made by the learned judge as the equivalent of saying that the rates were confiscatory, and therefore unlawful; but whether so or not, so far as it makes the 14th Amendment a ground of decision, it is inconsistent with the position taken in the bill, and as there is no basis for a claim of denial of rights under that Amendment in the case, it cannot be made the ground of direct appeal to this court under the 5th section of the court of appeals act.\n We are of opinion that this case must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction in this court, and it is so ordered. \n\n[218 U.S. 624, 633]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White, with whom concur Mr. Justice McKenna and Mr. Justice Hughes, dissenting:\n As I cannot concur in the judgment of dismissal, in view of what seems to me to be the importance of the subject, the reasons for my dissent are expressed.\n Let me restate the case. In September, 1907, the city of Memphis passed an ordinance fixing maximum telephone rates. The telephone company filed its bill to enjoin the enforcement of the ordinance. Diversity of citizenship was alleged. The relief prayed was based upon substantially the following grounds: (a) that, as the legislature of Tennessee had conferred no power upon the city of Memphis to fix rates, the city was wholly lacking in authority to pass the ordinance, and the same was therefore void; (b) that the ordinance was void 'because it is unjust, inequitable, and unreasonable, in that it fixes the maximum tariff or rate of charges beyond which your orator is forbidden to go, under severe penalties which is so low that your orator could not operate its exchange without actual loss of money to it; and, indeed, is in truth and effect confiscatory, in that it totally destroys the value of your orator's plant in the city of Memphis for profitable use as a telephone exchange.' The paragraph of the bill containing the foregoing concluded as follows: 'Your orator further states that said ordinance was passed by the legislative council of said city, not only without making any investigation whatever, but in ignorance of what was a reasonable rate (assuming that it had the power to deal with the subject at all, which is denied), and without the least regard to the vested rights of your orator, or to equity and justice, and it is, for the reasons set forth in this paragraph, null and void;' (c) that the ordinance was moreover void because it was unequal and discriminatory in consequence of a proviso to the 1st section, exempting from its operation telephone com- \n\n[218 U.S. 624, 634]\n\u00a0\n panies whose rates were fixed by contract with the city of Memphis.\n By its answer, the city asserted the power to pass the ordinance, and traversed the averments of the bill as to confiscation and discrimination. A final decree was awarded, adjudging the ordinance to be null and void, and permanently enjoining its enforcement. The court, premising by 'assuming that the city of Memphis, notwithstanding any contract it may have with the complainant, has the right and power to fix the rates which the latter may charge its customers in Memphis,' came to consider the constitutional limitations to which the exertion of that power was subjected. Dealing with that subject, it was pointed out that the power to fix rates could not be so unreasonably exerted as to amount to confiscation, and, examining the proof as to the operation and effect of the rates established by the ordinance, it was found that they were of that character. The court said:\n'The holders of stock in the complainant company are entitled to a fair return upon their investment if the company can earn it, but the testimony leaves no doubt that the rates prescribed by the ordinance would leave practically nothing to the stockholders.\n\n ... * *\n'If to large taxation and other enforced expenditures already properly exacted, the city (now that complainant's plant is fully installed) can add the burden of rates fixed arbitrarily that would so diminish earnings (though not expenses) as to leave no dividends whatever for stockholders, manifestly the money invested by them would be used for the benefit alone of the people of Memphis, and not at all for the profit of those who made the investment under inducements offered by the city.\n\n ... * *\n'That result seems to us to be destructive of complainant's rights under the Constitution of the United States. \n\n[218 U.S. 624, 635]\n\u00a0\n 'In Judge Clark's opinion upon the motion for the temporary injunction it is clearly indicated that that learned and lamented judge thought that the city had no power or authority to enact the ordinance for two reasons, viz.: 1st, because the state had never given the city such authority, and, 2d, because the city had a contract with the complainant which could not be thus impaired.\n\n'We are not to be considered as dissenting from either of these views. We have not had time to examine either proposition, nor inclination to do so, because we are entirely content to decide the case on final hearing upon the one ground herein discussed.'\n\n The city appealed directly to this court upon the ground that the case is one where a constitutional right was claimed below, and hence is susceptible of being directly reviewed here under  5 of the judiciary act of 1891. [26 Stat. at L. 827, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549.] On the hearing at bar it was suggested on behalf of the telephone company that the record did not disclose that the protection of the Constitution of the United States was claimed by the telephone company, and therefore the bill should be dismissed, and the court gives effect to that suggestion by its decree of dismissal.\n Before ascertaining whether the record establishes that there is a claim of Federal right authorizing a direct review, it is necessary to fix definitely what constitutes the record. The contention on this subject involves the inquiry whether the opinion of the court below is part of the record, and if it is a part of the record, and it be conceded that a question of Federal right was decided below, does that fact establish the existence of a claim of constitutional right, justifying the direct review within the meaning of the act of 1891? To my mind an affirmative answer to both these propositions is required if previous decisions of this court be now applied.\n In Loeb v. Columbia Twp. \n179 U.S. 472\n, 45 L. ed. 280, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174, the case was this: Loeb, a citizen of Indiana, sued the \n\n[218 U.S. 624, 636]\n\u00a0\n trustees of Columbia township in Hamilton county, Ohio, in a circuit court of the United States, to recover the amount of certain bonds issued by the township. The defendant filed a general demurrer. This demurrer was sustained, and the plaintiff electing not to plead further, judgment was rendered for the defendant. The court, in the opinion by it delivered, declared that it had sustained the demurrer because it had concluded, as claimed by the defendant on the argument of the demurrer, that the law under which the bonds were issued was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. A writ of error having been prosecuted directly from this court, the right to prosecute the same was challenged, and came to be disposed of when the case was considered. The court said (p. 477): 'The petition shows that the parties are citizens of different states. It states no other ground of Federal jurisdiction. If nothing more appeared, bearing upon the question of jurisdiction, then it would be held that this court was without authority to review the judgment of the circuit court.' The court then proceeded to consider whether it was 'sufficiently informed by the record that the defendant township, under its general demurrer, 'claimed' in the circuit court that the statute of Ohio, by the authority of which the bonds were issued, was in contravention of the Constitution of the United States.' It was held (p. 481) that although the demurrer was general, and did not make reference to any claim of the protection of the Constitution of the United States, 'it was certainly competent for the township to claim at the hearing of the demurrer' that the state enactment under which the bonds were issued 'upon its face was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, and therefore void.' The court, after pointing out that there was nothing in the record outside of the opinion of the court, showing that a claim of Federal right had been made and decided, was brought to consider whether it had a right to look \n\n[218 U.S. 624, 637]\n\u00a0\n at and was controlled by the result of the opinion showing that the Federal right had been claimed. The previous decisions of this court, relating to that subject, were then fully and carefully reviewed. The difficulty which had existed in ascertaining whether a Federal question had been specially set up or claimed on writs of error to state courts during the prevalence of the conception that the opinion of the state court formed no part of the record, and could not be looked at, was adverted to, the rule adopted by this court to correct that situation, and by which it had become established that the opinion of the state court could be referred to in order to ascertain whether a Federal right had been specially set up and claimed was stated, and it was observed (p. 483):\n'The rule of our court referred to does not apply alone to cases brought here from the highest court of a state. It applies, in terms, to all cases brought to this court by writ of error or appeal. What, therefore, was said in the above cases as to the object and effect of the rule, applies to records from a circuit court of the United States.'\n\n Applying the rule settled in the Loeb Case, and hence treating the opinion in this case as a part of the record, it is not subject to question that it affirmatively shows that the decree rendered in favor of the telephone company, adjudging the ordinnance to be null and void, was placed upon the express conclusion that the ordinance was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. Is this, then, sufficient to establish for the purposes of the jurisdiction of this court that a Federal question was claimed? This is to be determined, as held in the Loeb Case, by the principles applied by this court in testing its jurisdiction to review the judgments or decrees of a state court under  709 of the Revised Statutes ( U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901. p. 575). That is to say, the fact that the court below expressly decided a Federal question must be given the same weight as would be given the express determination by a state court in its opinion of a \n\n[218 U.S. 624, 638]\n\u00a0\n Federal question for the purpose of ascertaining whether a Federal right was specially set up and claimed in the state court. The rule upon this latter subject was thus stated in Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Elliott, \n184 \nU.S. 531, 533\n, 46 S. L. ed. 673, 674, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 446, 448, as follows:\n'The general rule undoubtedly is that those Federal questions which are required to be specially set up and claimed must be so distinctly asserted below as to place it beyond question that the party bringing the case here from the state court intended to and did assert such a Federal right in the state court. But it is equally true that even although the allegations of Federal right made in the state court were so general and ambiguous in their character that they would not, in and of themselves, necessitate the conclusion that a right of a Federal nature was brought to the attention of the state court, yet if the state court, in deciding the case, has actually considered and determined a Federal question, although arising on ambiguous averments, then, a Federal controversy having been actually decided, the right of this court to review obtains. F. G. Oxley Stave Co. v. Butler County, \n166 \nU.S. 648, 660\n, 41 S. L. ed. 1149, 1153, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 709. All that is essential is that the Federal questions must be presented in the state court in such a manner as to bring them to the attention of that tribunal. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, \n166 U.S. 226\n, 41 L. ed. 979, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 581. And of course, where it is shown by the record that the state court considered and decided the Federal question, the purpose of the statute is subserved. And so controlling as to the existence of the Federal question is the fact that it was actually considered and decided by the state court, that it has been held, although the general rule is that the raising of a Federal question in a petition for rehearing in the highest court of the state is too late, yet, when a question is thus raised, and it is actually considered and decided by the state court, the right to review exists. Mallett v. North Carolina, \n181 \nU.S. 589, 592\n, 45 S. L. ed. 1015, 1017, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 730, 15 Am. Crim. Rep. 241.' \n\n[218 U.S. 624, 639]\n\u00a0\n And the Elliott Case has been repeatedly approvingly referred to, and the doctrine which it announced expressly reiterated. Burt v. Smith, \n203 \nU.S. 129, 134\n, 51 S. L. ed. 121, 126, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 37; Smithsonian Institution v. St. John, \n214 \nU.S. 19, 28\n, 53 S. L. ed. 892, 897, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 601, and cases cited.\n\n Consistently with these rulings I am unable to conclude that the case made upon the record does not affirmatively establish a claim of constitutional right authorizing the direct review of the action of the court below in deciding a question of that character.\n Even at the risk of repetition, let me briefly consider the grounds by which it insisted that this case is not controlled by the authorities above referred to. They may be thus resumed: First, because the bill, it is insisted, did not complain of any action by the state of Tennessee against the rights of complainant, but simply alleged that the city of Memphis had, without authority, attempted to destroy the complainant's rights, thus, it is urged, excluding power in the court to decide that a violation of the Constitution of the United States had been brought about. Second, because even if the complaint did not in express terms exclude all claim of Federal right, nevertheless there was no right in the court to decide a constitutional question, since, taking the complaint as a whole, it clearly appears that its purpose was to assert only rights under the laws of the state of Tennessee, and to exclusively invoke protection of the state Constitution. Aside from the abnormal limitation on the judicial function which must arise from holding that, without the consent of a litigant, a judge, in a case over which he has jurisdiction, may not apply and enforce the Constitution if he deems the facts justify or require him to do so, the propositions, it seems to me, misconceive the averments of the bill. I say this, since thy disregard the fact that, in substance, while denying the want of power to pass the ordinance, the bill moreover proceeded upon the alternative that if there was power, the ordinance was void because of the confiscatory char- \n\n[218 U.S. 624, 640]\n\u00a0\n acter of the rates fixed. In any event, in view of the fact that the court below expressly considered and decided the constitutional question, the case is brought directly within the statement in the Elliott Case, which I again quote, that 'it is equally true that even although the allegations of Federal right made in the state court were so general and ambiguous in their character that they would not, in and of themselves, necessitate the conclusion that a right of a Federal nature was brought to the attention of the state court, yet, if the state court, in deciding the case, has actually considered and determined a Federal question, although arising on ambiguous averments, then, a Federal controversy having been actually decided, the right of this court to review obtains.' Passing, however, further consideration of the correctness of these propositions as applied to the case made by the record, and conceding them only for sake of argument to be sound, they are irrelevant to the question of dismissal, since they address themselves to the merits of the cause. In other words, if the propositions be accepted as sound, they only demonstrate that error was committed by the court below in undertaking to decide a question of constitutional right. But error in this particular, if found to exist, requires a correction of the wrong done, that is, a reversal, and not in substance the upholding of the wrong committed by refusing to review. If it be true, as announced in the previous decisions of this court, that the requirement of the statute as to the existence of a claim of Federal right for the purpose of review is subserved where the court below has expressly decided the question of Federal right, it must also be true that, in such a case, the duty exists to review and correct the error committed by the court below, whether such error arose from a mistake committed by the court in undertaking to decide a Federal question, or from a mistake committed in deciding the question which was expressly passed upon. In other words, where the court \n\n[218 U.S. 624, 641]\n\u00a0\n below has expressly decided a question of Federal right, and made it the basis of its decree, such decision, for the purpose of review of the merits, in the very nature of things, engenders a conclusive presumption as to the making below of a claim of Federal right. The necessity of this rule cannot be more clearly demonstrated than by the case on this record, as it persuasively appears that the telephone company, since the decree below, has continuously claimed and enjoyed the right to be relieved from the charges fixed in the ordinance of the city of Memphis,-a right possessed as the result of accepting the benefits of the decree and the relief awarded by the injunction therein issued. That is to say, it being certain that the telephone company has, up to this very moment, claimed the rights awarded to it by the decree, it, in my opinion, ought not now to be allowed to successfully assert that it made no claim to the constitutional right upon the existence of which alone the decree went in its favor. To claim the benefits of the decree amounts necessarily to claiming the existence of the constitutional right upon which alone the decree was based.\n The misconception which underlies the theory upon which the judgment of dismissal now rendered is said to be sustained seems to me to be destructive of the power to directly review a decision passing on a claim of constitutional right for which the statute expressly provides. I say this because, in my opinion, the propositions relied on in reason come to this: that the authority which is conferred upon this court to directly review the actions of trial courts in deciding constitutional questions will not be exerted wherever it is found that a trial court has erroneously undertaken to decide such a question. That is to say, that the right to directly review only authorizes the correction of the lesser wrong resulting from having decided a Federal question mistakenly, and does not embrace the greater, of having expressly decided a constitu- \n\n[218 U.S. 624, 642]\n\u00a0\n tional question when there was no power to do so. The duty to review by direct appeal, provided by the act of 1891, to be made efficacious, in the very nature of things must embrace not only the case where the court has erroneously decided a constitutional question, but also must extend to the case where a court has undertaken to expressly decide a constitutional question which it had no right to pass upon.\n Considered from another point of view, the confusion which is involved in the propositions upon which the decree of dismissal must rest, if I correctly understand them, is equally demonstrable. As I have said, the denial of authority to review by direct appeal the action of the trial court in expressly deciding a constitutional question, and awarding rights to the complainants solely upon the theory that they were guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States, can only rest upon the assumption that, although the court had general jurisdiction of the cause, it had not power, under the circumstances, to decide the constitutional questions which it did decide. But, if this premise be true, then there is presented by the direct appeal a question which, in its essence, is embraced within the power which the statute confers to review by direct appeal decisions involving the jurisdiction of trial courts. The distribution of appellate jurisdiction which the act of 1891 effected was stated, and the apparent conflict between some of the adjudged cases on that subject was cleared up, in MacFadden v. United States, \n213 U.S. 288\n, 53 L. ed. 801, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 490. It was reindubitably established that where the jurisdiction of a trial court was invoked on the ground of diversity of citizenship, and during the trial a question of constitutional or Federal right arose or emerged and was decided, the parties were put to the election of determining whether they would prosecute error from or appeal to the proper circuit court of appeals, or pursue the same course directly to or from this court. If the former course was \n\n[218 U.S. 624, 643]\n\u00a0\n adopted, it was declared the right to come directly to this court was waived and the judgment or decree of the circuit court of appeals on the constitutional question would be final. As the result of the ruling now made, it must follow that the right of election under the circumstances here disclosed would be difficult, if not impossible, of exercise, since, if the election were made to bring the case directly to this court, the right to review might be lost upon the theory that the lower court wrongfully undertook to decide the constitutional question which it expressly passed upon. If, on the other hand, the party elected to seek a review in the circuit court of appeals, and the conclusion of that court was that the trial court not only had power to decide the Federal question which it had passed upon, but had rightfully decided it, the right to review in this court would be lost.\n Let me come, then, to the question of authority; that is, the cases relied upon to sustain the decree of dismissal. As it is given me to understand them, none of them sustain the proposition in support of which they are cited. In view of the statement which I have previously made as to the ruling in the Loeb Case and the matter in that case decided, it is unnecessary to extendedly notice a reference to a general expression found in the opinion in that case as to the duty of bringing into a record, by way of a formal bill of exceptions, agreed facts, etc., since the expressions relied upon cannot be given the effect now attributed to them without virtually holding that the Loeb Case overruled itself. This is also true of certain general expressions found in the opinion in Lampasas v. Bell, \n180 U.S. 276\n, 45 L. ed. 527, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 368, decided at the same term as the Loeb Case, and which directly affirmed the ruling there made. Of course, nothing I have said in the slightest degree is intended to controvert the elementary doctrine that where the existence of a Federal question is essential to confer jurisdiction upon a trial court over a cause, \n\n[218 U.S. 624, 644]\n\u00a0\n the jurisdictional facts must be clearly and unambiguously alleged, and not be left to surmise or conjecture. And this is all, I submit, that can rightfully be said to have been decided in Hamilton Gaslight & Coke Co. v. Hamilton, \n146 U.S. 258\n, 36 L. ed. 963, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 90; Barney v. New York, \n193 U.S. 430\n, 48 L. ed. 737, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 502; Louisville v. Cumberland Teleph. & Teleg. Co. 84 C. C. A. 151, 155 Fed. 725, 12 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 500. But that doctrine has no application here, since the jurisdiction of the court below existed, as diversity of citizenship was alleged. This being true, it is apparent that the cases cited can only be made here applicable by failing to distinguish between the test for determining whether sufficient foundation has been laid to justify the bringing of the powers of a trial court into play, and the duty of an appellate tribunal to review the action of the trial court, had in a case within its jurisdiction and authority. After patient research I am of the opinion that it is accurate to say that no case can be found in the books holding that where a trial court has expressly considered and passed upon a question of constitutional rights, and awarded affirmative relief to a party before it, upon the theory that such right was involved in the cause which was within its jurisdiction, that the right to review by this court has been denied because there was no claim of right under the Constitution, since the court, in passing upon the case before it, erroneously based its conclusion upon the mistaken conception that stated propositions of constitutional law were claimed to be applicable.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice McKenna and Mr. Justice Hughes join in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","31":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY OF OMAHA v. OMAHA WATER CO.(1910)\nNo. 159\nArgued: April 19, 1910Decided: May 31, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 180, 181]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John L. Webster, Carl C. Wright, and Harry E. Burnam for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 180, 187]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Howard Mansfield, R. S. Hall, and Herbert C. Lakin for respondent.\n\n\n[218 U.S. 180, 191]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Lurton delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill seeking the specific performance by the city of Omaha of a contract for the purchase and sale of the system of waterworks owned by the appellee company. The waterworks plant in question was constructed in pursuance of legislative authority and municipal ordinance, which need not be considered, for neither party questions the sufficiency of either. The 14th section of the ordinance of 1880, under which the waterworks were constructed by the predecessor of the appellee, was in these words:\n'The city of Omaha shall have the right at any time after the expiration of twenty years to purchase the said waterworks at an appraised valuation, which shall be ascertained by the estimate of three engineers, one to be selected by the city council, one by the waterworks company, and these two to select the third: Provided, That nothing shall be paid for the unexpired franchise of said company.'\n\n In 1903 the city elected to exercise this option, and a board of appraisers was appointed, one by each of the parties and a third by the two so selected. This board of appraisers organized and proceeded to take evidence, and, after considering the matter for about three years, made an appraisement, fixing the value of the system at $6,263,295.49. The appraiser appointed by the city did not concur. The city rejected the award. Whereupon the company filed this bill, which, upon final hearing, was dismissed upon the sole ground of misconduct of the appraisers, other objections not being passed upon. Upon appeal, this decree was reversed and the cause remanded for a decree in pursuance of the opinion of the appellate court. 89 C. C. A. 205, 162 Fed. 232, 15 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 498.\n The case is here upon a writ of certiorari allowed at a former term. \n\n[218 U.S. 180, 192]\n\u00a0\n Three major objections have been urged against the appraisement. First, that it was not concurred in by all; second, that the appraisers heard certain evidence without notice or giving the city an opportunity to hear or rebut; and, third, that the property valued includes a distributing system beyond the corporate limits of Omaha, by which certain suburban villages are supplied, and that to that extent the city made no contract to buy, and, if it did, had no power to do so.\n These in their order:\n\n 1. \nThe only matter to be determined was the value of the waterworks system, which had long served the public. Its construction had been authorized by legislative enactment under which the municipal ordinance was passed. One section of this ordinance provided that the city, at the end of twenty years, might, at its election, purchase the works at a value to be determined by appraisers. The contention is that the refusal of one of the appraisers to concur in the valuation fixed by the majority defeated the appraisal. The matter in question was in no proper sense an arbitration. The contract was in all of its terms agreed upon. One party was to sell and the other to buy, at a valuation determined by the board of appraisers, and unanimity was not stipulated for. Unanimity was hardly to be expected in a board made up as this was When a matter of purely private concern is submitted to the determination of either arbitrators or appraisers, the rule seems to be that there must be unanimity of conclusion by such board, unless otherwise indicated by the terms of the submission. Hobson v. M'Arthur, 16 Pet. 182, 192, 10 L. ed. 930, 933; Green v. Miller, 6 Johns. 39, 5 Am. Dec. 184; Wheeling Gas Co. v. Wheeling, 8 W. Va. 320, 351, et seq. The rule is, however, otherwise when the submission is one which concerns the public. In such submissions, whether it be the arbitration of a difference or the ascertainment of a value, a majority may act, unless otherwise indicated by the agreement for \n\n[218 U.S. 180, 193]\n\u00a0\n submission. Why this distinction should exist is not altogether clear. In both instances the persons to whom the submission is made are acting under a power and must stay within it. The reason probably lies in the fact that public affairs are controlled by majorities, and, by analogy, a majority should control when the submission is a matter which concerns the public. But whatever the reason, so are the authorities. Colombia v. Cauca Co. \n190 U.S. 524\n, 47 L. ed. 1159, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 704; People ex rel. Washington v. Nichols, 52 N. Y. 478, 11 Am. Rep. 734; Wheeling Gas Co. v. Wheeling, 8 W. Va. 320; Grindley v. Barker, 1 Bos. & P. 229.\n The construction and acquisition of a system of water supply and distribution was a public municipal function. The Nebraska legislature, in 1903, went so far as to require municipal ownership of a water supply system in the city of Omaha, and that this should be accomplished either by construction or by the purchase of the existing system. The city, in compliance with and in the exercise of the power conferred when the existing plant was constructed, elected to purchase the existing system under the ordinance of 1880 and the power therein reserved. That in such circumstances the determination of the price to be paid by a submission was a matter of public concern, is too clear for argument. The cases cited above cover the point. The appraisal was not therefore defeated because not concurred in by all.\n The distinction suggested by counsel, that the authority for the submission must come from the public, if there be anything of substance in it, does not prevent the operation of the rule here, for the purchase upon a valuation settled by appraisers was in the ordinance of the city, in pursuance of legislative authority, and, in a very true sense, was an authority to submit to appraisers which came from the public.\n\n 2. \nThe next objection is that the appraisers heard evidence in the absence of the city and without opportunity \n\n[218 U.S. 180, 194]\n\u00a0\n to reply, and that this was such misconduct as to vitiate the valuation. As already hinted, this was not a board of arbitrators. An arbitration implies a difference, a dispute, and involves ordinarily a hearing and all thereby implied. The right to notice of hearings, to produce evidence and cross-examine that produced, is implied when the matter to be decided is one of dispute and difference. But when, as here, the parties had agreed that one should sell and the other buy a specific thing, and the price should be a valuation fixed by persons agreed upon, it cannot be said that there was any dispute or difference. Such an arrangement precludes or prevents difference, and is not intended to settle any which has arisen. This seems to be the distinction between an arbitration and an appraisement, though the first term is often used when the other is more appropriate.\n Counsel have cited and pressed upon us the case of Continental Ins. Co. v. Garrett, 60 C. C. A. 395, 125 Fed. 589, as a case where an appraisement of a fire loss was set aside because evidence was heard in the absence of the parties. But that was a case where the full amount of the insurance was claimed as the extent of the loss. This was denied. It was therefore a plain case of the submission of a dispute or difference which had to be adjusted. The rule applicable to a judicial proceeding therefore applied. It was in fact an arbitration, though the arbitrators were called appraisers. The dispute concerned the thing which had been destroyed, the value of something which was not to be inspected and valued from observation, because it was not in existence. Evidence was therefore essential to show what had been destroyed as well as its value. The case is wholly unlike the one here presented.\n In Collins v. Collins, 26 Beav. 306, where there was a contract for the sale of a brewery at a price to be fixed by persons called arbitrators, one chosen by each party and a third by these two, before entering upon valua- \n\n[218 U.S. 180, 195]\n\u00a0\n tion, it was ruled that they were not arbitrators, but appraisers, and the master of the rolls, Sir John Romilly, said:\n'But I do not think that, in this particular case, the fixing of the price of the property is an arbitration, in the proper sense of the term. An arbitration is a reference to the decision of one or more persons, either with or without an umpire, of some matter or matters in difference between the parties. It is very true that in one sense it must be implied that although there is no existing difference, still that a difference may arise between the parties; yet I think the distinction between an existing difference and one which may arise is a material one, and one which has been properly relied upon in the ease, If nothing has been upon in the case. If nothing has been purchaser between themselves, it can hardly purchaser between themselves, it can hardly them. It might be that if the purchaser knew the price required by the seller, there would be no difference, and that he would be willing to give it. It may well be that if the vendor knew the price which the purchaser would give, there would be no difference, and that he would accept it. It may well be that the decision of a particular valuer appointed might fix the price and might be equally satisfactory to both; so that it can hardly be said that there is a difference between them. Undoubtedly, as a general rule, the seller wants to get the highest price for his property, and the purchaser wishes to give the lowest, and in that sense it may be said that an expected difference between the parties is to be implied in every case; but unless a difference has actually arisen, it does not appear to me to be an arbitration.' Undoubtedly, if two persons enter into an arrangement for the sale of any particular property, and try to settle the terms, but cannot agree, and after dispute and discussion respecting the price, they say, 'We will refer this question of price to A. B., he shall settle it,' \n\n[218 U.S. 180, 196]\n\u00a0\n and thereupon they agree that the matter shall be referred to his arbitration, that would appear to be an 'arbitration,' in the proper sense of the term, and within the meaning of the act; but if they agree to a price to be fixed by another, that does not appear to me to be an arbitration.'\n\n In the present case there was not only no antecedent disagreement as to price, but the ordinance under which the purchase was to be made provided that the property was to pass 'at an appraised valuation, which shall be ascertained by the estimate of three engineers,' etc. The board was accordingly made up of such engineers, selected because they were experts of experience in the service they were expected to perform. That it was the understanding that these engineers were to examine and estimate the value and acquaint themselves with the condition and extent of the property in question in their own way, and not according to the procedure required in a judicial proceeding, is made clear by the avowals made by the counsel representing the parties at the beginning of the valuation. Thus, the attorney for the city, addressing the valuers, said:\n'As to the matter of the procedure to be adopted by your board, as to the method of arriving at the amount of property owned by the water company, and the determination of its value, the city of Omaha suggests that this board, having been appointed as experts in regard to the value of such property, ought to make a personal investigation as to the amount and extent of the property of the water company, together with its condition, and determine therefrom its value. As to the method of arriving at the amount and condition of the property of the water company, the city of Omaha suggests that this board may arrive at such facts by any method or means deemed advisable by it; but that, if the board shall determine to take proof and testimony before it, that it should go no further than to the question of the amount and condition \n\n[218 U.S. 180, 197]\n\u00a0\n of the property, and that said testimony should not be conclusive upon this board, but simply for its advice and information in the matter. It is not the opinion of the city of Omaha that it would be proper or necessary to call expert witnesses as to the value, since the members of the board have been selected as experts (to) whose judgment the question of value must be submitted upon the examination of the property.'\n\n Counsel for the water company appear to have fully concurred in this view of the function of the board.\n That the great bulk of the evidence was heard or submitted in the presence of counsel representing both sides is true. This course did not, however, preclude them from enlightening their judgment as experts by either personal inspection or by informing themselves in any other way of the value of the plant in question without calling in counsel, if they desired further information. The thing complained of is that the valuers called upon the company for their books, and that they had these books gone over by an expert auditor of their own selection. This, counsel say, was done without notice to the city, and after the close of the hearings. But it was not done secretly, for the city learned of it and asked an opportunity to be present when the books were submitted. What information was derived from the books is not shown. We have only the lone fact that the appraisers, of their own motion, asked an opportunity to look over and have audited the company's books, and that the company granted the privilege as 'confidential information' for the use of the appraisers only. Neither are counsel justified in saying that the books were called for after the matter was in the hands of the appraisers for conclusion. When the parties had submitted their maps, plats, blue prints, and such other evidence throwing light upon the value of the plant, as they desired, and had been heard in argument and upon brief, the chairman of the board said in substance to \n\n[218 U.S. 180, 198]\n\u00a0\n counsel that much time would be necessary to reach a conclusion; that the real work of valuation had been but begun; and that 'much more information must be sought by this board.'\n There is not the slightest evidence in the record of partiality, bad motive, or misconduct affecting the action of the board. Its members appear to have been gentlemen of high character, professionally and otherwise, and if their conclusion is to be set aside, it must be because they deemed it within their power to have a confidential examination made of the books of the company to assist them in arriving at a valuation.\n If this was a technical arbitration of a matter of dispute or difference between the parties, to be heard and decided upon evidence submitted, the examination of the company's books without the consent of the city or the presence of its representatives would be such misconduct as would vitiate the award. In such a matter, the rules relating to judicial inquiry would apply. Continental Ins. Co. v. Garrett, 60 C. C. A. 395, 125 Fed. 589, and cases cited. But in an appraisement, such as that here involved, the strict rules relating to arbitration and awards do not apply, and the appraisers were not rigidly required to confine themselves either to matters within their own knowledge, or those submitted to them formally in the presence of the parties; but might reject, if they saw fit, evidence so submitted, and inform themselves from any other source, as experts who were at last to act upon their own judgment. Kelly v. Crawford, 5 Wall. 785, 790, 18 L. ed. 562, 563; Green & C. Street Pass. R. Co. v. Moore, 64 Pa. 79, 91; Palmer v. Clark, 106 Mass. 373, 389; California Annual Conference v. Seitz, 74 Cal. 287, 15 Pac. 839; Curry v. Lackey, 35 Mo. 394.\n In the absence of any evidence of actual bad faith, we do not hesitate about agreeing with the circuit court of appeals in the conclusion that there was no such misconduct as to vitiate the valuation. \n\n[218 U.S. 180, 199]\n\u00a0\n 3. The next contention is that the valuation includes property not within the submission, and which the city did not have power to buy. The point from which the water wax taken by the existing water plant was beyond the corporate limits of Omaha. In the immediate suburbs of the city there are several villages outside the corporate limits. The distributing system of the Omaha Water Company has, from time to time, been extended to these outlying suburban towns. It is now said that the appraisers have valued these outlying distributing systems as a part of the plant to be acquired by the city under the ordinance electing to purchase.\n As to the power of the city: The charter,  61, Laws of Nebraska, 1887, c. 10, provided for the construction and maintenance of waterworks, 'either within or without the corporate limits of the city.' This is said to only allow the location of pumping works or source of supply outside the city. The city does not therefore object to valuing the supply station and mains extending to the city, as within the contemplated purchase. But it is said that the authority is limited to a distributing system wholly within the corporate limits. That the primary purpose was to supply the people of Omaha with water for public and private purposes is clear. But does that forbid that those who live outside may not be also supplied from the main plant, and, if necessary, by such extensions, not inconsistent with the primary object, as may prove desirable as suburbs grow up around the city?\n These powers were supplemented by the charter of 1897 (Laws Neb. 1897, c. 10). Under  27 of that charter it was given, among other things, 'power to appropriate any waterworks system, plant, or property already constructed, to supply the city and the inhabitants thereof with water, or any part thereof, whether lying within said city or in part without the city, and within 10 miles from the corporate limits of such city, including all real estate, buildings \n\n[218 U.S. 180, 200]\n\u00a0\n machinery, pipes, mains, hydrants, basins, reservoirs, and all appurtenances reasonably necessary thereto, and a part of or connected with said system, plant, or property, and franchises to own and operate the same, if any.' This was again supplemented by the act of 1903, chapter 12, providing a method of procedure for acquiring municipal water plants and the creation of a water board for their control and management, being the act under which the city was required to take steps to acquire its own water plant system. Again, by the Neb. Comp. St. of 1907, chapter 12a, it is among other things, provided by  242, that the water board may contract with any municipality adjacent to said city to supply such municipality with water for domestic, mechanical, public, or fire purposes,- a provision plainly contemplating just such a condition as would ensue if the city should acquire the existing system of works with a distributing system extending to villages adjacent. The review of the legislation touching the power of the city, and the conclusion of the circuit court of appeals from that legislation, that the city had the power to acquire the system as it existed, and has the power to operate so much of it as is intended to supply the suburban towns adjacent which may be acquired, is full and satisfactory, and meets our approval.\n We are also satisfied with the conclusion of the circuit court of appeals that the acquisition of the system as it existed at the time the city made its election to purchase was within the contemplation of both the city and the water company, and that the valuation of the system as an entirety was the matter which the appraisers were required to do. What we shall say upon this point will support our conclusion as to the power of the city, for the legislation upon that matter must be read in the light of the subject-matter and of all the known local conditions. The most weighty fact in this connection is, that the system was one single system, having a common source \n\n[218 U.S. 180, 201]\n\u00a0\n of supply and common main connections therewith. Its dismemberment is not to be thought of the option is so plainly limited to the purchase of only so much of the distributing system as lay wholly within the corporate limits as to admit of no other meaning. A presumption against dismemberment is not overthrown even if the city had no power to sell water to people or municipalities beyond its limits. If these outside distributing pipes could not be lawfully used by the city for the purpose for which the water company had used them, it does not follow that a contract to buy would be thereby any the less a contract to buy the plant as a unitary system. Aside from contract obligation which may pass with the plant, the city might cut off the supply of water to such outlying environs, if it saw fit, whether it could or could not legally supply water through the distributing pipes which had theretofore reached them. Certain it is that as the several towns adjacent had no source of supply, no pumping station of their own, disintegration would leave the water company with no means of supplying them with water. The distributing pipes under ground would, separated from the ownership of the pumping station, reservoir, filling or settling basins, necessarily lose much of the value which attached to them as a part of a going plant.\n The reservation in the ordinance under which the works were constructed should be read and interpreted in the light of the almost certain extension of the plant as the expansion and growth of the city might demand. The city, at the time the ordinance was passed, had some 30, 000 people. When the election to buy the plant was made, it had, approximately, four times as many. As is usual in respect of growing cities, there had grown up around it groups of population, which, in some cases, expanded into semidependent municipalities. \n\n[218 U.S. 180, 202]\n\u00a0\n CONNECTED BY CONTINUOUS STREETS AND CAR LinEs, they made one large community, and constituted greater Omaha. The water company, as was obviously expected from the beginning, expanded with Omaha, and met the public necessities by including these outside populations within its distributing system.\n The appraisers, in making their estimate of valuation, included $562, 712.45 for the 'going value.' This separation of an element contributing to the value of each tangible part was done because required to be done under an order made in the circuit court in a suit in which the water board of the city of Omaha was complainant and the members of the board of appraisers and the water company were defendants. The object of that suit was to instruct the appraisers in respect to the mode and manner in which they should proceed. An order resulted which required the board to report the separate elements making up the aggregate value of the plant.\n The option to purchase excluded any value on account of unexpired franchise; but it did not limit the value to the bare bones of the plant, its physical properties, such as its lands, its machinery, its water pipes or settling reservoirs, nor to what it would take to reproduce each of its physical features. The value, in equity and justice, must include whatever is contributed by the fact of the connection of the items making a complete and operating plant. The difference between a dead plant and a live one is a real value, and is independent of any franchise to go on, or any mere good will as between such a plant and its customers. That kind of good will, as suggested in Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co. \n212 U.S. 19\n, 53 L. ed. 382, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 192, is of little or no commercial value when the business is, as here, a natural monopoly, with which the customer must deal, whether he will or no. That there is a difference between even the cost of duplication, less depreciation, of the elements making up the water company plant, and the \n\n[218 U.S. 180, 203]\n\u00a0\n commercial value of the business as a going concern, is evident. Such an allowance was upheld in National Waterworks Co. v. Kansas City, 27 L.R.A. 827, 10 C. C. A. 653, 27 U. S. App. 165, 62 Fed. 853, where the opinion was by Mr. Justice Brewer. We can add nothing to the reasoning of the learned justice, and shall not try to. That case has been approved and followed in Gloucester Water Supply Co. v. Gloucester, 179 Mass. 365, 60 N. E. 977, and Norwich Gas & Electric Co. v. Norwich, 76 Conn. 565, 57 Atl. 764. No such question was considered in either Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co. \n212 U.S. 1\n, 53 L. ed. 371, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148, or in Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co. supra. Both cases were rate cases, and did not concern the ascertainment of value under contracts of sale.\n Aside from the errors pointed out in the petition for the writ of certiorari, counsel have suggested certain difficulties before a final decree, which are not disposed of in the opinion or decree of the circuit court of appeals. The circuit court had dismissed the bill. The circuit court of appeals considered and decided all of the large questions which were involved under the bill, but did not direct the precise form of the decree which the circuit court should enter, and remanded the case with directions to reverse the decree dismissing the bill, and to proceed in accordance with the opinion. Referring to certain matters left open, the court, in its opinion, said:\n'In a transaction of this magnitude there will always be encountered minor obstacles that will readily yield to business methods. What the parties cannot agree upon, the trial court has full power to determine according to principles of right and justice. We refer here to such contentions as that there are two or three properties in the city of Omaha belonging to the company, but not needed in the business, and also that there are supposed defects in its title to other properties. The latter are not of great importance in comparison with the magnitude of the entire system. The property not needed was \n\n[218 U.S. 180, 204]\n\u00a0\n appraised separately and it can be excluded from the sale, and the trial court can determine whether the title to other properties is defective. It is not necessary that the title of the company to all the lands upon which its works are built or through which its pipes are laid should be a fee simple, perfect in every particular and subject to no criticism. An irrevocable license, for instance, would be sufficient, or a title based upon prescription. If, however, there should be found substantial defects, opportunity should be given the company to remedy them; and if it is unable to do so, the parts of the property so circumstanced can be valued and the purchase price abated accordingly. It would be expressing too narrow a view to say that an appraisal of a great system of waterworks under a contract of purchase must fail because the title to a small part, not vital to the integrity of the system, was afterwards found to be defective. That the deed tendered by the company was not such as the city was required to take is immaterial. It is sufficient that the company was able, ready, and willing to do what might lawfully fully be required of it. At some time during the progress of the cause in the trial court, the trustees of the mortgages should be made parties, to the end that the precise amount of outstanding bonds may be ascertained and paid, and the liens discharged concurrently with payment by the city of the purchase price. Doubtless the company will have to use the proceeds of sale in paying its mortgage indebtedness. Or, if an arrangement is desired, such as was made in the Kansas City case, whereby the mortgages are assumed by the city, and the company released from liability, the presence in the case of the trustees would facilitate it.\n\n'The decree is reversed and the cause is remanded with direction to proceed to decree in accordance with the views expressed in this opinion.'\n\n We do not feel ourselves under any obligation to do \n\n[218 U.S. 180, 205]\n\u00a0\n more than to hold that we find no error in the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals, and to remand the case to the Circuit Court, to be proceeded with accordingly.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","32":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOLUMBIA HEIGHTS REALTY CO. v. RUDOLPH(1910)\nNo. 157\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 547, 548]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Arthur A. Birney and Leo Simmons for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 547, 549]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James Francis Smith and Edward H. Thomas for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Lurton delivered the opinion of the court:\n In 1899, the then commissioners for the District of Columbia filed a petition in the supreme court of the District for the condemnation of land necessary for the extension of Eleventh street northwest. In due course the statutory jury of seven filed an award of damages and of benefits. The verdict was confirmed so far as it awarded damages for the property, but was disaffirmed and vacated as to the amount of benefits. The award, so far as it assessed the damages, was accepted, and the money has long since been paid; but from the order setting aside or vacating the assessment of benefits, the commissioners appealed to the court of appeals of the District, where that order was reversed, and the proceeding remanded to the lower court, with direction to vacate the order setting aside the amount of benefits, 'and for such further proceedings in the case, according to law, as may be just and right.' The supreme court of the district, on March 4, 1904, in obedience to the mandate of the court of appeals, set aside its former order vacating the assessment of benefits by the jury, and thereupon heard the matter upon exceptions of the defendants to the award, and upon the motion of the petitioners for a confirmation of the award of benefits. Whereupon an order was made denying confirmation, and ordering that 'in case the petitioners desire to proceed further in the premises, they shall, within a reasonable time, make application to this court for directions to the marshal to summon a jury of twelve, as provided by law.' From this order refusing confirmation, the petitioners prayed an appeal, but did not perfect same. The next step in the case was taken on June 17, 1904, when the landowners moved the court \n\n[217 U.S. 547, 550]\n\u00a0\n to dismiss the proceeding, assigning as reason therefor that 'the law under which such proceeding must be had has been repealed;' and, second, 'for failure of petitioners to proceed as required by the order of this court of March 4, 1904.' Upon this motion the court, on June 17, 1904, made an order in these words:\n'Upon consideration of the proceedings herein and the motion filed by Abner Greenleaf and others on June 17th, A. D. 1904, it is by the court, this 17th day of June, A. p. 1904, ordered, that the petitioners in the above-entitled cause, within sixty days from the date hereof, proceed in the matter of the reassessment of benefits herein, in accordance with the terms and provisions of the act of Congress approved June 6, 1900, entitled, 'An Act for the Extension of Columbia Road East of Thirteenth Street, and for Other Purposes.\" [31 Stat. at L. 665, chap. 809.]\n\n Thereupon the then commissioners, in continuance of the old proceeding under the act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. at L. 1344, chap. 431), filed an amended and supplementary proceeding according to the terms of the later act of June 6, 1900 (31 Stat. at L. 668, chap. 809), in which, after setting out all of the proceedings under the pending petition, they prayed for a reassessment of benefits against abutting and adjacent owners whose lands had not been assessed for benefits as required both under the former and later acts of Congress in respect to the extension of Eleventh street northwest. Under this amended petition a jury of seven was impaneled, who returned as assessment of benefits against the plaintiffs. This, after exceptions had been overruled, was confirmed. A writ of error was taken by the plaintiffs in error to the court of appeals for the District of Columbia, where the judgment of the supreme court was affirmed. Thereupon this writ of error was sued out.\n This protracted litigation is now before us, unaccompanied by an assignment of errors. \n\n[217 U.S. 547, 551]\n\u00a0\n The act of February 9, 1893, chap. 74,  8, 27 Stat. at L. 436, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 573, concerning writs of error and appeals from the court of appeals of the District of Columbia, provides that they shall be allowed in the 'same manner and under the same regulations as heretofore provided for in cases of writs of error on judgments or appeals from decrees rendered in the supreme court of the District of Columbia.' The procedure referred to is that found in  705, Rev. Stat., which provides that such writs or appeals shall be allowed in the 'same manner and under the same regulations as are provided in cases of writs of error on judgments or appeals from decrees rendered in a circuit court.'\n Secs. 997 and 1012, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 712, 716), require the transcript from the circuit court to be filed with an assignment of error, and the 35th rule of this court prescribes the character of such assignments, and that 'no writ of error or appeal shall be allowed until such assignment of errors shall have been filed, . . .' and that 'errors not assigned according to this rule will be disregarded; but the court, at its option, may notice a plain error not assigned.' This rule refers in terms only to writs of error and appeals under  5 of the act of March 3, 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 827, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549], but it is, in effect, extended to every writ of error or appeal to or from any court by rule 21, which requires that the brief shall set out 'a specification of the errors involved.' This 'specification of error' must conform to rule 35 in particularity. Thus, the fourth paragraph provides: 'When there is no assignment of errors, as required by  997 of the Revised Statutes, counsel will not be heard, except at the request of the court; and errors not specified according to this rule will be disregarded; but the court, at its option, may notice a plain error not assigned or specified.'\n The court has, however, not regarded itself as under any absolute obligation to dismiss a writ of error or ap- \n\n[217 U.S. 547, 552]\n\u00a0\n peal because of the nonassignment of errors, as required by  997 and 1012, Rev. Stat., having, by its rules, reserved the option to notice a plain error, whether assigned or not. Independent School Dist. v. Hall, \n106 U.S. 428\n, 27 L. ed. 237, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 417; Farrar v. Churchill, \n135 \nU.S. 609, 614\n, 34 S. L. ed. 246, 249, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 771; United States v. Pena, \n175 \nU.S. 500, 502\n, 44 S. L. ed. 251, 252, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 165.\n In the present case, the brief of counsel for the plaintiffs in error specifies ten alleged errors. The defendants in error have made no objection for failure to assign error under  997 and 1012, Rev. Stat., but have submitted the case upon the specifications of error in the brief of the plaintiffs in error. For these reasons, we shall exercise the option reserved under both rules 21 and 35, of examining the transcript, that we may be advised as to whether there has occurred any 'plain error' which obviously demands correction.\n\n 1. \nDid the court err in allowing an assessment of benefits under the act of June 6, 1900? We think not. Under the proceedings had theretofore under the act of March 3, 1899, there had resulted a condemnation of the land needed for the extension of Eleventh street northwest, and an assessment of damages sustained by the landowners, which award had been confirmed and the money paid. But that act provided 'that of the amount found due and awarded as damages for and in respect of the land condemned under this section for the opening of said streets, not less than one half thereof shall be assessed by the jury in said proceedings against the pieces and parcels of ground situate and lying on each side of the extension of said streets, and also on all or any adjacent pieces or parcels of land which will be benefited by the opening of said streets, as herein provided.' Objection to this arbitrary fixing of the minimum amount to be assessed for benefits upon lots benefited by the opening of the street was considered, and the act sustained as within the complete jurisdiction which \n\n[217 U.S. 547, 553]\n\u00a0\n the United States possesses over the District of Columbia, in the case of Wight v. Davidson, \n181 U.S. 371\n, 45 L. ed. 900, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 616. The benefits assessable under that act were separately found as against each parcel of property supposed to be benefited, but that part of the award of the jury was vacated upon the erroneous supposition that the rule for assessment of benefits in the act was void. This action of the District court, as we have already seen, was reversed. Thereupon the District court denied the motion of the commissioners to affirm the verdict of the jury assessing benefits. In this situation it was open to the commissioners to apply for another jury. Before they did so the special act of June 6, 1900, was passed. The effect of the action of the court in refusing to confirm the first assessment of benefits was to make void the award and verdict of the jury, in so far as that verdict had separately found the benefits accruing to the property by the extension of the street. The commissioners were therefore complying with the direction to them found in the 12th section of the act of Congress of June 6, 1900. That act provided that the commissioners should make application to the supreme court of the District of Columbia 'for the final ratification and confirmation of the awards of the jury for and in respect to the land condemned for the extension of Eleventh street,' etc. And 'in the event that the assessments for benefits levied by the jury in relation to said Eleventh street shall for any reason be declared void, the said commissioners . . . are authorized and directed to make application to said court for a reassessment of such benefits, under and in accordance with the provisions of this act.' The procedure under this act differs in many particulars from that under the act of 1899. In view of this, the property owners, on June 17, 1904, moved the court to dismiss the old proceeding, basing the motion, as shown by the entry upon the journal of the court, upon the contention that \n\n[217 U.S. 547, 554]\n\u00a0\n 'the law under which such proceeding must be had has been repealed,' and 'for failure of the petitioners to proceed as required by the order of this court,' of March 4, 1904. Thereupon the court made the order heretofore set out, requiring a reassessment of benefits under the later act.\n There is no possible doubt as to the correctness of this order. The new act superseded the former act in so far as the reassessment of benefits was concerned. Both parties seemingly concurred in assuming that this was the case, and that the refusal of the court to confirm the original assessment of benefits was an annulment of the award of benefits by the first jury. The order was in part based upon the motion of the plaintiffs in error, and was made without protest or objection, and none was suggested for more than a year. Such a reassessment was but a continuance of the original proceeding, which might well be done by an amended or supplementary petition by virtue of the authority of the new act. This disposes also of the contention that the proceeding for reassessment of benefits was barred by the statute of limitations of three years. The proceeding for reassessment was not a new action, but a continuance of the old one, and therefore not subject to the operation of the statute.\n\n 2. \nComing now to the errors assigned upon the procedure under this petition for a reassessment of benefits. The first objection is that the court did not examine the jurors as to whether they possessed the qualifications required by  4 of the new act, nor administer to them the oath required by the statute under which the court was proceeding.\n These objections come too late. The statute made it the duty of the court to hear objections to jurors 'before accepting them.' None were made. So with the oath; if that administered departed in any particular from \n\n[217 U.S. 547, 555]\n\u00a0\n the terms of the statute, objection should have been made at the time. None was made, and only after the verdict was any made. The journal entry, moreover, recites that the jurors summoned by the marshal, under the order theretofore made, were 'accepted as qualified,' and that the oath was administered to them 'in accordance with the provisions of the act of Congress of June 6, 1900.' It is now sought to contradict the record by a statement contained in a bill of exceptions allowed after final judgment, that counsel for the plaintiffs in error was not present when the order of record was made and the jury accepted and sworn, and that after they had been so accepted and sworn, counsel was denied the right to examine the jurors as to their qualifications. In respect to the oath administered, the bill of exceptions contains the meager statement that the jurors were sworn to 'assess the benefits accruing to the property abutting or adjacent to Eleventh street extended, according to the statute.'\n The oath which is required to be administered by  4 of the act of June 6, 1900, under which the court was proceeding, was an oath applicable only to the condemnation of land for an exension of the Columbia road, and the jury were to be sworn to assess the damages and benefits resulting from the extension of that road. Such an otah in the present case, when only benefits were to be assessed for property already taken and paid for, upon another street altogether, was, of course, not applicable. The court, in such circumstances, required as it was to follow the procedure of the columbia road statute, was perfectly of the Columbia road statute, was perfectly to the property concerned in this proceeding. True, the oath prescribed by  4 includes an affirmation that the jury was disinterested and unrelated, and would act without favor or partiality; but the statement in the bill of exceptions does not show that these matters were omited from the oath, and the presumption remains that the \n\n[217 U.S. 547, 556]\n\u00a0\n statutory oath was followed as far as applicable, which is the implication from the journal entry.\n As to the qualitications of the jurors: Primarily, they had been summoned, as shown by the order to the marshal and his return, as men having the statutory qualifications. The journal recites that the court 'accepted them as qualified.' No hint is found in this transcript that they were not qualified, or that they were guilty of any misconduct. Not having asked the court to examine them before accepting them, or to be then permitted to qualify them, it was not reversible error to deny the privilege after they had been sworn and accepted. That counsel was not present when they were accepted and sworn does not invalidate the impaneling of the jury. Under the statute and the warning order, the parties interested were required to be present and 'continue in attendance' until the matter was ended.\n\n 3. \nIt is assigned as error that the court erred in overruling the plea of res judicata as to lots 1 and 30 in block 27, and lots 1 to 16 in block 28. The plea was not good.\n The first jury, that which, under the act of March, 1899, assessed both damages and benefits, was, under that act, required to award damages not only for land taken for the extension of the street, but also damages to the remainder of the land by being left high above or below the grade. The then owners of these lots were awarded such grade damages to land not taken, which award has been confirmed and paid. But the same jury, as they were instructed to do, assessed the benefits sustained to the remainder, not taken, separately. This part of the verdict was set aside; so that, as it stands, the plaintiffs have been paid the damages sustained to the property not taken by reason of the grade resulting, but have never been assessed for the benefits accruing to the same untaken remainder. It is now said that the confirmation of the amount of damages is an adjudication \n\n[217 U.S. 547, 557]\n\u00a0\n that the lots not taken were damaged, and not benefited. But that is not the legal construction of the judgment, for the real damages have never been reduced by the benefits, which the statute says shall not be less than 50 per cent of the damages sustained. The former judgment was conclusive only as to the damages, and that has not and could not be reopened. The benefits, having been separately stated in that verdict, remained to be determined, and were properly reassessed under the later act of Congress.\n\n 4. \nAlleged error in instructions given or refused.\n The sixth assignment noticed in the brief is error in giving the first instruction asked by the commissioners. This request was in these words:\n'It is the duty of the jury to consider and assess the benefits which have resulted to the pieces or parcels of land on each side of Eleventh street northwest, as extended from Florida avenue to Lydecker avenue, and the benefits which have resulted to any and all other pieces or parcels of land from the extension; and in determining the amounts to be so assessed against said pieces or parcels of land, the jury shall take into consideration the respective situations of the said pieces or parcels of land, and the benefits that they have severally received from said extension of said Eleventh street. By extension of the street, the jury are to understand its establishment, laying out, and completion for all the ordinary uses of a public thoroughfare, or highway.'\n\n The objection to this seems to be that the jury was not limited to the benefits resulting immediately from the opening of the street, but might consider all enhancement which might come from subsequent improvement of or upon the street. But this was not the whole of the instruction of the court upon that subject, and any doubt as to what the court did mean was eliminated by other parts of the charge. Thus, the court said that to lay an \n\n[217 U.S. 547, 558]\n\u00a0\n assessment for benefits against any piece of land abutting upon said street or adjacent thereto, the jury must find that the benefits upon which such assessment is based was brought about by the extension of said street, and not by any improvement made since it was extended, or by the extension of car lines in said street. Again, the court said that such benefits must accrue 'immediately from the extension of the street in question.' This was repeated when it was said that 'the benefit assessable must be an enhancement in value immediately upon the opening and extension of said street,' and that they had 'no right to consider any enhancement or increase in value that is the result of any special improvements made on the street after it was opened and established, as previously stated.' There is no reason for doubting the meaning of the court.\n The several requests made by the plaintiffs in error were sufficiently covered by the charge as given.\n\n 5. \nThe next specification of error in the brief is in these words: 'The court erred in refusing to review the evidence taken before the jury, and to determine if the verdict was unjust and unreasonable.' The act of June 6, 1900, under which the court was proceeding, required the jury to go upon and view the premises, and then to hear and receive such evidence as might be offered, in the presence of the court, or otherwise, as the court might direct, and to then return the majority verdict as to the amount of benefits against the property involved. In this case the evidence was not heard by the jury in the presence of the court, that being according to the order of the court.\n The act further provides that 'the court shall have power to hear and determine any objections which may be filed to said verdict or award, and to set aside and vacate the same, in whole or in part, when satisfied that it is unjust or unreasonable, and in such event a new jury \n\n[217 U.S. 547, 559]\n\u00a0\n shall be summoned, who shall proceed to assess the damages or benefits, as the case may be,' etc.\n This specification of error has for its foundation the concluding paragraph of the bill of exceptions, as follows:\n'The foregoing substance of the testimony taken before the said jury as abstracted by the appellant from the testimony filed as an affidavit in the case by order of the court. After the counsel had argued the case upon the propositions of the law raised by the exceptions, counsel for the appellant, in support of its motions and exceptions, offered to read to the court the said testimony, but the court declined to hear the same or consider it at the time in full, counsel saying that it would be his purpose to consider the same if the court found, after consideration, the propositions of the law were against the appellant. But counsel had no further opportunity to argue said case on the evidence, and without reading the evidence, or hearing it fully read, the court passed an order overruling all the exceptions, and confirming said verdict, and refused to consider said testimony any further, and the appellant excepted.\n\n'And thereupon the appellant presented to the court, the justice who presided at the hearing of this case, and made the rulings herein referred to, this, its bill of exceptions, containing the proceedings before the court and before the jury or commission, with the substance of the evidence taken before the said jury, and the affidavits filed in the case subsequent thereto, as herein referred to, with the exceptions as therein noted, which were duly taken by the appellant separately, in the order in which they appear, and allowed by the court at the time.'\n\n The certificate was in these words:\n'And the said appellant, by its counsel, prays the court to sign and seal this, its bill of exceptions, and make the same a part of the record in this case, which is now accordingly done, and the said bill of exceptions is here \n\n[217 U.S. 547, 560]\n\u00a0\n now signed and sealed in due form and made a part of the record in this case this 14th day of August, 1907, nuno pro tunc.'\n\n Why the court should be required to read, or hear read, 'in full,' a paper which was confessedly but the substance of the testimony taken before the jury, as 'abstracted by appellants from the testimony filed as an affidavit in the case,' we are at a loss to know. The power of the court to review the award by such a jury must, in the very nature of the matter, be limited to plain errors of law, misconduct, or grave error of fact indicating plain partiality or corruption. The jury saw and heard the witnesses; the court did not. The jury went upon and viewed the premises; the court did not. The duty to review did not involve mere error in judgment as to the extent of enhancement in value, for the judgment of the jury manifestly rested upon much which could not be brought before the court. The jury was expected to exercise its own judgment, derived from personal knowledge from a view of the premises, as well as from the opinion evidence which might be brought before them. Shoemaker v. United States, \n147 U.S. 282\n, 37 L. ed. 170, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 361. No specific wrong, injustice, or error is pointed out. Even if we had all of the evidence before us, it would not be within our province to weigh it. But we have not, nor is there, any agreed statement of facts. it is impossible for us to say, therefore, whether the trial court erred in holding the award not unreasonable, or so unjust as to require a new trial before another jury. Other matters complained of in argument need not be specifically referred to.\n We find no error, and the judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","33":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCONLEY v. BALLINGER(1910)\nNo. 77\nArgued: Decided: January 31, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 84, 85]\n\u00a0\n Miss Lyda B. Conley, in propria persona, for appellant.\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 84, 87]\n\u00a0\n Solicitor General Bowers and Mr. Barton Corneau for appellees.\n\n\n[216 U.S. 84, 88]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill in equity to enjoin the Secretary of the Interior and commissioners appointed by him from selling or disturbing an Indian cemetery. The bill was demurred to on the grounds, among others, that the matter in dispute was not alleged to exceed the value of $2,000, and that the suit was a suit against the United States. The bill was dismissed for want of jurisdiction, and an appeal was taken to this court.\n The substance of the bill is as follows: The plaintiff is a citizen of the state of Kansas and of the United States, and a descendant of Wyandotte Indians dealt with in the treaty of January 31, 1855. 10 Stat. at L. 1159. By article 1 of that treaty the tribe of the Wyandottes was to be dissolved on the ratification of the treaty, and the members made citizens of the United States, with exemption for a limited time of such as should apply for it. By article 2, the Wyandotte Nation ceded their land to the United States for subdivision in severalty to the members, 'except as follows, viz.: The portion now inclosed and used as a public burying ground shall be permanently reserved and appropriated for that purpose;' etc. The plaintiff's parents and sister are buried in this ground, and she alleges that she 'has seisin, and a legal estate and vested \n\n[216 U.S. 84, 89]\n\u00a0\n rights in and to' the same, and that although the land is worth $75,000, there is no standard by which to estimate the value of her rights. (It is set forth further that, by a treaty of February 23, 1867, with the Senecas and others, art. 13, 15 Stat. at L. 513, 516, a portion of the Wyandottes were allowed to begin anew a tribal existence; but the bearing of this treaty upon the case does not appear.) The defendants are intending and threatening to remove the remains of persons buried as above to another designated place and to sell the burying ground; the proceeds, after certain deductions, to be paid to parties to the treaty of 1855, or their representatives, in accordance with the act of Congress of June 21, 1906, chap. 3504, 34 Stat. at L. 325, 348. This act is alleged to violate the constitutional rights of the plaintiff and to be void.\n The record shows that the court left it open to the plaintiff to amend so as to avoid any technical objection that could be avoided by amendment, and as she conducted her own case, we go as far as we can in leaving such considerations on one side. For every reason we have examined the facts with anxiety to give full weight to any argument by which the plaintiff's pious wishes might be carried out. But if it is obvious that the bill could not be amended so as to state a case within the jurisdiction of the court, the judgment must be affirmed or the appeal dismissed, as the defect of jurisdiction turns out to be peculiar to courts of the United States as such, or one common to all courts.\n The allegation of the plaintiff's interest plainly does not mean that she has taken possession of the whole burying ground, and has acquired a seisin of the whole by wrong. As it does not mean that, it must mean simply a statement of the rights that the plaintiff conceives to have been conferred by the treaty of 1855 upon those whom she represents. The argument that vested rights were conferred upon individuals by that treaty, stated as strongly as we can state it, would be that, as the tribe was to be dissolved by the treaty, it cannot have been the beneficiary of the agreement for the permanent \n\n[216 U.S. 84, 90]\n\u00a0\n appropriation of the land in question as a public burying ground, that the language used imported a serious undertaking, and that to give it force as such the United States must be taken to have declared a trust. If a trust was declared, the benefit by it must have been limited to the members of the disintegrated tribe and their representatives, whether as individuals or as a limited public, and thus it might be possible to work out a right of property in the plaintiff, as a first step towards maintaining her bill.\n But we do not pursue the attempt to state the argument on that side, because we are of opinion that it is plainly impossible for the plaintiff to prevail. There is no question as to the complete legislative power of the United States over the land of the Wyandottes while it remained in their occupation before their quitclaim to the United States. Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, \n187 \nU.S. 553, 565\n, 47 S. L. ed. 299, 306, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 216. When they made that grant they excepted this parcel. Therefore it remained, as the whole of the land had been before, in the ownership of the United States, subject to the recognized use of the Wyandottes. But the right of the Wyandottes was in them only as a tribe or nation. The right excepted was a right of the tribe. The United States maintained and protected the Indian use or occupation against others, but was bound itself only by honor, not by law. This mode of statement sounds technical, perhaps, but the principles concerned are not so. The government cannot be supposed to have abandoned merely for a moment and for a secondary matter its general attitude toward the Indians as wards over whom and whose property it retained unusual powers, so long as they remained set apart from the body of the people. The very treaty of 1867, cited in the bill, providing for the resumption of the tribal mode of life by the Wyandottes, shows that the United States assumed still to possess such unusual powers. It seems to us that the reasonable interpretation of the language as to the burying ground is not that the United States declares itself subject to a trust which no court could enforce against it, if against anyone (see Naganab v. Hitchcock, 202 \n\n[216 U.S. 84, 91]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 473, 50 L. ed. 1113, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 667; Oregon v. Hitchcock, \n202 U.S. 60\n, 50 L. ed. 935, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 568), while, on the other hand, it stripped itself of any protecting power that otherwise it might have retained. It seems to us more reasonable to suppose that the words, 'shall be permanently reserved and appropriated for that purpose,' like the rest of the treaty, were addressed only to the tribe, and rested for their fulfilment on the good faith of the United States,-a good faith that would not be broken by a change believed by Congress to be for the welfare of the Indians.\n We are driven to the conclusion that even if the suit is not to be regarded as a suit against the United States, within the authority of the cases cited (\n202 U.S. 60\n and 473), the United States retained the same power that it would have had if the Wyandotte tribe had continued in existence after the treaty of 1855; that the only rights in and over the cemetery were tribal rights; and that the plaintiff cannot establish a legal or equitable title of the value of $2,000, or indeed any right to have the cemetery remain undisturbed by the United States.\n We are of opinion that, in view of the circumstances, it is just that the bill should be dismissed without costs.

R. CO.(1910)\nNo. 123\nArgued: Decided: April 4, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 157, 158]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wilbur Owen and Elbert H. Hubbard for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 157, 162]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William H. Farnsworth, Frank L. Littleton, and Shull, Farnsworth, & Sammis for defendants in error.\n\n\n[217 U.S. 157, 165]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case presents a question of jurisdiction arising from the levy in attachment proceedings on freight cars alleged to have been engaged, when attached, in interstate commerce. The case is here on certificate.\n Plaintiff in error, as executor of the estate of Frank E. Jandt, brought an action against the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago, & St. Louis Railway Company for causing the death of Jandt, a statute of Illinois giving such an action to the personal representative of a person whose death has been caused by 'wrongful act, neglect, or default.' The cause of action arose in Illinois. The action was brought, however, in the district court of Woodbury county, state of Iowa, and under the laws of the latter state writs of attachment and garnishment were issued and levied upon certain cars of the C. C. C. & St. L. Ry. Co. in the possession of the other defendants in error, referred to hereafter as the garnishee companies. Notice of garnishment was duly served on the garnishee companies, and each of them filed answers. Plaintiff in the action, and we will so refer to him, controverted by proper pleadings the answers, and demanded that evidence be taken on the issues joined.\n The original notice was served on the C. C. C. & St. L. Ry. Co., at its principal place of business in the state of Ohio; also noice of attachment and garnishment. It filed a petition for removal of the action to the circuit court of the United States for the northern district of Iowa, western division. Its peti- \n\n[217 U.S. 157, 166]\n\u00a0\n tion alleged that it was a corporation duly formed and organized under the laws of Indiana, and that the plaintiff was a citizen of Iowa. The petition was granted and the case duly removed to the circuit court of the United States. On the second of October, 1905, the C. C. C. & St. L. Ry. Co. filed a motion, which was denominated a motion to quash and set aside service, in which it stated that it appeared specially for the purpose of the motion only, 'to quash and set aside the service of attachment and garnishment attempted to be made in the cause by plaintiff against the defendant's property.' The motion was supported by an affidavit. The affidavit stated that the company was incorporated under the laws of Indiana and Ohio, and conducted and operated lines of railway in those states and in Illinois, with its principal place of business in Cincinnati, Ohio; that it was not incorporated in Iowa, and had no agent or agency of any character in that state; that it was a common carrier of freight and passengers, and in the carrying on of such business it owned and operated cars for the transportation of freight and merchandise through the various states; that in the conduct of such business it had arrangements, contracts, and agreements with various connecting railroad companies doing business as common carriers, including all of the railway companies attached and garnisheed in the action by plaintiff, under which those companies accepted from it, at points on its line of road, its cars loaded with goods and merchandise destined for various points on their respective lines, to be transported through the various states to destinations, constituting interstate shipments of commerce. It was stated that it was provided in the agreement that such connecting carriers should have the right to reload the cars received by them, and so use the same in returning them to the place where received, and that in all cases the cars of the company were to be returned to it in the usual and ordinary course of transit as soon as the nature and character of the business would permit. It was further stated that, under the laws \n\n[217 U.S. 157, 167]\n\u00a0\n of Congress, the company was bound to furnish cars so loaded, to be transported continuously from one state to another without being unloaded, and that, under the same laws, connecting carriers were bound to receive the same and transport them from one state to another. That, in pursuance of the agreements and laws of Congress, the cars attached were delivered by the C. C. C. & St. L. Ry. Co. to the other companies, and so received by them; that the cars were part of the company's rolling stock, and were necessary to enable it to preform its duties as a common carrier; that by reason of the commerce clause of the national Constitution and of the interstate commerce act the cars could not be levied upon; that the company had not been served personally or by publication, and had not appeared to the action or any writ issued in the cause. It was further stated that none of the garnishee companies was indebted to the company, and that any accounts which might be due from the garnisheed companies were only by reason of the contracts and agreements for the use of the cars, as heretofore stated, under which the permits for the use of the cars were arranged between the companies 'by wheelage or mileage of such cars, and were constantly and hourly changed from bills due one company to bills due the other company, which beills were satisfied and settled by such exchange of service and use of each other's cars. And such agreements and contracts are to be discharged, satisfied, and settled only in the city of Chicago and state of Illinois, where the same are made, and such accounts, or debts, if any, in favor of this defendant, have no situs in the state of Iowa.' The affidavit was supplemented by two others.\n Plaintiff filed a 'resistance' to the motion to quash and to the motion of the granishee companies, and alleged that a special appearance was 'unwarranted and unauthorized by law;' and that, as the purpose sought by the motion of the defendant company could only be had by a general appearance, the special appearance should be construed to be such, and subject the 'person of the defendant as well as the prop- \n\n[217 U.S. 157, 168]\n\u00a0\n erty actually attached, and the property and money of the defendant sought to be reached by garnishment proceedings, to the jurisdiction of the court.' The ground of this conclusion was stated, with some repetition, to be that the special appearance was not for the purpose of raising any question of lack of notice, or notice of defect or irregularity of process, but to contest the right to attach property by evidence outside the record of the case, and required the court to pass upon the merits of the attachment. Plaintiff denied that the property attached was engaged in interstate commerce or in the transportation of interstate commerce at the time they were attached, that they were not in use at the time they were attsached, but were standing empty upon the tracks of the railway companies in whose possession they were found, and denied the existence of the agreements and arrangements between the C. C. C. & St. L. Ry. Co. and the other companies in regard to the cars, and that no contractual rules existed between them; that the cars were not necessary, either to that company or to the other companies, to enable them to perform their duties as common carriers, and alleged that they were subject to attachment as other personal property. It was stated that the garnishee companies had no interest in the attached cars, and none of them had served notice of interest or ownership on the plaintiff nor on the sheriff.\n The answers of five of the garnishee companies denied indebtedness to the C. C. C. & St. L. Ry. Co., averred the existence of agreements as to the cars, substantially as set out by that defendant, also their duties as common carriers under the acts of Congress, and that the cars were in their possession in pursuance of the agreements with the defendant, and were to be returned empty or loaded, in the usual and customary course of business. The other companies also denied indebtedness to the C. C. C. & St. L. Ry. Co., and in effect set up the defense that the cars were in interstate commerce business.\n On the 22d of May. 1906, the court sustained the motion to quash the judgment and discharge the gar- \n\n[217 U.S. 157, 169]\n\u00a0\n nishees thereunder. On June 6 'the court' (we quote from the record) 'rendered further judgment, dismissing the said cause of action as to said principal defendant, on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction of the defendant or the attached property of the defendant, and taxed the costs in the case to the plaintiff.'\n The time for the allowance and filing the bill of exceptions was extended to October 28, 1906, and on the 28th of September it was allowed, the order reciting that the date 'being one of the regular days of the May, A. D., 1906, term of said court.' The bill of exceptions also recited that it was submitted to the court, with a prayer that it 'be signed and certified by the judge, and approved by him, and made a part of the record in said case, preparatory to the prosecution of a writ of error from the said circuit court of the United States to the Supreme Court of the United States.' It concludes as follows:\n'And the court, having examined said transcript of the record, papers, and proceedings, hereby certifies that the same contains the entire record in said cause, including the plaintiff's petition, the answers of the garnishees, the defendant's motion to quash and set aside service, and the plaintiff's resistance thereto, and all of the proceedings had thereunder in reference thereto, including the opinion, orders, and judgment of the court thereon, and the exceptions of the plaintiff thereto, and all of the record submitted to the court upon which the judgment\n\n'On consideration whereof, the court does allow the writ of error upon the plaintiff giving bond according to law in the sum of $500, which shall operate as a supersedeas bond.\n\n'And in this case, I, the undersigned, judge of the circuit court of the United States in and for the northern district of Iowa, western division, further hereby certify that in sustaining the motion to quash ihe attachment and discharging the garnishees, and in dismissing the action as to the principal defendant, and taxing the costs to the plaintiff, the sole ques- \n\n[217 U.S. 157, 170]\n\u00a0\n tion considered and determined by the court was that the court had no jurisdiction over the person of the defendant or of the property involved, and that the appearance of the principal defendant, as shown by the record, was a special, and not a general, appearance, and that the same did not subject said principal defendant and its property to the jurisdiction of the court.\n\n'This certificate is made conformable to the act of Congress of March 3, 1891, chapter 517, 26 Stat. at L. 826, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 488, and the opinion filed herein is made a part of the record, and will be certified and sent up as part of the proceeding, together with this certificate.'\n\n For the opinion of the court, see 146 Fed. 403\n A writ of error was sued out from the circuit court of appeals according to the admission of counsel, though there is nothing in the record to show it, which writ was dismissed. 84 C. C. A. 453, 156 Fed. 775.\n A motion is made to dismiss the writ of error, and in support of the motion it is urged (1) that the certificate as to jurisdiction was not granted during the term at which the judgment was rendered; (2) that the writ of error was not perfected in time, as required by law, in that the writ and certificate were allowed on the 28th of September, 1906, and were not prosecuted in this court until April, 1908; (3) that the certificate is not sufficient in law nor proper in form, in that it does not state any facts or propositions of law upon which the question of the court's lack of jurisdiction rested; (4) that the jurisdiction of the court as a Federal court was not put in issue; (5) that the case having been taken to the circuit court of appeals, and there decided, that the writ of error should be to that court, and not to the circuit court, the latter court, it is urged, having lost jurisdiction of the case; (6) there is no certificate of a jurisdictional question in the order allowing the writ of error.\n The first and second grounds in support of the motion to dismiss are based upon a misapprehension of the record. The \n\n[217 U.S. 157, 171]\n\u00a0\n term at which the judgment was rendered had not expired when the certificate of jurisdiction was made, and the writ of error was allowed on the 18th of March, 1908, not on September 28, 1906, as contended by defendants in error.\n The grounds of the motion based on the form or sufficiency of the certificate are not tenable. Even if we should admit, which we do not, that the certificate is not, as it is contended, in proper form, the record shows clearly that the only matter tried and decided in the circuit court was one of jurisdiction. This is sufficient. United States v. Larkin, \n208 \nU.S. 333, 339\n, 52 S. L. ed. 517, 520, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 417.\n The other grounds urged to support the motion to dismiss all depend upon the proposition whether the question of the jurisdiction of the circuit court as a Federal court was presented. If so, the writ of error from the circuit court of appeals is no bar to the present writ of error. Excelsior Wooden Pipe Co. v. Pacific Bridge Co. \n185 U.S. 282\n, 46 L. ed. 910, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 681; United States v. Larkin, supra. And if so, the way is clear to a decision of the question on the merits.\n As we have shown, the circuit court decided that it had no jurisdiction over either the person or the property of the principal defendant, the C. C. C. & St. L. Ry. Co. The first, nonjurisdiction over the person, depending, as the court considered, upon the second, nonjurisdiction over the property, as we understand the opinion. And this view of it the circuit court of appeals took.\n The latter court stated the questions to be: 'Was defendant's appearance to contest the validity of the attachments and garnishments a general one? Were the cars and credits of defendant subject to attachment and garnishment? In other words, did the trial court secure such dominion over person or property by appearance or process as authorized it to proceed to trial of the action and render a valid judgment upon the issues involved? The trial court answered them in the negative and dismissed the action for want of jurisdiction. In respect of the essential character of these questions, they are not distinguishable from \n\n[217 U.S. 157, 172]\n\u00a0\n one of the legality of the service of summons upon a defendant. They do not pertain to the merits of the case, and did not arise during the progress of a trial. They lay at the threshold, and upon an affirmative answer depended the power of the court to hear and decide the cause. In legal phraseology that power is termed 'jurisdiction.' It is none the less a jurisdictional matter in the case of attachment and garnishment of property of a nonresident because the power of the court to proceed to trial depends, in the absence of the defendant, upon its lawful seizure of his property. The question of jurisdiction was decided in favor of defendant, and the decision disposed of the case.' For these propositions the court cited Board of Trade v. Hammond Elevator Co. \n198 U.S. 428\n, 49 L. ed. 1114, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 740; United States v. Jahn, \n155 U.S. 109\n, 39 L. ed. 87, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 39; St. Louis Cotton Compress Co. v. American Cotton Co. 60 C. C. A. 80, 125 Fed. 196; and, as we have seen, dismissed the case on the ground that this court alone had the power to review the decision of the circuit court. We concur in the views of the circuit court of appeals, for which also may be cited Kendall v. American Automatic Loom Co. \n198 U.S. 477\n, 49 L. ed. 1133, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 768. The motion to dismiss is denied.\n The ruling of the circuit court dismissing the action is attacked upon the grounds (1) that the appearance of the C. C. C. & St. L. Ry. Co. was a general appearance, and, being so, the railway company submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the court, 'regardless of the seizure of the attached property;' (2) that the property was subject to attachment.\n\n 1. \nIt is not controverted that, if the property was subject to attachment, the procedure prescribed by the laws of Iowa was duly observed, and hence, it is contended, that the property having been seized under the jurisdiction of the court, under valid, regular process, the motion to quash the attachment was based on matters dehors the record, going to the jurisdiction of the court over the subject-matter of the action, and the court had jurisdiction over the person of the railway company. 'A special appearance,' it is contended, 'can never serve a \n\n[217 U.S. 157, 173]\n\u00a0\n dual or triple purpose, but is only allowed for the sole purpose of objecting to the jurisdiction of the court over the person of the defendant.'\n The ruling of the circuit court, we think, was broader than plaintiff conceives it to have been. It appears from the record that the C. C. C. & St. L. Ry. Co. was a corporation of Indiana and Ohio, and that certain of its freight cars were attached in Iowa in the hands of the garnishee companies, and that there were certain credits due to it from some of the latter companies, on account of interstate commerce freight. In other words, it fairly appears upon the face of the complaint in the action and the attachment papers that the cars had been sent into the state in the transportation of interstate commerce. It is true, it was also contended, that an issue was presented by the affidavits upon the motion to quash as to what contractual arrangements existed between the company and the other companies as to the right of the latter companies to reload the cars and so return them, but there was no dispute that it was their duty to receive them. Besides, the bill of exceptions contains the following: 'No evidence is submitted by the plaintiff in opposition to the motion of defendant to quash the attachment, or in support of its pleading controverting the answer of the several garnishees, and the matters are submitted upon the record, including such motion and admission of the pleadings.'\n The question, therefore, was submitted to the court, whether the cars, under the circumstances, were engaged in interstate commerce when they were attached; and the court considered it to be immaterial that the cars had not started on a return trip, saying that 'the cars of defendant, when brought into the state of Iowa to complete an interstate shipment of property, were being used in interstate commerce, and were being so used while waiting, at least a reasonable time, to be loaded for the return trip.'\n The court further decided that debts, if any, which were due from the garnishee companies to the C. C. C. & St. L. Ry. Co. for its share of the price of carriage were 'as much a part of \n\n[217 U.S. 157, 174]\n\u00a0\n interstate commerce, as defined by the Supreme Court, as the actual carriage of their property.'\n\n 2. \nThe next contention of plaintiff is that the appearance of the C. C. C. & St. L. Ry. Co. was a general appearance, and submitted its person to the jurisdiction of the court. In other words, it is contended that the person over whom personal jurisdiction has not been obtained cannot appear specially to set aside the attachment of his property, which we must assume, in order to completely exhibit the contention, is valid. We cannot concur in the contention. It is supported, it is true by some cases, but it is opposed by more. Drake, Attachm.  112, and cases cited. The stronger reasoning, we think, too, is against the contention. A court, without personal service, can acquire no jurisdiction over the person, and when it attempts to assert jurisdiction over property, it should be open to the defendant to specially appear to contest its control over such property; in other words, to contest the ground of its jurisdiction. Harkness v. Hyde, \n98 U.S. 476\n, 25 L. ed. 237; Southern P. Co. v. Denton, \n146 U.S. 206\n, 36 L. ed. 945, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 44; Goldey v. Morning News, \n156 \nU.S. 518, 523\n, 39 S. L. ed. 517, 519, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 559; Wabash Western R. Co. v. Brow, \n164 \nU.S. 271, 278\n, 41 S. L. ed. 431, 434, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 126.\n The appearance of the C. C. C. & St. L. Ry. Co. was not to object to the subject-matter of the action, as it is contended by plaintiff. The subject-matter of the action is a demand for damages, which can only be prosecuted to efficient judgment and be satisfied out of the property attached. Clark v. Wells, \n203 U.S. 164\n, 51 L. ed. 138, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 43. The jurisdiction of the court, therefore, depended upon the attachment, and the appearance to set that aside was an appearance to object to the jurisdiction. In other words, the defendant was only in court through its property, and it appeared specially to show that it was improperly in court.\n These contentions being disposed of, we are brought to the question whether the cars were 'immune from judicial process' because engaged in interstate commerce. The question has come up in several of the state courts and different views have been taken. The question has been answered in the \n\n[217 U.S. 157, 175]\n\u00a0\n affirmative in Michigan C. R. Co. v. Chicago & M. L. S. R. Co. 1 Ill. App. 399; Connery v. Quincy, O. & K. C. R. Co. 92 Minn. 20, 64 L.R.A. 624, 104 Am. St. Rep. 659, 99 N. W. 365, 2 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 347; Shore v. Baltimore & O. R. Co. 76 S. C. 472, 57 S. E. 526, 11 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 909; Seibels v. Northern C. R. Co. 80 S. C. 133, 16 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1026, 61 S. E. 435; Chicago & N. W. R. Co. v. Forest County, 195 Wis. 80, 70 N. W. 77; Wall v. Norfolk & W. R. Co. 52 W. Va. 485, 64 L.R.A. 501, 94 Am. St. Rep. 948, 44 S. E. 294. A negative answer has been pronounced in the following cases: De Rochemont v. New York C. & H. R. R. Co. 75 N. H. 158, -- L.R.A.( N.S.) --, 71 Atl. 868; Southern Flour & Grain Co. v. Northern P. R. Co. 127 Ga. 626, 9 L.R.A.(N.S.) 853, 119 Am. St. Rep. 356, 56 S. E. 742, 9 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 437; Southern R. Co. v. Brown, 131 Ga. 245, 62 S. E. 177; Cavanaugh v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. 75 N. H. 243, 72 Atl. 694. See also Humphreys v. Hopkins, 81 Cal. 551, 6 L.R.A. 792, 15 Am. St. Rep. 76, 22 Pac. 892. Cavanaugh v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. supra, may be assigned to the list of cases giving a negative answer. In that case there was an attachment of credits or funds representing the sending carrier's part of transportation charges on interstate freight. The attachment was sustained. In Wall v. Norfolk & W. R. Co. the levy was upon cars which were unloading. In the case in 1 Ill. App. the condition or situation of the cars does not clearly appear. In the other cases, the cars were not in use when attached. In most of the cases there is a full and able discussion of the principles involved. In Humphreys v. Hopkins it was taken for granted that the cars were subject to process, the case going off on another point.\n The answer to the question is, therefore, certainly not obvious, and counsel, realizing it, have pressed many considerations on our attention. Their arguments result in certain contentions. The plaintiff's contention is, that even though the cars in question had been or were to be used in interstate commerce, their attachment was not a regulation of such commerce, and that they were as legally subject to attachment as the property of any other nonresident. The contention of the defendants is an exact antithesis of that of plaintiff. It is that the state laws cannot be permitted to impede or impair interstate traffic or the usefulness of the facilities for such traffic. And, further, that the provisions of the interstate commerce act, providing for the establishment of through \n\n[217 U.S. 157, 176]\n\u00a0\n routes, and  5258 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3564), providing for the connection of railroads, exempt the cars from attachment.\n In our discussion we may address ourselves to the contention of defendants. They do not content that the laws of the state have the purpose to interfere with the interstate commerce, or are directly contrary terstate commerce, or are directly contrary however, that 'to permit the instrumentalities used in the interchange of traffic by railway common carriers to be seized on process from various state courts does directly burden and impede interstate traffic within the inhibition of the acts of Congress.' In other words, that the acts of Congress constitute a declaration of exemption of railroad property from attachment, and, of course, from execution as well, by reason of their provisions for continuity of transportation.\n This can only result if there is incompatibility between the obligations a railroad may have to its creditors and he obligations which it may have to the public, either from the nature of its service or under the acts of Congress. Obligations it surely will have to creditors, inevitable even in providing equipment for its duties,-inevitable in its performance of them. It would seem, therefore, that the contentions of the defendants are but deductions from the broader proposition that all of the property of the railroad company is put apart in a kind of civil sancturay. And one case (Wall v. Norfolk & W. R. Co. supra) seems to give this extent to the exemption. Indeed, the decision in the case at bar seems to do so, the court holding, as we have seen, that the C. C. C. & St. L. Ry. Co.'s share of the compensation for carriage was as much a part of interstate commerce as the actual carriage of property. A still broader proposition under the contention might be urged. If the property have such character that all obligations of the company must yield to the public use or to the obligations imposed by Congress, the railroad company itself, it might be contended, cannot burden its property, and that its property is taken from it as an asset of credit, the means, it may be, of performing the very duties enjoined upon it; and the anomaly \n\n[217 U.S. 157, 177]\n\u00a0\n will be presented of the duties it is to perform becoming an obstacle to acquiring the means of performing them. Indeed, the further consequence might be said to follow that the rolling stock of a railroad is exempt from taxation; at least, so far as taxation might be attempted to be enforced against the rolling stock. We realize that a proposition may be generally applicable and yet involve embarrassment when pushed to a logical extreme. If this be so of the contentions of defendant, it may be so of the counter contentions which would subject the cars of a railroad company to attachment process, however engaged or wherever situate.\n It is very certain that when Congress enacted the interstate commerce law it did not intend to abrogate the attachment laws of the states. It is very certain that there is no conscious purpose in the laws of the states to regulate, directly or indirectly, interstate commerce. We may put out of the case, therefore, as an element, an attempt of the state to exercise control over interstate commerce in excess of its power. Indeed, the questions in this case might arise upon process issued out of the circuit court of the United States under the Federal statutes. For, by  915 and 916 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 684), remedies 'by attachment or other process,' before judgment, and 'by execution or otherwise,' after judgment, are given litigants in common-law causes in the circuit and district courts of the United States.\n The questions in the case, therefore, depend for their solution upon the interpretation of Federal laws. Are the laws of the states for the enforcement of debts (laws which we need not stop to vindicate as necessary foundations of credit, and because they give support to commerce, state and interstate) and the Federal laws which permit or enjoin continuity of transportation, so far incompatible that the provisions of the latter must be construed as displacing the former? We do not think so. Section 5258 of the Revised Statutes is permissive, not imperative. It removed the 'trammels interposed by state enactments or by existing laws of Congress' to the \n\n[217 U.S. 157, 178]\n\u00a0\n powers of railroad companies to make continuous lines of transportation. Dubuque & S. C. R. Co. v. Richmond, 19 Wall. 584, 589, 22 L. ed. 173, 176. The interstate commerce act, however, has a different character. It restricts the powers of the railroads. It regulates interstate railroads and makes it unlawful for them, by any 'means or devices,' to prevent 'the carriage of frieght from being continuous from the place of shipment to the place of destination.' \n The interstate commerce law, therefore, is directed against the acts of railroad companies which may prevent continuity of transportation. Section 5258 of the Revised Statutes was directed against the trammels of state enactments then existing or which might be attempted. In neither can there be discerned a purpose to relieve the railroads from any obligations to their creditors, or take from their creditors any remedial process provided by the laws of the state, and, as we have seen, provided by Federal law as well. May it be said that such result follows from the use of property in the public service? A number of cases may be cited against such contention. We have already pointed out what might be contended as its possible if not probable consequences. In a recent case in this court, a lien imposed under the law of Michigan upon a vessel to be used in domestic and foreign trade was sustained. To the contention that the enforcement of the lien while the vessel was engaged in interstate commerce was unlawful and\n Sec. 7. That it shall be unlawful for any common carrier subject to the provisions of this act to enter into any combination, contract, or agreement, expressed or implied, to prevent, by change of time schedule, carriage in different cars, or by other means or devices, the carriage of freights from being continuous from the place of shipment to the place of destination; and no break of bulk, stoppage, or interruption made by such common carrier shall prevent the carriage of freights from being, and being treated as, one continuous carriage from the place of shipment to the place of destination, unless such break, stoppage, or interruption was made in good faith, for some necessary purpose, and without any intent to avoid or unnecessarily interrupt such continuous carriage, or to evade any of the provisions of this act. [24 Stat at. L. 382, chap. 104, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3159.] \n\n[217 U.S. 157, 179]\n\u00a0\n void, in view of the exclusive control of Congress over the subject, we answered: 'But it must be remembered that concerning contracts not maritime in their nature, the state has authority to make laws and enforce liens, and it is no valid objection that the enforcement of such laws may prevent or obstruct the prosecution of a voyage of an interstate character. The laws of the states enforcing attachment and execution in cases cognizable in state courts have been sustained and upheld. Johnson v. Chicago & P. Elevator Co. \n119 U.S. 388\n-398, 30 L. ed. 447-450, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 254. The state may pass laws enforcing the rights of its citizens which affect interstate commerce, but fall short of regulating such commerce in the sense in which the Constitution gives exclusive jurisdiction to Congress. Sherlock v. Alling, \n93 \nU.S. 99, 103\n, 23 S. L. ed. 819; Kidd v. Pearson, \n128 \nU.S. 1, 23\n, 32 S. L. ed. 346, 351, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 232, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 6; Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Hughes, \n191 U.S. 477\n, 48 L. ed. 268, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 132.' The Winnebago (Iroquois Transp. Co. v. De Laney Forge & Iron Co.) \n205 \nU.S. 354, 362\n, 51 S. L. ed. 836, 840, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 509.\n The interference with interstate commerce by the enforcement of the attachment laws of a state must not be exaggerated. It can only be occasional and temporary. The obligations of a railroad company are tolerably certain, and provisions for them can be easily made. Their sudden assertion can be almost instantly met; at any rate, after short delay, and without much, if any, embarrassment to the continuity of transportation. However, the pending case does not call for a very comprehensive decision on the subject. We only decide that the cars situated as this record tends to show that they were when attached, and the amounts due from the garnishee companies to the C. C. C. & St. L. Ry. Co., were not exempt from process under the state laws, and that the court had, therefore, jurisdiction of them, and through them of the C. C. C. & St. L. Ry. Co.\n Judgment reversed and the cause remanded with directions to proceed in accordance with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice Holmes took no part in the decision. \n\n\n\n","36":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDOZIER v. STATE OF ALABAMA(1910)\nNo. 105\nArgued: Decided: May 31, 1910\n\n\n\n Mr. A. D. Gash for plaintiff in error. \n\n[218 U.S. 124, 125]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Alexander M. Garber\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 124, 126]\n\u00a0\n and Thomas W. Martin for defendant in error.\n\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff in error was convicted and sentenced to a fine on a complaint for breach of an Alabama statute of \n\n[218 U.S. 124, 127]\n\u00a0\n March 7, 1907. By  17 of that act a license tax was imposed on persons who did not have a permanent place of business in the state, and also keep picture frames as a part of their stock in trade, if they solicited orders for the enlargement of photographs or pictures of any character, or for picture frames, whether they made charge for such frames or not, or if they sold or disposed of picture frames. The Chicago Crayon Company, having its only place of business in Chicago, and being engaged in the business of making and enlarging portraits from photographs, and in the manufacturing of picture frames, solicited orders in Alabama without paying the license tax. These orders were given in writing for a portrait of the size and kind wanted, specified the price, cash on delivery, and continued: 'I understand that my portrait is to be delivered in an appropriate frame, which this contract entitles me to accept at factory price.' The agent of the company gave back a written acceptance, repeating the other terms of the bargain, and adding: 'All portraits are delivered in appropriate frames, which this contract entitled the purchaser to accept at factory prices,' with particulars purporting to show that these prices were from one third to one half the retail or usual ones. The plaintiff in error, who also had no permanent place of business in Alabama and had paid no license tax, was an agent of the company, who delivered pictures and frames, and collected for them, in pursuance of the agreed plan. The pictures and frames were sent to the agent, and remained the property of the company until paid for and delivered. On these facts the supreme court of Alabama, while admitting that the dealings concerning the pictures were commerce among the states, sustined the conviction, on the ground that the sale of the frames was a wholly local matter. 154 Ala. 83, 129 Am. St. Rep. 51, 46 So. 9.\n No doubt it is true that the customer was not bound to take the frame unless he saw fit, and that the sale of it \n\n[218 U.S. 124, 128]\n\u00a0\n took place wholly within the state of Alabama, if a sale was made. But, as was hinted in Rearick v. Pennsylvania, \n203 \nU.S. 507, 512\n, 51 S. L. ed. 295, 297, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 159, what is commerce among the states is a question depending upon broader considerations than the existence of a technically binding contract, or the time and place where the title passed. It was agreed that the frame should be offered along with the picture. The offer was a part of the interstate bargain, and as it was agreed that the frame should be offered 'at factory prices,' and the company and factory were in Chicago, obviously it was contemplated, if not agreed, that the frame should come on with the picture. In fact, the frames were sent on with the pictures from Chicago, and were offered when the pictures were tendered, as part of a transaction commercially continuous, and one at prices generically fixed by the contract for the pictures, and by that contract represented to be less than retail or usual prices, in consideration, it is implied, of the purchase already agreed to be made. We are of opinion that the sale of the frames cannot be so separated from the rest of the dealing between the Chicago company and the Alabama purchaser as to sustain the license tax upon it. Under the decisions, the statute, as applied to this case, is a regulation of commerce among the states, and void under the Constitution of the United States. Art. 1,  8. Robbins v.

STERNBERGH(1910)\nNo. 29\nArgued: November 2, 1910Decided: November 14, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. Edwin C. Brandenburg, Clarence A. Brandenburg, F. Walter Brandenburg, Andrew A. Leiser, and Thomas K. Leidy for appellant.\n Messrs. Cyrus G. Derr and John G. Johnson for appellee. \n\n[218 U.S. 299, 300]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case arose on a controversy as to the right of the appellee, Sternbergh, to vote on the selection of a trustee in bankruptcy. At the first meeting of the creditors, Sternbergh offered for allowance a proof of claim for $14,438.86, which was objected to on the ground that Sternbergh was indebted to the bankrupt company for unpaid stock. Sternbergh announced that he intended to use this claim for voting purposes. After a hearing, the referee refused to allow the claim for use in the election, and certified the facts, as Sternbergh's vote, if allowed, would have elected a different trustee. The district judge stated the question to be whether the referee was right in rejecting the claimant's offer to vote, and that it did not involve the extent but only the fact of Sternbergh's liability, and he affirmed the action of the referee. Thereupon Sternbergh filed a petition to the circuit court of appeals, seeking a revision of the decree in matter of law under  24b of the bankruptcy law. That court, remarking that the facts were not in dispute, proceeded to discuss their significance and effect, and reversed the decree, but allowed the selection of trustee to stand, as no allegation was made against him. The bankrupt, through the trustee, appealed to this court, obtaining a certificate from a justice of this court under  25 b, 2.\n The first question to be answered is whether this is a case in which a party is entitled to take an appeal to this court under  25. And clearly it is not. The right of appeal from a decision of a circuit court of appeals allowing or rejecting a claim is given by 25b only where the decision is final, whether there is a certificate under  25 b, 2, or not. The circuit court of appeals may render a final decision when an appeal is taken to it under 25a from a judgment allowing or rejecting a claim of $ 500 or over. But this case did not and could not have \n\n[218 U.S. 299, 301]\n\u00a0\n come to in that way, for there was no judgment allowing or rejecting the claim. The referee's order was, 'The within claim is disallowed for the present, especially as to voting, without prejudice to the claimant's right to present the claim hereafter.' That is the order that was reviewed by the district court, and that was affirmed by it. Therefore Sternbergh's counsel, rightly apprehending that they could not appeal to the circuit court of appeals, brought their petition for revision under  24b, alleging that the district judge erred in matter of law in confirming the order of the referee, refusing to allow the claim of Sternbergh to be filed for voting upon the election of trustee. This is all that was brought before the circuit court of appeals, and all that it had authority to decide. Its decision, although directing the district court to allow the petitioner to prove his claim, was not a final decision upon that point, and did not come to it in such a way that it could be. It simply reversed the provisional order of the referee, and made a provisional, though seemingly useless, order the other way.\n No appeal to this court lies from a decision in the exercise of supervisory jurisdiction. Holden v. Stratton, \n191 U.S. 115\n, 48 L. ed. 116, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 45. But it is said that the circuit court of appeals treated this case as an appeal; that it did not follow the findings of the referee and the court below, as it was bound to do on a revisory proceeding; that it filed a statement of the facts found and of its conclusion of law, as required in an appeal by general orders 36, 3, and that a justice of this court allowed an appeal from its decision, which, as we have said, does not lie from an order or decree under  24b. It is argued that an appeal to the circuit court of appeals may be treated as a petition for revision (Holden v. Stratton, \n191 \nU.S. 115, 119\n, 48 S. L. ed. 115, 118, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 45), and that, conversely, a petition for revision may be turned into an appeal, or, at least, treated as one for the purpose of an appeal to this court, if only to establish that the circuit \n\n[218 U.S. 299, 302]\n\u00a0\n court of appeals exceeded its jurisdiction. There are two answers to this contention. In the first place, the converse proposition does not hold. An appeal opens both fact and law, and therefore might be regarded as intended to raise questions of law in any way that might be deemed proper. But a petition for revision opens only questions of law, and when the foundation of its jurisdiction is thus narrowed, the action of the court cannot enlarge it so as to deal with the facts. In the next place, in this case the circuit court of appeals made no such attempt. It treated the facts as undisputed, and differed from the court below only in its understanding of their significance and legal import. It filed no finding of facts at or before the time of entering its decree, as required by the general orders, but did so only two months after the decree had been entered, and a month after an appeal had been taken and allowed by a justice of this court, upon a petition of the appellant.\n We have considered the suggestion that, if the appeal should be dismissed, a certiorari should be granted, but we are of opinion that no ground is shown for the issue of the writ.\n Appeal dismissed. \n\n\n\n","38":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEAGLE MIN & IMP CO. v. HAMILTON(1910)\nNo. 51\nArgued: Decided: November 28, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. Samuel Parker, George W. Prichard, and Archibald G. Graham for appellant.\n Mr. James G. Fitch for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an appeal from a decree of the supreme court of the territory of New Mexico in two suits which were consolidated. The first suit was brought in August, 1903, \n\n[218 U.S. 513, 514]\n\u00a0\n in a district court of the territory, by the appellant, Eagle Mining & Improvement Company, against the appellees, the widow and heirs of Humphrey B. Hamilton, deceased, to have it adjudged that the decedent held a certain undivided interest in mining property in trust for the appellant, and to compel conveyance. In November, 1904, the appellees, one of whom was the administrator of the decedent's estate, brought suit against the appellant, alleging that Hamilton had rendered services as its attorney in connection with the mining property and otherwise, and that the legal title had been taken by him pursuant to an agreement, by which it was to be held as security for the appellant's indebtedness to him; the appellees prayed for foreclosure and recovery of the amount found to be due. The suits were consolidated and a referee was appointed to take testimony. Hearing was had, and a decree was entered in favor of appellees, which set forth separately findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n The court found that Hamilton had acquired the legal title to the undivided one-half interest in question under an agreement with the appellant, by which he was to negotiate for the purchase in its behalf, and was to surrender a certain equitable claim of lien upon another interest in the property; that in consideration of this surrender and of his services in acquiring the one-half interest, Hamilton was to receive the difference between an agreed sum and the amounts to be advanced by the appellant to effect the purchase; that for the payment of this difference- found to amount to $9,500-Hamilton was to hold the legal title as security; and that the agreement to this effect was evidenced by writings signed by Hamilton 'and delivered to, accepted and acquiesced in by, the said company.'\n As a conclusion of law, the court found that the heirs of Hamilton were entitled to hold the legal title to the \n\n[218 U.S. 513, 515]\n\u00a0\n undivided interest until the payment of $9,500, with interest and costs of suit, had been made to the administrator of Hamilton's estate; that upon such payment they should convey to the appellant, and that in default of payment the undivided interest should be sold to satisfy the indebtedness.\n It was further found that Hamilton had been retained by the appellant as its attorney, and at its request had rendered legal services from the date of its organization until his death without express agreement as to the amount to be paid therefor; that these services were reasonably worth $ 9,519.99, upon which, after deducting payments, there was due $8,419.99. And, as a conclusion of law, the court held that the administrator was entitled to judgment for the last-mentioned sum.\n It was decreed accordingly, and from this decree appeal was taken to the supreme court of the territory, where it was affirmed. [14 N. M. 271, 91 Pac. 718.]\n The record before us contains the testimony taken before the referee, and the letters and documents which, in connection with the testimony, he submitted to the court in his report; and the argument here is directed largely to the effect of the evidence and to the findings of the court below as to matters of fact.\n But we are not at liberty to review these findings of fact. We cannot go behind the findings to ascertain whether they are justified by the evidence. Under the act of April 7, 1874, chapter 80 (18 Stat. at L. 27), the jurisdiction of this court, upon this appeal, is limited to the inquiry whether the findings of fact made by the court below support its judgment, and to a review of exceptions which have been duly taken to rulings upon the admission or rejection of evidence.

The findings of the district court, having been adopted and affirmed by the supreme court of the territory, serve the purpose of the statement of facts required by the statute. Stringfellow v. Cain; Neslin v. Wells, F. & Co.; and Haws v. Victoria Copper Min. Co.,-supra.\n Nor are there any rulings upon questions of evidence which are properly before us for review, for no exceptions to such rulings appear in the record. When the evidence was taken before the referee appointed by the district court, various objections were made and were noted upon the record; but the referee did not attempt to pass upon the objections, and reported to the court the entire proceedings, including the testimony and documents to which objection had been made. What, if any, rulings were made by the court upon these objections, is not shown. In the progress of the cause a memorandum of opinion was filed by the judge sitting in the district court, in which the admissibility of certain testimony, relied upon by the appellant, was said to be doubtful; but it does not appear that the testimony was excluded, and, as we have said, there are no exceptions which bring up any question for review with respect to the admission or rejection of evidence.\n As the facts found by the court unquestionably support the judgment, it is Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","39":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEARLING v. EMIGH(1910)\nNo. 144\nArgued: Decided: May 31, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. Rufus S. Simmons, Frank J. R. Mitchell, and S. C. Irving for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. J. C. Thompson and E. F. Kileen for defendants in error. \n\n[218 U.S. 27, 28]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n To reverse a judgment of the supreme court of Wisconsin (134 Wis. 565 , -- L.R.A.(N.S.) --, 115 N. W. 128), affirming a judgment of the circuit court of Green Lake county, this writ of error is prosecuted.\n The Berlin National Bank, doing business in the city of Berlin, Green Lake county, Wisconsin, being insolvent, its doors were closed by the Comptroller of the Currency on November 17, 1904. P. R. Earling was subsequently appointed and qualified as receiver. On November 27, 1906, John Emigh and O. L. Atkins, as assignees of a large number of persons, commenced this action in the state court against the receiver and the bank. It was, in substance, averred that large quantities of milk had been furnished by the assignors of the plaintiffs to a creamery known as the Jenne Creamery Company, under agreements that all the milk supplied should be converted into butter, the butter sold, and the proceeds, less a sum agreed upon as a compensation for for the services rendered, should be divided pro rata among those furnishing the milk. It was alleged that the creamery, during the period covered by the claim, was, in fact, owned by and had been operated by the bank, and that when the doors of the bank were closed, there were outstanding unpaid checks for about $400, for collections made for account of those who had supplied milk between April and September, 1904, and that a large amount had been collected and not paid over for the proceeds of butter made from milk furnished during October and the first half of November, 1904. The prayer was that plaintiffs recover from the receiver such portion of the collections as had come into the hands of the receiver, and as to the proceeds, which had been diverted by the bank, that plaintiffs be recognized as general creditors, entitled to participate pro rata in the \n\n[218 U.S. 27, 29]\n\u00a0\n distribution of the assets of the bank. The defendants separately answered, and, except as to the allegations regarding the incorporation of the bank, its insolvency, and the appointment of a receiver, took issue upon the averments of the complaint.\n The cause was tried by the court. The facts, as found, are thus summarized:\n For some time prior to October 1, 1902, the Jenne Creamery Company, a Wisconsin corporation, having its principal place of business in the city of Berlin, carried on the business of making butter and other dairy products with milk furnished by patrons in Green Lake and other counties. The corporation for these purposes, besides operating its plant at Berlin, leased various other creamery plants in the vicinity. At one time the business was carried on by a firm known as D. J. Jenne & Company, and after the organization of the Jenne Creamery Company the creamery business was solely carried on by that corporation, the members of the firm of Jenne & Company, however, owning all the stock of the creamery company. The milk which the company separated was furnished by numerous producers under agreements by which, for a stated compensation, the creamery company agreed to make all the milk it received into butter, to sell the same, collect the proceeds, and to divide them pro rata among the milk owners, less the compensation agreed upon. The business did not prosper. On October 1, 1902, there were outstanding unpaid checks of the company, drawn on the unpaid checks of the company, drawn on the Berlin bank in favor of milk producers, to the extent of about $8,000, there being no funds on hand to the credit of the creamery company in the bank, available to pay the checks. On the same date one of the firm of D. J. Jenne & Company owed the bank $2,200, which was unsecured, and besides was indebted to other creditors for at least $2,600. The firm of D. J. Jenne & Company also owed the bank $5,000. Evidently in contemplation \n\n[218 U.S. 27, 30]\n\u00a0\n of securing the payment of these various debts, and to prevent the loss which would be occasioned by the bankruptcy of the creamery company, and upon the expectation that the situation might be relieved by carrying on the business under a new management, an arrangement was made between the Jennes and the Berlin bank. By this arrangement the entire stock of the creamery was assigned to Brown, the cashier of the bank, and two other officers of the bank, who, while thus becoming in form the owners of the stock, really held it for account of the bank. The property of the partnership of Jenne & Company and the property of the individual members of the firm was transferred to Brown. In order to bring about these transfers the bank agreed to pay the outstanding checks drawn against it by the creamery company in favor of the milk producers. Under the arrangement, the business continued to be carried on in the name of the Jenne Creamery company, although from the facts which we have just stated, it is apparent, as said by the supreme court of Wisconsin, 'that the use of Brown's name was only formal, and that the continuance in form of the corporation was only for convenience of bookkeeping and dealing with the patrons.' Brown acted as manager of the business apparently for the creamery company, signing and indorsing checks in the name of that corporation as such manager, etc.\n The producers of the milk were not parties to the transfer made by the Jennes to the bank. No formal notification to them was given of the fact that the bank in effect owned the stock of the corporation and was virtually carrying on the business, no new contracts were made with them in the name of the bank as the owner of the creamery, but, so far as they were concerned, the affairs of the creamery company were, in form, conducted as they had been previously carried on, the producers continuing without interruption to furnish their milk as they \n\n[218 U.S. 27, 31]\n\u00a0\n had been in the habit of doing under the agreements previously made.\n The operation of the business after the transfer was not profitable. The bank realized a few thousand dollars from the sale of the individual property of Jenne, but when the bank ceased to do business, in November, 1904, the account of the creamery company was apparently exhausted, and the bank had not recouped itself for the payments made of the $8,000 of checks outstanding in October, 1902. Besides, when the bank failed there were outstanding checks for $406.97, issued between April and October, 1904, and no settlement had been made with those who had supplied milk during the month of October and part of November, 1904, prior to the suspension of the bank. Referring to the proceeds of the butter made from the milk delivered by the patrons of the creamery during Cotober and November, 1904, the trial court, as stated by the supreme court of Wisconsin, found 'that bank drafts had been received into the bank for such butter. Such drafts ran to the jenne Creamery Company, and were indorsed by Brown, the cashier, and mingled with other moneys of the bank. The total amount was $2,520.46. It was found by the court, upon careful analysis of the accounts, that at all times after the receipt of any of said drafts the bank had on hand an amount of money and cash items exceeding said total, and such an amount was turned over to the receiver upon his taking possession. It also traced a considerable share of said drafts into the hands of the bank's correspondents at other cities, by which they had been collected and credited to the bank, and in each case it was found that there remained a credit account with that correspondent larger than the amount of such drafts sent to and collected by it, which credit balance was turned over to the receiver after his appointment.'\n Upon the facts by it found, the trial court adjudged that \n\n[218 U.S. 27, 32]\n\u00a0\n $2,520.46 should be paid to the plaintiffs out of the funds in the hands of the receiver, and that as to the sum of the outstanding checks given for the proceeds of butter sold prior to October, 1904, the plaintiffs were entitled to participate pro rata with the other general creditors in the distribution of the assets of the bank. As already stated, the supreme court of Wisconsin affirmed the judgment.\n The Federal question relied on is in substance that the Berlin bank, as a national bank, had no power to operate a creamery, and could not, therefore, lawfully incur liability on account of such operation, and hence the judgment of the state court is repugnant to the following sections of the Revised Statutes: 5133 and 5136 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3454, 3455), which prohibit a national banking association from doing other than a banking business; 5134 and 5190 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3454, 3486), which prohibit such an association from transacting the businesss of a bank in any other place than where its banking house is located and that specified in its organization certificate; 5145, which requires the affairs of such association to be managed by not less than five directors; and 5236 and 5242 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3508, 3517), which require ratable dividends and prohibit all transfers with a view to preference. It is true that there are other assignments of alleged error, but we put them at once out of view, as they in substance but assert that the court below erred in affirming the judgment of the trial court because certain of the facts found were not sustained by the evidence,-contentions which are not open to our inquiry, as it is elementary that, on error to a state court of last resort in a case of this character, the findings of fact of the state court are binding on us.\n The trial court found as a fact, that after the transfer of the creamery property in October, 1902, some of the patrons were informed that the officers and directors of the bank were individually interested in the creamery, but that they were acting for the bank was not made \n\n[218 U.S. 27, 33]\n\u00a0\n known, and it was also represented to such patrons that the creamery was in better condition than ever before, and such was generally believed by the patrons to be a true statement of the condition of affairs until after the failure of the defendant bank. The supreme court, however, evidently did not consider these circumstances material. It held that whatever the form of the transaction, the Berlin bank acquired the creamery property from the Jenne Creamery Company in October, 1902; that it operated the same thereafter until the bank ceased doing business; that it 'took the milk furnished by the patrons, made the same into butter, and sold it and collected the proceeds;' and that, by virtue of the agreements under which the milk was furnished, the proceeds of the sale of butter 'belonged to the patrons, and was received by the bank for them, and under a duty to pay it to them.' It also decided that when the bank failed on demand to pay over the collections for the butter sold prior to October, 1904, represented by outstanding checks, an indebtedness to the owners of the money arose. From the facts as found by the trial court, the supreme court concluded that the receiver had received, in actual money, or in credits with correspondents, the $2,520.46 belonging to the patrons collected for the butter made from the milk supplied in October and November, 1904, and that the receiver did not receive such sum as moneys of the bank upon any trust to distribute to the creditors of the bank but held it as trustee for the owners. In declining to consider whether, as contended, it was beyond the power of the bank to engage in the creamery business, the court said:\n'No authority has been cited, and we think none can be, to deny the power of a banking corporation, or any other corporation, to disgorge property of another which it had got into its possession by any means whatever under a duty to disgorge. It may have had no legal \n\n[218 U.S. 27, 34]\n\u00a0\n power to take the steps by which the money of these plaintiffs' assignors came to its hands; but having taken such steps and obtained their money, no such absurdity exists as a legal obstacle to its surrendering it. It would be a reproach to the law to hold any such doctrine of inequity. Beloit v. Heineman, 128 Wis. 398, 401, 107 N. W. 334.'\n\n As we are bound by the findings of fact made below, and as the construction which the court gave to the contracts under which the milk was furnished is also binding, since such construction presents no question of a Federal nature, it follows that all the contentions relied upon to procure a reversal of the judgment must rest upon the assumption that, although the milk was received under contracts of bailment, and the proceeds arising were the property of the milk producers, and were held by the bank for them, nevertheless the judgment was wrong, because the bank, under the national banking law, exceeded its powers when it virtually acquired the stock of the creamery and operated the same through its officers. But when the contentions thus come to be considered in their ultimate aspect, their unsoundness is demonstrated by the decision rendered at this term in Citizen's Cent. Nat. Bank v. Appleton, \n216 U.S. 196\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 364. We say this, even conceding, for the sake of the argument the ultra vires nature of the transaction as contended for. Although it would suffice to refer to that case as decisive here, in view of the importance of the subject, we briefly advert to the facts of the case to make apparent how absolutely conclusive the ruling there made is upon the contention here presented. One Samuel owed to the Central National Bank $10,000. Evidently the bank was not only unwilling to lend Samuel more money, but called upon him to pay off his existing indebtedness. Under these circumstances it was arranged that if Samuel could borrow $12,000 from the Cooper \n\n[218 U.S. 27, 35]\n\u00a0\n Exchange Bank, and would use $10,000 of the amount to pay his debt to the Contral National Bank, that bank would guarantee the repayment of the loan if made by the Cooper Exchange Bank, thus giving Samuel some further accommodation, and at the same time placing the Central National Bank in funds to the extent of its outstanding loan to Samuel. The loan upon the guaranty was made. Upon the bankruptcy of Samuel and the failure to pay the loan made by the Cooper Exchange Bank, the latter bank sued the Central National Bank to recover under the guaranty. In the state courts, while ultimately the ultra vires nature of the guaranty was not denied, recovery was allowed to the extent of the $10,000, the amount actually received by of the Cooper Exchange Bank. This court, Sup. Ct. Rep. 498; Central Transp. Co. without in any respect questioning that the state court was correct in holding that the contract of guaranty was ultra vires of the national bank act, nevertheless affirmed the judgment below. Reviewing and commenting upon the rulings in Logan County Nat. Bank v. Townsend, \n139 U.S. 67\n, 35 L. ed. 107, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 496; Aldrich v. Chemical Nat. Bank, \n176 U.S. 618\n, 44 L. ed. 611, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 498; Central Transp. Co. v. Pullman's Palace Car Co. \n139 U.S. 24\n, 35 L. ed. 55, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 478; and Pullman's Palace Car Co. v. Central Transp. Co. \n171 U.S. 136\n, 43 L. ed. 108, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 808, it was held although restitution of property obtained under a contract which was illegal, because ultra vires, cannot be adjudged by force of the illegal contract, yet, as the obligation to do justice rests upon all persons, natural and artificial, if one obtains the money or property of others without authority, the law, independently of express contract, will compel restitution or compensation. That this ruling is here applicable is plainly manifested by the fact which we have previously pointed out, that the relief afforded by the court below simply gave to the producers so much of their property as was actually in the hands of the receiver, and awarded them a right to recover as \n\n[218 U.S. 27, 36]\n\u00a0\n general creditors of the bank to the extent only that their property had been received and appropriated by the bank.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","40":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nELIAS v. RAMIREZ(1910)\nNo. 30\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1910\n\n\n\n\n Mr. A. C. Baker for appellant. \n\n[215 U.S. 398, 399]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William Herring for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Appellee was arrested as a fugitive from justice in pursuance of the provision of a treaty of extradition between Mexico and the United States [ 31 Stat. at L. 1818], and, after a hearing before John H. Campbell, judge of the district court of the first judicial district of Arizona, sitting as a commissioner in extradition proceedings, he was committed, on the charge of forgery and the utterance of forged papers, to the custody of the United States marshal for Arizona, to abide the order of the President of the United States in the premises. Upon his petition to the supreme court of the territory for habeas corpus, he was discharged from custody, and from the judgment of the court the case is here on appeal.\n The court decided that the offense charged is within the terms of the treaty between the United States and Mexico, 'that the committing magistrate had jurisdiction of the subject-matter and the accused,' and that the complaint was sufficient. The court, however, held that there was not sufficient legal evidence to establish the fact of forgery, and that therefore 'the judge of the district court exceeded his jurisdiction in holding the petitioner (appellee) for extradition.' This ruling constitutes the question in the case.\n The complaint, summarized, is that Ramirez forged certain railroad wheat certificates, which purported to have been issued by the Southern Pacific Company to show the true weight of certain car loads of wheat shipped from the United States to Mexico, and had the further purpose to show the amount of custom duties to be paid to Mexico. The certificates, in order to appear authenticated, it is alleged, purported and were intended to show that they were signed or sealed or stamped by the railroad company with a seal or stamp containing the words 'gross weight, tare, net weight,' and that the true gross, tare, and net weight of the wheat in each \n\n[215 U.S. 398, 400]\n\u00a0\n of the cars were inserted by the company after those words, and that the certificates were initialed with the letters 'G. W. B.'\n It is alleged that the certificates were not so authenticated by the company or anyone in its employ, and did not show the weight of the wheat, but showed that there was much less than the true weight. It is alleged also, with the usual repetition, that Ramirez forged the stamp and seal and the initials 'G. W. B.,' and did 'use and utter' the certificates, and presented them 'to the customhouse of the government of Mexico and the officials thereof,' at the town of Nogales, 'as true and genuine wheat certificates of the said railroad company, and as showing the true weight contained in the said cars.'\n There were two importations of wheat from Nogales, Arizona, to Nogales, Mexico, in the name of E. Ramirez. The manifest or request for importation was made to the proper officers at Nogales, Mexico, in the name of and for E. Ramirez. It was the duty of the Mexican inspectors of customs to inspect and weigh the wheat, in order to compute the proper amount of duties. One of the importations was inspected by one Manuel Rosas, the other by one Francisco Enriquez, both of whom were implicated in the prosecution in Mexico for the crimes of fraud against the federal treasury and forgery of private seals.\n Rosas testified that he examined the interior of the cars in a superficial manner, 'satisfying himself by opening a sack that said cars contained the merchandise represented.' He did not weigh the merchandise, because it came billed in car-load lots, and 'did not come designated as to so many bundles, and also because the customhouse lacked the proper scale facility.' He testified that 'the railroad of Sonora issued to the applicants a ticket with the seal of the office, without any signature, bearing thereon, indicated in lead pencil writing, the number of the respective cars, the net weight, and the gross weight. It was so done in this case; \n\n[215 U.S. 398, 401]\n\u00a0\n that he compared the data upon the tickets with reference notes with those presented by the customs agent, and, finding them to correspond with each other, he had no objection in authorizing, over his own signature, the correctness of the same, and ordered it 'despatched.\" As soon as the tickets, he further testified, are compared with the applications, they are destroyed, and that he did not know what had become of them in this case. He further testified that the applications were delivered to him by the customhouse collector, which applications manifested the weight of the merchandise to be imported, and, 'this being done, the manifest passed into the possession of the revisers, who solicit the railroad ticket from the interested parties for the purpose of verifying the respective comparisons.' The person of whom he 'asked for the tickets was Mr. Manuel Ramirez, who was in charge of the customs department of the house.' Further testifying, he said that he did not know the origin of the tickets 'by their form of writing;' that he did not find in any of them any erasures nor any trace of alteration, and could not tell 'even vaguely the name of the employees who wrote the tickets;' that he did not know whether any person was present 'when the corresponding tickets were delivered to him;' that he had no knowledge, from 'private sources or otherwise, of Mr. Cerilo Ramirez's connection with the customs agency that operates under his name.' He recognized, from the books of the railroad exhibited to him, the seals to be the same used by the company to express the weight, not recollecting having personally seen the books. Explaining how he 'erred,' he testified that it was because he did not go personally to the offices of the railroad to compare the true weight at those offices, but instead relied on the tickets presented by Manuel Ramirez, 'which were forged, in the sense that the said Ramirez personally, or in accord with some employee of the railroad,' forged the tickets, 'making use of the seals of the railroad.'\n Francisco Enriquez testified substantially to the same \n\n[215 U.S. 398, 402]\n\u00a0\n effect, though in some parts more fully. He testified that the tickets came approved by Mr. G. W. Bowman, chief of the station of the Sonora Railroad. He, however, did not know, he said, the handwriting of Bowman 'to the extent of being able to identify the same to a certainty,' because 'the tickets in question only bring numbers, made in great haste, setting forth the number of the car, the gross weight, the net weight, and the tare, calculated in pounds,' of which he 'made the computation into kilos.'\n Ignacio Alleo testified that he was a private employee of the firm under investigation, and served for five years as freighter for the firm or house; that his duty was to receive the loose freight from the American side, delivered to him at Nogales, Arizona, to place the same in the cars which convey it south; that in doing so he takes note of the number of bundles, marks, countermarks, weights, and other memoranda which serve to form the applications for shipment; that said data are made on loose papers, which he delivers to Manuel Ramirez, who makes out the applications for shipment; that 'Ramirez is also occupied in making the applications for exportation, reimportation, more properly exportation;' that he, the witness, had no other connection with the direct importation than to copy some applications for shipment; that when he came to the house, five years ago, Manuel Ramirez had been serving the house for a long time, and that Ramirez had 'personal charge of the dealings with the employees of the customhouse, all relative to importations;' that the head person in charge of the office 'was Eduardo Ramirez, who had full power to act from the owner of the business, Cerilo Ramirez; that up to three years ago, Alberto Masarenas kept the accounts of the house, since then he did not know who had, but that the cash accounts, he understands, were kept by Mr. Escobara.'\n Ignacio Escobara had testified before, but he would not ratify his former testimony in all respects, he said, because it was given 'under the belief that his gratitude towards his \n\n[215 U.S. 398, 403]\n\u00a0\n employer compelled him to do so,' and that, after mature consideration, he realized that he was not required 'to tell an untruth in a proceeding which may stain his honor, and for that reason he was disposed to tell the truth.' And he testified that from the beginning of the proceeding against Messrs. Campello he noticed the greatest uneasiness, excitement, and fear in Eduardo Ramirez, Luis Bartning, and Cerilo Ramirez; from that time they began to prepare themselves, 'fearing to become involved in the same manner as Messrs. Campello and associates; that he plainly noticed the attitude of the above gentlemen and the danger in which they were.' He further testified that 'he saw and noticed their conduct, as well as listening to their conversation,' and that 'the manner of preparing themselves consisted in making up packages of correspondence and documents carefully selected and packed in a wooden box which stood in a patio or court during the day and disappeared at night without' his knowing what became of it; that he was under the impression that it was taken to the American side, not being able to tell 'from whom he heard it in the office of the firm,' but he believed that he 'heard it said there in conversation.'\n He further testified that the books of account and the copy books of statement of expenses 'appeared and disappeared successively, being carried to and fro by Bartning personally, who was the bookkeeper;' that, at the beginning of Campello's investigation, Alleo confessed to him that the house was very much involved in the same manner as were Messrs. Campello; that the person in charge of all transactions was Manuel Ramirez; that Bartning is the brother-in-law of Ramirez, 'with whom he is strongly tied in business; the head of the institution is Cerilo Ramirez, who commands as supreme principal and owner of the establishment, and as such daily attends said office, watching carefully the affairs and progress of the house; during the absence of Cerilo his brother Eduardo directs the house, and is recognized by all as second chief; and as Cerilo was tried for smuggling, and his signature is not \n\n[215 U.S. 398, 404]\n\u00a0\n accepted in customhouse dealings, all official documents are signed by Eduardo Ramirez in his own name, or through an agent representing himself in the documents as a customhouse broker.' He testified further that he 'was told from the beginning that the cause of fear of Cerilo Ramirez and his associates in the present case proceded from a fraud committed by them upon the federal treasury in like manner as that committed by Messrs. Campello,-that is, by false and forged manifests of the weight of car loads of wheat imported by said house one year ago.'\n The record shows that Cerilo Ramirez, 'being present for the purpose of undergoing a suppletory confrontation with Ignacio Escobara,' and with 'that of said Ramirez,' referring apparently to some deposition or statement made by himself, which is not in the papers, stated that he was 'absent from Nogales, living in Lower California, and for that reason could not have been present after the detention of Campello,' and stated further that he was 'therefore ignorant of what disposition had been made of the books of account, correspondence, and documents of the establishment of 'C. Ramirez,' to which Escobara' referred. He denied that he was recognized as agent of the house, and said that 'if he left the name of C. Ramirez in the business, it was with the object of not impairing the credit of the house, and on account of his brother being concerned . . . which business he transferred to his brother Eduardo, without executing in this case any special instrument.' And he denied having had 'previous knowledge of the fraud upon the federal treasury.'\n Manuel Ramirez was also put in 'suppletory confrontation' with Escobara, whose testimony was read to him, as was that of C. Ramirez, and being 'apprised of the discrepancies of both depositions,' said that what Escobara said was 'not exact' when he said that he, Ramirez, was 'in collusion with the other, Messrs. Ramirez, in trying to conceal the books and correspondence of the business.' The rest of his testimony is as follows: 'He does not know where they (the books and \n\n[215 U.S. 398, 405]\n\u00a0\n correspondence) are, and says that their chief was Mr. Eduardo Ramirez, ignoring (?) to date if the payment has been made in full of the duties upon the importation of wheat, because his duties were only to draw the papers for the importation through the customhouse.'\n He was called upon a second time to testify, and he was asked if he personally copied the tickets or memoranda of the weight of the cars of wheat from the sheets in which the employees of the railroad noted the weight of bundles. He answered that sometimes he did, but not in the present case, he did not remember; that his brother, Eduardo Ramirez, attended to the loading and giving of weights, but that he, in his brother's absence, would sometimes attend to this branch. Aud further, that he could not explain the discrepancy between the weights of the bundles in question and those shown in the respective books of the railroad company.\n It appears that the frauds upon the revenue charged to E. Ramirez amounted to $11,944.95. The depositions were taken in proceedings instituted in Mexico under its laws as the basis for an application for the extradition of Eduardo Ramirez, and were attested by the officers of the tribunal to whom the case was assigned, and that tribunal, after citing the applicable law and its conclusion, and considering that 'the corpus delicti of fraud against the federal treasury and undue use of private seals' had been proved, and that it constituted forgery under the laws of Mexico, and was within the provisions of the treaty between that country and the United States, concluded as follows: 'Let a petition issue with the proper evidence to the Secretary of State and Foreign Affairs, so that, through the conduct of the diplomatic agents accredited in the neighboring Republic, steps be taken for the extradition of Eduardo Ramirez, and obtaining the same, to place at the disposal of this tribunal.'\n Appellant was commissioned by the Mexican ambassador as a proper person to present to the authorities of the United States of America a copy of the warrant of arrest in the \n\n[215 U.S. 398, 406]\n\u00a0\n United States of Mexico, and of the depositions upon which the warrant was issued, and, as agent of Mexico, to 'receive the said Eduardo Ramirez from the proper authorities of the United States of America.' We shall not further quote the papers, as there is no question but that requisition had been duly made for the extradition of Ramirez. The evidence before the district judge consisted of the depositions, together with oral testimony that they would be admissible in evidence in the courts of Mexico, and, in addition, the ambassador to Mexico and the charge d'affaires certified that they were 'properly and legally authenticated, so as to entitle them to be received for similar purpose by tribunals of Mexico, as required by the act of Congress of August 3, 1882.' [22 Stat. at L. 215, chap. 378, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3593.] There is also in the record a paper headed, 'Statement of the weight of the car loads of wheat imported by Eduardo Ramirez, made by this federal tribunal by virtue of the data shown in the books of the railroads,' and a large number of exhibits.\n The district judge committed Ramirez to the custody of the United States marshal for the territory of Arizona, to abide 'the order of the President of the United States of America in the premises.' The writ of habeas corpus under review was then issued by the supreme court of the territory and appellee discharged from custody. It was ordered, however, that if an appeal should be taken to this court, he should be remanded to the custody of the marshal, to be released upon giving bail in the sum of $ 25,000, under the provisions of rule 34. Bail was subsequently given and the appellee discharged from custody.\n The supreme court of the territory expressed the view that the writ of habeas corpus could not be made to perform the office of a writ of error, and that, therefore, if the district judge had jurisdiction of the subject-matter and of the accused, and the offense charged was within the terms of the treaty of extradition, and there was before him 'competent legal evidence on which to exercise his judgment as to whether \n\n[215 U.S. 398, 407]\n\u00a0\n the facts are sufficient to establish the criminality of the accused for the purposes of extradition, such decision cannot be reviewed on habeas corpus.' [90 Pac. 323.] The court cited Ornelas v. Ruiz, \n161 \nU.S. 502, 508\n, 40 S. L. ed. 787, 789, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 689, and Bryant v. United States, \n167 U.S. 104\n, 42 L. ed. 94, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 744. And considering further the extent of a court's power of review over the judgment of the committing magistrate upon the facts, said, 'but such court is not to inquire whether the legal evidence of facts before the commission was sufficient or insufficient to warrant his conclusion,' citing Re Stupp, 12 Blatchf. 501, Fed. Cas. No. 13,563; Ornelas v. Ruiz, supra; and Terlinden v. Ames, \n184 U.S. 270\n, 46 L. ed. 534, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 484. The cases cited establish the propositions expressed by the court, but the learned courts application of them to the facts of this record is challenged. The court expressed the opinion that all of the conditions of commitment were established, except that there 'was no competent legal evidence of the fact of forgery itself of the documents in question.' That is, that there was no legal evidence of the forgery of what are called in the complaint 'railroad wheat certificates' and 'tickets' in the depositions of the witnesses. We are unable to agree to this conclusion. They were either forged or issued by mistake, and the supposition of a mistake is precluded by the evidence. The books of the railroad showed the true weights; the mistake or forgery was in the certificates or tickets. Exclude the former and forgery is established. If a mistake was made, it is certainly strange that it should have escaped notice until the Mexican treasury had been defrauded of $11,944.94. Besides, the reparation for a mistake was payment of the amount in default, not by flight from the accusation of forgery and crime. Then, too, ample opportunity was given in Mexico to explain the certificates, but explanation was not attempted. It was not attempted in Arizona; and from these negative circumstances, as well as from the positive testimony of the witnesses, it certainly cannot be said that there was substantially no evidence to justify the judgment of the commissioner that a crime had been committed, and as little can it \n\n[215 U.S. 398, 408]\n\u00a0\n be said that there was not probable cause to believe that the accused had committed it. We have set out the evidence somewhat fully. It shows that the Mexican treasury was defrauded by the 'House of Ramirez' of $11,944.94, and that appellee was 'second chief' of the house, and the one to whom C. Ramirez had transferred it. It appears, therefore, that he was the principal, if not the only, beneficiary of the fraud. It is true that Manuel Rosas and Francisco Enriquez, the customhouse revisers, stated that they received the 'tickets' from Manuel Ramirez; but, from the testimony of the latter and other evidence, it may be reasonably concluded that accused acted in conjunction with him, in fact, prepared and directed the whole affair. It is certainly not out of the bounds of reason to suppose that he who was benefited by the fraud contrived and executed it, and not his subordinate or employee. It is, however, objected that there is no evidence in the record 'tending in any way to prove that any of the alleged certificate were forged or altered or changed by any person whatsoever.' Indeed, it is asserted by the appellee 'that the evidence, so far as it proves or tends to prove anything, proves that the certificates were genuine certificates, issued by G. W. Bowman, chief of the station of the Sonora Railroad.' To complete these contentions a reference is made to the complaint, in which it is alleged that the certificates, in order to appear authenticated, purported to show that they were signed, sealed, or stamped by the railroad, containing the words 'gross weight, tare, net weight,' and initialed with the letters 'G. W. B.,' and, if so worded and initialed, would have been so authenticated as to have shown true weight of the wheat in the cars. There is no evidence, it is said, of these allegations, or that it was the duty of the customhouse officer to accept any so-called weight certificates as evidence of the true weight of the wheat to be imported. It is probable that the supreme court of the territory yielded to these contentions, and that they were the basis of its decision that there was no legal evidence before the commission of 'facts tend- \n\n[215 U.S. 398, 409]\n\u00a0\n ing to prove the commission of the offense charged; to wit, the crime of forgery.'\n We, however, cannot concur in these contentions, and, without going over the evidence to show a precise or technical adaptation of it to the allegations, it is enough to say that we think the evidence shows not only that a crime was committed, but shows its character and by whom committed with sufficient certainty and strength to satisfy the statute, and to justify the order of the commissioner committing the accused to await the action of the executive department.\n It is further contended that the statements of Rosas and Enriquez were unsworn to, and because unsworn to were not admissible in evidence; that 'under the common law and the law of Arizona the unsworn statement of no witness is competent upon a preliminary hearing before a committing magistrate,' and would not justify a commitment for trial in Arizona. It is hence contended that it was not sufficient to justify the extradition of the appellee. Re Ezeta, 62 Fed. 972; Re McPhun, 24 Blatchf. 254, 30 Fed. 57; Benson v. McMahon, \n127 U.S. 457\n, 32 L. ed. 234, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1240, are adduced to sustain the contention. The answer to the contention is that the statute providing for extradition makes the depositions receivable in evidence, and provides that their sufficiency to establish the crime shall be such as to create a probability of the commission by the accused of the crime charged against him. This is the principle announced by the cases cited by the appellee.\n Other contentions are made, but we do not think that they need special mention.\n Order reversed and the cause remanded with directions to proceed in accordance with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","41":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEX PARTE GRUETTER(1910)\n\nArgued: Decided: May 31, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. Arthur Crownover, Isaac W. Crabtree, and William L. Myers for petitioner.\n Mr. William L. Granbery for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n Gruetter brought an action in the circuit court of Franklin county, Tennessee, against the Cumberland Telephone & Telegraph Company, to recover $20,000 for violation of  2 of chapter 66 of the Acts of 1885, which is  1842 of Shannon's Code of Tennessee, for the unjust discrimination by defendant against plaintiff, set up in the declaration. The section is as follows:\n'Every telephone company doing business within this \n\n[217 U.S. 586, 587]\n\u00a0\n state, and engaged in a general telephone business, shall supply all applicants for telephone connection and facilities, without discrimination or partiality, provided such applicants comply, or offer to comply, with the reasonable regulations of the company; and no such company shall impose any condition or restriction upon any such applicant that are not imposed impartially upon all persons or companies in like situations, nor shall such company discriminate against any individual or company in lawful business by requiring, as condition for furnishing such facilities, that they shall not be used in the business of the applicant or otherwise, under penalty of $100 for each day such company continues such discrimination and refuses such facilities after compliance, or offer to comply, with the reasonable regulations, and time to furnish the same has elapsed, to be recovered by the applicant whose application is so neglected or refused.'\n\n Defendant filed a petition to remove the case to the Circuit court of the United States for the Middle division of the Middle district of Tennessee, to which plaintiff demurred on the ground that it was an action to recover a penalty, and therefore was not removable. The demurrer was heard by the circuit judge, who sustained it, dismissed the petition, and refused to remove the case. Defendant obtained a certified copy of the record, and filed the same in the circuit court of the United States for the sixth circuit, and plaintiff moved to remand the case because it was a suit to recover a penalty and the action was not of a civil nature; because the petition and record did not show that the suit was sought to be removed to the circuit court of the United States for the distrcit in which either the plaintiff or the defendant resided; and because the defendant did not specifically pray for the removal of the cause.\n The circuit court, upon hearing, filed a memorandum opinion considering and overruling all of the grounds \n\n[217 U.S. 586, 588]\n\u00a0\n presented to sustain the motion, and denied the motion to remand, whereupon Gruetter filed a petition for writ of mandamus, directing the district judge of the United States for the middle devision of the middle district of Tennessee, holding the circuit court for that division, to remand the suit to the circuit court of Franklin county, state of Tennessee. Leave to file this petition was granted and a rule to show cause was thereon entered, to which the judge filed his return, stating that the motion of plaintiff to remand was denied for the reason that, in respondent's opinion, the several grounds of the petitioner's motion were not well founded in law, and that, under the facts and pleadings presented by the record, the circuit court of the United States for the middle district of Tennessee, sitting at Nashville, had jurisdiction of said cause.\n There was no controversy as to there being diversity of citizenship. The defendant was a corporation of Kentucky and plaintiff was a citizen of Tennessee. Inasmuch as we are of opinion that the circuit court of the United States had jurisdiction to determine the questions presented, we hold that mandamus will not lie. The final order of the circuit court cannot be reviewed on this writ. Re Pollitz, \n206 U.S. 323\n, 51 L. ed. 1081, 27 Sup. Ct.

Strother for defendants in error.\n\n Per Curiam:\n This is a writ of error to the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of West Virginia, brought directly to this court, and as such falls within the rule that the controversy must be substantial and the question open to discussion. Tested by that rule, we think the writ of error must be dismissed on the authority of King v. Mullins, \n171 U.S. 404\n, 43 L. ed. 214, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 925; King v. West Virginia, \n216 U.S. 92\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 225. And see King v. Panther Lumber Co. \n171 U.S. 437\n, 43 L. ed. 227, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 573; Swann v. West Virginia, \n188 U.S. 739\n, 47 L. ed. 677, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 848. It is contended that the question of the forfeiture of plaintiffs' title under the Constitution of West Virginia was not ruled in those cases, because they also involved the statute of the state referred to, while this case presents the validity of the forfeiture provision of the state Constitution alone. But it was pointed out in King v. West Virginia, \n216 U.S. 100\n, 54 L. Ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 225, that the right to redeem, given by the statute, was not coextensive with the forfeiture under the state Constitution, and yet the Constitution was upheld, as it was in King v. Mullins, supra. It follows, therefore, that the state Constitution must be upheld in the present case. The only hearing that could be necessary would be whether the facts constitute a forfeiture; and that question, when it arises between a former owner and a claimant under the state, can be tried in a case between those parties, as it was here. There is no greater objection under the Constitution of the United States to the forfeiture of land for five years' neglect to pay taxes than there is to a similar forfeiture by the statute of limitations for neglect to assert title against one by whom the former owner has been disseised. We think that the question suggested is so plainly covered by the preceding cases that the writ of error must be dismissed.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","43":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFIRST NAT BANK OF ESTHERVILLE, IOWA v. CITY COUNCIL OF(1910)\nNo. 64\nArgued: December 10, 1909Decided: January 3, 1910\n\n\n\n\n Mr. Charles A. Clark for plaintiffs in error.[ First Nat Bank of Estherville, Iowa v. City Council of \n215 U.S. 341\n (1910) ]\n\n\n[215 U.S. 341, 344]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Byron M. Coon for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was an appeal under  1373 of the Code of Iowa, from the action of the members of the city council of the city of Estherville, Iowa, sitting as a board of equalization and review, in fixing the assessed value of the shares of stock in the plaintiff bank for the year 1906. The shares of stock in the plaintiff bank were assessed by the assessor on the basis of the book or assessed value, obtained by adding the capital, surplus, and undivided profits of the bank, and dividing the sum total by the number of shares of capital stock, to ascertain the value of one share, a proper deduction having been made on account of real estate owned by the bank. The board of review and equalization raised the assessed valuation of the shares to $130 per share. The bank and its shareholders appeared before the board, and objected to its action and to the valuation fixed by them as being in excess of the actual value, and exorbitant and unjust. The bank contended that the stock was not assessed and valued in proportion to other like personal property in the city of Estherville, but was grossly in excess thereof, and constituted unfair and unequal taxation, and that the taxable value of the shares of the stock in the bank should be found as the assessor had previously found it. But the board adhering to its own judgment, plaintiffs perfected an appeal to the district court of Emmett County, \n\n[215 U.S. 341, 345]\n\u00a0\n Iowa. In that court plaintiffs filed a pleading containing taining a recital of the facts and demanding relief, and reiterating the same contention as made below, and the same claim as to the proper manner to arrive at the assessable valuation of said shares of stock. Answer was filed in behalf of the board, wherein it was denied that the assessment, as raised, was unjust, and asserted that the market value was the proper criterion for valuation, and that the actual and market value of the stock in question was even greater than that fixed in the raised assessment. It was also denied that the assessment was unfair as related to the assessment on other like property.\n The district court sustained the action of the board of review, whereupon the case was appealed to the supreme court of Iowa, which affirmed the decree of the district court. 136 Iowa, 203, 112 N. W. 829. In the supreme court it was contended for the first time that the action of the board worked a violation of  5219 of the United States Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3502), touching upon state taxation of national bank shares. Because of the fact that such matter was not presented to the board or suggested on the trial in the court below, the supreme court refused to entertain the question. What the court said was this:\n'In doing so we shall first dispose of a matter of contention brought forward for the first time in argument in this court. This contention is, through the action of the defendant board, as complained of, there was worked a violation of  5219 of U. S. Revised Statutes, having to do with the subject of state taxation of national bank shares. As confessedly such matter was not presented to the board, or suggested on the trial in the court below, we cannot give consideration thereto on merits in this court. But this is to follow our repeated decisions bearing on the subject. Cedar Rapids & M. C. R. Co. v. Cedar Rapids, 106 Iowa, 476, 76 N. W. 728; Farmer's Loan & T. Co. v. Fonda, 114 Iowa, 728, 87 N. W. 724.'\n\n And further:\n'On appeal to the district court, the statute (Code,  1373) provides for a hearing as in equity. This, however, is not to \n\n[215 U.S. 341, 346]\n\u00a0\n be construed as clothing the court with jurisdiction to sit as an assessing tribunal. Frost v. Board of Review, 114 Iowa, 103, 86 N. W. 213; Farmers' Loan & T. Co. v. Fonda, supra.'\n\n We are met at the threshold by a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction. It was ruled in Tyler v. Registration Ct. Judges, \n179 U.S. 408\n, 45 L. ed. 252, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 206, that although 'it is true that under the third clause of  709 [of the Revised Statutes], U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575, where a title, right, privilege, or immunity is claimed under Federal law, such title, etc., must be 'specially set up or claimed,' and that no such provision is made as to cases within the second clause, involving the constitutionality of state statutes or authorities, but it is none the less true that the authority of such statute must 'be drawn in question' by someone who has been affected by the decision of a state court in favor of its validity, and that, in this particular, the three clauses of the section are practically identical.'\n In order to give this court jurisdiction of a writ of error to the highest court of a state in which a decision could be had, it must appear affirmatively that a Federal question was presented for decision, that its decision was necessary to the determination of the cause, and that it was actually decided, or that the judgment rendered could not have been given without deciding it.\n The only complaint made before the reviewing board and the district court was that the assessment was in excess of the actual value of such stock, and exorbitant and unjust, and that the taxable value thereof should be no greater sum than is obtained by adding the capital, surplus, and undivided profits of said bank, subtracting therefrom the amount of the bank's capital invested in real estate, and dividing the remainder by the number of its shares of capital stock to obtain the true assessable value of one share of stock; also that 'said stock is not assessed and valued in proportion to other like personal property in the city of Estherville, but is grossly in excess thereof, and unfair to these appellants, and is unequal taxation.' \n\n[215 U.S. 341, 347]\n\u00a0\n These were not Federal questions. No mention of the national banking act was made, nor any right or privilege claimed under it, nor were the provisions of the Revised Statutes invoked, by name or otherwise. There was no assertion of an issue in the case claiming the local statutes to be in conflict with, or repugnant to the terms of,  5219 of the Revised Statutes, or the Constitution of the United States. Plaintiffs filed a written pleading in the district court, in which they set out all proceedings leading up to the appeal and the grounds for their complaint against the action of the equalization board, and when the case went to trial filed an amendment, alleging the additional grievance of inequality.\n Section 1322 of the Iowa Code reads as follows:\n'National, State, and Savings Banks.-Shares of stock of national banks shall be assessed to the individual stockholders at the place where the bank is located. Shares of stock of state and savings banks and loan and trust companies shall be assessed to such banks and loan and trust companies, and not to the individual stockholders. At the time the assessment is made, the officers of national banks shall furnish the assessor with a list of all the stockholders and the number of shares owned by each, and he shall list to each stockholder, under the head of corporation stock, the total value of such shares. To aid the assessor in fixing the value of such shares, the corporation shall furnish him a verified statement of all the matters provided in the preceding section, which shall also show, separately, the amount of capital stock, and the surplus and undivided earnings, and the assessor, from such statement and other information he can obtain, including any statement furnished to and information obtained by the auditor of state, which shall be furnished him on request, shall fix the value of such stock, taking into account the capital, surplus, and undivided earnings. In arriving at the total value of the shares of stock of such corporations, the amount of their capital actually invested in real estate owned by them [and in the shares of stock of \n\n[215 U.S. 341, 348]\n\u00a0\n corporations owning only the real estate (inclusive of leasehold interest, if any) on or in which the bank or trust company is located] shall be deducted from the real value of such shares, and such real estate shall be assessed as other real estate, and the property of such corporations shall not be otherwise assessed.'\n\n But the court held that the assessor need not rely entirely upon the statements which the bank is required by the section to furnish, but might take into consideration other information he might obtain, and, construing that section in connection with  1305 of the Code, reading, 'All property subject to taxation shall be valued at its actual value. . . . Such assessed value shall . . . be taken and considered as the taxable value of such property, . . . upon which the levy shall be made. Actual value of property, as used in this chapter, shall mean its value in the market in the ordinary course of trade,' found that the shares should be assessed at their market or sale values; and then the court proceeded to ascertain, on the facts, whether the shares were taxed at more than their market value, and whether at a greater rate in proportion to the value of other like personal property.\n If plaintiffs in error believed that the local statute was unconstitutional and invalid because of conflict with the Federal Constitution or statute, they could and should have said so; but the validity of the act was nowhere specifically drawn in question.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","44":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFISHER v. MAYOR AND COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF NEW ORLEANS(1910)\nNo. 43\nArgued: Decided: November 28, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 438, 439]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles Louque for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. St. Clair Adams and I. D. Moore for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a petition for mandamus to direct the levy of a special tax of 1 1\/2 mills to pay claims and judgments against the New Orleans school board, based on contracts made by the board with teachers and others during the years 1874, 1875, and 1876, under the Louisiana act 36 of 1873. The ground of the petition is that, under the act, the contracts were authorized and were payable out of a special tax, unlimited in amount; that an attempt to limit taxation in article 232 of the state Constitution of 1898 is void as to them, because it impairs their obligation, contrary to article 1,  10, of the Constitution of the United States (Louisiana ex rel. Hubert v. New Orleans, \n215 U.S. 170\n, 175-178, 54 L. ed. 144, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 40); and that a sufficient amount has not been levied for the years mentioned. The supreme court denied the mandamus (121 La. 762, 46 So. 798), and this writ of error was brought.\n The plaintiffs in error are met at the outset by a denial of the jurisdiction of this court. The main grounds upon which the supreme court of the state decided the case were that the relators had been guilty of laches, and that the act of 1873 did not authorize contracts to be made by the school board in such wise as to bind the city to levy the tax. The court did not purport to rely upon the Constitution of 1898, or any subsequent legislation, for the result. It did not purport to enforce any later \n\n[218 U.S. 438, 440]\n\u00a0\n law; it simply denied the existence of the right alleged. Therefore, on the face of the decision, there is no warrant for coming here. But it is said that this court is not limited to the mere language of the opinion, but will consider the substance and effect of the judgment (McCullough v. Virginia, \n172 \nU.S. 102, 116\n, 117 S., 43 L. ed. 382, 387, 388, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 134; Louisiana ex rel. Hubert v. New Orleans, \n215 \nU.S. 170, 175\n, 54 S. L. ed. 144, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 40), and that this court will decide for itself, with due respect for the state decision, whether a contract had been made and what it was (Sullivan v. Texas, \n207 \nU.S. 416, 423\n, 52 S. L. ed. 274, 277, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 215). Both of these statements are true, of course, and are relevant when the judgment really gives effect to a later act of the state that would impair the obligation of the contract if the contract were as alleged. But the mere allegation of a later constitution or statute impairing the obligation of the contract gives no jurisdiction to this court to see that the contract is enforced according to its tenor, irrespective of the supposed interference of the later law. The jurisdiction extends to doing away with such an interference, but not to remedying an erroneous construction of contracts, or to seeing that they are carried out according to the interpretation of this court, apart from it. Bacon v. Texas, \n163 \nU.S. 207, 218\n, 219 S., 41 L. ed. 132, 136, 137, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1023; New Orleans Waterworks Co. v. Louisiana, \n185 \nU.S. 336, 350\n, 351 S., 352, 46 L. ed. 936, 943, 944, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 691; Weber v. Rogan, \n188 \nU.S. 10, 14\n, 47 S. L. ed. 363, 365, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 263; Central Land Co. v. Laidley, \n159 \nU.S. 103, 110\n, 111 S., 40 L. ed. 91, 94, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 80. Therefore the present writ of error must be dismissed unless there is more in the case than the opinion has disclosed.\n We discover nothing. If it was true that there was no contract binding the city to levy an extra tax, or that the parties demanding it had lost any rights they might have had by laches, there was no occasion to invoke or enforce any law later than the act of 1873. Obviously, however much we consider the substance of the judgment, it discloses no question of rights under the Constitution any more than does the opinion of the state court. Un- \n\n[218 U.S. 438, 441]\n\u00a0\n less the reasons put forward for the decision were but a cover for an unavowed enforcement of the Constitution of 1898, which, of course, there is no ground to suggest, the jurisdiction of this court fails. As a work of supererogation, we will indicate in a summary way some of the reasons for denying the power of the board of school directors to bind the city to levy the tax upon the facts, simply to show how remote from matter of Federal jurisdiction the decision was.\n By  2 of the act of 1873, the board of directors are to adopt an estimate of debt and expenditures for the current year, and thereafter, in October of each year, to adopt and communicate to the city council an estimate for the year beginning on the next January 1. By  4 'the council, after receiving the estimate . . . shall proceed to make provision for the support of public schools. . . . For the purpose of such support it shall levy a tax of not less than 1\/4 of 1 per cent,' etc. Then, by  10, 'the board of directors of the public schools shall not be empowered to make contracts or debts for the year 1873, or any subsequent year, greater than the amount of the revenue provided for according to this act, or other school laws existing, it being the intent hereof that parties contracting with said board shall take heed that due revenues shall have been provided to satisfy the claims, otherwise they shall lose and forfeit the same.' It will be observed that the city council is not required by  4 to make provision for the amount of the estimate received by it, but for the support of the public schools; and that the minimum limit set to its action implies that beyond that point it has power of control. The subsequent provisions of  10 hardly are reconcilable with any other view.\n In this state of the law, the city council levied the minimum tax of 1\/4 of 1 per cent, and no more, for the years 1874, 1875, and 1876. But the levy was less \n\n[218 U.S. 438, 442]\n\u00a0\n than the estimates of the school board, and the contention was that the city council was bound to levy for the full amount of the latter, and that the plaintiffs in error are entitled to demand a levy for the difference between the two now. The contrary decision was natural enough on the face of the act of 1873, and is corroborated by the consideration of other statutes before and after 1873, to which we think it unnecessary to refer. It also is said that a part of the tax levied was not collected. But that was not a ground stated in the petition, and is not a matter with which we have any concern. We do not go into this matter of laches beyond noting that this petition was not filed until 1907. Whether the long delay was sufficiently explained or not was for the state court to decide.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","45":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFORBES v. STATE COUNCIL OF VIRGINIA(1910)\nNo. 104\nArgued: January 25, 1910Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. C. V. Meredith, Preston Cocke, E. B. King, and Smith W. Bennett for plaintiffs in error.\n The court declined to hear Mr. Samuel A. Anderson for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case grows out of one heretofore in this court, National Council, J. O. U. A. M. v. State Council, \n203 U.S. 151\n, 51 L. ed. 132, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 46. In that case this court affirmed a judgment of the supreme court of appeals of Virginia, which had affirmed a decree of the lower court of that state. The effect of that decree was to enjoin \n\n[216 U.S. 396, 397]\n\u00a0\n the National Council of the Junior Order of United American Mechanics of the United States, and certain persons, officers of a voluntary association, from using in the state of Virginia the corporate name of the State Council of the Virginia Junior Order of United American Mechanics of the State of Virginia, or any other name likely to be taken for it, and from using the seal of the asid Virginia order, and from carrying out under such name the objects for which the Virginia order and the voluntary association had been organized, from granting charters to subordinate councils in the state, and from interfering in any way with the pursuance of its objects by the Virginia order within the state, and from designating their officers in the state by appellations set forth as used by the plaintiff. After this decree, thus affirmed, had become final in the Virginia state court, the plaintiffs in error proceeded to obtain a charter under the name of the 'Virginia Branch of the National Council of the Junior Order United American Mechanics,'-a name which they urged was clearly distinguishable from that of the State Council of Virginia Junior Order United American Mechanics of the State of Virginia, protected by the original decree. Having taken out the charter by the name aforesaid, the plaintiffs in error were prosecuted for contempt of court in violating the original decree. Upon hearing in the chancery court, an order was entered finding the plaintiffs in error to be in contempt, and a fine of $20 was imposed on each of them, and the same was ordered to be paid to the clerk of the court within thirty-five days, and, in default thereof, each of the plaintiffs in error to stand committed to the custody of the sheriff, to remain in jail until the said sum be paid by then respectively.\n A writ of error was allowed by the supreme court of appeals of Virginia to this order of the chancery court. In the supreme court of appeals a motion was made to dismiss the writ of error as having been improvidently granted. Upon consideration, the supreme court of appeals of Virginia sustained that motion upon the ground that it had no jurisdiction \n\n[216 U.S. 396, 398]\n\u00a0\n to review the judgment complained of, and dismissed the writ of error accordingly. 107 Va. 853, 60 S. E. 81. The plaintiffs in error seek to bring the case here upon the ground that the ruling of the supreme court of appeals of Virginia denies them due process of law, and deprives them of the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n An inspection of the record shows that no claim of the rights now asserted under the Federal Constitution was made until the petition for rehearing was filed after the judgment in the state court of final resort. That petition embodies many objections to the opinion and judgment of the supreme court of appeals of Virginia, not involving the Federal Constitution. As to the Federal Constitution, it was set up that if the Virginia statute, which provides that a writ of error shall lie to the supreme court of appeals of Virginia to a judgment for a contempt of court other than for the nonperformance of, or disobedience to, a judgment, decree, or order, was applied to deny a review in the pending case, it would violate the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, in that it attempts to deprive the plaintiffs in error of a right to a writ of error from the supreme court of appeals of Virginia, as given under  88 of the Constitution of Virginia, and thereby deprive plaintiffs in error of their liberty without due process of law, and denied to them the equal protection of the laws; that a denial by the supreme court of appeals of Virginia of a writ of error under  88 of the Virginia Constitution, which provides that the supreme court of appeals of Virginia shall have appellate jurisdiction in all cases involving the life or liberty of any person, will be in violation of the 14th Amendment, in that it would deprive them of property without due process of law, and would deny to them the equal protection of the laws.\n In passing upon the petition for rehearing, the supreme court of appeals of Virginia said: 'On mature consideration of the petition of the plaintiffs in error to set aside the judg- \n\n[216 U.S. 396, 399]\n\u00a0\n ment entered herein on January 16, 1908, and to grant a rehearing of said cause, the prayer of said petition is denied.'\n It has been many times held in this court that an attempt to introduce a Federal question into the record for the first time by a petition for rehearing is too late. Loeber v. Schroeder, \n149 \nU.S. 580, 585\n, 37 S. L. ed. 856, 859, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 934; Pim v. St. Louis, \n165 U.S. 273\n, 41 L. ed. 714, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 322.\n There is an exception to this rule when it appears that the court below entertained the motion for rehearing, and passed upon the Federal question. But it must appear that such Federal question was in fact passed upon in considering the motion for rehearing; if not, the general rule applies. Mallett v. North Carolina, \n181 U.S. 589\n, 45 L. ed. 1015, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 730; Leigh v. Green, \n193 U.S. 79\n, 48 L. ed. 623, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 390; Corkran Oil & Development Co. v. Arnaudet, \n199 U.S. 182\n, 50 L. ed. 143, 144, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 41; McMillen v. Ferrum Min. Co. \n197 U.S. 343\n, 49 L. ed. 784, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 533; Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas, \n212 \nU.S. 112, 118\n, 53 S. L. ed. 431, 434, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 227.\n But, it is alleged, the memorandum which we have quoted shows that the Virginia court must have considered and passed upon the Federal question made in the petition for a rehearing. Except that the order is said to be upon 'mature' consideration, it is almost word for word the order on rehearing reviewed in McCorquodale v. Texas, \n211 U.S. 432\n, 53 L. ed. 269, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 146, which was held to amount to no more than a denial of the motion. See \n211 U.S. 437\n. In that case the rule was again laid down that it was too late to raise a Federal question upon a petition for rehearing, unless the Federal question was passed upon in ruling upon the petition.\n It results that the writ of error in this case must be dismissed.\n Dismissed. \n\n\n\n","46":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFRAENKL v. CERECEDO(1910)\nNo. 411\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n This is an appeal from a decree of the district court of the United States for Porto Rico, upon a bill of review, vacating and annulling a decree entered by that court in an equity cause, and dismissing the bill of complaint in said cause without prejudice. \n\n[216 U.S. 295, 296]\n\u00a0\n The bill in the equity cause referred to was filed in December, 1900. The present appellants were complainants. Some of them were alleged in the bill to be copartners, doing business in Dundee, scotland, as Jaffe Brothers & Company, and to be subjects of the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland. The others were averred to be copartners doing business in Berlin, Germany, as Hinne & Company, and to be subjects of the Emperor of Germany. The defendants to the bill were Demetria Bolta and Alfredo Arnaldo y Sevilla, and various other individuals alleged to be the general and special partners of a firm styled J. Fernandez & Company. Among such were Manuel, Enrique, Jose, and Francisco Cerecedo, all of whom were members of a firm styled Cerecedo Hermanos, which firm, it was charged, was a special partner in J. Fernandez & Company. All the defendants were averred to be citizens and residents of Porto Rico.\n The allegations of the bill were thus summarized in an opinion rendered in the court below:\n'It avers, in substance, that Fernandez & Company, of which firm Cerecedo Brothers were special partners up to the time when Fernandez & Company suspended payment, were indebted to the complainants in certain sums set forth in the bill; that fraudulently and to obtain time the lastnamed firm agreed with Jaffe Brothers & Company to transfer to them certain securities upon third parties for their debt, but thereafter proposed to turn them over in actual payment pro tanto; but when the agent of Jaffe Brothers & Company obtained authority to agree to this, said firm applied for suspension of payments; that to get this, they issued false evidences of indebtedness to Cerecedo Brothers and others; that after the suspension of payments, Fernandez, as liquidator, fraudulently transferred the securities complainant Jaffe Brothers & Company were to have to a third party, without consideration, and for half their value, Cerecedo Brothers being in fact the real purchasers; that Fernandez, after the suspension of payments, turned over to Cerecedo Brothers a large amount \n\n[216 U.S. 295, 297]\n\u00a0\n of property, the amount being unknown to complainants, and disposed of a large part of the assets fraudulently. Interrogatories were propounded in the bill to Fernandez. The relief sought was a specific performance of the agreement with Fernandez as to the securities; that a receiver be appointed, and the assets of Fernandez & Company be marshaled; that Fernandez & Company be enjoined from collecting said securities or interfering with the company's assets; that they be delivered to the receiver, the liens be ascertained, the property sold and distributed among the creditors, Jaffe Brothers & Company being allowed to participate in the distribution, said securities being first applied on their debt.' [ 1 Porto Rico Fed. Rep. 54.]\n\n After the return of service of summons upon the firm, Herbert E. Smith, signing himself 'Solicitor for defendants,' filed a 'special appearance' in the case, 'for the purpose of moving the court for the compliance on the part of the plaintiffs with the rule of court relative to nonresidents giving security for costs, and for the purpose of opposing the motion for an injunction and receiver.' On January 14, 1901, a receiver was appointed, who, however, never qualified. It was recited in the order appointing the receiver that after due notice had been given of an application for temporary injunction, the cause had been fully argued by counsel for the respective parties. Subsequently, on January 31, 1901, by written stipulation between counsel for the plaintiffs and defendants, it was agreed 'that the defendants herein may and shall have until the 20th day of February, 1901, for the purpose of demurring to, pleading to, or answering the bill of complaint of said complainants herein.' Thereafter, on February 23, 1901, a decree pro confesso was entered against all the defendants, and complainants were given leave to proceed ex parte. On June 8 following, a final decree was entered, adjudging the general and special partners in the firm of J. Fernandez & Company to be indebted to the complainants in specified amounts, canceling and annulling, as against the rights of complainant, because fraudulent and fictitious, the \n\n[216 U.S. 295, 298]\n\u00a0\n alleged indebtedness of the firm of J. Fernandez & Company to the special partners, canceling and setting aside as fraudulent the transfers made to the defendant Bolta, and adjudging that the defendants composing the firm of J. Fernandez & Company pay the amounts found due to the complainants, and that, in default of so doing, execution should issue. On January 31, 1902, an execution was issued, which was levied upon the property of the firm of Cerecedo Hermanos. Thereupon, on February 6, 1902, there was filed in the court from which the execution issued, on behalf of the members of that firm, a petition praying for leave to file a bill to review and set aside the decree theretofore entered pro confesso against them. The petition recited the presentation of the bill of review, and that document was marked as 'Tendered February 6, 1902.'\n Both in the petition and bill of review various errors asserted to be apparent on the face of the record were set out, which, from the view we take of the case, need not be here detailed.\n While, as stated, the petition for leave was filed on February 6, 1902, leave to file was not granted until June 22, 1903, on which date the court filed an opinion. 1 Porto Rico Fed. Rep. 53. The opening paragraph of the opinion is as follows:\n'This is a petition for leave to file a bill of review, which is also tendered. The decree asked to be set aside was entered June 8, 1901. This petition was presented February 6, 1902. Objection is made that it comes too late. It is claimed that the act of Congress of March 3, 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 826, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 488], relative to the United States circuit court of appeals, applies to it. The limitation for appeal, and which, by analogy, has been applied in equity to the time for filing bills of review, applicable, however, is the two years provided in  1008 of the United States Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 715 ). Clark v. Killian, \n103 U.S. 766\n, 26 L. ed. 607; Allen v. Southern P. R. Co. \n173 U.S. 479\n, 43 L. ed. 775, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 518.\n\n The court considered two of the grounds assigned in support of the petition for leave to file. One related to the jurisdiction of the court to render the decree, and was disposed \n\n[216 U.S. 295, 299]\n\u00a0\n of by the statement that all the complainants were aliens. Upon the ground, however, that the averments of the bill in the main cause did not authorize the money decree which had been rendered, it was held that, in order to prevent injustice, the 'petitioners should be allowed to file their bill of review, appear, open the decree, and make defense,' upon payment of costs to date, and the execution of a bond in the sum of $15, 000, conditioned to perform any judgment that might finally be rendered against them. On June 19, 1903, an order was entered permitting the filing of the bill of review, opening the decree in the original cause, and permitting the Cerecedos to appear therein and make defense, and ordering the return of the execution upon the giving of bond. The condition as to payment of costs and giving bond having been complied with, thereafter, on October 13, 1903, a demurrer was filed to the bill of review, and at the same time in the main cause a plea to the jurisdiction of the court was filed.\n On October 14, 1903, an amended bill of review was filed. Nearly four years afterwards, on June 1, 1907, an opinion was filed, holding that the demurrer to the bill of review and also the plea to the jurisdiction in the main case should be overruled. On the 22d of the same month an answer was filed to the bill of review, to which a reply was filed in the following month. On the same day the Cerecedos also demurred to the bill of complaint in the main cause. On April 3, 1908, the court vacated, as improvidently made, the order opening the final decree in the main cause, and suspended further proceeding therein until the determination of the question raised by the bill of review. On October 30 following, however, the court consented to a reargument of the plea to the jurisdiction in the main cause, which had been theretofore adversely ruled upon, with the result that, on February 1, 1909, the plea to the jurisdiction was sustained. A final decree was thereupon entered upon the issues made upon the bill of review, and after reciting that it appeared upon the \n\n[216 U.S. 295, 300]\n\u00a0\n face of the record in the original cause that the court was without jurisdiction to entertain the same, it was decreed as follows:\n'It is therefore hereby ordered, adjudged, and decreed that this bill to review the proceedings of this court in said original cause, be, and the same hereby is, sustained for the reason aforesaid; that the decree entered by this court on the 8th day of June, A. D. 1901, in the city of Mayaguez, in favor of complainants in said original suit, the same being as aforesaid No. 6 on the equity docket at Mayaguez, entitled Jaffe Bros. & Co. and Hinne & Co. v. J. Fernandez & Co. and Cerecedo Bros. be, and the same hereby is, vacated and annulled; and that said original bill of complaint be, and the same hereby is, dismissed without prejudice, with costs of this bill of review in favor of the complainants herein.'\n\n The cause was then appealed to this court.\n Messrs. N. B. K. Pettingill and George H. Lamar for appellants. \n\n[216 U.S. 295, 301]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Francis H. Dexter for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The assignments of error which require consideration assail the power of the court below to permit the filing of the bill of review, and also question the validity of its action in vacating the decree entered in the main cause and dismissing the bill filed therein.\n Respecting the first, the proposition is that the limit of time within which a bill of review might be filed had expired when leave was given, and that the court should have required payment of the money judgment decreed in the main cause before granting permission to file the bill of review. These contentions are untenable. True it is that, in analogy to the time allowed by law for an appeal to this court from a final decree of the district court of Porto Rico, the bill of review should have been filed in two years from June 8, 1901, the date when the final decree sought to be reviewed was entered, and the bill of review was not actually filed until June 22, 1903. But the bill was presented for filing on February 6, 1902, and it is plain that the failure of the complainants in the bill of review to actually file the same until June 22, 1903, was occasioned by the action of the court in not sooner passing upon the application for leave to file. Under such circumstances, we think the time which elapsed between the \n\n[216 U.S. 295, 302]\n\u00a0\n tendering of the bill for filing and the permission given to file should not be counted in applying the two years' limitation. Ensminger v. Powers, \n108 U.S. 292\n, 27 L. ed. 732, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 643. As respects the granting of permission to file the bill of review, the court was vested with a judicial discretion to permit such filing without a previous payment of the moneys awarded by the decree sought to be reviewed, and there was no abuse of such discretion in giving leave to file, conditioned upon the furnishing of the indemnity bond which was thereafter executed.\n As to the alleged error in vacating the decree entered in, and dismissing, the original cause.-In the court below, the allegation attacking the jurisdiction of the court over the original cause was as follows:\n'That this court did not have jurisdiction of the original cause and bill of complaint, for the reason that, according to the allegations of said bill, all the parties plaintiff were foreign subjects, and all the parties defendant were citizens of Porto Rico, there being no citizen of the United States or of a state of the United States a party defendant, and no other or sufficient ground or reason for the jurisdiction of this court is in the said original bill set forth sufficient to give this court jurisdiction of the said cause.'\n\n The bill in the main cause was filed in December, 1900. At that time the jurisdiction of the court below was fixed and limited by  34 of the act of Congress of April 12, 1900 [31 Stat. at L. 84, chap. 191], commonly known as the Foraker act, which established civil government in Porto Rico. It was provided in the section that the district court of the United States for Porto Rico 'shall have, in addition to the ordinary jurisdiction of the district courts of the United States, jurisdiction of all cases cognizant in the circuit courts of the United States, and shall proceed therein in the same manner as a circuit court.' That, in view of the parties to the controversy, the case would not have been cognizable in a circuit court of the United States, is obvious, and hence, manifestly, the court below was without jurisdiction under the act of 1900. It is urged, how- \n\n[216 U.S. 295, 303]\n\u00a0\n ever, that, as the final decree in the main cause was entered in June, 1901, although the court was clearly without jurisdiction to entertain the cause when the bill was filed, as no question as to jurisdiction had been raised, the court had power to enter the decree by virtue of the 3d section of the act of March 2, 1901 (31 Stat. at l. 953, chap. 812), reading as follows:\n'That the jurisdiction of the district court of the United States for Porto Rico in civil cases shall, in addition to that conferred by the act of April twelfth, nineteen hundred, extend to and embrace controversies where the parties, or either of them, are citizens of the United States, or citizens or subjects of a foreign state or states, wherein the matter in dispute exceeds, exclusive of interest or costs, the sum or value of one thousand dollars.'\n\n Pacific R. Co. v. Ketchum, \n101 U.S. 289\n, 25 L. ed. 932, is cited as authority for the proposition. In that case, however, not only was no objection made by the parties in the progress of the cause to the right of the court to proceed, but the decree when rendered was censented to, and the ruling was that although 'consent cannot give the courts of the United States jurisdiction, it may bind the parties and waive previous errors, if, when the court acts, jurisdiction has been obtained.' A brief consideration, however, of the circumstances in this case, demonstrates that the Ketchum Case is not in point. The last appearance of the defendants in the litigation in the main cause was on January 31, 1901, when a stipulation was made in respect to the time for pleading to the bill, and, of course, an exertion of jurisdiction by the court was neither invoked by the defendants nor consented to by them after the enactment of the amendatory statute of 1901. Under such circumstances it cannot be held that the defendants were estopped from availing of the objection of want of jurisdiction.\n The additional contention is made that the case presented by the bill in the main cause was one arising under the laws of the United States, and that because thereof jurisdiction \n\n[216 U.S. 295, 304]\n\u00a0\n existed, irrespective of the want of citizenship of the parties. The argument is that the complainants, in their bill, made reference to the provisions of an order of the military governor of Porto Rico concerning 'suspension of payments,' which, if given proper effect, would have prevented the accomplishment of the fraud which it was the object of the bill to prevent. This order, thus referred to, it is said, was, in legal effect, a law of the United States, and the reference to and reliance upon its provisions was an invoking of the jurisdiction of the court on the Federal ground that the case was one arising under the laws of the United States. In our opinion, however, there is not even color for the proposition that the bill presented a controversy arising under a law of the United States, even if the military order referred to be treated as a law of the United States. To sustain such a contention it must appear that a controversy of that nature was called to the attention of the lower court in such a way as to invoke its action thereon. In other words, after a case has been decided below, parties may not, for the purpose of a review by this court, attempt to inject a Federal question into the cause by suggesting that it would have been possible by a latitudinarian construction of the pleadings to suggest that a right under the Constitution or a law of the United Sates was relied upon. And of course, in saying this, we must not be understood as intimating that the assumed Federal question, even if it had been called to the attention of the court below, would have had sufficient substantiality to have been the basis jurisdiction.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","47":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFRANKLIN v.

C. 332, 60 S. E. 953. The case is here upon a writ of error to the supreme court of South Carolina.\n The record discloses that the homicide occurred upon the attempt of H. E. Valentine, entine, a constable, to arrest Franklin upon a charge of 'having violated and broken \n\n[218 U.S. 161, 163]\n\u00a0\n an agricultural contract,' against the form of a statute made and provided in such cases in the state of South Carolina. The statute referred to is  357 of the Criminal Code of South Carolina, which provides:\n'Any laborer working on shares of crop or for wages in money or other valuable consideration, under a verbal or written contract to labor on farm lands, who shall receive advances either in money or supplies, and thereafter wilfully, and without just cause, fail to perform the reasonable service required of him by the terms of said contract, shall be liable to prosecution for a misdemeanor, and on conviction shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than twenty days, nor more than thirty days, or to be fined in the sum of not less than $25 nor more than $ 100, in the discretion of the court: Provided, the verbal contract herein referred to shall be witnessed by at least two disinterested witnesses.'\n\n Upon the filing of the complaint before a magistrate, what is termed an arrest warrant was issued, directed to Henry E. Valentine, as special constable, commanding him to apprehend the plaintiff in error because of the alleged violation of the agricultural contract, and to bring him before the magistrate, to be dealt with according to law.\n As it becomes necessary, in considering the Federal questions raised in the record, to know the facts concerning the homicide, we take occasion to briefly summarize such as are pertinent. The testimony offered for the state and that offered for the plaintiff in error differed widely as to what occurred at the time the constable was shot. The record discloses that about the time of the attempted arrest, Valentine, the constable, summoning one Carter to assist him, about 3 o'clock on the morning of the homicide, proceeded to the farm of one Spires, who lived near to Franklin's house, and requested him to induce Franklin to go to his house, that he might be there arrested. \n\n[218 U.S. 161, 164]\n\u00a0\n Accordingly, Spires went to Franklin's, and, having aroused him, asked him to do some plowing for him. Franklin replied that he would do the plowing that afternoon, but could not work for Spires that morning. Thereupon Valentine and Carter went to Franklin's house to make the arrest. For the state the testimony tended to show that the door of Franklin's house and the inner door of his bedroom were open; that Valentine rapped with a knife on the steps of the house, and called to Franklin, and received no response; that Valentine thereupon directed Carter to go around that house, which he did, and Valentine, entering the door, was instantly shot by Franklin, and Valentine's pistol was seized and wrung from his hand; that after he was shot a colored woman came in with an axe and said that she had a good will to finish up the job; that Carter, upon hearing the pistol shots, which were fired in rapid succession, ran around the house, and was caught by the leg by Franklin's son, a small boy; that upon entering the house he, too, was shot, receiving a slight wound.\n On other hand, the accused testified that he had no acquaintance with Valentine; that he did not know that he was an officer of the law and armed with a warrant for his arrest; that he heard nothing until the door was hurled open, and Valentine said to him 'Hands up!' that he (Franklin) did not move; that Valentine shot him, inflicting a wound in his shoulder; that he fell down by his pallet, got his gun, and fired, intending to get out of the way, and did get out as fast as he could.\n In a proceeding of this kind this court has no jurisdiction to notice other errors than those which involve alleged violations of Federal rights secured by the Constitution of the United States or Federal statutes. The states have the right to administer their own laws for the prosecution of crime, and the jurisdiction of this court extends only to the reversal of such state proceedings \n\n[218 U.S. 161, 165]\n\u00a0\n where fundamental rights secured by the Federal law have been denied by the proceedings in the state courts. Rogers v. Peck, \n199 \nU.S. 425, 434\n, 50 S. L. ed. 256, 260, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 87, and cases there cited.\n We will proceed, then, to examine the errors assigned which may be fairly said to raise Federal questions reviewable here. A motion was made to quash the indictment because of the disqualification of the grand jury which returned it. The argument being that the Federal act of June 25, 1868 (15 Stat. at L. 73, chap. 70), provides that the Constitutions of certain states, including South Carolina, should never be amended or changed so as to deprive any citizen or class of citizens of the United States, of the right to vote in said state, given to them by the Constitution thereof, named in the act, except for the punishment for crimes such as are now felonies at common law, whereof they shall have been duly convicted under laws equally applicable to all the states. The necessary qualifications of voters in South Carolina at that time were defined in  2, article 8, of the Constitution of South Carolina of 1868, and were: 'Every male citizen of the United States of the age of twenty- one years and upwards, not laboring under the disabilities named in this Constitution, without distinction of race, color, or former condition, who shall be a resident of this state at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, or who shall thereafter reside in this state one year and in the county in which he offers to vote sixty days next preceding any election, shall be entitled to vote for all officers that are now or hereafter may be elected by the people, and upon all questions submitted to the electors at any elections: Provided, that no person shall be allowed to vote or hold office who is now or hereafter may be disqualified therefor by the Constitution of the United States until such disqualification shall be removed by the Congress of the United States: Provided further, that no person, while kept in any almshouse or asylum, or of unsound mind, or confined in any public \n\n[218 U.S. 161, 166]\n\u00a0\n prison, shall be allowed to vote or hold office.' These qualifications for voters were changed by the Constitution of 1895, and now are:\n'Art. 2,  4. The qualifications for suffrage shall be as follows: '( a) residence in the state for two years, in the county one year, in the polling precinct in which the elector offers to vote, four months, and the payment, six months before any election, of any poll tax then due and payable; . . . (d) Any person who shall apply for registration after January 1st, 1898, if otherwise qualified, shall be registered: Provided, that he can both read and write any section of this Constitution submitted to him by the registration officer, or can show that he owns and has paid all taxes collectible during the previous year on property in this state assessed at three hundred dollars ($300) or more.\"\n\n This change in the qualification for voters, it is said, worked a deprivation of the rights of the accused, because the qualification of grand jurors under the constitution of 1895, they being required to be electors of the state, made eligible different persons than those who were qualified to be electors under the Constitution of 1868. As to this contention, the South Carolina supreme court held that the Constitution of 1895 laid no restriction on color or previous condition to entitle one to be an elector; that the act of Congress of 1868 had no reference to the selection of jurors, and that it was inapplicable to the Constitution of the state in regard to juries.\n If it could be held that the act of Congress restricted the state of South Carolina in fixing the qualifications for suffrage, it is unnecessary to decide the point in this case, as there is nothing in the record to show that the grand jury, as actually impaneled, contained any person who was not qualified as an elector under the Constitution of 1868, nor is there anything to show that the grand jury was so made up as to prevent citizens of the race of the \n\n[218 U.S. 161, 167]\n\u00a0\n plaintiff in error from sitting thereon. There was no allegation in the motion to quash upon this ground, or offer of proof in the case to show that persons of the African race were excluded because of their race or color from serving as grand jurors in the criminal prosecution of a person of that race; therefore the case does not come within the rule laid down in Carter v. Texas, \n177 U.S. 422\n, 44 L. ed. 839, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 687; Rogers v. Alabama, \n192 U.S. 226\n, 48 L. ed. 417, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 257, and kindred cases. Moreover, if the restriction upon the right to fix qualifications for suffrage in the Federal act could have the effect contended for as to subsequent state action, there was nothing in the act to prevent the selection of grand jurors having the qualifications prescribed for electors in the Constitution of 1895, in the absence of a showing that such legislation operated to exclude citizens from such juries on account of race. Re Shibuya Jugiro, \n140 \nU.S. 297, 298\n, 35 S. L. ed. 513, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 770. In this class of cases, when the real objection is that a grand jury is so made up as to exclude persons of the race of the accused from serving in that capacity, it is essential to aver and prove such facts as establish the contention. Martin v. Texas, \n200 U.S. 316\n, 50 L. ed. 497, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 338.\n It is next contended, concerning the jury law of South Carolina, that it confers arbitrary power upon the jury commissioners in selecting jurors. Section 2 of the act of 1902 provides (p. 1066):\n'They [the jury commissioners] shall . . . prepare a list of such qualified electors under the provisions of the Constitution, between the ages of twenty-one and sixty-five years, and of good moral character, of their respective counties, as they may deem otherwise well qualified to serve as jurors, being persons of sound judgment and free from all legal exceptions, which list shall include not less than one from every three of such qualified electors,' etc.\n\n We do not think there is anything in this provision of the statute having the effect to deny rights secured by the Federal Constitution. It gives to the jury commissioners \n\n[218 U.S. 161, 168]\n\u00a0\n the right to select electors of good moral character, such as they may deem qualified to serve as jurors, being persons of sound judgment and free from all legal exceptions. There is nothing in this statute which discriminates against individuals on account of race or color or previous condition, or which subjects such persons to any other or different treatment than other electors who may be qualified to serve as jurors. The statute simply provides for an exercise of judgment in attemping to secure competent jurors of proper qualifications. Murray v. Louisiana, \n163 \nU.S. 101, 108\n, 41 S. L. ed. 87, 90, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 990; Gibson v. Mississippi, \n162 \nU.S. 565, 589\n, 40 S. L. ed. 1075, 1081, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 904.\n Under this statute, the supreme court of South Carolina held that the jury commissioners were only required to select men of good moral character, and that competent colored men were equally eligible with others for such service. We find no denial of Federal rights in this provision of the statute.\n It is next contended that the plaintiff in error was denied due process of law in the refusal of the court of continue his case when the same was called for trial. It is elementary that the matter of continuance rests in the sound discretion of the trial court, and its action in that respect is not ordinarily reviewable. It would take an extreme case to make the action of the trial court in such a case a denial of due process of law. A continuance was asked for because, it was alleged, the counsel for the accused had not had sufficient time or opportunity to examine the notes of the testimony taken before the coroner who investigated the case. The record discloses that, in support of the motion to continue, counsel for the plaintiff in error made affidavit that, two weeks before the beginning of the term, he had called upon the clerk of the court, and asked to see the testimony taken before the coroner, and that the clerk had informed him that the coroner kept his book in a room upstairs, but that the \n\n[218 U.S. 161, 169]\n\u00a0\n room was locked at the time; that the plaintiff in error's counsel thereupon made a search for the coroner, and that, failing to find his, he called upon the solicitor for the state, and asked him if he had the original testimony, and the same was handed him, which testimony was partly in shorthand, and the stenographer who took the same being out of town at the time, counsel for the accused could therefore not get a proper and intelligent reading of the testimony. Counsel for the accused further deposed that he called upon the deputy sheriff and asked him to go into the room used by the grand jury at the time, to get the coroner's book. This was on Tuesday or Wednesday of the week of the trial. He found, upon examination, that the testimony had not been copied into the coroner's book, and that therefore the counsel were not enabled to read and become familiar with the testimony 'absolutely needed for contradiction on the trial of such causes.' Counsel for the state stated in this connection that when the attorney for the accused came to his office and asked for the coroner's inquisition, he handed to him the papers in the case, telling him at the time that he did not know whether he could read them or not, because they were written in a kind of short or running hand; that he had suppressed no record in the case, and had given the counsel all the records which he had; that the record was written in a kind of running long hand; that the young man who took the testimony was out of town at the time, and that he had so stated. Upon this showing, the court declined to continue the case. Certainly there was no deprivation of due process of law in this action.\n It is next contended that the court erred in refusing to direct a verdict upon motion of the defendant's counsel at the close of the testimony, because the warrant on which the deceased attempted to arrest the plaintiff in error was null and void, because the act under which it \n\n[218 U.S. 161, 170]\n\u00a0\n was issued was unconstitutional, and this, so far as Federal questions are concerned, because it was in violation of Art. 4, and repugnant to the 13th and 14th Amendments of the Federal Constitution. Responding to this motion to direct an acquittal, the court said:\n'It is not necessary to argue that point further, even if you were to establish the fact that the warrant were null and void, or even if the man had no warrant at all, it would not be competent for the court to direct a verdict in favor of the defendant Pinkney Franklin, and the motion is refused. I will also leave it to the jury as to the guilt or innocence of the other defendant. I don't care to discuss the matter, but I do not apprehend that it is a case in which the court ought to direct a verdict in case of either of the defendants, and the motion is therefore refused.'\n\n The only Federal question raised in this connection is found in this denial of the motion to direct a verdict in favor of the accused, because the statute under which he was sought to be arrested was void under the Federal Constitution, and the warrant issued for his arrest under such unconstitutional law therefore void and of no effect. That the statute under which the proceedings were had and the warrant issued is unconstitutional was held by the supreme was in contravention of the 13th and 14th Hollman, 79 S. C. 1, 21 L.R.A.(N.S.) 242, 60 S. E. 19, 14 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 1105. In that case the court reached the conclusion that the statute in question not only violated the Constitution of the state, but was in contravention of the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and  1990 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1266), known as the peonage statute. See Clyatt v. United States, \n197 U.S. 207\n, 49 L. ed. 726, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 429.\n But an inspection of this record does not disclose that by any request to charge, or otherwise, any advantage was sought to be taken of the unconstitutionality of the act other than is found in the request for the peremptory \n\n[218 U.S. 161, 171]\n\u00a0\n instruction to acquit the accused. Even if one attempted to be arrested under process issued under a void and unconstitutional law has the right to resist arrest, even to the taking of human life (a point we do not find it necessary to decide), the case could not have been taken from the jury upon the testimony disclosed in this record. The right to make such resistance to the officer, under the circumstances here shown, must have been left to the determination of the jury, under proper instructions. In this case, if the state's testimony is to be believed, the accused, without any warning, or resorting to any other means of resistance, and after the constable had knocked for admission, shot the officer upon his entering the open door, armed with a supposed warrant of arrest. Upon this showing, the case could certainly not be taken from the jury because of any supposed right to resist with all necessary force an unlawful arrest because of the invalidity of the statute, or the warrant issued in pursuance thereof.\n It was insisted in the oral argument of this case, and an elaborate brief was filed by eminent counsel, making the contentions that the proceedings for the arrest of the accused were in violation of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, and of  1990 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, abolishing and prohibiting peonage, and declaring null and void the resolutions, regulations, and usages of any state or territory in that respect; and that they were in violation of  5526 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3715 ), punishing any person who holds, arrests, or returns, or causes to be held, arrested, or returned, or in any way aids in the arrest or return of, any person to a condition of peonage, and were in violation of the 13th Amendment. This being so, and the statute and the warrant being illegal and void, the accused, it is contended, had the right to use all reasonable force to protect his person, his liberty, and his* habi- \n\n[218 U.S. 161, 172]\n\u00a0\n tation from such unlawful arrest; and that therefore the firing of the fatal shot was only a reasonable use of force for the defense of the accused under the circumstances shown.\n But, as we have said, the only attempt to raise questions of a Federal character concerning the validity of the statute and the warrant under which it was issued, and the right to resist arrest under such warrant, was in the request for a peremptory instruction for an acquittal. Even upon the theory of his rights now advanced, he was not entitled to a peremptory instruction taking the case from the jury.\n The supreme court of South Carolina considered and overruled certain grounds of appeal, which embrace objections to the charge. But we do not find in these rulings any determination of Federal questions adverse to the plaintiff in error which would warrant a reversal of the judgment by this court. These rulings were upon questions of general law, concerning which no Federal right was asserted and denied, as is essential to enable this court to review the judgment of a state court.\n After giving this case the examination its importance deserves, in view of its gravity, we are unable to find in the record anything which worked a deprivation of Federal rights, warranting this court in disturbing the judgment of the Supreme Court of South Carolina, and the judgment is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","48":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFRANKLIN v. U S(1910)\nNo. 736\nArgued: Decided: March 14, 1910\n\n\n\n Three indictments were returned against plaintiff in error by the grand jury in the southern district of New York. In the first of said indictments he was charged with the embezzle- \n\n[216 U.S. 559, 560]\n\u00a0\n ment of certain personal property of the cadets at the United States Military Academy, upon a government reservation, to wit, the West Point Military Reservation, in the southern district of New York, in violation of  5391, Revised Statutes, as amended by the act of July 7, 1898 [30 Stat. at L. 717, chap. 576, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3652], and of  528 and 531 of the New York Penal Code.\n In the second indictment he was charged with making and presenting to an officer of the Army, for approval, false claims upon the government of the United States for supplies furnished to the cadet mess at Wast Point, in violation of  5438, Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3674); and in the third indictment, he was charged with making and presenting to an officer of the Army, for approval and for payment, a false claim upon the United States War Department, and upon the treasurer of the United States Military Academy in violation of  5438, Revised Statutes.\n Demurrers to the indictments were overruled and they were then consolidated. The first of said indictments contained six counts, in three of which plaintiff in error was charged with grand larceny in the second degree, under the New York Penal Code, and in the other three he was charged with embezzlement of the same funds, in violation of the New York Penal Code; but the first three of said counts were nolle prossed. The defendant thereupon pleaded guilty to all three of the indictments; but before judgment was pronounced, he moved in arrest of judgment, the grounds of his motion being as follows:\n'1. Because the said fourth, fifth, and sixth counts of the indictment against the said defendant for grand larceny under  2, chapter 576, act of July 7, 1898, to and of which the defendant pleaded and was found guilty, do not, nor does any one of the said counts, charge a criminal offense under the laws of the United States.\n\n'2. Because the said  2, chapter 576, of an act of Congress approved July 7, 1898, entitled, 'An Act to Protect the Harbor Defenses and Fortifications Constructed or Used by the United States from Malicious Injury, and for Other Purposes,' is unconstitutional and void. \n\n[216 U.S. 559, 561]\n\u00a0\n\n'3. Because, by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, this court here has no jurisdiction of the offense alleged to have been committed by this defendant in said fourth, fifth, and sixth counts of the said indictments, because he says the said  2, chapter 576, of the said act of Congress approved July 7, 1898, confers upon this court here no jurisdiction of this cause, nor any legal power to hear, try, and determine the same, inasmuch as the punishment for the offense alleged in said indictment, and in each and every count thereof, when committed by the treasurer of the United States Military Academy, an officer of the Army of the United States, is provided for by  1342, Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 944); and inasmuch as, by the said Constitution and laws, exclusive jurisdiction over said offense, when committed by a person subject to military jurisdiction, is vested in the properly constituted and authorized courts-martial of the United States.\n\n\n'4. Because the facts alleged in said counts under  5438, Revised Statutes of the United States, do not, as alleged in said counts, or in any one of them, charge a criminal offense against the United States.'\n\n This motion was overruled, and defendant was sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment of two and one-half years in the United States penitentiary at Atlanta; and, errors being assigned which raised the questions presented in the motion in arrest of judgment, the case was removed to this court by writ of error.\n The statutes under which said indictments were found are as follows:\n\n 1. \nSection 2 of the act of July 7, 1898 (30 Stat. at L. 717, chap. 576, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3652):\n'That when any offense is committed in any place, jurisdiction over which has been retained by the United States or ceded to it by a state, or which has been purchased with the consent of a state for the erection of a fort, magazine, arsenal, dockyard, or other needful building or structure, the punishment for which offense is not provided for by any law of the \n\n[216 U.S. 559, 562]\n\u00a0\n United States, the person committing such offense shall, upon conviction, in a circuit or district court of the United States for the district in which the offense was committed, be liable to and receive the same punishment as the laws of the state in which such place is situated now provide for the like offense when committed within the jurisdiction of such state, and the said courts are hereby vested with jurisdiction for such purpose; and no subsequent repeal of any such state law shall affect any such prosecution.'\n\n\n 2. \nSections 528 and 531 of the Penal Code of New York:\n'Sec. 528. A person who, with the intent to deprive or defraud the true owner of his property, or of the use and benefit thereof, or to appropriate the same to the use of the taker, or of any other person, either--\n\n'1. Takes from the possession of the true-owner, or of any other person; or obtains from such possession by color or aid of fraudulent or false representation or pretense, or of any false token or writing; or secretes, withholds, or appropriates to his own use, or that of any person other than the true owner, any money, personal property, thing in action, evidence of debt or contract, or article of value of any kind; or,\n\n'2. Having in his possession, custody, or control, as a bailee, servant, attorney, agent, clerk, trustee, or officer of any person, association, or corporation, or as a public officer, or as a person authorized by agreement or by competent authority, to hold or take such possession, custody, or control, any money, property, evidence of debt or contract, article of value of any nature, or thing in action or possession, appropriates the same to his own use, or that of any other person other than the true owner or person entitled to the benefit thereof, steals such property and is guilty of larceny.\n\n ... * *\n'Sec. 531. A person is guilty of grand larceny in the second degree, who, under circumstances not amounting to grand larceny in the first degree, in any manner specified in this article, steals or unlawfully obtains or appropriates: \n\n[216 U.S. 559, 563]\n\u00a0\n\n'1. Property of the value of more than $25, but not exceeding $500, in any manner whatever; or\n\n\n'2. Property of any value, by taking the same from the person of another; or\n\n'3. A record of a court or officer, or a writing, instrument, or record kept, filed, or deposited according to law, with, or in keeping of, any public office or officer.'\n\n\n 3. \nSection 5438, Revised Statutes, so far as applicable to these indictments:\n'Every person who makes or causes to be made, or presents or causes to be presented, for payment or approval, to or by any person or officer in the civil, military, or naval service of the United States, any claim upon or against the government of the United States, or any department or officer thereof, knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent, or who, for the purpose of obtaining or aiding to obtain the payment or approval of such claim, makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, any false bill, receipt, voucher, roll, account, claim, certificate, affidavit, or deposition, knowing the same to contain any fraudulent or fictitious statement or entry . . . every person so offending in any of the matters set forth in this section shall be imprisoned at hard labor for not less than one nor more than five years, or fined not less than one thousand nor more than five thousand dollars.'\n\n Messrs. Holmes Conrad and S. T. Ansell for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[216 U.S. 559, 565]\n\u00a0\n Solicitor General Bowers for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller: \n\n[216 U.S. 559, 566]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a writ of error brought directly to this court from the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York, and the grounds upon which it is rested appear to be--\n First. That under the 62d article of war,  1342, Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 957), which reads: \n\n[216 U.S. 559, 567]\n\u00a0\n 'All crimes not capital, and all disorders and neglects, which officers and soldiers may be guilty of, to the prejudice of good order and military discipline, though not mentioned in the foregoing articles of war, are to be taken cognizance of by a general or a regimental, garrison, or field officers' court-martial, according to the nature and degree of the offense, and punished at the discretion of such court,' a court-martial has exclusive jurisdiction of the offenses charged herein, inasmuch as plaintiff in error was an officer of the United States Army; and\n Second. That the case involved the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States, and that the constitutionality of a law of the United States was drawn in question because, as is alleged,  2 of the act of July 7, 1898, is unconstitutional, in that it undertakes to delegate the power of legislation to the state legislatures.\n\n 1. \nIt is well settled that the 62d article of war does not vest, nor purport to vest, exclusive jurisdiction in courts-martial, and that civil courts have concurrent jurisdiction over all offenses committed by a military officer which may be punished by a court-martial under the provisions of that article.\n The 30th section of the act of March 3, 1863 (12 Stat. at L. 736, chap. 75, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 955), provided that in time of war, insurrection, or rebellion certain offenses, including murder, 'shall be punishable by the sentence of a general court-martial or military commission, when committed by persons who are in the military service of the United States, and subject to the articles of war; and the punishments for such offenses shall never be less than those inflicted by the laws of the state, territory, or district in which they may have been committed.'\n In Coleman v. Tennessee, \n97 U.S. 509\n, 24 L. ed. 1118, it was held that this statute did not confer upon courts-martial exclusive jurisdiction for the trial of the offenses mentioned.\n In Grafton v. United States, \n206 \nU.S. 333, 348\n, 51 S. L. ed. 1084, 1089, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 749, 11 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 640, it was expressly declared that the jurisdiction of courts-martial is not \n\n[216 U.S. 559, 568]\n\u00a0\n exclusive. Undoubtedly the general rule is that the jurisdiction of civil courts is concurrent as to offenses triable before courts-martial. See opinion of Attorney General Cushing, 6 Ops. Atty. Gen. 413, 419; United States v. Clark, 31 Fed. 710.\n And in the present case the language of article 62 and that of  5438, Revised Statutes, and of  2 of the act of July 7, 1898, demonstrates that it was the intention of Congress that offenses committed in violation of the latter statute should be punished by the civil courts; to say nothing of the fact that it was expressly provided in  2 and prior laws, that conviction should be 'in a circuit or district court of the United States in which the offense was committed.'\n There is absolutely nothing in the first proposition.\n\n 2. \nThis is equally so of the intimated constitutional point.\n By  3 of the act of March 3, 1825 (4 Stat. at L. 115, chap. 65, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3651), it was provided:\n'That, if any offense shall be committed in any of the places aforesaid, the punishment of which offense is not specially provided for by any law of the United States, such offense shall, upon a conviction in any court of the United States having cognizance thereof, be liable to, and receive, the same punishment as the laws of the state in which such fort, dockyard, navy yard, arsenal, armory, or magazine, or other place, ceded as aforesaid, is situated provide for the like offense when committed within the body of any county of such state.'\n\n In United States v. Paul, 6 Pet. 141, 142, 8 L. ed. 348, 349, coming here on certificate of division, it was held by this court, speaking by Chief Justice Marshall, that the effect of this section was 'limited to the laws of the several states in force at the time of its enactment;' and it followed that by this act Congress adopted for the government of the designated places, under the exclusive jurisdiction and control of the United States, the criminal laws then existing in the several states within which such places were situated, in so far as said laws were not displaced by specific laws enacted by Congress.\n Section 2 of the act of July 7, 1898, was \n\n[216 U.S. 559, 569]\n\u00a0\n to the same effect, and moreover, by express language, Congress adopted such punishment as 'the laws of the state in which such place is situated now provide for the like offense.' There is, plainly, no delegation to the states of authority in any way to change the criminal laws applicable to places over which the United States has jurisdiction.\n We give below the legislation on the subject. \n On March 3, 1825, Congress passed:\n Chap. 65. An Act More Effectually to Provide for the Punishment of Certain Crimes against the United States, and for Other Purposes.\n Sec. 3. . . . That, if any offense shall be committed in any of the places aforesaid, the punishment of which offense is not specially provided for by any law of the United States, such offense shall, upon a conviction in any court of the United States having cognizance thereof, be liable to, and receive, the same punishment as the laws of the state in which such fort, dockyard, navy yard, arsenal, armory, or magazine, or other place, ceded as aforesaid, is situated, provided for the like offense when committed within the body of any county of such state. (4 Stat. at L. p. 115, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3651, approved March 3, 1825.)\n In 1866, Congress enacted the following:\n Chap. 24. An Act More Effectually to Provide for the Punishment of Certain Crimes against the United States.\n Sec. 2. . . . That if any offense shall be committed in any place which has been, or shall hereafter be, ceded to and under the jurisdiction of the United States, which offense is not prohibited, or the punishment thereof is not specially provided for, by any law of the United States, such offense shall, upon conviction in any court of the United States having cognizance thereof, be liable to, and receive, the same punishment as the laws of the state in which such place is or may be situated, now in force, provide for the like offense when committed within the jurisdiction of such state; and no subsequent repeal of any such state law shall affect any prosecution for such offense in any of the courts of the United States . (14 Stat. at L. p. 13, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3651, approved April 5, 1866.)\n This act was carried forward as  5391 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3651), as follows:\n'Sec. 5391: If any offense be committed in any place which has been or may hereafter be ceded to and under the jurisdiction of the United States, which offense is not prohibited, or the punishment thereof is not specially provided for, by any law of the United States, such offense shall be liable to, and receive, the same punishment as the laws of the state in which such place is situated, now in force, provide for the like offense when committed within the jurisdiction of such state; and no subsequent repeal of any such state law shall affect any prosecution for such offense in any court of the United States.'\n\n The act of July 7, 1898, upon the same subject, reads: \n\n[216 U.S. 559, 570]\n\u00a0\n We are of opinion that the points attempted to be raised to justify jurisdiction are so unfounded in substance as to utterly fail of their purpose.\n Writ of error dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\nFootnotes\n 'Sec. 2. That when any offense is committed in any place jurisdiction over which has been retained by the United States or ceded to it by a state, or which has been purchased with the consent of a state for the erection of a fort, magazine, arsenal, dockyard, or other needful building or structure, the punishment for which offense is not provided for by any law of the United States, the person committing such offense shall, upon conviction in a circuit or district court of the United States for the district in which the offense was committed, be liable to, and receive, the same punishment as the laws of the state in which such place is situated now provide for the like offense when committed within the jurisdiction of such state, and the said courts are hereby vested with jurisdiction for such purpose; and no subsequent repeal of any such state law shall affect any such prosecution.'\n This section appears in the act of Congress approved March 4, 1909, modifying, amending, and revising the penal laws of the United States, to become effective January 1, 1910, as follows:\n'Sec. 289. Whoever, within the territorial limits of any state, organized territory, or district, but within or upon any of the places now existing or hereafter reserved or acquired, described in section two hundred and seventy-two of this act, shall do or omit the doing of any act or thing which is not made penal by any law of Congress, but which, if committed or omitted within the jurisdiction of the state, territory, or district in which such place is situated, by the laws thereof now in force would be penal, shall be deemed guilty of a like offense and be subject to a like punishment; and every such state, territorial, or district law shall, for the purposes of this section, continue in force, notwithstanding any subsequent repeal or amendment thereof by any such state, territory, or district.'

Kincaid, and Evans Browne for plaintiff in error.\n Assistant Attorney General Fowler for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a writ of error to the supreme court of the Philippine Islands, seeking to reverse a judgment of that court affirming a conviction of the plaintiff in error of the crime of estafa (embezzlement), growing out of the alleged misappropriation of some 3,500 pesos received by him as manager of the steamship department of Castle Brothers, Wolf & Sons. The sentence of the court of first instance was as follows:\n'The court therefore finds the defendant, Otis G. Freeman, guilty of embezzlement of the sum of p3,500, Phil- \n\n[217 U.S. 539, 541]\n\u00a0\n ippines currency, as charged in the complaint, the property of Castle Brothers, Wolf & Sons, and does sentence him to imprisonment, presidio correctional, in the insular prison of Bilibid, for the period of one year and nine months, and to restore to said Castle Brothers, Wolf & Sons the sum of p3,500, Philippines currency, or in lieu thereof to suffer subsidiary imprisonment for the period of seven months, and to pay the costs of prosecution.'\n\n Upon appeal to the supreme court of the Philippine Islands, that court, after reviewing the testimony, said:\n'This finding, of course, will in no way estop the said firm of Castle Brothers, Wolf & Sons from recovering in a civil action from the defendant any sum or sums in excess of this amount which are found to be due to the said firm. The only [charge] change which this finding makes in the conclusion of the lower court is in the amount of money which must be returned to the firm of Castle Brothers, Wolf & Sons by virtue of this sentence.\n\n'It is the judgment of this court that the sentence of the lower court be affirmed with this modification, and that the defendant be sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of one year and nine months of presidio correccional, and to restore to Castle Brothers, Wolf & Sons the sum of p2,078.50, or, in lieu thereof, to suffer subsidiary imprisonment for a period not to exceed one third of the principal penalty, and to pay the costs.' [9 Philippine, 176, 177.]\n\n The statute of the Philippine Islands defining the crime is article 535 of the Philippine Code:\n'(1) Philippine Penal Code, article 535:\n\n'The following shall incur the penalties of the preceding articles:\n\n ... * *\n'5. Those who, to the prejudice of another, shall appropriate or misapply any money, goods, or any kind of personal property which they may have received as a deposit on commission for administration or in any other* \n\n[217 U.S. 539, 542]\n\u00a0\n character producing the obligation to deliver or return the same, or who shall deny having received it.'\n\n Other pertinent articles of the Philippine Code are as follows:\n'(2) Philippine Penal Code, article 534:\n\n'A person who shall defraud another in the substance, quantity, or quality of things he may deliver to him, by virtue of an obligation, shall be punished--\n\n ... * *\n'2. With that [the penalty] of arresto mayor in its medium degree to presidio correccional in its minimum degree, if it should exceed 250 pesetas and not be more than 6,250 pesetas.\n\n'(3) Philippine Penal Code, article 28:\n\n ... * *\n'Those [penalties] of presidio correccional and prision correccional shall last from six months and one day to six years.\n\n ... * *\n'That of arresto mayor shall last from one month and one day to six months.\n\n'(4) Philippine Penal Code, article 49:\n\n'In case the property of the person punished should not be sufficient to cover all the pecuniary liabilities, they shall be satisfied in the following order:\n\n'1. Reparation of the injury caused and indemnification of damages.\n\n'2. Indemnification to the state for the amount of stamped paper and other expenses which may have been incurred on his account in the cause.\n\n'3. The costs of the private accuser.\n\n'4. Other costs of procedure, including those of the defense of the person prosecuted, without preference among the persons interested.\n\n'5. The fine.\n\n'Should the crime have been of those which can be \n\n[217 U.S. 539, 543]\n\u00a0\n prosecuted only at the instance of a party, the costs of the private accuser shall be satisfied in preference to the indemnification to the state.\n\n'(5) Philippine Penal Code, article 50:\n\n'If the person sentenced should not have property to satisfy the pecuniary liabilities included in Nos. 1, 3, and 5 of the preceding article, he shall be subject to a subsidiary personal liability at the rate of one day for every 12 1\/2 pesetas, according to the following rules:\n\n'1. If the principal penalty imposed is to be undergone by the criminal confined in a penal institution, he shall continue therein, although said detention cannot exceed one third of the term of the sentence, and in no case can it exceed one year.\n\n ... * *\n'(6) Philippine Penal Code, article 52:\n\n'The personal liability which the criminal may have incurred by reason of insolvency shall not exempt him from the reparation of the injury caused and indemnification of damages if him pecuniary circumstances should improve; but it shall exempt him from the other pecuniary liabilities included in Nos. 3 and 5 of article 49.'\n\n It is the contention of the plaintiff in error that the judgment of the supreme court of the Philippine Islands should be reversed for two reasons: first, because the judgment was, in substance and effect, an imprisonment for debt; second, because the court should have dismissed the case without prejudice to the right to institute a civil action for the rendition of accounts.\n As to the first contention, that the judgment and sentence amounted to imprisonment for debt: The act of July 1, 1902, providing for the administration of the affairs of the civil government of the Philippine Islands (32 Stat. at L. 691, chap. 1369), provides, among other things, in  5 thereof, 'that no person shall be imprisoned for debt.' This provision was carried to the Philippine Islands in the \n\n[217 U.S. 539, 544]\n\u00a0\n statute quoted with a well-known meaning, as understood when thus adopted into the Bill of Rights for the government of the Philippines, and must be so interpreted and enforced. Kepner v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 100, 124\n, 49 S. L. ed. 114, 122, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 797, 1 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 655.\n Statutes relieving from imprisonment for debt were not intended to take away the right to enforce criminal statutes and punish wrongful embezzlements or conversions of money. It was not the purpose of this class of legislation to interfere with the enforcement of such penal statutes, although it provides for the payment of money as a penalty for the commission of an offense. Such laws are rather intended to prevent the commitment of debtors to prison for liabilities arising upon their contracts. McCool v. State, 23 Ind. 129; Musser v. Stewart, 21 Ohio St. 353; Ex parte Cottrell, 13 Neb. 193, 13 N. W. 174; Re Ebenhack, 17 Kan. 618, 622.\n This general principle does not seem to be controverted by the learned counsel for the plaintiff in error, and the argument is, that inasmuch as the money adjudged is to go to the creditor, and not into the public treasury, imprisonment for the nonpayment of such sum is an imprisonment for debt. But we think that an examination of the statutes of the Philippines and the judgment of the supreme court shows that the imposition of the money penalty was by way of punishment for the offense committed, and not a requirement to satisfy a debt contractual in its nature, or be imprisoned in default of payment.\n Section 5, article 535, of the Penal Code, provides that those who, to the prejudice of another, shall appropriate or misapply any money, goods, or any kind of personal property which they may have received as a deposit on commission for administration, or in any other character producing the obligation to deliver or return the same, or who shall deny having received it, shall incur certain \n\n[217 U.S. 539, 545]\n\u00a0\n penalties. As a further means of punishing the act done in violation of the statute, he may, under the Philippine Code, be made to suffer a subsidiary imprisonment for a term not to exceed one third of the principal penalty in the lieu of the restoration of the sum found to be embezzled. The sentence of the supreme court of the Philippine Islands, including the imprisonment in lieu of the payment of the sum found due, was because of the conviction for the violation of this statute; in other words, the money payment was part of the punishment, and was not imposed as an imprisonment for nonpayment of the debt, regardless of the criminal offense committed. The sentence and each part of it was imposed because of the conviction of the defendant of the criminal offense charged.\n This situation is not changed because the sentence provides for a release from the subsidiary imprisonment upon payment of the money wrongfully converted. The sentence imposed, nevertheless, includes the requirement to pay money because of the conviction of the offense. The requirement that there shall be no imprisonment for debt was intended to prevent the resort to that remedy for the collection of contract debts, and not to prevent the state from imposing a sentence for crime which should require the restoration of the sum of money wrongfully converted in violation of a criminal statute. The nonpayment of the money is a condition upon which the punishment is imposed. State v. Nicholson, 67 Md. 1, 8 Atl. 817.\n We do not think that the sentence and judgment violated the statute providing that no person shall be imprisoned for debt.\n As to the second objection, that the court should have dismissed the cause without prejudice to the right of instituting a civil action, the argument seems to be that this should be so because the payment of the money adjudged, or suffering the 'subsidiary imprisonment' im- \n\n[217 U.S. 539, 546]\n\u00a0\n posed, would not, as the supreme court adjudged, bar the creditor from a civil action to recover any sum which he might prove to be due in excess of the judgment rendered in the present case. 'In other words,' says the learned counsel, 'imprisonment will satisfy (and therefore discharge) the judgment here rendered, leaving another and wholly civil action open to the complainants, to recover any additional sum arising out of the same cause of action.' This possibility is said to be so wholly unjust that it ought not to be permitted to exist in any country subject to American jurisdiction. But we fail to appreciate the weight of this argument. We see no reason why the court may not, for the purpose of the criminal proceedings, find the amount wrongfully converted by the defendant for the purpose of fixing the sentence in this case, leaving the firm defrauded to recover in a civil action any sum or sums in excess of that amount which may be found due and remain unpaid to them. We are unable to perceive in this action such violation of the fundamental principles of justice as required the dismissal of the criminal action, leaving the parties complaining to the remedies of a civil suit.\n We find no error in the judgment of the court below, and the same is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","50":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFRIDAY v. HALL & KAUL CO(1910)\nNo. 68\nArgued: January 10, 1910Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 449, 450]\n\u00a0\n The Monongahela Construction Company, a corporation organized under the law of Pennsylvania, was, in an involuntary proceeding, adjudged a bankrupt in the district court for the western district of Pennsylvania. Upon a petition for review, filed by a judgment creditor, the adjudication was set aside upon the ground that the construction company was not 'a corporation engaged principally in manufacturing,' as found by the bankrupt court. The opinion of the circuit court of appeals is reported in 87 C. C. A. 23, 158 Fed. 593.\n From the agreed statement of facts it appears:\n 1st. That the Monongahela Construction Company's charter sets out that it was organized 'for the purpose of constructing, erecting, and repairing railroads, traction lines, duly incorporated, and streets, roads, buildings, structures, works or improvements of public or private use or utility.'\n 2d. That its principal business had been 'making and constructing arches, walls, and abutments, bridges, buildings, etc., out of concrete.'\n 3d. That, 'in carrying on its business, it buys and combines together raw materials, such as cement, gravel, and sand in the making of concrete, and supplies labor, machinery, and appliances necessary for the proper carrying on of said business, of constructing and erecting concrete arches, piers, buildings, and structures, and excavating therefor at such time and place as its contracts call for.'\n 4th. It has no permanent shop or factory, but has a warehouse. \n\n[216 U.S. 449, 451]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Alexander J. Barron and Richard A. Ford for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 449, 452]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George l. roberts and Eugene H. Baird for respondent.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Lurton: \n\n[216 U.S. 449, 453]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Lurton, after stating the facts as above, delivered the opinion of the court:\n Section 4 of the bankrupt act, as amended by the act of February 5, 1930 [32 Stat. at L. 797, chap. 487, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 1309 ], reads thus:\n'Any natural person, except a wage earner, or a person engaged chiefly in farming or the tillage of the soil, any unincorporated company, and any corporation engaged principally in manufacturing, trading, printing, publishing, mining or mercantile pursuits, owing debts to the amount of one thousand dollars or over, may be adjudged an involuntary bankrupt upon default or an impartial trial, and shall be subject to the provisions and entitled to the benefits of this act. Private bankers, but not national banks or banks incorporated under state or territorial laws, may be adjudged involuntary bankrupts.'\n\n The single question is whether the Monongahela Construction Company, upon the facts stated above, was a corporation principally engaged in the business of 'manufacturing,' within the meaning of the act. If it was, the adjudication should stand.\n The corporate powers of the company were very broad. It \n\n[216 U.S. 449, 454]\n\u00a0\n is possible that it might have so limited its functions as not to have come under any reasonable definition of manufacturing; but at last the question of whether it was principally engaged in manufacturing must turn more upon what it was actually doing than upon what it was authorized to do.\n It must be conceded that the word 'manufacturing,' as used in the bankrupt act, has no definite legislative meaning by reason of adoption from other bankrupt acts, as is the case with the words 'trader' or 'trading,' and perhaps other words with wellunderstood common-law meanings.\n Though British bankrupt acts were in existence from the time of Henry VIII.; they applied only to 'traders' until 1860, when they were extended to other persons. Our own original act, that of 1800 [2 Stat. at L. 19, chap. 19], applied only to traders, bankers, brokers, and underwriters. The act of 1841 [5 Stat. at L. 440, chap. 9] added 'merchants.' The act of 1867 [14 Stat. at L. 517, chap. 176] extended practically to all persons and corporations. That of 1898 [30 Stat. at L. 544, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3418] limited the wide application of the act of 1867 to the class of business coporations enumerated. Thus it is that the words 'manufacture' and 'manufacturing' have no meaning derived from adjudications of any former law.\n Undoubtedly Congress intended that that class of business corporations engaged in any class of manufacturing, as its principal business, and not as a mere minor incident to some larger work, should be subject to the law; and this intention should be regarded by giving to doubtful words and terms a liberal rather than a narrow meaning. 'Manufacturing' has no technical meaning. It is not limited by the means used in making, nor by the kind of product produced. In Kidd v. Pearson, \n128 \nU.S. 1, 20\n, 32 S. L. ed. 346, 350, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 232, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 6, Mr. Justice Lamar said that 'manufacture is transformation,-the fashioning of raw materials into a change of form for use.'\n In Tide Water Oil Co. v. United States, \n171 \nU.S. 210, 216\n, 43 S. L. ed. 139, 140, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 837, Mr. Justice Brown, referring to the expansion of the meaning of the word 'manufacture,' said that 'the word is now ordinarily used to denote an article upon the material of which labor has been expended to make the finished product.' \n\n[216 U.S. 449, 455]\n\u00a0\n Concrete is an artificial stone. It is a product resulting from a combination of sand or gravel or broken bits of limestone, with water and cement; a combination which requires ordinarily the use of both skill and machinery. It is not denied that if concrete in a shape adapted to use and in finished form is supplied to others for the making of a house, bridge, pier, arch, or abutment, that the corporation making such blocks or shapes would be, in the most narrow sense, one engaged in manufacture. But it is urged that this corporation made these blocks or shapes at the place where used; and that, as finished, they became a part of a principal structure and affixed to the realty; and that therefore they were not engaged in manufacturing, which, say counsel, is a business confined to those who make articles which may be 'transported and sold at some other place than that where made.'\n The production of concrete arches or piers or abutments is the result of successive steps. The combination of raw material-the sand, the limestone, the cement, and the water-produced a product which undoubtedly was 'manufactured.' This concrete had then to be given shape. That required the manufacture of moulds, which remain in place until hardening occurs. If the concrete is reinforced, as is the case where great strength is required, then the adjustment of the bars of steel within the moulds was another step. Do all of these steps, each a step in 'manufacturing,' cease to be 'manufacturing' because the moulds into which the concrete is poured, when in a fluid state, are upon the spot where the finished product is to remain? That the operation of making and shaping the concrete is done at the place used seems rather a matter of convenience, due to the quick hardening in moulds and difficulties of transportation. But, as we may take notice, the operation which, in the end, is to produce an arch or abutment or pier or house, is not necessarily a single operation, but one of successive repetitions of the process. The business is not identical with that of a mere builder or constructor who puts together the brick or stone or wood or \n\n[216 U.S. 449, 456]\n\u00a0\n iron, as finished by another. If the builder made his brick, shaped his timbers, and joined them all together, he would plainly be a manufacturer as well as a builder; and if the former was the principal part of the business, he would be within the definition of the bankrupt act. To say that one who makes, and then gives form and shape to the product made, is not engaged in manufacturing because he makes his product and gives it form and shape in the place where it is to remain, is too narrow a construction.\n In a case styled Re First Nat. Bank, 81 C. C. A. 260, 152 Fed. 64, 11 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 355, the circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit, in an opinion by Sanborn, Circuit Judge, sustained an adjudication of bankruptcy against a precisely similar corporation.\n In Columbia Ironworks v. National Lead Co. 64 L.R.A. 645, 63 C. C. A. 99, 127 Fed. 99, the sixth circuit court of appeals adjudged that a corporation engaged principally in the business of building and repairing large steel ships for sale and upon order, who prepared and gave shape to much of the raw material, was engaged in manufacturing.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed and that of the District Court affirmed. \n\n\n\n","51":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGREAT NORTHERN RY. CO. v. STATE OF MINNESOTA(1910)\nNo. 359\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 206, 207]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William R. Begg for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 206, 211]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George T. Simpson and George W. Peterson for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n This suit by the state of Minnesota against the Great North- \n\n[216 U.S. 206, 212]\n\u00a0\n ern Railway Company, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of that state, has for its object to recover the balance alleged to be due the state on account of taxes from the railway company, under a statute known as chapter 253 of the General Laws of Minnesota of 1903\n\n\n The controlling question in the case relates to the constitutionality of certain sections of that statute, as follows: ' 1. Every railroad company owning or operating any line of railway situated within or partly within this state shall, during the year 1905, and annually thereafter, pay into the treasury of this state, in lieu of all taxes and assessments upon all property within this state, owned and operated for railway purposes by such company, including the equipment, appurtenances, appendages, and franchises thereof, a sum of money equal to 4 per cent of the gross earnings derived from the operation of such line of railway within this state; and the annual payment of such sum shall be in full and in lieu of all other taxes and assessments upon the property and franchises so taxed. The lands acquired by public grants shall be and remain exempt from taxation until sold or contracted to be sold or conveyed, as provided in the respective acts whereby such grants were made or recognized.  2. The term 'gross earnings derived from the operation of such line of railway within this state,' as used in  1 of this act, is hereby declared and shall be construed to mean all earnings on business beginning and ending within the state, and a proportion based upon the proportion of the mileage within the state to the entire mileage over which such business is done of earnings on all interstate business passing through, into, or out of the state.' Minn. Gen. Laws 1903, chap. 253, p. 375.\n The effect of the statute, Minnesota asserts, was to place the Great Northern Railway Company, as to rates, on the same basis of taxation as other railroads in the state. But the company contended in the courts below, and contends here, that the requirement to pay for 1905 and annually thereafter 4 per cent of the gross earnings derived from the operation \n\n[216 U.S. 206, 213]\n\u00a0\n of its railroad within the state was in violation of a statute enacted May 22d, 1857, by the territory of Minnesota, incorporating the Minnesota & Pacific Railroad Company, and which fixed 3 per centum of the gross earnings of that company's railroad property as a tax in lieu of all taxes and assessments whatever. Minn. Sess. Laws 1857, Extra Sess.  1, 4, 8. The provisions in the latter statute, it is alleged, constituted a contract with that company (the remote predecessor of the defendant company), which was protected, in favor of the latter by the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States, as well as by the clause of the 14th Amendment, forbidding the deprivation of property without due process of law. All this was disputed by the state.\n The gross earnings of the company during 1905 were, it is conceded, $ 18,540,396.27, 4 per cent of which, $741,615.85, the state demanded under the act of 1903. The company paid $620,878.47 on account of gross earnings for 1905, and refused to pay more. For the difference, $120,737.38, with interest, the state claimed judgment. The railway company admitted its liability to pay 4 per cent on the gross earnings derived from certain lines operated by it in 1905, but denied liability in excess of 3 per cent on the gross earnings derived, during the same period, from certain other lines. It insisted that the sum paid by it before being sued herein was all that could be legally demanded by the state for the year 1905.\n The trial court made certain findings of fact and announced certain conclusions of law that were not satisfactory to either party. But it was stipulated that, on the basis of those findings and conclusions, the state would be entitled to a judgment for $32,285.94, with interest from July 11th, 1908, and costs; and for that sum judgment was given by the trial court against the railway company. Each party prosecuted an appeal to the supreme court of Minnesota. That court sustained the state's appeal, and reversed the judgment, with directions to enter judgment in favor of the state for the entire amount it had \n\n[216 U.S. 206, 214]\n\u00a0\n sued for,-$120,737.88, with interest. 106 Minn. 303, 119 N. W. 202. Hence this writ of error by the railway company.\n It is necessary to a clear understanding of the question of contract, as well as the objections raised against the act of 1903, that we state certain facts in the history of the taxation of railroad property in Minnesota.\n By an act approved February 26th, 1857, Congress authorized the people of the territory of Minnesota to form a constitution preparatory to its admission into the Union as a state on an equal footing with the original states. 11 Stat. at L. 166, chap. 60. And by an act passed March 3d, 1857, it made a grant of lands to the territory to aid in the construction of railroads between certain points, with branches between certain other points, and provided that the lands so granted should be subject to the future disposal by the legislature of the territory or future state for the purposes expressed by Congress, and no other. 11 Stat. at L. 196, chap. 99,  1, 3.\n In execution of the trust created by that act of Congress, the legislative assembly of the territory, by the above act of May 22d, 1857, incorporated the Minnesota & Pacific Railroad Company, investing it with all the powers, privileges, franchises, and immunities incident to a corporation, and empowering it to survey, locate, construct, maintain, and operate a railroad with one or more tracks or lines between certain named places; to which end it was authorized to enter upon and appropriate lands belonging to the territory or future state, not exceeding a prescribed width throughout the entire length of its railroad. Minn. Sess. Laws 1857, Extra Sess. p. 1,  1, 4, 18.\n The 18th section of the latter act constitutes an important feature in this case. So much of that section as is material in determining this case is as follows: 'In consideration of the grants, privileges, and franchises herein conferred on the said Minnesota & Pacific Railroad Company, the said company shall and will, on or before the 1st day of March in each year, \n\n[216 U.S. 206, 215]\n\u00a0\n pay into the treasury of the territory or future state, 3 per centum of the gross earnings of the said railroad, for the year ending on the last day of the preceding December, in lieu of all taxes and assessments whatever, . . . and for securing to the territory or state the payment of the aforesaid per centum it is hereby declared that the state shall have a lien upon the railroads of the said company, and upon all other property, estate, and effects of the said company, whether real, personal, or mixed, and the lien hereby secured shall take and have precedence of all demands, decrees, and judgments against the said company. The first payment shall be made on the 1st day of March next after 50 miles of said railroad shall be completed, and such payment shall be in lieu of all taxes and in full of all claims of the territory or state for the grant hereby made; and, in consideration of such annual payments, the said company shall be forever exempt from all assessments and taxes whatever by the territory, or state which shall succeed the territory, or by any county, city, town, village, or other municipal authority in the territory or state, upon all stock in the said 'Minnesota & Pacific Railroad Company,' whether belonging to said company or to individuals, and upon all its franchises or estate, real, personal, or mixed, held by said company, and said land granted by said act of Congress hereby authorized to be conveyed to the said Minnesota & Pacific Railroad Company shall be exempt from all taxation till sold and conveyed by said company.' This act, it must be remembered, was passed before Minnesota became a state.\n By an act approved May 11th, 1858, Minnesota was admitted into the Union as a state, with the Constitution it had adopted by popular vote on the 13th of October previous (11 Stat. at L. 285, chap. 31); which Constitution provided that all taxes to be raised in the state 'shall be as nearly equal as may be, and all property on which taxes are to be levied shall have a cash valuation and be equalized and uniform throughout the state.' Another section in the same article required that \n\n[216 U.S. 206, 216]\n\u00a0\n 'laws shall be passed taxing all moneys, credits, investments in bonds, stocks, joint stock companies, or otherwise, and also all real and personal property, according to its true value in money;' also, that certain specified kinds of property, devoted to charitable and public uses, 'shall, by general laws, be exempt from taxation.' Art. 9,  1, 3. But railroad property was not included in such exemptions; therefore, after the state Constitution went into operation, railroad property-if no inviolable contract controlled the matter-was taxable in Minnesota only on the basis fixed in that instrument.\n On the 23d of June, 1860, there was a foreclosure of two mortgages ( the principal one having been executed July 31st, 1858, and a supplementary one executed November 27th, 1858) which the Minnesota & Pacific Railroad Company, under the authority of an act of the legislature, had given to secure moneys borrowed by it as well as certain bonds it had issued. Those mortgages covered the company's line and all its property and franchises. Their validity is not questioned in this case. The state, being the highest and best bidder at the foreclosure sale, became the purchaser on the 23d of June, 1860, and by that purchase, the supreme court of Minnesota has said, 'the state became vested with all the railroad properties, and, no redemption being made, the company became wholly devested of its rights.'\n Subsequently, on March 8th, 1861, the legislature passed an act entitled, 'An Act to Facilitate the Construction of the Minnesota & Pacific Railroad,' which provided 'that the road, lands, property, rights, franchises, privileges, and immunities belonging or pertaining to the Minnesota & Pacific Railroad Company, prior to the sale and purchase thereof by the governor on the 23d day of June, 1860, on behalf of the state, and now claimed or held by the state, and all bonds and securities of the said company, held by the state, shall be and are hereby released, discharged, and restored to the said company free of all liens or claims thereon held by or \n\n[216 U.S. 206, 217]\n\u00a0\n in behalf of the state.'  1. The act named certain conditions to be performed by the company in respect of the proposed railroad, and, if they were not performed by the time specified, then all the rights and benefits conferred upon said company 'shall be forfeited to the state absolutely, without any further act or ceremony whatever.' Minn. Laws 1861, chap. 5, p. 235. The company having failed wholly to comply with the conditions prescribed, all the rights, privileges, franchises, and immunities granted to it by the last-named act were resumed by and reinvested in the state.\n Thereafter, by an act of March 10th, 1862, the legislature, with a view of facilitating the construction of the Minnesota & Pacific Railroad, and of amending and continuing the act of incorporation relating thereto, granted to certain named parties under the corporate name of the St. Paul & Pacific Railroad Company 'all the rights, privileges, property, franchises, and interests' granted by the territory of Minnesota to the Minnesota & Pacific Railroad Company by the above act of May 22d, 1857, 'with all the immunities, rights, property, benefits, and privileges which the said Minnesota & Pacific Railroad Company had, or might or could have, by reason of the passage of said act, free and clear of all liens thereon, and free from all liens and claims of the state of Minnesota against the same, except such as are retained by the provisions of this act.' Minn. Special Laws 1862, chap. 20.\n We take from the opinion of the supreme court of the state this additional statement of facts: 'By chapter 3, p. 174, Sp. Laws 1864, the St. Paul & Pacific Company was authorized to issue one or more classes of preferred stock, and to enter into agreements or contracts with the holders thereof for the administration of the portion of the road to which the stock might pertain, and for the independent organization by such holders to enable them separately or in conjunction with the general directors of the road to exercise supervision and control of their separate portion of the road. Under this act, preferred stock was duly issued, and \n\n[216 U.S. 206, 218]\n\u00a0\n the holders thereof, acting under the statute just referred to, organized and incorporated the First Division of the St. Paul & Pacific Railroad Company, which company, through its officers, thereafter cooperated with the St. Paul & Pacific Company in the construction of the road. The act incorporating the latter-named company contained no express reference to the rate or system of taxation to be imposed upon the company, but it is claimed that all the provisions on this subject contained in the old Minnesota & Pacific Company's charter passed by the terms of the act incorporating it, and were included within the designation of 'rights, privileges, and immunities.' However, by chapter 6, p. 40, Sp. Laws 1865, an act to facilitate the completion of the St. Paul & Pacific Railroad and branches [March 2d, 1865], the legislature imposed a different rate of taxation than that contained in the Minnesota & Pacific Company's charter, in this: that by this act the company was required to pay during the first three years after 30 miles of its road had been completed, 1 per cent of its gross earnings, 2 per cent during the succeeding seven years, and thereafter 3 per cent. The act also contained a provision that the lands of the company should be subject to taxation as soon as sold, leased, or contracted to be sold or leased. The St. Paul & Pacific Company formally accepted this act, and the First Division Company thereafter complied with its terms and provisions by paying the rate of taxation thereby imposed. The organization of the First Division Company was legalized and confirmed by chap. 1, p. 11, Sp. Laws 1866. Between 1862 and 1871, both these companies separately executed trust deeds and mortgages covering the main line of the road and all its branches, according to the ownership of the same by the separate companies, thereby conveying to the mortgagees or trustees all property, rights, privileges, franchises, and immunities held, owned, or possessed by either company. Both companies made default in the payment of the indebtedness secured by these instruments, and they were duly \n\n[216 U.S. 206, 219]\n\u00a0\n foreclosed in the manner prescribed by law, John S. Barnes, for himself and associates, being the purchaser at the sale made under the foreclosure as to the branch line. Thereafter, Barnes and his associates incorporated under the laws of the state the St. Paul, Minneapolis, & Manitoba Railroad Company, and to this company they conveyed all rights acquired under the foreclosure stated. Thereafter the mortgage on the main line was foreclosed and the Manitoba Company became the purchaser. By these foreclosures the Manitoba Company became the sole owner of all rights, privileges, and property of the two other companies. The Manitoba Company leased its line, together with all property rights, franchises, privileges, and immunities to the defendant Great Northern Company, incorporated under the laws of the state for the term of 999 years. The old Pacific and the First Division Companies paid taxes to the state upon the basis of the act of 1865, already referred to, viz., 1 per cent for the first three years after the completion of 30 miles of road, 2 per cent for the succeeding seven years, and thereafter, and until their rights passed from them by the foreclosure proceedings, just referred to, at the rate of 3 per cent of their gross earnings. The Manitoba Company paid this rate at all times during its ownership and operation of the road.'\n In 1871, the provisions of the state Constitution in relation to the taxation of railroad property were extended by an amendment. That amendment was as follows: 'Art. 4,  32(a). Any law providing for the repeal or amendment of any law or laws heretofore or hereafter enacted, which provides that any railroad company now existing in this state, or operating its road therein, or which may be hereafter organized, shall, in lieu of all other taxes and assessments upon their real estate, roads, rolling stock, and other personal property, at and during the time and periods therein specified, pay into the treasury of this state a certain percentage therein mentioned of the gross earnings of such railroad companies now existing or hereafter organized, shall, before the same \n\n[216 U.S. 206, 220]\n\u00a0\n shall take effect or be in force, be submitted to a vote of the people of the state, and be adopted and ratified by a majority of the electors of the state, voting at the election at which the same shall be submitted to them.' This amendment was submitted to popular vote and approved by the electors. It thereby became, to all intents and purposes, a part of the Constitution. Minn. Const. art. 4,  32a.\n After the adoption of that amendment, the legislature passed the above act of 1903, increasing the tax to be paid for 1905 and annually thereafter on the gross earnings of railroads operated within the state to 4 per cent. That act was submitted to a vote of the electors, and was sustained by the requisite majority.\n As already stated, the railway company insists that the territorial act of May 22d, 1857, incorporating the Minnesota & Pacific Railroad Company, constituted a valid and irrepealable contract with that company, of which its successors in interest could avail themselves, and that its obligation could not be subsequently impaired by any legislative enactment, or by any provision of the state Constitution adopted in 1858, after the act of 1857 was passed, or as amended in 1871.\n We have seen that the (old) Minnesota & Pacific Railroad Company was required, by the territorial act of May 22d, 1857, 'in consideration of the grants, privileges, and franchises' conferred upon it, to pay annually into the treasury of the territory or future state 3 per centum of its gross earnings for the preceding year, in lieu of all taxes and assessments whatever, and that, 'in consideration of such annual payments,' the company should be forever exempt from all assessments and taxes whatever, territorial, state, or municipal, upon all its stock, by whomsoever held, and upon all its franchises or estate, real, personal, or mixed, and that the land granted by Congress, and conveyed to the company under the authority of the state, should be exempt from all taxation until sold and conveyed by it.\n The supreme court of the state expressed doubt whether \n\n[216 U.S. 206, 221]\n\u00a0\n the act of 1857 was so worded as to constitute, in itself, a contract that would prevent the territory or the state from adopting and enforcing any different rule of taxation from that prescribed by that act. We share this doubt of the state court, that act being alone considered, and we are somewhat justified in so doing by the fact that the state legislature, by the act of 1865, changed the rate of taxation as to this property, then operated by the St. Paul & Pacific Company (a predecessor of the plaintiff ), which had undertaken to complete the contemplated railroad and branches. The act of 1865 seems to have been accepted and complied with by the successors in interest of the Minnesota & Pacific Railroad Company, and amounted, as the court below well said, to a practical construction by the parties of the alleged contract of exemption to be found in the territorial act of 1857. But we forbear any direct decision of this question, for there are other grounds upon which our judgment will be based.\n The state court recognized the doctrine as firmly established that a legislature, unless restrained by state constitutional provisions, may contract to limit its power of taxation. But it held that, as taxation was essential to the existence and operations of government, an exemption from taxes cannot be presumed from doubtful language, but must be expressed in words so clear and explicit as to leave no reasonable doubt that the exemption was intended to be given. And such is the settled rule announced by this court in cases familiar to counsel, and too numerous to be cited. Passing without direct decision the question whether the act of 1857 constituted, in itself, an irrepealable contract as between the territory and the (old) Minnesota & Pacific Railroad Company, the supreme court of Minnesota considered the question whether the contract was personal to that particular company, or 'did it become attached as an appurtenant to the charter, rights, franchises, and privileges of the company, and pass down the line to the defendant?' The first clause of that question was answered by the court in the affirmative; the latter in the \n\n[216 U.S. 206, 222]\n\u00a0\n negative,-the court citing, in support of its conclusions, the following cases: Morgan v. Louisiana, \n93 U.S. 217\n, 23 L. ed. 860; Chesapeake & O. R. Co. v. Miller, \n114 U.S. 176\n, 29 L. ed. 121, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 813; Covington & L. Turnp. Road Co. v. Sandford, \n164 U.S. 578\n, 41 L. ed. 560, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 198; Rochester v. Rochester R. Co. 182 N. Y. 99, 70 L.R.A. 773, 74 N. E. 953; Memphis & L. R. R. Co. v. Railroad Comrs. (Memphis & L. R. R. Co. v. Berry) \n112 U.S. 609\n, 28 L. ed. 837, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 299. We need not extend the discussion upon that point.\n But the state court said, and correctly, that there was another and stronger reason why it should be adjudged that an irrevocable contract did not and could not pass to the companies that claimed to have succeeded to the rights of the Minnesota & Pacific Railroad Company. That reason is suggested by the facts and circumstances now to be stated by us.\n The rights, franchises, privileges, or immunities of every kind covered by the above territorial act of 1857 were wholly lost to the old Minnesota & Pacific Railroad Company when the state, by its purchase of June 23d, 1860, at the foreclosure sale, became completely reinvested with them. Those rights, franchises, privileges, and immunities were swept away from that company by that sale. Now, when that purchase was made, the territory had become a state, with a constitution expressly requiring the equal and uniform taxation of all real and personal property in the state upon a cash basis, and authorized the exemption from taxation of certain specified kinds of property, devoted to public and charitable uses; but, as we have seen, railroad property was not included among the properties that could be so exempted. It is, therefore, to be taken that the Constitution of the state, after it went into operation in 1858, required all railroads to be taxed by an equal and uniform rule and on a cash basis. The state having, by its purchase, become reinvested, in 1860, with all the rights, franchises, and privileges granted to the Minnesota & Pacific Railroad in 1857, could, speaking generally, have disposed of such interests at will; but, clearly, it could not have disposed of the interests acquired by its purchase, in any manner that was inconsistent with, or which would have rendered nuga- \n\n[216 U.S. 206, 223]\n\u00a0\n tory, the requirements or injunctions of the state Constitution. Even if the territorial act of 1857, considered alone, might have been regarded as a contract with the state in respect of the amount of the tax to be paid by the railroad company named in it, that contract ceased to have any force, as against the state, when the state, in 1860, became, by purchase at foreclosure sale, the owner of all the rights, property, immunities, and franchises of the company. The legislature of the state could not, after the state Constitution went into operation, have reinvested the old railroad company with such property, rights, immunities, or franchises, or have transferred them to a new corporation or to a consolidated railroad corporation created by the union of prior corporations, accompanied by an exemption from taxation that was inconsistent with the Constitution. Therefore, when, by the act of March 8th, 1861, the state released and restored to the Minnesota & Pacific Railroad Company the road, lands, property, rights, franchises, privileges, and immunities which had belonged to that company prior to the state's purchase of 1860, there did not go, there could not have gone, with that release or restoration, an exemption from taxation that was forbidden by the state Constitution then in operation. That instrument stood in the way of such legislation. And, upon like grounds, it must be held that no qualified or partial exemption from taxation could have been acquired by the St. Paul & Pacific Railroad Company under the act of March, 1862, which assumed to pass to that company all the rights, benefits, privileges, property, franchises, and interests of the Minnesota & Pacific Company, which the state had acquired by its second purchase. It was not competent for the legislature, after the state Constitution went into operation, to agree, for the state, that the payment of any given per cent of the gross earnings of the railroad corporation should be in lieu of all other taxation. The Constitution again stood in the way.\n Apart from the decision of the supreme court of Minnesota in this case, the views just expressed are abundantly supported \n\n[216 U.S. 206, 224]\n\u00a0\n by adjudged cases. It is well to look at some of those cases, because the question relates to the existence or nonexistence of a contract protected as to its obligation by the Constitution of the United States; and upon that question this court must exercise its independent judgment. Douglas v. Kentucky, \n168 \nU.S. 489, 492\n, 42 S. L. ed. 553, 554, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 199, and authorities there cited.\n In Trask v. Maguire, 18 Wall. 401, 404, 409, 21 L. ed. 944, 945, 947, it appeared that a railroad company was incorporated with an exemption from state and county taxes. The corporation obtained a loan from the state. The act under which the loan was made and the bonds given to secure it provided that the acceptance of such bonds should be a mortgage of the road and every part thereof for the benefit of the state. Subsequently, the state adopted a new Constitution, which declared that no property, real or personal, should be exempt from taxation, except such as was used exclusively for public schools or belonged to the United States, and also forbade the legislature to pass any special laws exempting the property of any named person or corporation from taxation. The legislature passed an act under which proceedings were instituted against defaulting railroad companies to foreclose the state's lien. Pending those proceedings, another act was passed, declaring that any corporation purchasing at such a foreclosure sale should have the same power, franchises, rights, and privileges, and be subject to the same liabilities and restrictions, as the corporation whose property and franchises were to be sold. A sale was had and the state became the purchaser of the defaulting railroad and its appurtenances. It was then sold to a private person, who, with his associates, organized a new corporation with the same name as the old one. The question was whether the last corporation was entitled to the immunity from taxation granted to the original company. This court, speaking by Mr. Justice Field, said: 'When the state became the purchaser, the immunity ceased; the property stood in its hands precisely the same as any other unencumbered property of the state, exempt from taxation, not by virtue of any previous \n\n[216 U.S. 206, 225]\n\u00a0\n stipulation with the company, but as all property of the state is thus exempt. Subsequently, the road and its appurtenances, and all the franchises, which, under the new Constitution of Missouri, adopted in 1865, were transferable by the state, were sold by the commissioners to McKay, Vogel, and Simmons, who conveyed the same to Thomas Allen, who, with others, in July, 1867, became incorporated under the name of the St. Louis & Iron Mountain Railroad Company. That company is still in existence, and is one of the defendants herein. To it Allen transferred all the rights and privileges acquired by him from his vendors, and all which they acquired from the state. The act under which the sale was made provided that the purchasers of the road should have all the rights, franchises, privileges, and immunities which were enjoyed by the defaulting company under its charter and laws amendatory thereof, subject to the limitations and conditions therein contained, and not inconsistent with the act authorizing the sale. The new company thus acquired all the immunity from taxation which the original company had possessed, if it were competent for the legislature at the time, under the new Constitution, to confer this privilege. The question, therefore, is whether the legislature was competent to grant the immunity claimed, under that Constitution, which went into operation on the 4th of July, 1865, previous to the passage of any of the acts authorizing the proceedings under which the new company acquired its rights. . . . The inhibition of the Constitution applies in all its force against the renewal of an exemption equally as against its original creation; and this inhibition the legislature could not disregard in providing for the sale of the property which it had purchased.'\n The Trask Case was cited with approval in Morgan v. Louisiana, \n93 \nU.S. 217, 224\n, 23 S. L. ed. 860, 862, and Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Palmes, \n109 \nU.S. 244, 254\n, 27 S. L. ed. 922, 925, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 193, 200.\n In the latter case it appeared that, at a particular date, the legislature of Florida passed an act that was valid under the existing state Constitution, which exempted from taxation the capital stock of railroad companies accepting its provi- \n\n[216 U.S. 206, 226]\n\u00a0\n sions. The road, property, franchises, and privileges under that act were acquired by a certain railroad company; there was a foreclosure and sale under which the road, property, and franchises were ultimately acquired by another railroad company, and the legislature, by an act, declared that the latter company, as assignees of the original company, should have the same exemption as the old company. But, before the above foreclosure, a new state Constitution came into operation, which provided for an uniform and equal rate of taxation, and that the property of corporations, whenever created, should be subject to taxation. This court, speaking by Mr. Justice Matthews, said: 'It does not weaken this conclusion to say that the exemption contained in the internal improvement act of 1855 was authorized by the Constitution of the state then in force, which may be admitted, and that it was assignable in its nature or by its terms, in such manner that it became impressed upon the property itself into whosesoever hands it should afterwards come. . . . After the adoption of the Constitution of Florida of 1868, there could be no corporation created capable in law of accepting and enjoying such an exemption, for that was prohibited by the constitutional provisions that have been cited. In the case of the Pensacola & Louisville Railroad Company, 1872, the capacity at that time to receive this privilege depended altogether upon the legislative act amending its charter to that effect; and if any doubt as to this might be reasonably entertained, certainly none can arise as to the Pensacola Railroad Company, which derived all its powers and its very existence from legislation dependent for its validity wholly upon the Constitution of 1868. The prohibition which forbids the legislature from exempting the property of railroad corporations from taxation makes it impossible for the legislature to create such a corporation capable in law of acquiring and holding property free from liability to taxation.'\n In Memphis & L. R. R. Co. v. Railroad Comrs. (Memphis & L. R. R. Co. v. Berry) \n112 \nU.S. 609, 623\n, 28 S. L. ed. 837, 842, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 299, 305, which was a case in which a railroad claimed an exemp- \n\n[216 U.S. 206, 227]\n\u00a0\n tion from taxation, enjoyed by its predecessor, this court said: 'It is, of course, the law in force at the time the transaction is consummated and made effectual that must be looked to as determining its validity and effect. This is the principle on which this court proceeded in deciding the case of Atlantic & G. R. Co. v. Georgia, \n98 U.S. 359\n, 25 L. ed. 185. The franchise to be a corporation remained in, and was exercised by, the old corporation, notwithstanding the mortgage of its charter, until the new corporation was formed and organized; it was then surrendered to the state, and by a new grant, then made, passed to the corporators of the new corporation, and was held and exercised by them under the constitutional restrictions then existing. Our conclusions, then, are, that the exemption from taxation contained in the 28th section of the act of January 11, 1853, was intended to apply only to the Memphis & Little Rock Railroad Company as the original corporation organized under it; that it did not pass by the mortgage of its charter and works, as included in the transfer of the franchise to be a corporation, to the mortgagees or purchasers at the judicial sale; that the franchises embraced in that conveyance were limited to those which had been granted as appropriate to the construction, maintenance, operation, and use of the railroad as a public highway, and the right to make profit therefrom; and that the appellant, not having become a corporate body until after the restrictions in the Constitution of 1874 took effect, was thereby incapable in law of having or enjoying the privilege of holding its property exempt from taxation.' That case was referred to with approval in Mercantile Bank v. Tennessee, \n161 U.S. 161\n, 40 L. ed. 656, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 461, where it was held that a sale of a corporate charter and franchises transferred to the purchaser only the right to reorganize as a corporation, 'subject to the laws, constitutional and otherwise, existing at the time of the organization.'\n A case in point is Keokuk & W. R. Co. v. Missouri, \n152 \nU.S. 301, 312\n, 38 S. L. ed. 450, 455, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 592, 596. Under the authority of a legislative enactment, passed in 1869, a Missouri corporation was consolidated in 1870 with an Iowa corporation, created in \n\n[216 U.S. 206, 228]\n\u00a0\n 1857, and the charter of which contained an exemption of its stock from taxation for a specified period. The consolidated road was sold in 1886 under a decree of foreclosure of a mortgage given by the Iowa corporation, and conveyed to the Keokuk & Western Railroad Company. The latter company claimed the benefit of the exemption contained in the charter of the company created in 1857. Between that date and the passage of the act of 1869, a new state Constitution was adopted, and it provided that 'no property, real or personal, shall be exempt from taxation, except such as may be used exclusively for public schools, and such as may belong to the United States, to this state, to counties, or to municipal corporations within this state.' [Art. 11,  16.] After considering the general question whether an immunity from taxation passed to the purchaser of the franchises, rights, and privileges of a railroad company under a foreclosure of a mortgage, the court said: 'But the decisive answer to this objection is that the legislature had no power, in 1869, to extend to a new corporation created by the consolidation an exemption contained in an act passed in 1857, before the Constitution was adopted, and hence that, under the terms of this act, we cannot hold that immunity from taxation passed as a franchise or privilege to the consolidated corporation. The construction claimed by the defendant would be directly in the teeth of the constitutional provision that no property shall be exempted from taxation. While, as heretofore observed, an exemption from taxation contained in a charter previously granted could not be taken away by this constitutional provision without the impairment of the obligation of a contract, it doubtless applies to all corporations thereafter formed, either by original charter or by the consolidation of prior corporations under the act of 1869.'\n In Yazoo & M. Valley R. Co. v. Adams, \n180 \nU.S. 1, 23\n, 45 S. L. ed. 395, 407, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 240, 248, which related to an exemption from taxation claimed by a company consolidated in 1892 by the union of companies organized in 1882, and which consolidation was held to create a new corporation, this court said: 'But it is scarcely necessary \n\n[216 U.S. 206, 229]\n\u00a0\n to say that, if the consolidation of 1892 resulted in a new corporation, it would come into existence under the Constitution of 1890, with the disabilities attaching thereto, among which is the provision that 'the property of all private corporations for pecuniary gain shall be taxed in the same way and to the same extent as the property of individuals.' Even if the legislature, in these several acts of consolidation, had expressly provided that the new corporation thereby formed should be exempted from taxation, the higher law of the Constitution would be interpreted as nullifying it to that extent. A similar remark may be made with regard to the provision that these companies might consolidate upon such terms as they should agree upon. Obviously, such terms must be consistent with the law existing at the time of the consolidation. . . . Under no circumstances would they be interpreted as conveying rights to the new corporation which the legislature was incompetent to confer.'\n In Rochester R. Co. v. Rochester, \n205 \nU.S. 236, 254\n, 255 S., 51 L. ed. 784, 791, 792, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 469, 475, in respect to a legislative enactment assuming to transfer to a particular corporation an exemption granted to a former corporation, the court, after a full reference to the adjudged cases, held: 'No corporation can receive by transfer from another an exemption from taxation or governmental regulation which is inconsistent with its own charter or with the Constitution or laws of the state then applicable, and this is true, even though, under legislative authority, the exemption is transferred by words which clearly include it;' that 'those who seek and obtain the benefit of a charter of incorporation must take the benefit under the conditions and with the burdens prescribed by the laws then in force, whether written in the Constitution, in general laws, or in the charter itself.'\n The recent case of Yazoo & M. Valley R. Co. v. Vicksburg, \n209 \nU.S. 358, 364\n, 365 S., 52 L. ed. 833, 834, 835, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 510, 512, was the case of a consolidated corporation claiming the benefit of an exemption legally given to its predecessor before the adoption of a state Constitution prohibiting the exemption of corporate property \n\n[216 U.S. 206, 230]\n\u00a0\n from taxation. This court said: 'The exemption to the former constituent company could not inure to the consolidated company without, in effect, ignoring the constitutional provision. . . . The formation of the consolidated company was not imposed upon the complainant; it had the privilege of standing upon such rights as it had, by contract or otherwise, under the former legislation in force before the adoption of the new Constitution. When it saw fit to enter into the consolidation and form a new corporation, in 1892, the Constitution then in force in the state became the law of its corporate being, and the requirement that corporate property should not be exempt from taxation then became binding upon it, as upon all other corporations formed under the new organic law.'\n In view of the adjudged cases, it would seem clear that after the Minnesota Constitution went into operation in 1858, the legislature could not, by legislation or otherwise, enter into a binding contract for a complete or partial exemption, either in favor of the corporation originally created by the territory in 1857, or in favor of a new railroad corporation, or of one created by the consolidation of old corporations. It must have been controlled by the fundamental law of the state. So the highest court of Minnesota has held in this case. And so we hold. It follows that legislative acts relating to the property and railroads here in question, and passed after the state Constitution took effect, which proceeded, in the matter of taxation, on grounds of taxation different from those established by that instrument, were ineffectual.\n We have not deemed it necessary in this discussion to refer in detail to the numerous cases in the supreme court of the state, which have been cited by counsel. This course has been pursued for two reasons: 1. The state court, in its opinion in the present case, said: 'That the question here presented, viz., whether the provisions of the Minnesota & Pacific Company's charter on the subject of the earnings tax constituted an irrevocable contract was not involved in any prior litigation be- \n\n[216 U.S. 206, 231]\n\u00a0\n tween the state and the railroad company, and as what was said in the previous cases bearing upon the question was wholly unnecessary to the decision of the particular case, and therefore not of binding force or effect, we take up and dispose of the present case as though the question were, as it is, here for the first time.' We accept that view of the state court as to the scope of its own decisions. 2. The question just stated- the question of the existence or nonexistence of a binding contract with the state-is one peculiarly for the final determination of this court. The authorities heretofore cited by us show that upon an issue of that kind this court must, upon its own responsibility and independent judgment, determine the legal rights of the parties under the clause of the Federal Constitution protecting the obligation of contracts against being impaired by state legislation.\n In the present case it is gratifying that there is a concurrence of views between this court and the state court upon the question whether the plaintiff in error, the Great Northern Railway Company, described by the state court as the 'successor in interest of all the prior companies,' was entitled, as upon contract, to claim the benefit of the 3 per centum gross earnings tax provision in the act of 1857. And this seems to be a determination of the only question of a Federal nature arising on this writ of error and which should be now decided; for, if the contention of the railroad company as to that question be overruled,-as both this court and the state court agree that it must be,-it would only remain to inquire whether the act of 1903, prescribing a 4 per centum gross earnings tax, was authorized by the state Constitution, as amended in 1871. The supreme court of the state adjudges that it was so authorized, but that is a state or local question upon which this court need not express its opinion. It is true that one of the assignments of error before the state court was that the act of 1903 was inconsistent with the due-process clause of the Federal Constitution. But the suggestion was not much pressed in argument; and it cannot, under the evi- \n\n[216 U.S. 206, 232]\n\u00a0\n dence before us in this case, be assumed that the rate prescribed by the act of 1903 is confiscatory, either in its nature or in its necessary operation. If, when the act of 1903 was passed, the state was not fettered by inviolable contracts in respect of the taxation of the gross earnings of railroad property, there was nothing to prevent the legislature, instructed by a popular vote, from prescribing an uniform gross-earnings tax for all railroad property operated in the state. There being no adequate proof showing the contrary, the rate prescribed by that act must be taken as being within the power of the legislature to establish, and not as being confiscatory. There is absolutely nothing in the record that would justify the conclusion that the rate fixed by the act of 1903 was confiscatory in its nature; that is, wanting in the due process of law enjoined by the Constitution.\n One other matter deserves notice. Some reference was made at the argument to Stearns v. Minnesota, \n179 \nU.S. 223, 230\n, 240 S., 253, 45 L. ed. 162, 165, 172, 177, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 73. There is nothing in the judgment in that case which at all conflicts with or controls the decision in this case. That case involved only the question whether certain lands owned by the defendant railroad companies, but which were not used in the operation of their roads in the state, were subject to taxation according to their value, or were exempted from ordinary rule of taxation by virtue of statutes, like that of 1857, passed after the state Constitution took effect. A similar question was adverted to in the present case, and the state supreme court, referring to the charter of the Minnesota & Pacific Railroad Company, said: 'Two distinct provisions on the subject of taxation were embodied therein, the first providing for a gross-earnings tax in lieu of all other taxes and assessments, and second, an exemption of the land granted until sold or contracted to be sold by the company.' Observing that the exemption in question did not pass as an appurtenant to the railroad properties in question, and was not included within the expression, 'rights, privileges, and immunities,' citing Gulf & S. I. R. Co. v. Hewes, \n183 U.S. 66\n, 46 L. ed. 86, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 26; \n\n[216 U.S. 206, 233]\n\u00a0\n Chesapeake & O. R. Co. v. Miller, \n114 U.S. 176\n, 29 L. ed. 121, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 813; Lake Drummond Canal & Water Co. v. Com. 103 Va. 337, 68 L.R.A. 92, 49 S. E. 506; Rochester v. Rochester R. Co. 182 N. Y. 99, 70 L.R.A. 773, 74 N. E. 953; Covington & L. Turnp. Road Co. v. Sandford, \n164 U.S. 578\n, 41 L. ed. 560, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 198,-the court said: 'A distinction must not be overlooked, when considering the assignability of a tax exemption, between those imposing a commuted system in lieu of property taxes, and those exempting specific property. In the former case, the system does not attach to the corporation or concern thus taxed, nor to any particular property, and necessarily is personal, and not assignable. But where, as in the case at bar, specific land is granted to a railroad company to aid in the construction of a railroad, and is specifically exempted from taxation until sold by the company, and the company accepts, in consideration of the exemption, the exemption attaches to and follows the land. New Jersey v. Wilson, 7 Cranch, 164, 3 L. ed. 303; State v. Hicks, 9 Yerg. 486, 30 Am. Dec. 423; International & G. N. R. Co. v. State, 75 Tex. 356, 12 S. W. 685. In such case, as we have frequently held, as will be shown later, the exemption is appurtenant to and passes with the land to a succeeding corporation assuming the burden attached to it.' In the Stearns Case the court determined only the question whether the lands of the railroad company were taxable. It held, upon the showing there made, that there was a valid contract with the railroad companies in respect to the taxation of the lands there in question which it was beyond the power of the state to impair by legislation. Nothing beyond that was actually adjudged in the Stearns Case. No such question arises in the present case. There is no attempt here to tax the lands granted by the territorial act of 1857 or by any other act. The state sues only for the balance due to it on account of taxes imposed by the act of 1903 on the gross earnings of property used and operated within its limits for railroad purposes.\n Perceiving no error in the record as to the Federal question involved, the judgment must be affirmed.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","52":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGRENADA LUMBER CO. v. STATE OF MISSISSIPPI(1910)\nNo. 493\nArgued: Decided: May 2, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 433, 434]\n\u00a0\n This is a writ of error to the supreme court of the state \n\n[217 U.S. 433, 435]\n\u00a0\n of Mississippi to review a decree dissolving a voluntary association of retail lumber dealers as a combination in restraint of trade, under a statute of the state.\n So such of the Mississippi act as is here involved is set out in the margin, being part of  5002, Mississippi Code. \n The proceeding under this statute was by a bill filed in a chancery court of the state, by the state, upon relation of its attorney general. The bill averred that the defendants, some seventy-seven individuals and corporations, were retail dealers in lumber, sash, doors, etc., doing business, some of them, in the state of Mississippi, and others in the state of Louisiana, and were competitors in business, each engaged in buying and selling again for profit, and in competition with each other for the business of consumers; that the defendants had entered into an agreement, compact, or combination for the purpose and with the intent to destroy, prevent, or sup-\n 5002. (4437) Definition of term; criminal conspiracy (Laws 1900, chap. 88).- A trust and combine is a combination, contract, understanding, or agreement, expressed or implied, between two or more persons, corporations, or firms, or associations of persons, or between one or more of either with one or more of the others:\n\n\n (a)\n In restraint of trade.\n\n\n (b)\n To limit, increase, or reduce the price of a commodity.\n\n\n (c)\n To limit, increase, or reduce the production or output of a commodity.\n\n\n (d)\n Intended to hinder competition in the production, importation, manufacture, transportation, sale, or purchase of a commodity.\n\n\n (e)\n To engross or forestall a commodity.\n\n\n (f)\n To issue, own, or hold the certificates of stock of any trust or combine.\n\n\n (g)\n To place the control, to any extent, of business, or of the products and earnings thereof, in the power of trustees, by whatever name called.\n\n\n (h)\n By which any other person than them-selves, their proper officers, agents, and employees, shall, or shall have the power to, dictate or control the management of business; or,\n\n\n (i)\n To unite or pool interests in the importation, manufacture, production, transportation, or price of a commodity; and is inimical to the public welfare, unlawful, and a criminal conspiracy. \n\n[217 U.S. 433, 436]\n\u00a0\n press all competition between themselves, as retail dealers in the materials mentioned, and manufacturers, wholesale dealers, brokers or commission men, keeping no stock, from selling the like articles or commodities directly to consumers in competition with retailers. To accomplish this suppression of competition for the trade of consumers it was in substance averred that they had organized an association, and had obligated themselves not to purchase any of their stock or commodities from any wholesale dealer or manufacturer who sold such products direct to the consumers in competition with the members of their combination, and to carry out this end had adopted articles of agreement, called a constitution, and appointed a secretary to ascertain such sales and to see that the obligation of the members was respected. The material parts of the agreement under which the defendants combined consist of a preamble, called 'Declaration of Purpose,' the relevant part of which, together with articles 2, 3, and 7, are set out in the margin. \n It was then averred that the necessary effect of such agreement among the defendants, who, it was said, composed a majority of all the retail lumber dealers in the states covered by their compact, was to limit or destroy competition between\n Declaration of Purpose.\n We recognize the right of the manufacturer and wholesale dealer in lumber products to sell lumber in whatever market, to whatever purchaser, and at whatever price, they may see fit.\n We also recognize the disastrous consequences which result to the retail dealer from direct competition with wholesalers and manufacturers, and appreciate the importance to the retail dealer of accurate information as to the nature and extent of such competition, where any exists.\n And recognizing that we, as retail dealers in lumber, sash, doors, and blinds, cannot meet competition from those from whom we buy, we are pledged as members of this association to buy only from manufacturers and wholesalers who do not sell direct to consumers, where there are retail lumber dealers who carry stock commensurate with the demands of their communities, and we are pledged not to buy from lumber commission merchants, agents, and broker who sell to \n\n[217 U.S. 433, 437]\n\u00a0\n the retailers and the wholesalers or manufacturers for the trade or business of the consumer, and that they constituted a combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade, etc. \n\n[217 U.S. 433, 438]\n\u00a0\n The answer admitted the substantial facts, but denied that the object or purpose was to restrain trade or to suppress competition, or that such a result has ensued or would or \n\n[217 U.S. 433, 439]\n\u00a0\n could follow, or that the agreement had any other object than to 'conserve and advance their business interests as retailers.' That their agreement is defensive of, and not injurious to, public interests, is asserted by many paragraphs of the answer, upon economic considerations.\n The chancery court, upon the pleadings and exhibits, held that the association and agreement among the members was 'a combination in restraint of trade, and intended to hinder competition in the sale and purchase of a commodity, and was inimical to the public welfare, and unlawful.' The dissolution of the association was adjudged, and an injunction against further operations granted. This decree was affirmed upon appeal to the supreme court of the state.\n Messrs. Edward Mayes and C. D. Joslyn for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. J. B. Stirling for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Lurton:\n\n Mr. Justice Lurton, after making the above statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The agreement and combination which offends against the Mississippi anti-trust statute is one between a large majority of the independent and competitive merchants engaged in the retail lumber trade in the territory covered by their articles of association, whereby they have obligated themselves not to deal with any manufacturer or wholesale dealer in lumber, sash, or doors, etc., who sells to consumers in localities in which they conduct their business and keep a sufficient stock to meet demands, and to inform each other of any sale made by manufacturers or wholesalers who sell to consumers.\n That such an agreement and combination was, within the meaning of the Mississippi statute, a conspiracy 'in restraint of trade,' 'intended to hinder competition in the production, \n\n[217 U.S. 433, 440]\n\u00a0\n importation, manufacture, transportation, sale, or purchase of a commodity,' is the express decision of the supreme court of Mississippi. That the object and purpose of the compact was to suppress competition between the plaintiffs in error and another class of dealers in or producers of the same commodity and the consumer is avowed in the 'Declaration of Purpose,' set out heretofore, in which it is stated that the members of the association, as retailers, 'cannot meet competition from those from whom they buy.' This concession means, if it means anything, that those against whom the plaintiffs in error are acting in concert will undersell them in the competition for the trade of the consuming public, and must therefore be stopped by concerted refusal to deal with them if they should persist in such competition. This constitutes under the interpretation of the Mississippi statute by the Mississippi court, a 'restraint of trade,' and a hindrance to competitors in the sale of a commodity. Accepting, as we must, this interpretation and application of a state statute by the highest court of the state, there is no question for our consideration other than the insistence that the statute is in conflict with the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The contention is that this statute abridges unreasonably the freedom of contract, which is as much within the protection of that Amendment as is liberty of person.\n That any one of the persons engaged in the retail lumber business might have made a fixed rule of conduct not to buy his stock from a producer or wholesaler tho should sell to consumers in competition with himself is plain. No law which would infringe his freedom of contract in that particular would stand. But when the plaintiffs in error combine and agree that no one of them will trade with any producer or wholesaler who shall sell to a consumer within the trade range of any of them, quite another case is presented. An act harmless when done by one may become a public wrong when done by many, acting in concert, for it then \n\n[217 U.S. 433, 441]\n\u00a0\n takes on the form of a conspiracy, and may be prohibited or punished, if the result be hurtful to the public, or to the individual against whom the concerted action is directed. Callan v. Wilson, \n127 \nU.S. 555, 556\n, 32 S. L. ed. 228, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1301\n\n\n But the plaintiffs in error say that the action which they have taken is purely defensive, and that they cannot maintain themselves as independent dealers, supplying the consumer, if the producers or wholesalers from whom they buy may not be prevented from competing with them for the direct trade of the consumer.\n For the purpose of suppressing this competition, they have not stopped with an individual obligation to refrain from dealing with one who sells within his own circle, and thereby deprives him of a possible customer, but have agreed not to deal with anyone who makes sales to consumers, which sales might have been made by any one of the seventy- seven independent members of the association. Thus they have stripped themselves of all freedom of contract in order to compel those against whom they have combined to elect between their combined trade and that of consumers. That such an agreement is one in restraint of trade is undeniable, whatever the motive or necessity which has induced the compact. Whether it would be an illegal restraint at common law is not now for our determination. It is an illegal combination and conspiracy under the Mississippi statute. That is enough if the statute does not infringe the 14th Amendment.\n The argument that the situation is one which justified the defensive measures taken by the plaintiffs in error is one which we need neither refute nor concede. Neither are we required to consider any mere question of the expediency of such a law. It is a regulation of commerce purely intrastate,-a subject as entirely under the control of the state as is the delegated control over interstate commerce exercised by the United States. The power exercised is the police power reserved to the states. The limitation upon its exercise, con- \n\n[217 U.S. 433, 442]\n\u00a0\n tained in the Federal Constitution, is found in the 14th Amendment, whereby no state may pass any law by which a citizen is deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. A like limitation upon the legislative power will be found in the Constitution of each state. That legislation night be so arbitrary or so irrational in depriving a citizen of freedom of contract as to come under the condemnation of the Amendment may be conceded.\n In dealing with certain Kansas legislation in regulation of state commerce, which was claimed to be so extreme as to be an unwarranted infringement of liberty of contract, this court, in Smiley v. Kansas, \n196 \nU.S. 447, 457\n, 49 S. L. ed. 546, 551, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 289, 291, said:\n'Undoubtedly there is a certain freedom of contract which cannot be destroyed by legislative enactment. In pursuance of that freedom, parties may seek to further their business interests, and it may not be always easy to draw the line between those contracts which are beyond the reach of the police power, and those which are subject to prohibition or restraint. But a secret arrangement, by which, under penalties, an apparently existing competition among all the dealers in a community in one of the necessaries of life is substantially destroyed, without any merging of interests through partnership or incorporation, is one to which the police power extends. That is as far as we need to go in sustaining the judgment in this case.'\n\n We confine ourselves to so much of the act assailed as was construed and applied in the present case. If there should arise a case in which this legislation is sought to be applied where any interference with freedom of contract would be beyond legislative restraint, it will be time enough for interference by the courts.\n As observed in Smiley v. Kansas, where the breadth of the act was criticized, 'Unless appellant can show that he himself has been wrongfully included in the terms of the law, he can have no just ground of complaint.' The same principle has been often announced by this court in may cases, the \n\n[217 U.S. 433, 443]\n\u00a0\n last instance being in Citizens' Nat. Bank v. Com. an opinion handed down with this. [\n217 U.S. 443\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 532.]\n The excessive penalties provided by the Mississippi statutes have been urged as making the act unconstitutional under Ex parte Young, \n209 U.S. 123\n, 52 L. ed. 714, 13 L.R.A.(N.S.) 932, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 441. No penalties were demanded in the present case, the state contenting itself with a bill in equity to dissolve the association. The penalty provisions are plainly separable from the section under which such a combination is declared illegal. The penalty section not being invoked, we are not called upon to give any opinion in respect to it. United States ex rel. Atty. Gen. v. Delaware & H. Co. \n213 \nU.S. 366, 417\n, 53 S.

Rep. 496.]\n It is enough to say that the act, as construed and applied to the facts of this case by the Supreme Court of Mississippi, exhibits no such restraint upon liberty of contract as to violate the Federal Constitution. The decree must therefore be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n consumers, but do not carry stocks, nor from a manufacturer who sells to such lumber commission merchants, agent, or broker.\n Article Two.\n The Object.\n The object of this association is and shall be to secure and disseminate among its members any and all legal and proper information which may be of interest or value to any member or members thereof in his or their business as ratail lumber dealers, and to carry into actual effect our 'Declaration of Purpose.'\n Article Three.\n Limitation and Restriction.\n Sec. 1.

The offenses charged were the exacting on certain loans of money a rate of interest greater than 15 per cent per annum, contrary to the provisions of the 1st section of the act, and in accepting notes for an amount greater than that actually loaned, with intent to evade the provisions of said 1st section, contrary to the provisions of the 2d section of the act. During the course of the trial, the accused, in various forms, assailed the validity of the statute referred to because of repugnancy to the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States, and to the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.

Alcorn for defendant in error.\n\n\n[218 U.S. 563, 567]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The motion to dismiss or affirm is in effect based upon the claim that the assignments of error present no substantial Federal question. As the contentions urged required for their elucidation a consideration of the provisions of the statute charged to have been violated, we excerpt the 1st and 2d sections of the act. They are as follows:\n'Sec. 1. No person, firm, or corporation, or any agent thereof, other than a national bank or a bank or trust company duly incorporated under the laws of this state, or a pawnbroker, as provided in chapter 235 of the Public Acts \n\n[218 U.S. 563, 568]\n\u00a0\n of 1905, shall, directly or indirectly, loan money to any person, and directly or indirectly charge, demand, accept, or make an agreement to receive therefor interest at a greater rate than 15 per centum per annum. The provisions of this section shall not apply to loans made to any national bank, or any bank or trust company duly incorporated under the laws of this state, or to any bona fide mortgage of real or personal property.\n\n'Sec. 2. No person, firm, or corporation, with intent to evade  1 hereof, shall accept a note for a greater amount than that actually loaned.'\n\n The claim that the statute operates to deny the equal protection of the laws is based upon the provision exempting from the operation of the terms of  1 'any national bank, or any bank or trust company duly incorporated under the laws of this state,' and 'any bona fide mortgage of real or personal property.' The contentions elaborated in the assignments of error find succinct expression in the following proposition set out in the brief filed in opposition to the motion to dismiss:\n'It is claimed by the plaintiff in error that the statute in question is an arbitrary, unjust, and unreasonable selection, favoring a class; is detrimental to the public, stifles competition, and that no good reason exists for the granting of the privilege of loaning money at any rate of interest without taking a mortgage on real or personal property to the favored class, to the exclusion of all others.\n\n ... * *\n'It is not a police regulation; there is no care imposed or restriction in the loan of money by the favored few,-simply an arbitrary, unreasonable limitation upon all except those privileged under the statute.\n\n ... * *\n'The regulation of interest charges is undoubtedly the proper subject of state legislation, but, in the first place, this statute is not a regulation of interest charges. It is \n\n[218 U.S. 563, 569]\n\u00a0\n in effect a special statute permitting only certain favored individuals or corporations to do an act or conduct a business.\n\n ... * *\n'There is 'no fair reason for the law that would not require with equal force its extension to others it leaves untouched.\"\n\n It is elementary that the subject of the maximum amount to be charged by persons or corporations subject to the jurisdiction of a state for the use of money loaned within the jurisdiction of the state is one within the police power of such state. The power to regulate existing, the details of the legislation and the exceptions proper to be made rest primarily within the discretion of the state legislature, and 'unless such regulations are so unreasonable and extravagant as to interfere with property and personal rights of citizens, unnecessarily and arbitrarily, they are within the power of the state; and that the classification of the subjects of such legislation, so long as such classification has a reasonable basis, and is not merely arbitrary selection without real difference between the subjects included and those omitted from the law, does not deny to the citizen the equal protection of the laws.' Watson v. Maryland, \n218 U.S. 173\n, 54 L. ed. 987, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 644, and cases cited. In the case at bar, the supreme court of errors ruled that the statute was not repugnant to the 14th Amendment, folowing a prior ruling to that effect made in State v. Hurlburt, 82 Conn. 232, 72 Atl. 1079.\n In the Hurlburt Case, discussing contentions similar to those here urged against the validity of the Connecticut statute of 1907, based upon the exemption clause in question, the court said:\n'The exception from its operation of loans by national banks was merely a recognition of the legal effect, in excluding state legislation on the same subject, of the statutes of the United States which regulate their right to \n\n[218 U.S. 563, 570]\n\u00a0\n make such contracts. The further exception in favor of loans by trust companies chartered by this state was fully justified by the peculiar character of these institutions, each created by a special act of legislation, and subject to the inspection of the bank commissioners. Gen. Stat. 1902, chaps. 199, 202. There was also reasonable cause for the exception as to pawnbrokers. Their business can only be carried on by those found by public authority to be suitable persons to engage in it, and its character is such as to make it not improper to allow a charge of interest beyond the limit of 15 per cent a year. Pub. Acts 1905, chap. 235, p. 438. There was also sufficient reason for restricting the statute so that it should not apply to loans made to any bank or to any trust company chartered by this state. Such institutions, managed by those accustomed to financial operations and familiar with the worth of money in the market from day to day, might well be deemed to require no statutory protection against being forced by their financial necessities to pay excessive interest for moneys borrowed. Nor is the act invalidated by the exception of mortgages.\n\n'Publicity is one of the best safeguards against the making of unconscionable contracts. Under our recording system, it is rare that any bona fide mortgage, either of real or personal property, fails to be promptly spread upon the records of the town in which is situated the property which is its subject. So far as concerned chattel mortgages, also, our General Statutes of 1902 ( 4132, 4134) had already made other and reasonable provision as to the rate of interest which might be charged, or which, in case of foreclosure, could be allowed. The general assembly, in respect to the matter of usury, had the right to deal with different classes of money lenders or money borrowers in a different way, provided there were nothing apparently unreasonable in creating such distinctions, and all the members of each class were treated \n\n[218 U.S. 563, 571]\n\u00a0\n in the same manner. Heath & M. Mfg. Co. v. Worst, \n207 \nU.S. 338, 354\n, 52 S. L. ed. 236, 243, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 114; Home Teleph. & Teleg. Co. v. Los Angeles, \n211 \nU.S. 265, 281\n, 53 S. L. ed. 176, 186, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 50. The enactment of the statute now in question fell within this right. Norwich Gas & Electric Co. v. Norwich, 76 Conn. 565, 573, 57 Atl. 746.'\n\n In the argument on behalf of the plaintiff in error, no attempt is made to meet the force of the foregoing statements of the court below; and, clearly, in the light of such declarations, it is impossible to conclude otherwise than that the classification complained of has a reasonable basis, and that the exemption of national banks, etc., was not a mere arbitrary selection.\n In the argument for plaintiff in error no reference is made to the claim urged below of the protection of the contract clause of the Constitution. The claim appears to have had reference to a provision contained in  5 of the act of 1907, forbidding the enforcement of contracts made in violation of the act, thereby operating to deny validity to such contracts when made by those not within the exempted classes. There was power to enact the provision (Missouri, K. & T. Trust Co. v. Krumseig, \n172 \nU.S. 351, 358\n, 359 S., 43 L. ed. 474, 476, 477, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 179), and, as said by the court below, the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States 'does not give validity to contracts which are properly prohibited by statute.'\n The supreme court of errors of Connecticut did not err in its judgment of affirmance. As, however, the particular classification here assailed has not been the subject of express consideration in any prior decision of this court, and hence the power to make it cannot be said to have been so explicitly foreclosed as to cause contention on the subject to be obviously frivolous, the motion to dismiss cannot prevail Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Melton, \n218 U.S. 36\n, 54 L. ed. 921, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 676. It is, however, manifest from the analysis which has been made of prior decisions, that applying the principles settled by the cases which have \n\n[218 U.S. 563, 572]\n\u00a0\n gone before, the contentions now advanced against the correctness of the judgment are so wholly without merit as not to require further argument. The motion to affirm must therefore prevail.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","54":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGRIFFITH v.

The judge dismissed the complaint of his own motion, and the defendants in error confine themselves to the suggestion that for that reason the judgment should be reversed at the cost of the plaintiff in error, concurring in the argument that the judgment was wrong. As we are of opinion that the judgment was right, it will be unnecessary to consider that point.\n The suit is brought by a Connecticut corporation against residents of Connecticut. We give an abridgment of the com- \n\n[217 U.S. 497, 498]\n\u00a0\n plaint. The plaintiff is the owner of a patent for finger nail clippers. The defendants, during the time of the acts complained of, were directors in control of another Connecticut corporation, the Little River Manufacturing Company. This company infringed the patent, and the plaintiff brought a suit in equity against it in the same circuit court, which ended in a decree for an injunction, $12,871 damages, and $496.35 costs. The defendants voted to continue the sale of the infringing clipper pending the suit, and also voted and caused to be executed a bond of indemnity from their company to the selling agent, against liability for the sale. As directors and as individuals they authorized and brought about such sales, and they directed the defense of the equity suit. In consequence of the expenditures to the foregoing ends, their company became and is insolvent, and the defendants knew that that would be the result of a judgment against it, but did the acts alleged for the purpose of increasing the value of their stock in the company, and of receiving the profits and dividends that might be received from the sale.\n The plaintiff's argument is that the defendants and their corporation were joint tort feasors, and that this is a suit against the defendants for their part in infringing its patent, the judgment against their cotrespasser not having been satisfied. It is unnecessary to speculate whether this is an afterthought, or whether the complaint was framed with intentional ambiguity, so that, if one cause of action failed, another might be extracted from the allegations, or what the explanation may be. But the present interpretation is not the natural interpretation of the complaint. The natural interpretation is that which was given to it by the court below; that it is an attempt to make the defendants answerable for the judgment already obtained. There was no other reason for alleging that judgment with such detail, while, on the other hand, the patent now supposed to be the foundation of the claim is not set forth. The judge was fully warranted in taking this not to be a suit upon a patent. Indeed, it would seem \n\n[217 U.S. 497, 499]\n\u00a0\n from his opinion that one of the grounds of jurisdiction urged before him was that this is an action ancillary to the judgment in the former suit, which, of course, is not, any more than Stillman v. Combe, \n197 U.S. 436\n, 49 L. ed. 822, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 480; but the argument recognized that the former judgment was the foundation of the present case. Apart from that contention, there can be no question that, as the judge below said, if the directors are under obligations by Connecticut law to pay a judgment against their corporation, that is not a matter that can be litigated between citizens of the same state, in the circuit court of the United States. The only argument attempted here is that which we have stated and have decided not to be open on the complaint.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","56":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHAAS v. HENKEL(1910)\nNo. 367\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 462, 463]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Nash Rockwood, Henry E. Davis, and Max D. Steuer for appellant.\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 462, 470]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Jesse C. Adkins and Assistant Attorney General Fowler for appellees. \n\n[216 U.S. 462, 471]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Lurton delivered the opinion of the court:\n On May 29, 1908, four indictments were found in the supreme court of the District of Columbia against Moses Haas and certain others, charging them with having conspired in the District of Columbia to defraud the United States, and with having conspired to commit an offense against the United States, under  5440, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3676). Bench warrants were issued and returned not found.\n On the same day four other indictments were found in the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York against the same Moses Haas and the others named in the District of Columbia indictments, charging them with having conspired in the southern district of New York to commit the same offenses covered by the four District of Columbia indictments. Haas appeared in the New York courts and gave bail. Later he was arraigned and pleaded not guilty, then withdrew his plea and entered a motion to quash, which was overruled.\n On June 24, 1908, and while this motion to quash was sub judice, proceedings were duly begun by the United States district attorney for the southern district of New York before the United States commissioner for the arrest of Haas and his removal to the District of Columbia for trial upon the indictments there pending against him. Pending these removal proceedings, and before any hearing, the United States district attorney moved the circuit court in which the New York indictments were pending for consent to the prosecution of these removal proceedings, and consent was granted over the objection of Haas. This application was made by direction of the then Attorney General of the United States, who in an official communication, said 'that should the trial here [Washington] result in acquittal or conviction, the indictments in New York will be dropped.' Among other \n\n[216 U.S. 462, 472]\n\u00a0\n reasons for desiring the trial in Washington, aside from mere questions of convenience to government officials and witnesses, the Attorney General said:\n'1. The indictments charge a conspiracy on the part of the several defendants to cause to be issued at Washington by the Bureau of Statistics for the Department of Agriculture of false cotton crop reports, and that Holmes, who was then associate statistician of the Bureau of Statistics, was to furnish to his co-conspirators, in advance of thier official issue, the information to be contained in the reports. While, owing to the commission in your district of acts in pursuance of the conspiracy, the court in your district has jurisdiction of the offense, yet the conspiracy was, in all probability, actually formed in Washington. The false reports were prepared and issued here, and the advance information was given out here. The real situs of the crime, then, is in the District of Columbia, and the trials should therefore be had here.\n\n'2. The defendant Holmes has been arrested and is now awaiting trial on the indictments pending in the District of Columbia. There are two series of these indictments, one against Price, Haas, and Holmes, and the other against Haas, Peckham, and Holmes. It would be a great convenience and a vast saving to the government to try the defendants together. Even this would necessitate two trials, one in each series. If the nonresident defendants are not removed to Washington, four trials would be needed,-two in Washington and two in New York.'\n\n Upon the hearing before the commissioner, the government put in evidence certified copies of the four District of Columbia indictments, and proof that bench warrants had issued in that district and returned not found. The defendant admitted his identity, and put in evidence copies of the four New York indictments and of the proceedings had thereunder. The commissioner found probable cause, and directed that Haas be held to await an order of removal by a district judge. Thereupon a petition for writs of habeas corpus and \n\n[216 U.S. 462, 473]\n\u00a0\n certiorari was filed in the circuit court, averring that his arrest and detention were illegal and in violation of the Federal Constitution. The circuit court, upon a full hearing, denied the writs and remanded the petitioner. 166 Fed. 621. This appeal was thereupon taken.\n The facts stated present the question as to whether Haas could be lawfully removed under  1014, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 716), over his objection, pending the proceedings against him in the southern district of New York for similar offenses.\n Section 1014 provides for the arrest and detention of any person, wherever found, 'for trial' before such court of the United States as by law has cognizance of the offense, and that 'where any offender or witness is committed in any district other than that where the offense is to be tried, it shall be the duty of the judge of the district where such offender or witness is imprisoned seasonably to issue, and of the marshal to execute, a warrant for his removal to the district where the trial is to be had.'\n Haas was arrested upon a warrant duly sworn out, charging him with offenses against the United States, committed within the District of Columbia. Copies of the indictments duly returned by a grand jury were put in evidence. That made a prima facie case, requiring detention until an order of removal could be applied for and issued. Haas insisted upon his right to be tried in the district of his residence, and complained, with more or less justice, of the expense and hardship incident to a trial in the District of Columbia. But there is no principle of constitutional law which entitles one to be tried in the place of his residence. The right secured by article 3,  2, and the 6th Amendment of the Constitution, is the right of trial in the district 'where the crime shall have been committed.' If, therefore, Haas committed a crime against the United States in the District of Columbia, he had neither legal nor constitutional right to object to removal to the district where the trial was to be had. Re Palliser, \n136 \nU.S. 257, 265\n, 34 S. L. ed. 541, 517, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1034. \n\n[216 U.S. 462, 474]\n\u00a0\n If the only constitutional right secured is the right to a trial by jury in the district where the crime was committed, there is obviously no invasion of either right by the election of the government to prosecute the offense in any district and 'court of the United States as by law has cognizance of the offense.' If the same accusation has been made by grand juries of different jurisdictions, it would be manifestly the duty of the prosecuting officer of the United States to determine in which the offense was most probably committed, and bring the offender to trial there. Thus, if the place of the formation of the conspiracy be doubtful, and there be some facts pointing to one district and some to another, and indictments have been returned in each, it would be the plain duty of the prosecution to take steps to bring the case to trial in that district to which the facts most strongly pointed. This seems to have been the very situation of this case, and the principal motive moving the Attorney General to give the instruction shown by his letter to the district attorney for the southern district of New York. The removal statute is plain, and leaves no room for the court to make an exception when Congress has made none.\n Has the United States court for the District of Columbia jurisdiction over the accusation made in that district, and is the case triable there? If so, the duty of the commissioner, assuming a showing of probable cause, was to detain, and of the judge of the district to issue his warrant for the removal of the accused 'to the district where the trial is to be had.' The case, on principle, must be the same if the offense be one which was committed in more than one district. In such a case,  731, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 585), makes it cognizable in either. But, if indicted in two or more districts, there must be an election as to where the defendant shall be tried. Primarily, this is the right and duty of the Attorney General, or those acting by his authority. If the election require the arrest of the accused in a district other than that in which the trial is to be had, removal proceedings must, of course, be instituted. \n\n[216 U.S. 462, 475]\n\u00a0\n The duty of the commissioner is then limited to the determination of the single question of whether a prima facie case is made that the accused has committed an offense against the United States, indictable and triable in the district to which a removal is sought. There is no discretion reposed when such a case is made out. That bail had been given would not prevent removal, for in such a situation the sureties would be exonerated by act of the law. Beavers v. Haubert, \n198 U.S. 77\n, 49 L. ed. 950, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 573.\n But in the case before us, the consent of the circuit court, to which the New York indictments had been returned, was granted. To say that the accused had a right to a speedy trial of the New York cases may be conceded. If unreasonable delay should result from continuances due to an election to try the same accusations in another district, a very different question might arise, calling for relief through habeas corpus. But such a possibility affords no legal reason for denying the right of removal. The precise question has not been before raised; but in principle the case is within Re Palliser, \n136 \nU.S. 257, 267\n, 34 S. L. ed. 514, 518, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1034; Hyde v. Shine, \n199 U.S. 62\n, 50 L. ed. 90, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 760; and Benson v. Henkel, \n198 \nU.S. 1, 15\n, 49 S. L. ed. 919, 924, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 569.\n In the Palliser Case, a removal from a New York district, the residence of Palliser, to a Connecticut district, was objected to because the offense had been committed in New York, and not Connecticut. The court said:\n'But there can be no doubt at all that, if any offense was committed in New York, the offense continued to be committed when the letter reached the postmaster in Connecticut; and that, if no offense was committed in New York, an offense was committed in Connecticut; and that, it either aspect, the district court of the United States for the district of Connecticut had jurisdiction of the charge against the petitioner. Whether he might have been indicted in New York is a question not presented by this appeal.'\n\n In Hyde v. Shine, the fact that the conspiracy charged was one triable in California, the residence of the appellant, was \n\n[216 U.S. 462, 476]\n\u00a0\n not considered as an answer to the demand for removal from California to the District of Columbia, the question of distance being the one pressed, and decided as presenting no obstacle to the legal right of removal.\n In Beavers v. Haubert, supra, the appellant objected to removal from the district of his residence to another, to be there tried, because he was, at the time, under indictment in the district of his residence, and under bail for his appearance for a different offense against the United States. But it was held that this fact afforded no reason for denying a removal upon the election to try the one case before the trial of the other.\n In Benson v. Henkel, \n198 U.S. 15\n, 49 L. ed. 924, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 569, objection was made to a removal to the District of Columbia upon the ground that the offense, if any, was committed in California, and that, under the Constitution, the appellant was entitled to a trial in that jurisdiction. In dealing with that question, Mr. Justice Brown said:\n'The objection does not appear upon the face of the indictment, which charges the offense to have been committed within this district, but from the testimony of one of those clerks it seems that the money was received by him in certain letters mailed to him from San Francisco and received in Washington. Without intimating whether the question of jurisdiction can be raised in this way, the case clearly falls within that of Re Palliser, \n136 U.S. 257\n, 34 L. ed. 514, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1034, in which it was held that where an offense is begun by the mailing of a letter in one district and completed by the receipt of a letter in another district, the offender may be punished in the latter district, although it may be that he could also be punished in the former.'\n\n The next objection is that the District of Columbia indictments do not charge any offense against the United States.\n The four District of Columbia indictments charge two sets of conspiracies. One conspiracy, charged in indictment No. 26,088, is averred to have been formed between Haas, one \n\n[216 U.S. 462, 477]\n\u00a0\n Theodore Price, and one Edwin S. Holmes, Jr., who was an associate statistician in the Department of Agriculture. The charge in certain of these counts is that these three defendants conspired to defraud the United States by secretly obtaining information from Holmes, which he should acquire in his official character as associate statistician, and should, in violation of his official duty, give out secretly to his co- conspirators, as to the probable contents of certain official cotton crop reports in advance of the time when these reports were to be promulgated according to law. In one of the counts it is charged that Holmes was to falsify one of these official cotton crop reports, of which fact his associates were to be advised in advance. All of which information in advance of the publication of the official cotton crop reports was to be used for speculative purposes in the open market.\n Indictment No. 26,089 charges that Haas and Price conspired to bribe Holmes to make this false report, and to furnish them in advance information as to its contents.\n Indictment No. 26,086 charges that Haas and one Frederick A. Peckham conspired with one Van Riper to bribe Holmes to give them advance information of the June report of 1905, while No. 26,087, charges Haas, Peckham, and Holmes with conspiracy to defraud the United States by Holmes giving his co-conspirators advance information as to that report.\n The indictments are of such great length that it is not feasible to set them out in full or to state the substance of their several counts. It is, for the purposes of this case, enough to say that it is averred that the Department of Agriculture includes a Bureau of Statistics, established by law. That one of the governmental functions exercised by that department, particularly through the Statistical Bureau, is the acquirement of detailed information from time to time in respect to the condition of the cotton crop of the country. That this information comes through thousands of correspondents, some official and others not, through the reports of local agents scattered through the cotton region, and through travel- \n\n[216 U.S. 462, 478]\n\u00a0\n ing representatives of the Department. From these and other sources a report is made estimating acreage, condition, and the probable size of the crop. Comparisons with former reports are made, and every explanation furnished which may throw light upon the present condition and prospect of the growing crop. That the purpose is to complete and promulgate at stated times fair, impartial, and reliable reports, and that said reports are issued about the 3d day of the months of June, July, August, September, October, and December. That the information thus officially acquired and compiled, and the estimates thereon, are of value and do greatly affect the market price of the crop. That such reports are required to be submitted to and approved by the Secretary of Agriculture before publication, and that under the custom, practices, and regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture all officers and employees are required to keep secret the information so gathered, and from in any way divulging same or giving out any information forecasting such report in advance of its official approval and promulgation.\n It is averred that the said Holmes was an employee or an official in said department, and in the Bureau of Statistics. That by virtue of his duty as such official and assistant statistician, he acquired much of the information upon which such reports are based, and, as an official, came into knowledge of the probable contents of the regular reports. That neither Haas nor Price had any official connection, and were not authorized to obtain information about such reports in advance of their promulgation. That the conspiracy was to obtain such information from Holmes in advance of general publicity, and to use such information in speculating upon the cotton market, and thereby defraud the United States by defeating, obstructing, and impairing it in the exercise of its governmental function in the regular and official duty of publicly promulgating fair, impartial, and accurate reports concerning the cotton crop. One count charges, in addition, that the conspiracy included the making of a false report, the \n\n[216 U.S. 462, 479]\n\u00a0\n facts to be given by Holmes to his co-conspirators in advance of its publication.\n The counts charging a conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States in substance charge that this was to be accomplished by bribing the said Holmes to induce him to do certain acts in violation of his lawful duty not to give out advance information in respect to the condition of the cotton crop, acquired in the performance of his official duty.\n Do the counts which charge a conspiracy to defraud the United States charge any offense?\n The authority for the indictments charging a conspiracy to defraud is  5440, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3676). Its language is plain and broad:\n'If two or more persons conspire . . . to defraud the United States in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such parties do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, all the parties to such conspiracy shall be liable,' etc.\n\n These counts do not expressly charge that the conspiracy included any direct pecuniary loss to the United States, but, as it is averred that the acquiring of the information and its intelligent computation, with deductions, comparisons, and explanations, involved great expense, it is clear that practices of this kind would deprive these reports of most of their value to the public, and degrade the department in general estimation, and that there would be a real financial loss. But it is not essential that such a conspiracy shall contemplate a financial loss or that one shall result. The statute is broad enough in its terms to include any conspiracy for the purpose of impairing, obstructing, or defeating the lawful function of any department of government. Assuming, as we have, for it has not been challenged, that this statistical side of the Department of Agriculture is the exercise of a function within the purview of the Constitution, it must follow that any conspiracy which is calculated to obstruct or impair its efficiency and destroy the value of its operations and reports as fair, impartial, and reasonably accurate, would be to defraud \n\n[216 U.S. 462, 480]\n\u00a0\n the United States by depriving it of its lawful right and duty of promulgating or diffusing the information so officially acquired in the way and at the time required by law or departmental regulation. That it is not essential to charge or prove an actual financial or property loss to make a case under the statute has been more than once ruled. Hyde v. Shine, \n199 \nU.S. 62, 81\n, 50 S. L. ed. 90, 96, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 760; United States v. Keitel, \n211 \nU.S. 370, 394\n, 53 S. L. ed. 230, 243, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 123; Curley v. United States, 64 C. C. A. 369, 130 Fed. 1; McGregor v. United States, 134 Fed. 195, 69 C. C. A. 477.\n The counts charging a conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, namely, the offense of bribing Holmes to violate his duty as a public official by giving out advance information about the monthly cotton reports, are said not to charge an offense against the United States, because there is no statute which prohibits the giving out of such official secrets in advance of lawful promulgation.\n Section 5451, Rev. Stat.,1 makes it a crime to bribe or offer to bribe 'any officer of the United States,' or 'any person acting for or on behalf of the United States, in any official function, under or by authority of any department or office of the government; . . . to induce him to do or omit to do any act in violation of his lawful duty.' The head of each department is authorized by  161, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 80), 'to prescribe regulations not inconsistent with law for the government of his department, the conduct of its officers and clerks, the distribution and performance of its business, and the . . . preservation of the records, papers, and property appertaining to it.' Such regulations need not be promulgated in any set form, nor in writing.\n In United States v. Macdaniel, 7 Pet. 1, 14, 15, 8 L. ed. 587, 592, it was said of departmental regulations that, 'of necessity, usages have been established in every department of the government, which have become a kind of common law, and regulate the rights and duties of those who act within their respective limits.'\n In Benson v. Henkel, \n198 \nU.S. 1, 11\n, 49 S. L. ed. 919, 922, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 569, a similar question \n\n[216 U.S. 462, 481]\n\u00a0\n arose in an appeal from an order denying a writ of habeas corpus in a removal case. The appellant was charged with a conspiracy to commit an offense by bribing certain clerks of the land office to divulge the contents of certain reports. It was said that these clerks had not been forbidden by any statute to give out such information. Mr. Justice Brown, for the court, said:\n'But it is clearly for the court to say whether every duty to be performed by an official must be designated by statute, or whether it may not be within the power of the head of a department to prescribe regulations for the conduct of the business of his office and the custody of its papers, a breach of which may be treated as an act in violation of the lawful duty of an official or clerk. United States v. Macdaniel, 7 Pet. 1, 14, 8 L. ed. 587, 592.'\n\n We have not dealt with certain minor objections which go to the form of the indictments rather than to the substance. These are matters to be determined in the court where they were found, and are not proper for consideration upon habeas corpus proceeding.\n The exclusion of the evidence taken in Price v. United States, and offered in this case upon the petition for writ of habeas corpus in the circuit court, touching the history of the finding of indictment No. 26, 088, is not a matter which is proper for review on such an appeal as this. So, also, the defense of the statute of limitations. The one defense is matter in abatement and the other of substantive defense, and both are properly matters for the determination of the court into which the indictments were returned and where the case will be tried.\n It is enough to hold, as we do, that the indictments sufficiently charge an offense committed within the District of Columbia to require that the appellant shall be removed to that district for trial. Benson v. Henkel, \n198 U.S. 1\n, 49 L. ed. 919, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 569.\n The introduction of certified copies of the District of Columbia indictments made a prima facie case for removal. That \n\n[216 U.S. 462, 482]\n\u00a0\n case was not overcome by the copies of the New York indictments. That they laid the locus of the conspiracy in a different place from that laid in the District of Columbia indictments is true. But if such indictments are evidence for the purpose of showing that the place of the conspiracy was not in the District of Columbia, such evidence was not, as matter of law, sufficient to overcome the probable cause shown by the District of Columbia indictments. They certainly could not be regarded as admissions by the government. They were, at most, evidence of the opinion of the New York grand jury as to the locus of the conspiracy. But if the fact be that the offense charged in both sets of indictments is identical, and that the locus of the conspiracy is laid in one set as in one district and in the other as in a different district, it is still for the government to determine in which of the two districts it will bring the accused to trial, and of the commissioner to determine whether a prima facie case has been shown that the accused had probably committed an offense in the District of Columbia, which was indictable and triable there. This we have dealt with already, and only refer to it now in connection with the use of the New York indictments as evidence that the offense was not committed in the District of Columbia.\n Upon the whole case, we conclude that the commissioner had jurisdiction, and that no sufficient reason is shown for discharging the appellant.\n Final order denying writ affirmed.\n\n Brewer, J., concurring:\n I concur in affirming the orders of removal in these cases, but my concurrence must not be taken as holding that the indictments will stand the final test of validity or sufficiency. Assuming that there is a doubt in respect to these matters, as I think there is, and as seems to be suggested by the opinion in No. 367, I am of the opinion that such doubt should be \n\n[216 U.S. 462, 483]\n\u00a0\n settled by direct action in the court in which the indictments were returned, and not in removal proceedings.\n Mr. Justice McKenna concurs in the result, but reserves opinion whether the facts alleged in the indictment constitute a conspiracy to defraud the United States. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.

CITY OF BALTIMORE(1910)\nNo. 75\nArgued: January 12, 1910Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n Mr. Shirley Carter for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Sylvan Hayes Lauchheimer, Edgar Allan Poe, and Oscar Leser for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n The city of Baltimore sued to recover from the Hannis Distilling Company, a West Virginia corporation, $18,218.77, of which $9,259.28 was the amount of state and city taxes for 1902 on an assessment of 50,996 barrels of distilled spirits, and $8,959.49 was the sum of state and city taxes for 1903 \n\n[216 U.S. 285, 286]\n\u00a0\n on an assessment of 54,514 barrels of distilled spirits. It was alleged that the spirits assessed were 'in the ownership and possession or custody of said defendant in the city of Baltimore, state of Maryland . . . at the time each assessment was made.' The declaration, as amended, alleged that the taxes sued for had been levied by virtue of 'chapter 704 of the acts of general assembly of Maryland passed at the January session of 1892, as amended by chapter 320 of the acts of the general assembly of Maryland, passed at the January session of 1900.' The provisions thus referred to are embraced in  214 to 224, inclusive, of article 81 of the Code of Public General Laws of Maryland of 1904. Their purpose is indicated by  214 and 215, which are as follows:\n'Sec. 214. There shall be levied and collected upon all distilled spirits in this state, as personal property, the same rate of taxation which is imposed by the laws of the state on other property for state and county purposes.\n\n'Sec. 215. For the purpose of such assessment and collection, it is hereby made the duty of each distiller, and of every owner or proprietor of a bonded or other warehouse in which distilled spirits are stored, and of every person or corporation having custody of such spirits, to make report to the state tax commissioner, on the 1st day of January in each and every year, of all the distilled spirits on hand at such date, and the tax for the ensuing year from the said 1st of January shall be levied and paid on the amount of distilled spirits so in hand, as representing the taxable distilled spirits for such year; provided, however, that the same distilled spirits shall not be taxed twice for the same year.'\n\n By the remaining provisions of the act, the machinery for levying and collecting the taxes for which the act provided was created. Such regulations afforded those interested an opportunity to be heard as to the amount of any assessment, made it the duty of the person having the possession, control, or custody of the spirits assessed to pay the taxes levied thereon, and gave to the persons thus made liable to make \n\n[216 U.S. 285, 287]\n\u00a0\n payment a lien upon the spirits to secure the reimbursement of the taxes paid.\n Because of diversity of citizenship, the defendant removed the case to the circuit court of the United States for the district of Maryland. In that court two pleas to the declaration were filed. By the first, it was alleged that the corporation was not only incorporated under the laws of West Virginia, but had always been exclusively a citizen and resident of that state, and of no other. The corporation, it was averred, was not, at the time when the taxes sued for were levied, the owner of the distilled spirits upon which the levy was made, or any portion thereof, and, indeed, had never at any time since the assessment and levy had any interest, direct or indirect, in the distilled spirits in question. Under these circumstances it was charged 'that under the provisions of article 15 of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution of Maryland, as the same has been construed by the court of appeals of Maryland . . . the respective taxes levied on the assessed value of all of the said barrels of distilled spirits . . . were levied on the owners of said barrels of distilled spirits, who were and are persons other than this defendant, and the said taxes were not and could not have been levied on this defendant.' The plea then proceeded to aver that at all times prior to the day when the assessment had been made, and since, the spirits assessed has been stored in the defendant's bonded warehouse, subject to the acts of Congress applicable to bonded warehouses, and that the defendant had at no time 'any further custody or control of the spirits than is by the acts of Congress applicable to the subject.' The plea further charged that the corporation had no funds in its possession or under its control, belonging to the owners of the spirits, with which to pay the taxes; that the corporation had not agreed to pay them, that it had never borne any other relation to the owners than that of creditor, and therefore there was no right to recover the taxes from the corporation or to compel it to pay them. It \n\n[216 U.S. 285, 288]\n\u00a0\n was specially averred that to compel the corporation to pay the taxes would be to deprive it of its property without due process of law, in violation of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The second plea substantially reiterated the averments of the first, and, in addition, specially alleged that all the persons who owned the distilled spirits resided outside of the state of Maryland, and could not be taxed in personam, and that, by the construction given to the Constitution of the state by the highest court of the state, the property, although situated in the state, was not susceptible of being taxed, and, therefore, the taxes were void, and there was no power to cast upon the corporation the duty of paying them, and to compel the corporation to pay the taxes would be a violation of the due-process clause of the 14th Amendment.\n A demurrer filed by the city to both pleas, on the ground that they stated no defense, was sustained without an opinion. The distilling company electing to stand upon its pleas, judgment was entered against it for the amount of the taxes. Thereupon a writ of error directly from this court was prosecuted upon the assumption that questions under the Constitution of the United States were involved which gave a right to an immediate resort to this court for their solution. Upon the correctness of such assumption our jurisdiction depends. The assumption, however, may not be indulged in simply because it appears from the record that a federal question was averred, if such question be obviously frivolous or plainly unsubstantial, either because it is manifestly devoid of merit, or because its unsoundness so clearly results from the previous decisions of this court as to foreclose the subject and leave no room for the inference that the questions sought to be raised can be the subject of controversy. Leonard v. Vicksburg, S. & P. R. Co. \n198 \nU.S. 416, 421\n, 49 S. L. ed. 1108, 1110, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 750, and cases cited; Delmar Jockey Club v. Missouri, \n210 \nU.S. 324, 335\n, 52 S. L. ed. 1080, 1084, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 702; McGilvra v. Ross, \n215 U.S. 70\n, 54 L. ed.--, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 27.\n The assignments merely charge that error was committed \n\n[216 U.S. 285, 289]\n\u00a0\n in sustaining the demurrer to the pleas, and consequently in refusing to give effect to the alleged rights under the Constitution which the pleas asserted. But the pleas based the claim of Federal right, not merely upon the inherent operation of the law under which the taxes were levied, abstractly considered, but upon limitations which it was assumed were to be treated as embodied in the law in consequence of restrictions on the general power of the state to tax, based upon the construction which it was asserted had been given to a provision in the Bill of Rights in the state Constitution by the court of last resort of the state. And the argument elaborately pressed at bar concerning the assumed Federal question accords with this conception of the pleas, since it does not deny that the act under which the taxes were levied would not be wanting in due process if it had been enacted by a state government possessing normal powers of local taxation, but contends that the act under consideration must be held to be wanting in due process, because its provisions should be construed with reference to the assumed abnormal limitations upon the taxing power of the state of Maryland, above referred to. By the limitation which the argument thus assumes to exist it is urged the government of the state of Maryland, in the exertion of its taxing power, is confined exclusively to the levy of taxes in personam upon the owners of property. Being thus limited by the state Constitution, the argument proceeds to insist that there was no taxing power in the state of Maryland adequate to embrace an assessment of taxes upon a mere custodian of distilled spirits, and consequently that the compelling of a custodian to pay such an imposition, not being within the taxing power, was virtually an exercise of the power of eminent domain, and hence there was such a proposed taking of the money or property of the custodian, without full and adequate compensation, as would constitute a denial of due process of law. In addition, it is elaborately insisted that as by the Constitution of the United States a state may not extend its taxing au- \n\n[216 U.S. 285, 290]\n\u00a0\n thority over nonresidents, it must follow, from the limitations on the taxing power of the state of Maryland, above asserted, that that state, not having the power to tax a nonresident owner of distilled spirits, could not, without a violation of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, by indirection accomplish the same result by imposing the obligation to pay upon the custodian. But back of the abstract theories as to the scope of the state taxing power, upon which these propositions necessarily depend, lies the inquiry whether, for the purposes of this case, in view of the previous decisions of the court of last resort of the state of Maryland, and of this court, dealing with such decisions, it is open to press such theories, and to attempt to make them the basis of the assumed existence of rights under the Constitution of the United States.\n In Carstairs v. Cochran, 95 Md. 495, 52 Atl. 601, suit was brought by Cochran, as treasurer and tax collector, to recover from Carstairs and another the amount of taxes assessed and levied in respect of distilled spirits in a warehouse of the defendants, the assessment and levy having been made under the identical law by virtue of which the assessment and levy here in controversy were made. The court of appeals of Maryland upheld the statute, and consequently sustained the validity of the tax. In opening its opinion, the court said:\n'This appeal constitutes the third attack upon the validity of the act of 1892, chap. 704, as now amended by the act of 1900, chap. 320, being  204 to 213, inclusive [of article 81] of the Supplement to the Public General Code of Maryland, providing for the collection of taxes upon distilled spirits in this state. The appellants admit that all the features of the law which are here assailed upon constitutional grounds were considered by the court in Monticello Distilling Co. v. Baltimore, 90 Md. 416, 45 Atl. 210; and that while the act was there held invalid, as it then stood, because of the failure to provide for a hearing in respect to the valuation to be placed on the \n\n[216 U.S. 285, 291]\n\u00a0\n spirits for the purposes of taxation, it was declared to be 'in other respects free from constitutional objections.\"\n\n After then stating that it was contended that, as the Monticello Case had been decided on the ground that the statute did not provide adequate notice, the declarations of the court in that case, upholding the constitutionality of the law in other respects, were obiter, the court proceeded to consider that contention and hold that it was not well founded, because the reasoning in the Monticello Case concerning the constitutionality of the statute was directly responsive to the contentions made, and therefore involved in the case as presented. Although reaching this conclusion, in view of the court's estimate of the importance of the subject, it nevertheless proceeded to reconsider all the contentions concerning the constitutionality of the statute. As a prelude to the reinvestigation, the court said:\n'The provisions of the act of 1892, chap. 704, were sufficiently detailed in the opinion rendered in Monticello Distilling Co. v. Baltimore, supra, and that statement will be adopted for this case without repeating it here. That act is assailed here as it was there, as fundamentally vicious, and upon precisely the same grounds, with the exception of the want of notice of assessment, which has been cured by the act of 1900, chap. 320. These grounds are twofold: First, that it lays a tax upon property, and not upon the owner of the property; and, second, that it compels one not the owner of the spirits to pay the tax due by the owner, who is usually unknown to the party compelled to pay.'\n\n And after an elaborate consideration of all the contentions, the conclusions reached in the Monticello Case were adhered to and the constitutionality of the statute imposing the tax was reaffirmed. The case was brought to this court (Carstairs v. Cochran, \n193 U.S. 10\n, 48 L. ed. 596, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 318), and the repugnancy of the statute to the Constitution of the United States was elaborately pressed. Preliminarily to a consideration of the Federal questions which were presented for decision, the court at the \n\n[216 U.S. 285, 292]\n\u00a0\n outset declared (p. 16) 'that the statutes in question do not conflict with the Constitution of Maryland is settled by the decisions of its highest court.' In considering the Federal question, it was held that the state of Maryland could, as an exertion of its taxing power, without denial of due process of law, tax tangible property having a situs within its borders, irrespective of the residence of the owner, and could impose, if necessary, the obligation to pay such tax upon the custodian or possessor of such property, giving a lien thereon to secure the reimbursement of the tax so paid. It was moreover expressly held that neither the regulations contained in the laws of the United States concerning bonded warehouses for the storage of distilled spirits, or the fact that the custodian in whose warehouse such spirits were stored had issued negotiable receipts for the same, operated to prevent the assessment of the spirits for state taxation, and the imposing of the duty to make payment of the tax upon the warehouseman. Since the decision in the Carstairs Case, the right of a state, consistently with the Constitution of the United States, to tax tangible property having a situs within its borders, irrespective of the residence of the owner, and to impose the duty on a warehouseman to pay a tax upon distilled spirits in his custody, even although the warehouse in which they were stored was bonded under the laws of the United States, has been again upheld in Thompson v. Kentucky, \n209 U.S. 340\n, 52 L. ed. 822, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 533.\n It follows that at the time the writ of error directly from this court was sued out, upon the assumed theory that the Maryland act imposing the taxes sued for was repugnant to the due-process clause of the Constitution of the United States, such contention had been expressly decided to be without foundation by this court, and therefore the propositions of Federal right upon which alone the jurisdiction of this court depended was foreclosed and not open to controversy, and afforded no substantial basis for the writ of error, unless, for some of the reasons alleged by counsel, the case is taken out of this general principle. \n\n[216 U.S. 285, 293]\n\u00a0\n To accomplish such result, the argument is that, in Carstairs v. Cochran, this court erroneously, although unwittingly, assumed that the law of the state of Maryland levying the tax which was in question in that case, and which is the same law and character of tax involved in this case, had been upheld by the Maryland court of last resort as a valid exercise of the state taxing power. This alleged oversight, it is suggested, arose from the fact that the court overlooked the 'singular limitations' on the taxing power of the state of Maryland, which, as we have previously seen, it is asserted, results from a provision in the Bill of Rights of the Constitution of that state, by which it insisted the state is bereft of general powers of taxation, and is limited strictly to taxing the owners of property in personam. Before further noticing this theory, we briefly advert to an attempt to support the suggestion of oversight alleged to have occurred in the decision in the Carstairs Case by reference to the subsequent case of Corry v. Baltimore, \n196 U.S. 466\n, 49 L. ed. 556, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 297. The Corry Case did not concern the Maryland law here in question, but involved the constitutionality of a tax imposed by the state of Maryland upon the shares of stock in a domestic corporation held by a nonresident of the state, which were assessed at the domicil of the corporation, accompanied with the obligation upon the corporation to pay the tax. The principal contention was that the tax was repugnant to the due-process clause of the 14th Amendment, because, as the complainant stockholder was a nonresident of Maryland, the tax was an attempt to extend the taxing power of the state over a person not subject to its jurisdiction. The court, while recognizing that the Maryland court had decided that the tax in question was not upon the stock in rem or upon the corporation, but was upon the owner, nevertheless decided that the tax was not wanting in due process, because the situs of the stock for the purpose of taxation was in effect fixed by the act of incorporation by which the stockholder was bound, and that the right thus to tax at the domicil of the corporation carried with it \n\n[216 U.S. 285, 294]\n\u00a0\n as an incident the regulating power to compel the corporation to pay. Because it was recognized that the court below had decided that the tax there in question was in personam, and, accepting the complexion given to the tax by the court of last resort of Maryland, it was held not to be repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, lends even no semblance of support to the proposition that thereby it was in the remotest degree intimated that the Carstairs Case was mistakenly decided, or that, in disregard of the ruling made by the Maryland court in the Carstairs Case, it was intended to intimate that the burden which the court in that case had sustained as an exercise of the taxing power of the state of Maryland was not the exertion of such authority. And this serves to demonstrate the unsubstantial character of the contention concerning the limitation of the state taxing power, as applied to the case before us, by which alone the semblance of support for the existence of a Federal question necessary to confer jurisdiction upon this court can be evolved. Beyond dispute, in the Carstairs Case the court of last resort of Maryland upheld the act here in controversy as an exertion of the taxing power of the state, and in so doing declared that it but reiterated and reexpounded rulings by it previously made. It follows that, as for the purposes of a review by this court of alleged questions concerning the repugnancy of the taxing act to the Constitution of the United States, the decision of the state court, maintaining, under the state Constitution, the validity of the taxing power which the act exerted, was binding upon this court, it must result that contentions to the contrary are so devoid of merit as to present no substantial Federal question. Castillo v. McConnico, \n168 U.S. 674\n, 42 L. ed. 622, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 229. Indeed, considered in its ultimate aspect, the entire argument by which it is sought to evolve a supposed Federal question, and thus to escape the controlling effect of the decision of this court in the Carstairs Case, rests upon the assumption that the conclusion of the state court in that case as to the validity of the taxing act under the state Constitution was not \n\n[216 U.S. 285, 295]\n\u00a0\n sustained by the reasoning which the court gave for its conclusion, or that the reasoning was inherently unsound because it proceeded upon a misconception of the state Constitution. In other words, the only possible foundation for the asserted Federal question is the conception that this court would usurp the functions of a state court of last resort in order to distort, if not to destroy, for infirmity of state power, a state law expressly upheld as valid by the state court of last resort.\n Dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","58":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHARDING v.

The cases were then brought here by appeal.\n From this statement it will appear that the appellants were convicted in a court of competent jurisdiction of the alleged offense charged in the indictment; that a trial was had before a court and jury, which was reviewed by proper proceedings in error in the circuit court of appeals for the fifth circuit, and that this court declined to grant a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the latter court.\n The cases have been earnestly and elaborately argued here by counsel for appellants, upon the theory that, in a proceeding of this character, the court may inquire into the facts put in evidence at the trial, at least, so far as is necessary to determine whether there was any inculpating testimony, and for that purpose may examine the bill of exceptions, which it appended to the petition, and which was originally taken for the purpose of bringing the voluminous testimony in the cases into the record in order that a review might be had by the appellate court. \n\n[218 U.S. 442, 445]\n\u00a0\n It is contended that an examination of the bill of exceptions will disclose that the alleged conspiracy was not formed in the northern district of Florida, as laid in the indictment; that there is a total lack of evidence to connect the petitioners with any such conspiracy; that the petitioners (notably the petitioner Harlan) are not shown by any competent testimony to have been concerned in any overt act for the carrying out of the alleged conspiracy; that it is not shown that there is any condition of peonage in which Lanninger had been detained, and to which he could be returned, in violation of  5526 of the Revised Statutes of the United States. In other words, in this feature of the case this court is asked to review the testimony adduced at the trial, with a view to determining the lack of evidence in the record to support the verdict and judgment, although such matters were properly reviewable, and were in fact reviewed, in the error proceedings already referred to.\n It is the settled doctrine of this court, often affirmed, that the writ of habeas corpus cannot be used for the purpose of proceedings in error, and that the jurisdiction under that writ is confined to an examination of the record, with a view to determining whether the person restrained of his liberty is detained without authority of law. Gonzales v. Cunningham, \n164 \nU.S. 612, 621\n, 41 S. L. ed. 572, 575, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 182; Re Schneider, \n148 U.S. 162\n, 37 L. ed. 406; 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 572; Whitney v. Dick, \n202 \nU.S. 132, 136\n, 50 S. L. ed. 963, 964, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 584; Toy Toy v. Hopkins, \n212 \nU.S. 542, 548\n, 53 S. L. ed. 644, 646, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 416; Re Wilson, \n140 \nU.S. 575, 582\n, 35 S. L. ed. 513, 516, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 870.\n But it is contended that two recent cases in this court are authority for the proposition that, in a collateral attack by a habeas corpus proceeding, while the weight of testimony cannot be examined into, the record may be investigated with a view of determining whether there is any testimony to support the accusation; and where there is an entire lack of evidence, the court may order a discharge, and language to this effect is referred to in the \n\n[218 U.S. 442, 446]\n\u00a0\n opinion in Hyde v. Shine, \n199 U.S. 84\n, 50 L. ed. 97, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 764, wherein the learned justice, delivering the opinion of the court, said: 'In the Federal courts, however, it is well settled that upon habeas corpus the court will not weigh the evidence, although, if there is an entire lack of evidence to support the accusation, the court may order his discharge.'\n That case was a proceeding in habeas corpus to attack the validity of an order made under  1014 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 716), for the removal of the petitioner from the state of California to the District of Columbia for trial upon an indictment found in the District. In that case it was contended that, inasmuch as  1014 requires proceedings for the removal of persons from one district to another to be agreeable to the usual mode of process against defendants in such state, and as in the state of California, where the prisoner was arrested, the supreme court had held that the question of probable cause of the prisoner's guilt might be considered upon the writ of habeas corpus, it necessarily followed that such should be the course of procedure in the Federal courts. In answer to this contention, the language above quoted was used. In so stating, the learned judge, speaking for the court, was but affirming the rule well established under  1014, that there must be some testimony before the commissioner to support the accusation in order to lay the basis for an order of removal, otherwise the accused could be discharged upon habeas corpus, although the court would not weigh the evidence where the record shows that some evidence was taken. This was the construction of  1014 in Greene v. Henkel, \n183 \nU.S. 249, 261\n, 46 S. L. ed. 177, 189, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 218. In Greene v. Henkel, Mr. Justice Peckham, speaking for the court, said: 'There must be some competent evidence to show that an offense has been committed over which the court in the other district had jurisdiction, and that the defendant is the individual named in the charge, and that there is probable cause for believing him guilty of the \n\n[218 U.S. 442, 447]\n\u00a0\n offense charged.' In the case of Hyde v. Shine the justice was but declaring the rule already recognized and enforced under  1014 of the Revised Statutes.\n So, in the other case relied upon, Tinsley v. Treat, \n205 U.S. 20\n, 51 L. ed. 689, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 430, it was held, under the circumstances shown, that a prisoner would be released upon habeas corpus where the proceedings were under  1014 of the Revised Statutes. It was held that while an indictment constitutes prima facie evidence of the offense, when the defendant offered to show that no offense had been committed triable in the district to which removal was sought, the exclusion of such evidence was not mere error, but a denial of a right secured under the Federal Constitution to be tried in the state and district where the alleged offense was committed, and therefore reviewable under habeas corpus proceedings. Neither Hyde v. Shine nor Tinsley v. Treat is authority for the proposition that a writ of habeas corpus can be made the basis of a review of the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, where proceedings were had under a constitutional statute giving the court authority to examine into the charges, and to convict or acquit the accused, when the proceedings show no attempt to exert the jurisdiction of the court in excess of its authority.\n The learned counsel for appellants rely upon a number of cases which are said to warrant the court in habeas corpus proceedings in examining the bill of exceptions with a view to determining such matters as are herein presented. But an examination of these cases will show that where collateral attacks have been sustained through the medium of a writ of habeas corpus, the grounds were such as attacked the validity of the judgments, and the objections sustained were such as rendered the judgment not merely erroneous, but void. In Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 21 L. ed. 872, the court undertook to impose a second punishment where it had already exhausted its power in \n\n[218 U.S. 442, 448]\n\u00a0\n imposing one of the alternative penalties allowed by law. In Re Snow, \n120 U.S. 274\n, 30 L. ed. 658, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 556, the record disclosed that it was sought to impose a second punishment for the same offense. In Ex parte Bain, \n121 U.S. 1\n, 30 L. ed. 849, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 781, 6 Am. Crim. Rep. 122, it was held that the court was without power to order an amendment of the indictment without a submission of the case to the grand jury, and that subsequent proceedings upon an indictment thus changed were without jurisdiction. In Re Nielsen, \n131 U.S. 176\n, 33 L. ed. 118, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 672, it was held that the court exceeded its authority in undertaking to pass the particular sentence imposed. We find nothing in these cases to conflict with the well-established rule in this court that the writ of habeas corpus cannot be made to perform the office of a writ of error.\n If such would be its effect, then this court could readily be converted into an appellate court in criminal proceedings,-a jurisdiction denied to it by the statute. No attack can be successfully made upon the right and authority of the circuit court of the United States to take jurisdiction of the offense charged in the indictment. No objection is made to the constitutionality of the statute, or the right and authority of the court to consider and determine the guilt or innocence of the accused, and for that purpose to weigh and determine the effect of the testimony offered. The contention is that, in the respects pointed out, the testimony wholly fails to support the charge. The attack is thus not upon the jurisdiction and authority of the court to proceed to investigate and determine the truth of the charge, but upon the sufficiency of the evidence to show the guilt of the accused. This has never been held to be within the province of a writ of habeas corpus. Upon habeas corpus the court examines only the power and authority of the court to act, not the correctness of its conclusions. See, among other cases in this court, Ex parte Kearney, 7 Wheat. 38, 5 L. ed. 391; Ex parte Terry, \n128 \nU.S. 289, 306\n, 32 S. L. ed. 405, 409, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 77; Davis v. Beason, \n133 U.S. 333\n, 33 L. ed. 637, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 299, 8 Am. Crim. Rep. 89; \n\n[218 U.S. 442, 449]\n\u00a0\n Ex parte Parks, \n93 \nU.S. 18, 22\n, 23 S., 23 L. ed. 787-789; Kazio v. Henry, \n211 \nU.S. 146, 148\n, 53 S. L. ed. 125, 126, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 41.\n We will proceed, then, to examine such of the objections as go to the authority of the court to try and sentence the accused. It is insisted that the trial in the circuit court of the United States at Pensacola, Florida, was without jurisdiction, because the trial took place when the court had no lawful authority to sit, as it was not held at any legal term of court. It is contended that the right to hold a term at Pensacola because of the proceedings disclosed in the record had ended before the accused were tried at the session beginning in November, 1906. It appears that the regular term of court at Pensacola commenced on March 3, 1906, continued in session until May 12, 1906. The clerk of the court testified that the court was in session in Tallahassee, held by the same judge as held the court at Pensacola, on May 13, 14, 15, and 16, 1906. It appears that the clerk was in the habit of using a rubber stamp for the purpose of evidencing the adjournments of the court, and also the adjournments from day to day when the court was not present. These adjournments appear to have been in accordance with a rule of the court which provides that, during the temporary porary absence of the judge, the court shall be deemed open daily at each of the clerk's offices in the district for the transaction of business on the equity side of the court, and also for the filing of papers, and the transaction of business of a general character in court, and the clerk shall be present, in person or by deputy, and the record of the same shall be entered upon the minutes of the court.\n Such adjournments were had from June 6, 1906, the last day the judge was present at Pensacola, until he returned to the circuit court for the northern district of Florida in November, 1906, subsequent to which time the indictment, trial, and conviction of the appellants took place. The argument of the appellants comes to this,- \n\n[218 U.S. 442, 450]\n\u00a0\n that as there was no legal adjournment of the term at Pensacola to a day certain when the court proceeded to hold the term at Tallahassee, there was no legal authority to resume the sitting of the court at Pensacola in November, and consequently there was no legal term of the court at which the proceeding resulting in the conviction of the accused could be had.\n But we cannot agree to this contention. The statutes of the United States provide for two terms of the United States circuit court for the northern district of Florida, the one beginning on the first Monday of February, at Tallahassee, the other the first Monday in March, at Pensacola. U. S. Rev. Stat.  658, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 531. Section 612 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 494) provides that the circuit courts of the United States can be held at the same time in different districts of the same circuit. Section 672 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 546) provides that if neither of the judges of the circuit court be present to open and adjourn any regular or adjourned special session, either of them may, by a written order, directed alternatively to the marshal, and, in his absence, to the clerk, adjourn the court from time to time, as the case may require, to any time before the next regular term. We think the purpose of the law was to provide for statutory terms of court for the northern district of Florida, beginning on the first Monday of February and March, respectively, which term should continue until the beginning of the next term, unless finally adjourned in the meantime. Such is the general and recognized practice in the circuit courts of the United States. East Tennessee Iron & Coal Co. v. Wiggin, 15 C. C. A. 510, 37 U. S. App. 129, 68 Fed. 446.\n There was certainly no adjournment of the court for the term when the judge was absent, holding court at Tallahassee, or was out of the state. There was an attempt, at least, to keep the court open pending the absence of the presiding judge by the adjournments in pursuance of rule 13. \n\n[218 U.S. 442, 451]\n\u00a0\n Nor do we find anything in the objections made to the manner in which the record of the sessions was kept, which it is unnecessary to examine in further detail, it being sufficient to say that we think the court that sat in November, 1906, was legally in session, with authority to proceed against the accused.\n It is next objected that the order for the impaneling of the grand jury was made by a judge of the circuit court for the fifth circuit, who, although within his circuit, was not within the district where the court was located when the trial was had. If there were otherwise merit in this objection, it certainly could not be made on habeas corpus. Such objections must be made by proper pleas filed in the court of original jurisdiction. Kaizo v. Henry, \n211 \nU.S. 146, 149\n, 53 S. L. ed. 125, 126, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 41.\n It is contended that competent testimony was adduced to show that the indictments were not properly presented by the grand jury, in that the one under which the accused was tried was not regularly found by the grand jury nor voted upon by them. Testimony was introduced to the effect that, after the presentation of the original indictment, the grand jury were informed by the district attorney that the indictment needed amendment in some particular, this amendment was read over in the presence of the grand jury, was incorporated into an indictment, the indictment was regularly returned into court, where it was produced with the consent of all the grand jurors. No objection was taken at the trial to the indictment for this reason, and upon proper pleas a trial and conviction were had; certainly an objection of that kind, if ever available, cannot be made for the first time in a habeas corpus proceeding.\n It was objected in the court below that the original sentence exceeded the authority of the court, in that it required service at hard labor. Upon motion of the government's counsel, that much of the sentence was stricken \n\n[218 U.S. 442, 452]\n\u00a0\n OUT. THERE IS NO CONTENTION THAT HARD LAbor has Been, or will be, imposed upon the appellants, and, at most, only that part of the sentence in excess of the law will be void. United States v. Pridgeon, \n153 U.S. 48\n, 38 L. ed. 631, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 746.\n We find no error in the judgments of the Circuit Court in refusing to release the petitioners upon the writs of habeas corpus, and the same will be affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","60":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHARRIS v. FIRST NAT BANK(1910)\nNo. 98\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles S. Todd, George Q. McGown, John A. Hurley, and T. E. Webber for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. W. L. Estes, Hiram Glass, John J. King, and A. L. Burford for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case presents the single question of the jurisdiction of the district court of the United States to entertain a suit \n\n[216 U.S. 382, 383]\n\u00a0\n brought by Harris, as trustee in bankruptcy, against the First National Bank of Mount Pleasant, Texas.\n The petition alleged that Hargrove, the bankrupt, was indebted to the defendant bank for an overdraft in the sum of $2,000; that, to secure the payment of the same, Hargrove delivered into the bank's possession as collateral security certain notes; that, at the time of the adjudication in bankruptcy, Hargrove had paid the overdraft in full.\n Further, the petition alleged that, at the time Hargrove was adjudged a bankrupt, the bank had in its possession two certain promissory notes, which had been signed by one McGee as principal and by Hargrove as surety. That prior to the bankruptcy Hargrove paid the notes, and thus became entitled to the same. That defendant refuses to account for said notes, and wrongfully withholds them from the trustee. The prayer of the petition is that the bank be required to surrender to the trustee the notes so pledged as collateral security, and also the notes paid by Hargrove as surety, or, in default thereof, judgment against the bank in the sum of $3, 500, the value of all the notes. Upon issue made as to its jurisdiction, the district court held it was without jurisdiction, and dismissed the suit.\n In Bardes v. First Nat. Bank, \n178 U.S. 524\n, 44 L. ed. 1175, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1000, this court held that under  23 of the bankruptcy act of 1898 [30 Stat. at L. 544, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3418], the district court of the United States could, by the consent of the defendant, and not otherwise, entertain suits by the trustee against third persons to recover property conveyed by the bankrupt before the institution of proceedings in bankruptcy.\n Subsequently, Congress, by the act of February 5, 1903 (32 Stat. at L. 797, chap. 487, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 1308), amended certain sections of the bankruptcy act. To  23b, which provided that suits by the trustee should only be brought in courts where the bankrupt, whose estate was being administered by the trustee might have brought them if proceedings in bankruptcy had not been instituted, unless by the defendant's consent, these words were added: 'Except suits for the recovery of property \n\n[216 U.S. 382, 384]\n\u00a0\n under section sixty, subdivision b, and section sixty-seven, subdivision e.'\n Subdivision b of  60 made provision for the recovery of preferences given by the bankrupt within four months before the filing of the petition in bankruptcy. To that subdivision these words were added: 'And, for the purpose of such recovery, any court of bankruptcy, as hereinbefore defined, and any state court which would have had jurisdiction if bankruptcy had not intervened, shall have concurrent jurisdiction.'\n Subdivision e of  67 made provision for setting aside fraudulent conveyances, and the recovery of property so conveyed at the suit of the trustee. To that subdivision these words were added: 'For the purpose of such recovery, any court of bankruptcy, as hereinbefore defined, and any state court which would have had jurisdiction if bankruptcy had not intervened, shall have concurrent jurisdiction.'\n A consideration of these amendments, having reference to the recovery of preferences and of property fraudulently conveyed, shows that they cannot include the action under consideration here. Nor is it claimed that they are sufficient of themselves to authorize the present suit. Reliance is had on the amendment made by the act of February 5, 1903, of subdivision e of  70. We give that subdivision, putting the amendment in italics:\n'e. The trustee may avoid any transfer by the bankrupt of his property which any creditor of such bankrupt might have avoided, and may recover the property so transferred, or its value, from the person to whom it was transferred, unless he was a bona fide holder for value prior to the date of the adjudication. Such property may be recovered or its value collected from whoever may have received it, except a bona fide holder for value. For the purpose of such recovery, any court of bankruptcy, as hereinbefore defined, and any state court which would have had jurisdiction if bankruptcy had not intervened, shall have concurrent jurisdiction.'\n\n It is to be noted that  70, subdivision e, is not mentioned in the \n\n[216 U.S. 382, 385]\n\u00a0\n amendment to  23, enlarging the jurisdiction of the Federal court to entertain suits without the consent of the defendant. And it has been held that suits under  70, subdivision e, can only be brought in a court of bankruptcy with the consent of the defendant. Hull v. Burr, 83 C. C. A. 61, 153 Fed. 945. The contrary view was taken in Hurley v. Devlin, 149 Fed. 268.\n But we do not find it necessary to pass upon that question. Assuming for this purpose that actions may be brought by trustees in the courts of bankruptcy in cases coming within the terms of  70, subdivision e, without the consent of defendant, we do not think the present action is one of that character.\n That subdivision provides for avoiding transfers of the bankrupt's property which his creditors might have avoided, and for recovery of such property, or its value, from persons who are not bona fide holders for value. In this action, no such transfer is alleged; no attack is made upon a transfer by the bankrupt which would have been void as to creditors. The petition seeks to recover property held by the bank, if the allegations are true, which belonged to the bankrupt, and consequently passed to the trustee as the representative of the bankrupt's estate. The recovery sought is of property held for the bankrupt estate, which the defendant wrongfully refused to surrender. The District Court was right in denying jurisdiction of the suit, and its judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","61":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHAWAIIAN TRUST CO. v.

January 24, 1910, suggestion of death of appellee, and substitution of Hannah Martin Von Holt, as trustee, appellee. \n\n[216 U.S. 367, 368]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n These are bills in equity, brought by the respondents, trustees under the will of James Campbell, for instructions as to the meaning of a clause in the will. James Campbell died on April 21, 1900, leaving large amounts of real and personal property. His will was proved on June 26, 1900. By it the same persons were made, first, executors, and afterwards trustees. On July 3, 1905, a decree of distribution was made, discharging the executors, and ordering them to turn the property over to themselves as trustees. The testator left a widow and children, and the question before the court is whether the widow, the appellant, is entitled to any part of the income from realty before the same came to the trustees' hands. The bill in No. 106 originally raised other questions, but the widow is the only appellant, and what we have stated is the single matter here. The supreme court decided against the appellant on the merits in 106, the principal case. 18 Haw. 34. The bill in 107 was filed after the decree in 106, on the notion that the decree did not fix the time when the widow's income from realty began. The supreme court regarded the matter as res judicata, but discussed the merits again, and then affirmed a decree dismissing the bill. 18 Haw. 342.\n By the first clause of the will, the executors were to reduce all the estate, real and personal, to possession, to collect the income thereof 'pending the distribution thereof,' as thereinafter provided, and to have the value adjudged. By the second, they were to pay the debts and funeral expenses. By the third, there was given to the widow a sum of money equal to one third of the value of the personal property only, adjudged as above, after payment of debts, etc. This sum was to be paid in cash, and if the condition of the estate should not warrant the payment of the whole at one time, then it was to be paid 'as rapidly as the income and interests of my estate shall permit, without the sale of any real estate, or \n\n[216 U.S. 367, 369]\n\u00a0\n the sacrifice of any personal property, as a means of raising such sum, but provided that the entire sum be paid within two years from the date of my decease, and no deferred payments shall, within said period of two years, draw any interest.' The fourth clause gives the use and occupation of the testator's dwelling house and grounds, furniture, horses, carriages, etc., to the widow, and to the children so long as they remain unmarried, and the executors or trustees are to keep the house and grounds in suitable condition and repair at the charge of the estate; with further details. The fifth clause directs the executors to pay to the widow, 'for the use of herself and our children, as a family allowance, such sum, monthly,' as may be decreed by the probate court, and the trustees, after entering upon their functions, are to make such further provision for the maintenance of the children as is thereinafter directed. By the sixth clause, after satisfying the second and third, the executors 'shall, as soon as may be, conclude the probate proceedings hereunder, and obtain a decree of distribution of my estate,' and the testator gives to the trustees and to those living and resident within the Hawaiian Islands at the date of such decree, all the residue of the estate not before otherwise devised or bequeathed.\n The trusts, so far as material, after a further provision in clause seven as to the house and grounds and their contents, are as follows: 'Eighth. With respect to all property which shall be so distributed to them,' except that mentioned in seven, the trustees are to reduce it to possession and manage it, paying charges and their own commissions. 'And to collect all the rents, issues, profits, income, and revenue thereof . . . and to invest and reinvest, and keep invested,' and at will to change the investment of any and all moneys that shall come to their hands by virtue hereof,' not otherwise specially disposed of, 'and to segregate, and keep separate and apart (during the life of my wife) the accounts of and pertaining to the realty of my estate from the accounts pertaining to any and all other thereof.' 'Ninth. And from \n\n[216 U.S. 367, 370]\n\u00a0\n and out of the net income, rents, issues, and profits of and from the realty last aforesaid, said trustees shall pay the equal one third part or portion thereof, in semiannual or (at the discretion of said trustees) more frequent payments, to my said wife, for and during the remainder of her natural life.' Habendum to her absolutely. By the tenth clause the remaining two thirds of the net income 'from said realty' are given to the children, with a proviso for their minority and making surplus revenues capital. Finally, the sixteenth clause states that the provision made for the widow 'is intended, and shall be by her accepted (if at all), in lieu and full satisfaction of her dower interest in my estate.'\n It will be seen from the dates of the probate of the will, June 26, 1900, and of the decree turning over the property to the trustees, July 3, 1905, that probably a longer time was taken to finish the administration than the testator expected, and that if the widow did not have a right to her third of the income from the real estate until in fact the estate went to the trustees, she will lose a considerable sum that has accumulated in the meantime. The loss is made the more aggravating that the estate seems to have been ready for distribution on February 10, 1902. Nevertheless, we think that any doubts are artificial, and agree with the supreme court of Hawaii that the language of the will is too clear to admit any interpretaton but one. It is said that the provision is in lieu of dower, and that the will, as construed, leaves her worse off than if there had been no will. Whether that would be so or not, if we take into account that she is one of the executors and trustees, getting her share of the commissions, we do not know, or think of much importance. The testator seems to treat it as an open question whether she will accept the provision. However that may be, the words are explicit. The eighth clause purports to deal only with the 'property which shall be so distributed to them.' That phrase dominates the whole clause. It is the rents 'thereof' that they are to collect, as by clause one the executors were to collect all in- \n\n[216 U.S. 367, 371]\n\u00a0\n come before distribution; the accounts pertaining to the realty, that is the realty so distributed to them, are to be kept separate, and the ninth clause gives the widow one third of the income of 'the realty last aforesaid.' It is argued that, under the earlier clauses, the realty and accrued income would be kept intact, and that it is reasonable to suppose that the testator meant his wife to have one third of the income of the land, as she had one third of the personalty. It might be reasonable to suppose so if the testator had not declared in terms what he meant. What he gave was not one third of the income [of the realty] generally, as in Lovering v. Minot, 9 Cush. 151, and as it was taken to be by the probate judge, but one third of the income of the realty 'last aforesaid,'-that is, the realty distributed to the trustees. It was one third of the income of the realty in the hands of the trustees, the income collected by them from it, and of which they were to keep a separate account. Perhaps the testator thought that the family allowance provided in clause five would be a sufficient substitute during the relatively short time for which he thought that the administration would last. Perhaps he did not think of the event that has happened at all. It would seem that the widow had herself partly to blame for the delay between February 10, 1902, and July 3, 1905, as she was an executrix and trustee. At all events, we are of opinion that she took no income from real estate, eo nomine, before July 3, 1905, and did take her share from that date.\n Decrees affirmed. \n\n\n\n","62":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHEIKE v. U S(1910)\nNo. 849\nArgued: Decided: May 2, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. John B. Stanchfield, George S. Graham, and John C. Spooner for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[217 U.S. 423, 426]\n\u00a0\n Solicitor General Bowers and Messrs. Henry L. Stimson and Felix Frankfurter for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff in error, Charles R. Heike, was indicted with others on January 10, 1910, for alleged violations of the customs laws of the United States in connection with the fraudulent importation of sugar, and also for conspiracy under  5440 of the Revised Statutes of the United States ( U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3676), to defraud the United States of its revenues. Heike appeared and filed a special plea in bar, claiming immunity from prosecution under the act of February 25, 1903 (32 Stat. at L. 1904, chap. 755, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 1142), as amended June 30, 1906 (34 Stat. at L. 798, chap. 3920, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 1168). The plea set up in substance that Heike had been called upon to \n\n[217 U.S. 423, 427]\n\u00a0\n testify before the grand jury in matters concerning the prosecution against him, and had thereby become immune from prosecution under the law. The government filed a replication, taking issue upon the matters set up in the plea. The issues thus raised were brought to trial before a jury in the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York, and at the conclusion of the testimony, the government and the defendant each moved for direction of a verdict, and the court thereupon instructed the jury to find the issues joined in favor of the government. Upon application by Heike, he was granted the privilege of pleading over, and he thereupon entered a plea of not guilty, and the case was set for trial on March 1, 1910. No judgment having been entered in the case, mandamus proceedings were brought in this court, and in pursuance of its order a judgment nunc pro tunc was entered as of February 14, 1910, as follows: 'Judgment be and is hereby entered for the United States upon the verdict, with leave to the defendant to plead over.'\n On February 25, 1910, a writ of error was allowed to the circuit court from this court by one of its justices. The government then moved to vacate the order allowing the writ. That motion was overruled, and the government made the present motion to dismiss the writ of error, upon the ground that the judgment entered as of February 14, 1910, is not a final judgment within the meaning of the court of appeals act.\n The motion to dismiss brings to the attention of the court the important question of practice as to whether, after a judgment has been entered upon a verdict setting up the plea of immunity under the act of February 25, 1903, as amended June 30, 1906, finding the issues against the defendant, with leave given to plead over, and a plea of not guilty entered, on which no trial has been had, such judgment is, or is not, a final judgment, reviewable by writ of error \n\n[217 U.S. 423, 428]\n\u00a0\n from this court where a constitutional question is involved, under  5 of the act of March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. at L. 826, chap. 517, U. S. Comp Stat. 1901, p. 488).\n The appellate jurisdiction in the Federal system of procedure is purely statutory. American Constr. Co. v. Jacksonville, T. & K. W. R. Co. \n148 \nU.S. 372, 378\n, 37 S. L. ed. 486, 489, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 158. For many years it did not exist in criminal cases. It has been granted by statute in certain cases; and criminal cases in which are involved a deprivation of constitutional rights may be brought to this court by writ of error under  5 of the court of appeals act. Burton v. United States, \n196 U.S. 283\n, 49 L. ed. 482, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 243.\n In the case at bar, it is the contention of the plaintiff in error that he was deprived of the constitutional right of trial by jury in the direction by the court that the jury find a verdict against him upon his plea in bar. The question, then, is, Is the judgment entered nunc pro tunc as of February 14, 1910, a reviewable one under the statute? That judgment in effect denied the validity of the plea in bar, and left the defendant to plead over, which he did, putting in issue the averments of the indictment.\n The construction of  5 of the court of appeals act was before this court in the case of McLish v. Roff, \n141 U.S. 661\n, 35 L. ed. 893, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 118, and it was there held that the allowance of appeals or writs of error under that section must be understood to have the meaning which those terms had always had under acts of Congress relating to the appellate jurisdiction of this court, and that, taken in that sense, appeals or writs of error could only be allowed in cases in which there had been a final judgment. Mr. Justice Lamar, who spoke for the court in that case, pointed out that under the judiciary act of 1789 [1 Stat. at L. 73, chap. 20] no appeal would lie to this court except from final judgments or decrees; and further stated that this was only declaratory of the settled practice of England, where no writ of error would lie except from a final judgment; and if the writ was made returnable before such judgment, it would be quashed; and in this connection, speaking for the court, the learned justice said:\n'From the very foundation of our judicial system, the ob- \n\n[217 U.S. 423, 429]\n\u00a0\n ject and policy of the acts of Congress in relation to appeals and writs of error . . . have been to save the expense and delays of repeated appeals in the same suit, and to have the whole case and every matter in controversy in it decided in a single appeal.'\n\n McLish v. Roff, supra, has been followed and approved in this court. American Constr. Co. v. Jacksonville, T. & K. W. R. Co. \n148 U.S. 372\n, 37 L. ed. 486, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 158; Kirwan v. Murphy, \n170 \nU.S. 205, 209\n, 42 S. L. ed. 1009, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 592; Ex parte National Enameling & Stamping Co. \n201 U.S. 156\n, 50 L. ed. 707, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 404.\n It may, therefore, be regarded as the settled practice of this court that a case cannot be brought here by piecemeal, and is only to be reviewed here after final judgment by direct appeal or writ of error in a limited class of cases under  5 of the court of appeals act.\n It is unnecessary to enter upon a full consideration of what constitutes a final judgment,-a subject of much discussion. The definition of a final judgment or decree was tersely stated by Mr. Chief Justice Waite in St. Louis, I M. & S. R. Co. v. Southern Exp. Co. \n108 \nU.S. 24, 28\n, 27 S. L. ed. 638, 639, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 6, in these terms: 'A decree is final for the purposes of an appeal to this court when it terminates the litigation between the parties on the merits of the case, and leaves nothing to be done but to enforce by execution what has been determined.'\n If we apply the definition herein contained of a final judgment or decree, it appears certain that the judgment of respondeat ouster, leaving the case with issue joined upon the plea of not guilty, does not dispose of the whole matter litigated in this proceeding, leaving nothing to be done except the ministerial act of executing the judgment. The thing litigated in this case is the right to convict the accused of the crime charged in the indictment. Certainly that issue has not been disposed of, much less has a final order been made concerning it, leaving nothing but an execution of it yet undone. The defendant was indicted for the crime alleged, and, being apprehended, he had a right to raise an issue of law upon the indictment by demurrer, to plead in bar, or to plead the general \n\n[217 U.S. 423, 430]\n\u00a0\n issue. He chose to plead in bar immunity from prosecution by reason of the statute referred to. That issue was, by direction of the court, whether properly or improperly, held against him, and the verdict of the jury and the judgment of respondeat ouster duly entered. At the common law, upon the failure of such plea in a case of misdemeanor, it was usual at once to sentence the defendant as upon conviction of guilt of the offense charged. In cases of felony it was usual to permit a plea of not guilty after judgment over. In the case at bar, the record shows after the return of the verdict, the plaintiff in error's counsel asked to be permitted to plead, and was allowed that privilege. As the case now stands, upon the plea of not guilty, upon which the issue raised must be tried to a jury, certainly the whole matter has not been disposed of. It may be that upon trial the defendant will be acquitted on the merits. It may happen that, for some reason, the trial will never take place. In either of these events there can be no conclusive judgment against the defendant in the case. It is true that, in a certain sense, an order concerning a controlling question of law made in a case is, as to that question, final. Many interlocutory rulings and orders effectually dispose of some matters in controversy, but that is not the test of finality for the purposes of appeal or writ of error. The purpose of the statute is to give a review in one proceeding after final judgment of matters in controversy in any given case. Any contrary construction of the court of appeals act may involve the necessity of examining successive appeals or writs of error in the same case, instead of awaiting, as has been the practice since the beginning of the government, for one review after a final judgment, disposing of all controversies in that case between the parties.\n But it is urged by the learned counsel for the plaintiff in error that this judgment must be held to be final for the purpose of review, otherwise the government cannot keep the contract of immunity which it has made with the accused, by virtue of the terms of the immunity statute, which provides: \n\n[217 U.S. 423, 431]\n\u00a0\n 'No person shall be prosecuted or be subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which he may testify or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, in any proceeding, suit, or prosecution under said acts [ Sherman anti-trust and interstate commerce acts] . . .' [32 Stat. at L. 904, chap. 755, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 1142.]\n By the amendatory act of June 30, 1906 (34 Stat. at L. 798, chap. 3920, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 1168), it was provided that the above immunity shall extend only to a natural person who, in obedience to a subpoena, gives testimony under oath, or produces evidence, documentary or otherwise, under oath.\n In view of the provisions of this act, it is argued that the complete immunity promised is not given unless the person entitled to the benefits of the act is saved from prosecution, for it is contended that if the act is to be effective, it means not only immunity from punishment, but from prosecution as well. It is admitted in the brief of the learned counsel for the plaintiff in error that prosecution must necessarily proceed so far as an indictment and apprehension are concerned, but when the plea of immunity under this act is entered, if well taken, the prosecution must be ended, as the statutes provide that no person shall be prosecuted, etc. But we are of opinion that the statute does not intend to secure to a person making such a plea immunity from prosecution, but to provide him with a shield against successful prosecution, available to him as a defense; and that when this defense is improperly overruled, it may be a basis for the reversal of a final judgment against him. Such promise of immunity has not changed the Federal system of appellate procedure, which is not affected by the immunity statute, nor does the immunity operate to give a right of review upon any other than final judgments.\n A question very analogous to the one before us was made and decided in the case of Brown v. Walker, \n161 U.S. 591\n, 40 L. ed. 819, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 369, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 644, in which the constitutionality of an immunity statute was sustained. The statute undertook to give immunity after testimony before the Interstate Commerce Commission, and to \n\n[217 U.S. 423, 432]\n\u00a0\n provide that no person shall be prosecuted nor subject to any penalty, etc ., concerning matters which he testified to by the production of documents or otherwise before the Commission. In that case, as in this, the contention was made that the immunity was not perfect, because the witness might still be prosecuted, and therefore the promised immunity was insufficient to afford constitutional protection. Answering that contention, this court said (\n161 U.S. 608\n):\n'The same answer may be made to the suggestion that the witness is imperfectly protected by reason of the fact that he may still be prosecuted and put to the annoyance and expense of pleading his immunity by way of confession and avoidance. This is a detriment which the law does not recognize. There is a possibility that any citizen, however innocent, may be subjected to a civil or criminal prosecution and put to the expense of defending himself, but, unless such prosecution be malicious, he is remediless, except so far as a recovery of costs may partially indemnify him.'\n\n The Constitution of the United States provides that no person shall be twice placed in jeopardy of life and limb for the same offense, yet the overruling of a plea of former conviction or acquittal has never been held, so far as we know, to give a right of review before final judgment. In the case of Rankin v. Tennessee, 11 Wall. 380, 20 L. ed. 175, an attempt was made to bring to this court a judgment of a state court, upon a plea in bar of former conviction in a capital case. But this court, speaking by Mr. Justice Bradley, said:\n'It is a rule in criminal law in favorem vitoe, in canital cases that when a special plea in bar is found against the prisoner, either upon issue tried by a jury or upon a point of law decided by the court, he shall not be concluded or convicted thereon, but shall have judgment of respondeat ouster, and may plead over to the felony the general issue, 'not guilty.' 4 Bl. Com. 338. And this is the effect of the judgment of reversal rendered by the supreme court of Tennessee in this case, so that in no sense can that judgment \n\n[217 U.S. 423, 433]\n\u00a0\n be deemed a final one. The case must go back and be tried upon its merits, and final judgment must be rendered before this court can take jurisdiction. If, after that, it should be brought here for review, we can then examine the defendant's plea and decide upon its sufficiency.'\n\n It may thus be seen that a plea of former conviction under the constitutional provision that no person shall be twice put in jeopardy for the same offense does not have the effect to prevent a prosecution to final judgment, although the former conviction or acquittal may be finally held to be a complete bar to any right of prosecution; and this notwithstanding the person is in jeopardy a second time, if, after one conviction or acquittal, the jury is impaneled to try him again. We think, then, that the effect of the immunity statute in question is not to change the system of appellate procedure in the Federal courts, and give a right of review before final judgment in a criminal case, but was intended to provide an effectual defense against further prosecution, which, if denied, may be brought up for review after a final judgment in the case.\n We therefore reach the conclusion that the motion to dismiss the present writ be sustained, and it is so ordered.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","63":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHENLEY v. MYERS(1910)\nNo. 72\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. W. W. Nevison, George J. Barker, A. C. Mitchell, and S. D. Bishop for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[215 U.S. 373, 376]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. E. Myers, in propria persona, and Mr. R. E. Melvin for defendant in error.\n\n\n[215 U.S. 373, 378]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n The Federal question to be disposed of on this writ of error arises under the contract clause of the Constitution. The facts upon which this decision depends are not in dispute and may be thus summarized:\n On the 3d day of August, 1887, the plaintiffs in error became respectively subscribers to and owners of capital stock in the Consolidated Barbed Wire Company, a Kansas corporation, engaged in the business of manufacturing wire. But, on the 15th day of January, 1899, they sold and transferred their stock, worth par, in good faith, to responsible parties, and thereafter had no interest in the company. The fact of such transfer was made to appear on the books of the company. On the same date the company sold all its property and the good will of its business, the proceeds of the sale being distributed among the defendants as stockholders in the proportion of the stock held by each. And on the day last named the company suspended and did not thereafter resume business.\n In 1900, W. H. Stevenson obtained a judgment against the company upon which execution was issued and returned 'no property found.' In 1903, two other judgments-each of which, it is admitted, being based upon a cause of action sounding in tort-were recovered against the company, one by Briggs, administrator, and one by Maxwell. No execution was issued on either of those judgments.\n In 1903, Myers, the defendant in error, was appointed receiver of the wire company. As such receiver, and by authority of existing statutes, he brought an action in one of the Kansas courts against the present plaintiffs in error as stockholders, to recover the amount of the above judgments. Upon final hearing, the trial court gave judgments against the defendants, respectively, in certain amounts, to be paid by them in proportion to the stock owned by each. The case was carried to the supreme court of Kansas, and the \n\n[215 U.S. 373, 379]\n\u00a0\n judgment was affirmed. A rehearing was granted, but the judgment was again affirmed. 76 Kan. 736, 17 L.R.A. (N.S.) 785, 93 Pac. 173.\n At the time the defendants became stockholders in the wire company certain constitutional and statutory provisions relating to corporations were in force in Kansas. Those referred to by counsel are given, for convenience, in the margin. \n1\n From an examination of those provisions it will be \n\n[215 U.S. 373, 380]\n\u00a0\n seen that when the defendants became the owners of stock in the company it was the law of Kansas: 1. That a \n\n[215 U.S. 373, 381]\n\u00a0\n stockholder in any corporation other than one for railroad, religious, or charitable purposes, should be liable for the dues of the \n\n[215 U.S. 373, 382]\n\u00a0\n corporation to the extent of every unpaid subscription, and for an additional amount equal to the par value of the stock owned by him. 2. That if an execution against a corporation was returned 'no property found,' then execution could go, on the order of court and after written notice, against any stockholder, to the extent equal in amount to his stock, together with the amount, if any, unpaid thereon. 3. That when a corporation became insolvent a receiver could be appointed on application to the proper court, to close its affairs; and it was made the duty of such receiver to immediately institute proceedings against all stockholders to collect unpaid subscriptions, together with the additional liability of such stockholders, equal to the par value of the stock held by each; all such collections to be for the benefit of creditors. 4. That the stock of the corporation should be transferable only on the books of the corporation in such manner as the law prescribed.\n By an act passed in 1899, and which went into effect January 11th, 1899, before the defendants sold their stock, the previous statute (Gen. Stat. 1868, chap. 23,  24) was so amended as to make it the duty of the president and secretary or the managing officer of each corporation for profit doing business in the state (other than banking, insurance, and railroad corporations), as soon as any transfer, sale, or change of ownership of stock is made, as shown on its books, 'to at once file with the secretary of state a statement of such change of ownership, giving the name and address of the new stockholder or stockholders, the number of shares so transferred, and the par value and the amount paid on such stock.' The same statute provided that 'no transfer of such stock shall be legal or binding until such statement is made as provided.' Laws of Kan. Special Sess. 1898, chap. 10,  12, p. 33. It is not claimed that the above statement had been made or filed with the company prior to the sale by the defendants of their stock, or that it was ever filed; and the result is that the transfer made by the defendants of their stock (although the \n\n[215 U.S. 373, 383]\n\u00a0\n fact of such transfer may have been shown on the books of the wire company) was not legal or binding, if the statute was valid.\n But the defendants insist that, as the statutes of Kansas did not, at the time they acquired their stock, require as a condition of its legal or binding transfer that a statement of such transfer should be filed with the secretary of state, by the president, secretary, or managing officer of the corporation, the subsequent statute imposing a condition of that kind impaired the obligation of the contract under which stockholders acquired their stock, in violation of the Constitution of the United States. The supreme court of Kansas rejected this view, and they were right.\n In what way the transfer of the stock of a corporation shall be made and evidenced is a matter entirely within the govermental power of the state that creates the corporation, the state taking care that such power be not so exerted as to violate any right secured by the supreme law of the land. It was never contemplated by the framers of the Constitution that the national authorities should supervise the action of a state upon such a subject, so long as the state did not transgress that instrument, but kept within the limits of its reserved power to enact such reasonable laws or regulations as, in its judgment, were necessary or conducive to the general good. We can well understand how the state might have concluded that the statutory requirement in force when the defendants acquired their stock, to the effect that transfers of the stock of corporations created by the state (except certain corporations) should be transferable only on the books of the corporation, was not effective or sufficient; particularly, because such books might not be easily or at all accessible. And we can also well understand how the state might have reasonably concluded, in the interest of the public, particularly of purchasers of stock, and of stockholders as well, that the evidence of such transfers should appear from the records of some public office, like that of the secretary of state. Hence, \n\n[215 U.S. 373, 384]\n\u00a0\n perhaps, the enactment of the statute which went into effect January 11th, 1899. Such a requirement as that in the act of 1899 did not increase, in any degree whatever, the liability of stockholders as agreed to by them when becoming stockholders. On the contrary, it was in the interest of stockholders, as determining the fact of their ceasing to be stockholders on and after a particular date. Further, the statute did not forbid a sale of the stock upon such terms as might be agreed upon between a stockholder and any purchaser, the transfer, pursuant to such sale, being evidenced as prescribed by the statute. Nor, if sued as stockholders, did the act deprive defendants of any valid defense which they were entitled to make at the time they acquired their stock. It did nothing more than to prescribe, presumably in the interest of the parties immediately concerned and of the public, a rule under which a person owning and selling his stock in a corporation should be regarded as a stockholder, unless and until its sale and transfer were manifested by a statement of a particular kind, filed in a named public office. If it be said that the officers charged with the duty of making and filing that statement might fail or refuse to discharge the duty imposed upon them, the answer is that, if injury thereby came to the stockholder, those officers would be liable to him for such injury arising from neglect of duty. Besides, those officers could be compelled by proper proceedings to perform the duty put upon them by the statute. We hold that the defendants acquired their stock subject, necessarily, to the power of the state, having due regard to the legal rights of parties, to regulate the transfer of stocks in its own corporations. In its first opinion in this case, the supreme court of Kansas well said: 'Before the act [of 1899] was passed, one who had sold stock of a corporation, in order to relieve himself from liability for its debts, was obliged to see that the transfer was noted by its officer upon its books; the enactment merely imposed an additional duty to see that a similar notation was made upon a public record. The change \n\n[215 U.S. 373, 385]\n\u00a0\n imposed no restraint upon the transfer of the stock, but related only to the means by which it should be accomplished and the manner in which it might be evidenced. It is essentially a matter of method, of procedure, rather than of ultimate substantial rights.' [76 Kan. 735, 17 L.R.A.(N.S.) 785, 93 Pac. 173.]\n Equally without merit is the contention that the statute of 1899 impaired the obligations of the stockholder's contract, in that it substituted for individual actions against them a suit im equity by a receiver appointed after judgment against the corporation. In becoming stockholders, the defendants did not acquire a vested right in any particular mode of procedure adopted for the purpose of enforcing their liability as stockholders. It is a well-established doctrine that mere methods of procedure in actions on contract, that do not affect the substantial rights of parties, are always within the control of the state. It is to be assumed that parties make their contracts with reference to the existence of such power in the state.\n Without expressing any opinion as to questions of a local character, we hold, for the reasons stated, that the statute of 1899 furnishes no valid basis for the contention that it impaired the obligation of the contract by which defendants acquired their stock. This is the only Federal question of a substantial character presented on this writ of error, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Kansas must be affirmed.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"Dues from corporations shall be secured by individual liability of the stockholders to an additional amount equal to the stock owned by each stockholder, and such other means as shall be provided by law; but such individual liabilities shall not apply to railroad corporations, nor corporations for religious or charitable purposes.'

Should the collections made by the receiver exceed the amount necessary to pay all claims against such corporation, together with all costs and expenses of the receivership, the remainder shall be distributed among the stockholders from whom collections have been made, as the court may direct; and in the event any stockholder has not paid the amount due from him, the stockholders making payment shall be entitled to an assignment of \n\n any judgment or judgments obtained by the receiver against such stockholder, and may enforce the same to the extent of his proportion of claims paid by them.'

No transfer of such stock shall be legal or binding until such statement is made as provided for in this act; provided, however, that no transfers of stock shall release the party so transferring from the liability of the laws of this state as to stockholders of corporations for profit, for ninety days after such transfer and the filing and recording thereof in the office of the secretary of state.'

GUZMAN(1910)\nNo. 46\nArgued: Decided: December 19, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[219 U.S. 44, 45]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Willis Sweet for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Frederick L. Cornwell for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This action was brought in the district court of the United States for Porto Rico to recover damages for personal injuries resulting from the fall of a portion of the building owned by the plaintiff in error, which it was alleged he had negligently allowed to remain in a dangerous condition. It was tried by a jury, who gave a verdict against plaintiff in error for the sum of $9,000. Judgment was entered accordingly, and the case comes here on writ of error.\n The argument on behalf of the plaintiff in error proceeds upon the assumption that this court may review the evidence as to negligence and as to the damages recoverable, and may reverse the judgment if the court is dissatisfied with the findings of the jury. This, however, is not the province of the court upon writ of error. As there was evidence proper for the consideration of the jury, the objection that the verdict was against the weight of evidence, or that the damages allowed were excessive, cannot be considered. United States Exp. Co. v. Ware, 20 Wall. 543, 22 L. ed. 422; New York, L. E. & W. R. Co. v. Winter, \n143 \nU.S. 60, 75\n, 6 S. L. ed. 71, 80, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 356; Lincoln v. Power, \n151 U.S. 436\n-438, 38 L. ed. 224, 225, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 387; Humes v. United States, \n170 U.S. 210\n, 42 L. ed. 1011, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 602.\n Nor was any exception taken by the plaintiff in error to the instructions which the trial court gave to the jury. The only questions which are properly before us for review are as to certain rulings upon the admissibility of testimony.\n Error is assigned in admitting the testimony of a physician, Dr. Joaquin Martinez Guasp, 'as correct,' and it is further urged that the court 'erred in changing the record \n\n[219 U.S. 44, 46]\n\u00a0\n relative thereto after the bond on appeal had been given and approved.' It appears that the witness was appointed by the court to examine the plaintiff below in order to ascertain his condition at the time of the trial, and that this action was taken with the consent of the counsel for the defendant (the plaintiff in error). The examination was made and the witness subsequently testified without objection. In fact, the counsel for the plaintiff in error conducted the direct examination, and there was no cross-examination. No question, therefore, is presented with respect to the admissibility of this testimony. The bill of exceptions was amended so as to show that the court stated, when the testimony was introduced, not only that the physician's examination had been made by consent, but that counsel had 'agreed that his evidence should be considered as correct.' This amendment, as the district judge states, was to conform the record to the fact. Assuming, as we must, that the statement was made by the court, it does not appear that it was unjustified or that it was objected to. The exception of the plaintiff in error is simply to its inclusion in the record.\n It is further insisted that the court erred in refusing to allow one Dr. Gonzalez to testify. As to this, the record merely sets forth that counsel 'offered to present the testimony of one Dr. Gonzalez, as an expert, which testimony is not allowed by the court, and to which ruling of the court counsel for defendant thereupon noted an exception.' Manifestly, the judgment cannot be set aside because of this ruling, for it does not appear what testimony the witness was expected to give, or that he was qualified to give any.\n We have examined the other rulings of which plaintiff in error complains, with respect to the striking out of certain testimony, and we find no error.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","65":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHERNDON v. CHICAGO, R I & P R CO(1910)\nNo. 150\nArgued: April 14, 1910Decided: May 31, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 135, 136]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James T. Blair, Elliott W. Major, and Charles G.

Lindley for appellee.\n\n\n[218 U.S. 135, 146]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This suit was brought by the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company in the circuit court of the United States for the western district of Missouri, to enjoin the execution of certain provisions of the acts of the legislature of the state of Missouri, as violative of complainant's rights under the Federal Constitution. The bill was filed against Harry T. Herndon, prosecuting attorney of Clinton county, Missouri, and John E. Swanger, secretary of state of the state of Missouri.\n The bill is very lengthy, and as the decision of the court was made upon demurrer to it, will be necessary to call attention to some of its pertinent allegations. Complainant avers that it is a duly organized corporation of the \n\n[218 U.S. 135, 147]\n\u00a0\n state of Illinois, operating a railroad in certain states; among others, in the state of Missouri; and is engaged in both state and interstate commerce. It sets forth in detail the acts of the state of Missouri authorizing the consolidation, extension, and operations of the railroads under which it claims to have acquired its system of railroads in that state. It avers that it duly filed with the secretary of state of the state of Missouri a copy of its charter, in compliance with the laws of the state, and received a certificate, November 22, 1902, in all respects in compliance with the laws of the state, authorizing the complainant to carry on business in said state for the term ending April 3, 1930, which certificate is in full force, never having been canceled or withdrawn.\n The bill sets forth the act of March 19, 1907, amending  1075 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri, requiring railroad companies to perform certain duties, among others, to stop passenger trains at the junction or intersecting points of other railroads. As that amended section is one of the acts complained of, it is set forth in the margin. \n Sec. 1075. Every railroad corporation in this state which now is, or may hereafter be, engaged in the transportation of persons or property from one point in this state to another point in this state, shall give public notice of the regular time of starting and running its cars, and shall furnish sufficient accommodations for the transportation of all such passengers, baggage, mails, and express freight as shall, within a reasonable time previous thereto, be offered for transportation at the place of starting, at the junctions of other railroads, and at the junction of branch railroads of the same system, as herein defined, carrying passengers, and at the several stopping places; and shall, at all crossings and intersections of other railroads, where such other railroad and the railroad crossing the same are now, or may hereafter be made, upon the same grade, and the character of the land at such crossing or intersection will admit of the same, erect, build, and maintain, either jointly with the railroad company whose road is crossed, or separately by each railroad company, a depot or passenger house and waiting room or rooms sufficient to comfortably accommodate all passengers awaiting the arrival and departure of tains at such junction or railroad crossing, and shall keep such depot or passenger house or rooms warm, lighted, and open to the ingress and egress of all passengers for a reasonable time before the arrival and until after the departure of all trains carrying passengers on said railroad or railroads; and they are hereby required to stop all trains carrying passengers at the junction or intersection of other railroads, and they are further required to receive all passengers and baggage for, and to stop, on a flag or signal, all trains carrying passengers, at the junction of all branch railroads of the same system, which said branch railroads are 18 miles or more in length, and at the terminus of which is located any county seat town of any county in this state, a sufficient length of time to allow the transfer of passengers, personal baggage, mails, and express freight from the trains of railroads so connecting or intersecting; or they may mutually arrange for the transportation of such persons and property over both roads without change of cars; and they shall be compelled to receive all passengers and freight from such connecting, intersecting, or branch roads whenever the same shall be delivered to them. And every railroad company or corporation owning, operating, or leasing any railroad in this state shall keep all its depots, stations, or passenger stations, whether located at the crossing or \n\n[218 U.S. 135, 148]\n\u00a0\n Concerning this section, and the requirement to stop trains at junction points, the bill sets out that the complainant has traffic rights over the Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy Railway track between Cameron Junction and Kansas City; that the town of Lathrop is a town of about 1, 000 inhabitants, situated in Clinton county, Missouri, between Cameron Junction and Kansas City, on said line of railway; that complainant, for the purpose of carrying on its business as a common carrier, at the said station of Lathrop, stops a morning and evening passenger train each way, two west bound, and two east bound, and, in addition thereto, stops two passenger trains, one east bound and one west bound, which are local freight trains regularly carrying passengers. Complainant further sets forth that it runs a fast through passenger train between Chicago, Fort Worth, and Dallas, Texas, by means of connecting carriers in the state of \n\n[218 U.S. 135, 149]\n\u00a0\n Texas, and a fast through passenger train between Chicago and the Pacific coast by means of connecting carriers beyond the territory of Oklahoma, neither of which stop at the station of Lathrop to take on or let off passengers; that said trains which do not stop at Lathrop are immediately preceded by trains that do stop there, and which are maintained for the purpose of collecting passengers from local stations and conveying them to nearby stations on the line of the road of the complainant, where both of said fast through trains do stop for the purpose of taking on and letting off passengers.\n The complainant further avers that the tracks of the complainant cross and intersect with the tracks of the Atchison, Topeka, & Santa Fe Railway Company at the said station of Lathrop; that the Atchison, Topeka , & Santa Fe Railway runs two trains each way every day, all of which stop at the station of Lathrop, and which make close and direct connection with the trains which the \n\n[218 U.S. 135, 150]\n\u00a0\n complainant stops at the station of Lathrop; that except under unusual circumstances passengers seldom find it convenient to change from the complainant's railway to that of the Atchison, Topeka, & Santa Fe line at the station of Lathrop. Complainant avers that to stop the through interstate trains running between Chicago, Fort Worth, and Dallas, Texas, and between Chicago and the Pacific coast, would be a direct, unreasonable, and unwarrantable interference with its interstate business, and that said through trains are maintained for, and are essential to the purpose of, transporting interstate passenger traffic, and for the carriage of the United States mails. The complainant avers that the facilities for the interchange of passengers at the station of Lathrop are amply sufficient to accommodate the public, and that the service is both convenient and satisfactory to the public. The bill further avers that if the said through trains are required to stop at all junctions with other railways and there interchange passengers with such road, their usefulness as through trains will be destroyed, and the interstate business of the complainant interfered with to an unwarranted extent without any corresponding benefit to the traveling public; that the law of March 19, 1907, as applied to said trains which do not stop at the station of Lathrop, is a serious burden upon interstate commerce so conducted by said trains, and an unlawful and unreasonable interference therewith, and in violation of the Constitution of the United States and the acts of Congress regulating commerce. Complainant avers that the act of March 19, 1907, requiring trains carrying passengers to stop at the junction or intersections of other roads for the purpose of interchanging passengers and baggage at such junction points, was not passed in the exercise of the police power of the state of Missouri to protect the traveling public, but solely for the purpose of increasing traveling facilities, and to provide a more convenient and satisfactory \n\n[218 U.S. 135, 151]\n\u00a0\n train service at such junction points. Complainant avers that it installed an interlocking plant and an automatic signal device at the intersection with the tracks of the Atchison, Topeka, & Santa Fe Railway at the station of Lathrop, and thereby provided an absolutely safe method for its through trains to pass over the tracks of the Atchison, Topeka, & Santa Fe road without stopping. The bill avers that Harry T. Herndon, as prosecuting attorney for the county of Clinton, Missouri threatens to and will, unless enjoined, put in motion the special provisions of the act of March 19, 1907, for the enforcement of penalties of $25 per day since July 21, 1907, which penalties in a short time would amount to many thousands of dollars.\n Complainant further avers that defendant John E. Swanger, secretary of the state of Missouri, under and by authority of said act of the state of Missouri, approved March 13, 1907, concerning the bringing of cases by foreign corporations in the Federal courts, which act is set forth in the margin,1 threatens to, and will, unless\n 1 Be it enacted by the general assembly of the state of Missouri as follows:\n Sec. 1. If any foreign or nonresident railway corporation of whatever kind, incorporated, created, and existing under the laws of any other state, territory, or country, and doing business as a carrier of freight or passengers from one point in this state, to another point in this state, under the laws of this state regulating or authorizing the licensing of, or the issuing of a permit or a certificate of authority to, or suffering or allowing, any such corporation to enter or to do business in this state shall, without the consent of the other party, in writing, to any suit or proceeding brought by or against it in any court of this state, remove said suit or proceeding to any Federal court, or shall institute any suit or proceeding against any citizen of this state in any Federal court, the license, permit, certificate of authority, and all right of such corporation and its agents to carry passengers or freight from one point in this state to another point in this state shall forthwith be revoked by the secretary of state, and its right to do such business shall cease, and the secretary of state shall publish such revocation in some newspaper of large and general circulation in the state, and such corporation shall not again be authorized or permitted to carry passengers or freight from one point in this state to another point in this state, or to do business as a carrier of passengers or freight of any kind from one point in this state to another point in this state at any time within five years from the date of such revocation or the cessation of such right. But the revocation of such license, permit, right, certificate of authority, or the cessation of such right, shall not be deemed to prohibit or prevent such corporation from carrying passengers or freight from a point within this state to a point without this state, or from a point without this state to a point within this state, or from making what are portation.\n Sec. 2. If any corporation included in the provisions of this act shall carry, or attempt to carry, or hold itself out to carry, passengers or freight of any kind from one point in the state to another, without a license, permit, or certificate of authority therefor, first had and obtained from the state of Missouri,-to be issued by the secretary of state,-or after its license, permit. right, or certificate of authority to carry passengers or freight of any kind from one point in this state to another point in this state, shall have been revoked or ceased, as provided for by the preceding section of this \n\n[218 U.S. 135, 152]\n\u00a0\n enjoined, cancel the complainant's certificate of the right to do business in the state of Missouri, and will take other steps necessary to revoke the license and permit, as provided in the act of March 13, 1907, should the complainant file this, its bill of complaint, in the United States circuit court, and because of any attempt complainant \n\n[218 U.S. 135, 153]\n\u00a0\n may make to remove any case to a Federal court from any state court of the state of Missouri, and to bring any case in any Federal court against a citizen of the state of Missouri. The bill then sets out the coming of the complainant into the state of Missouri in accordance with the laws of the state, that it acquired property therein, which included many miles of railroad, depots, station grounds, shops, and warehouses, terminals, rolling stock, and other equipment necessary to the maintenance and operation of its line, located in the state of Missouri, and at an assessed value of $3,252,775. The bill sets out the various particulars wherein it is contended that the act of March 13, 1907, is void under the Constitution of the United States, and the bill avers that if the complainant should attempt to remove into the Federal courts any case commenced in the state courts of Missouri, or should commence proceedings in any Federal court against a citizen of the state of Missouri, the defendant, as secretary of state of the state of Missouri, would deny the right of complainant to do business in the state of Missouri, and if the complainant attempted to carry on the same it would be subject to forfeit and to pay to the state of Missouri a penalty of not less than $2,000 nor more than $10,000, to be recovered in any court in the state having jurisdiction. An injunction was prayed against the defendant Harry T. Herndon as prosecuting attorney of the county of Clinton, Missouri, requiring him to refrain from enforcing, or attempting to enforce, the provisions of the act of March 19, 1907, so far as it relates to the stopping of the trains aforesaid, at the crossing of the Atchison, Topeka , & Santa Fe Railway at the station of Lathrop, Clinton county, Missouri, and from enforcing, or attempting to enforce, the penalties of the statute; and that the defendant John E. Swanger, secretary of state of the state of Missouri, be restrained from enforcing, or attempting to enforce, the provisions of the act of March 13, 1907, \n\n[218 U.S. 135, 154]\n\u00a0\n providing for the revocation and canceling of the complainant's charter because of the removal of cases from a state to a Federal court, or bringing suit in a Federal court against any citizen of the state of Missouri.\n A demurrer was filed to the bill by both of the defendants, the same was overruled, and a final decree was entered enjoining the enforcement of the act of March 13, 1907, because of the beginning of the suits, or the removal of cases to Federal courts, and enjoining the enforcement of the act of March 19, 1907, so far as it relates to the complainant's said trains passing through Lathrop, or the stopping of such trains at the station of Lathrop, and enjoined the defendant prosecuting attorney of Clinton County, Missouri, from enforcing, or attempting to enforce, the provisions of said act as to stopping said trains, or enforcing the penalties provided for in that act for the failure to comply with the provisions thereof.\n It is evident from the foregoing statement that the constitutional questions involved in this case are: First, whether, under the act of March 19, 1907, the complainant can be compelled to stop its through trains, described in the bill, at the station of Lathrop, and whether such a statute, so far as it relates to interstate commerce trains, is void as an attempt to regulate interstate commerce, and imposes a burden thereon by state legislation. And, secondly, under the act of March 13, 1907, can the license and right of the complainant to do business in the state of Missouri be lawfully revoked because it has begun a suit, or may remove a suit, from a state court to a Federal court, complainant being a corporation organized in another state.\n Before considering these questions, we will notice some of the objections to the decree below, made by the learned counsel for the state. It is asserted that the bill is multifarious, and that there is no right to join the defendants, the prosecuting attorney and secretary of state, in the \n\n[218 U.S. 135, 155]\n\u00a0\n same bill. But no objection to such joinder of the parties was specially taken, and it is well settled that an objection of this character must be promptly made. The proper way to raise such question is by special demurrer, specifically directed to the objection. 1 Street, Fed. Eq. Pr.  936. It is true that a court may itself take the objection in extreme cases, when that course is essential to the necessary and proper administration of justice. But, as laid down in Oliver v. Piatt, 3 How. 333, 412, 11 L. ed. 622, 658, Mr. Justice Story, speaking for the court, if the court can get to a final decree without serious embarrassment, it will do so; and says the learned justice: 'A fortiori, an appellate court would scarcely entertain the objection, if it was not forced upon it by a moral necessity.' No such case exists here. Certainly, in the absence of a specific objection, there is no difficulty in hearing at the same time the case against the secretary of state and the prosecuting attorney. The bringing of the suit against the prosecuting attorney in the Federal court, if the statute of March 13, 1907, is to be carried out, will forfeit the complainant's right to do business within the state, and we see no reason why the right to declare such forfeiture may not be considered with the case against the prosecuting attorney. We find no merit in the objection of multifariousness.\n As to the objection that the suit is one against the state, we think no discussion is necessary, and content ourselves with a reference to the late cases in this court to that point. Ex parte Young, \n209 U.S. 123\n, 52 L. ed. 714, 13 L.R.A.(N.S.) 932, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 441; Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Andrews, \n216 U.S. 165\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 286.\n The act of March 19, 1907, requiring the stopping of certain trains, upon its face seems to require the stoppage of all passenger trains at the junction or intersection of other roads. But it is contended by counsel for the state that this statute is but an amendment of former statutes, and that the requirement to stop trains carrying pas- \n\n[218 U.S. 135, 156]\n\u00a0\n sengers, as qualified by the subsequent language of the act, means to stop such trains for a sufficient length of time to allow the transfer of passengers, personal baggage, mails and express from the trains of the roads connecting or intersecting to the trains of the other road, and that, therefore, the act applies only to the operation of trains actually carrying such passengers, personal baggage, mails and express as are destined for points on the connecting road, and does not require the stoppage of all trains carrying passengers, as is set out in the bill. And this conclusion, it is said, must necessarily follow because of the construction given to the statute prior to its amendment on March 19, 1907. State use of School Fund v. Wabash, St. L. & P. R. Co. 83 Mo. 148; Logan v. Hannibal & St. J. R. Co. 77 Mo. 666; State ex rel. McPherson v. St Louis & S. F. R. Co. 105 Mo. App. 212, 79 S. W. 714.\n The contention is that the amendment of 1907 has only the effect to bring into the statute certain provisions as to branch railroads. Assuming this to be a correct interpretation of this statute, and that it only requires the stoppage of trains at Lathrop carrying passengers destined for points on the intersecting railroad, or to take up passengers there, destined for points on complainant's road, the question remains, Would the requirement of the act of March 19, 1907, to stop the through trains described in the bill, for such purpose and under the circumstances set forth, be an unlawful attempt to regulate interstate commerce, and impose an unlawful burden thereon?\n The extent of the right to control through interstate transportation of passengers by state legislation, or under orders of a commission authorized by the state, has been recently before this court. Mississippi R. Commission v. Illinois C. R. Co. \n203 U.S. 335\n, 51 L. ed. 209, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 90; Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Wharton, \n207 U.S. 328\n, 52 L. ed. 230, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 121.\n The principle to be deduced from these cases is, that where a railroad company has already provided ample \n\n[218 U.S. 135, 157]\n\u00a0\n facilities for the adequate accommodation of the traveling public, such as may be proper and reasonable at any given point, and operates interstate commerce trains, carrying passengers, through the same places, at which such interstate trains do not stop, a state regulation which requires the stopping of such interstate trains, in addition to ample facilities already provided, to the detriment and hindrance of interstate traffic, is an unlawful regulation and burden upon interstate commerce. Applying the principles thus settled, and taking the allegations of the bill as true, which we must do, in view of the fact that the case was decided upon demurrer, we think that construing the statute so as to require the stoppage of the through trains whenever any persons might seek to avail themselves thereof, in order to permit a transfer of passengers from one road to the other upon such trains, would be an unnecessary and unlawful burden upon interstate traffic. The averment of the bill is that the business is already amply provided for in the other trains of the company and the connecting road, and the serious detriment to the interstate carrying business from the requirement to stop the through trains described for the purpose of permitting such transfers is fully set forth in the bill, and admitted by the demurrer.\n It is true that the bill avers that few persons require transfer at such connecting point, but if passengers have the right, under this statute, to require the stoppage of such through trains at Lathrop whenever they may desire to avail themselves of such privilege, serious inconvenience would result to the interstate traffic in question. It is to be remembered that this statute is not of that class passed in the exercise of the police power of the state for the promotion of the public safety, and requiring the stoppage of trains by one railroad before crossing the tracks of another railroad; this statute, as its second section shows, was passed for the purpose of providing \n\n[218 U.S. 135, 158]\n\u00a0\n greater facilities of travel, and not for the protection of life and limb. We therefore reach the conclusion that the circuit court did not err in granting the injunction, so far as it relates to the enforcement of the act of March 19, 1907, relating to the stoppage of the interstate commerce trains at the station of Lathrop.\n As to the validity of the act of March 13, 1907, forfeiting the right of the company to do business in the state of Missouri, and subjecting it to penalties in case it should bring a suit in the Federal courts, or remove one from the state courts to the Federal courts, but little need be said. This is so because of the cases decided at this term, involving contentions kindred to the one made in this case. See Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Kansas, \n216 U.S. 1\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 190; Pullman Co. v. Kansas, \n216 U.S. 56\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 232; Ludwig v. Western U. Teleg. Co. \n216 U.S. 146\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 280; Southern R. Co. v. Greene, \n216 U.S. 400\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 287.\n Applying the principles announced in those cases, it is evident that the act in controversy cannot stand, in view of the provisions of the Constitution of the United States. Moreover, this is not a case where the state has undertaken to prevent the coming of the corporation into its borders for the purpose of carrying on business. The corporation was within the state, complying with its laws, and had acquired, under the sanction of the state, a large amount of property within its borders, and thus had become a person within the state, within the meaning of the Constitution, and entitled to its protection. Under the statute in controversy, a domestic railroad company might bring an action in the Federal court, or, in a proper case, remove one thereto, without being subject to the forfeiture of its right to do business, or to the imposition of penalties provided for in the act. In all the cases in this court, discussing the right of the states to exclude foreign corporations, and to prevent them from removing cases to the Federal courts, it has been conceded that \n\n[218 U.S. 135, 159]\n\u00a0\n while the right to do local business within the state may not have been derived from the Federal Constitution, the right to resort to the Federal courts is a creation of the Constitution of the United States and the statutes passed in pursuance thereof.\n It is enough now to say that within the principles decided at this term, in the cases cited above, the act of March 13, 1907, as applied to the complainant railroad company, in view of the admitted facts set out in the bill in this case, is unconstitutional and void. We find no error in the decree granted in the Circuit Court, and the same is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n intersection of other roads or elsewhere, warm, lighted, and open to the ingress and egress of all passengers a reasonable time before the arrival and until after the departure of all passenger trains on said railroad which stop or receive or discharge passengers at such depots, stations, or passenger houses.

WOODMAN(1910)\nNo. 640\nArgued: Decided: May 31, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 205, 206]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. H. T. Newcomb, Edward Lauterbach, and Underwood & Smyser for Woodman et al.\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 205, 210]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Lurton delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case comes to this court upon a certificate under  6 of the act of 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 828, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549], creating circuit courts of appeals. The action in the circuit court was one by the executor and legatees under the will of James F. Woodman, to recover an amount of money which had been paid, under protest, as a tax upon legacies under the will of the testator, by virtue of  29 and 30 of the act of June 13, 1898 [30 Stat. at L. 464, 465, chap. 448, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 2307, 2308], and amendments, known as the war revenue act.\n The facts certified are: That Woodman died at Chicago, March 15, 1902, leaving a will, which was there duly probated on May 3, 1902, and that the Illinois Trust & Savings Bank qualified as executor. The clear value of legacies payable under the will to the defendants in error was $166,250. On January 17, 1905, and before the payment of these legacies, the collector claimed and collected, as the amount of duty and tax due and payable upon said legacies, under the act of Congress before mentioned, the sum of $2,812.49. After stating the facts, substantially as above, the certificate concludes as follows:\n'Upon the foregoing facts the question of law concerning which this court desires the instruction and advice of the Supreme Court is this: Does the fact that the testator dies within one year immediately prior to the taking effect of the repealing act of April 12 1902 ([32 Stat. at L. 97, chap. 500] U. S. Comp. \n\n[218 U.S. 205, 211]\n\u00a0\n Stat.Supp. 1903, p. 279, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 876), relieve from taxation legacies otherwise taxable under  29 and 30 of the act of June 13, 1898, as amended by the act of March 2, 1901 [31 Stat. at L. 946- 948, chap. 806, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 2307, 2308]?'\n\n The form of this certificate has been criticized, but we think it sufficiently states both the question and the desire of that court for the instruction of this court that it may make a proper decision. It conforms in substance with the statute, and finds precedents in a number of instances in matter of form. Helwig v. United States, \n188 U.S. 605\n, 47 L. ed. 614, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 427; United States v. Pridgeon, \n153 U.S. 48\n, 38 L. ed. 631, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 746; United States v. Ju Toy, \n198 U.S. 253\n, 49 L. ed. 1040, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 644.\n It is also urged that the circuit court of appeals for the seventh circuit is precluded from requesting the instruction of this court, because it had in two cases theretofore decided the very question now certified. United States v. Marion Trust Co. 74 C. C. A. 439, 143 Fed. 301; United States v. Stephenson, not yet reported. In both cases the decision was adverse to the contention of the United States. The first was affirmed by this court without opinion, by an evenly divided court (\n203 U.S. 594\n, 51 L. ed. 332, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 783); and, in the second, an application by the United States for a writ of certiorari was denied (\n212 U.S. 572\n, 53 L. ed. 656, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 682). It is further contended that, if not concluded by its own decisions, it was bound to follow the judgments of this court in Eidman v. Tilghman, affirming the judgment of the circuit court of appeals of the second circuit, reported in 69 C. C. A. 139, 136 Fed. 141, the affirmance by this court being reported in \n203 U.S. 580\n, 51 L. ed. 326, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 779, and similar judgments of affirmance in McCoach v. Philadelphia Trust, S. D. & Ins. Co. 73 C. C. A. 610, 142 Fed. 120, and \n205 U.S. 539\n, 51 L. ed. 921, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 783, and United States v. Marion Trust Co. supra.\n All of these cases were affirmances by an equally divided court of the judgments of the court below in favor of the legatees or distributees who had sued to recover taxes paid upon legacies or shares which had passed to the plaintiffs within one year after the death of the testator \n\n[218 U.S. 205, 212]\n\u00a0\n or intestate, the several lower courts having ruled that the tax had not been saved, because it was not due and payable at the time of the repeal of the act under which the tax was claimed.\n The circuit court of appeals was obviously not bound to follow its own prior decision. The rule of stare decisis, though one tending to consistency and uniformity of decision, is not inflexible. Whether it shall be followed or departed from is a question entirely within the discretion of the court, which is again called upon to consider a question once decided. The court below, in this instance, when called upon to reconsider its former construction of the inheritance tax act, found itself confronted by the fact that this court had been equally divided in opinion as to the proper interpretation of the act, and for that reason alone obliged to affirm the ruling of that and other courts against the legality of the tax which had been collected. If the decision of the court under review had been in favor of the legality of the tax, an affirmance must likewise have resulted from an equal division. That court also found that its own former view of the act had not been satisfactory to the circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit, which court had decided contrariwise in Westhus v. Union Trust Co. 90 C. C. A. 441, 164 Fed. 795. In such circumstances the court below was not only free to regard the question as one open for determination, but one which might well be certified to this court, that the question of law which had never been authoritatively decided by this court might be so determined by an instruction as to how it should decide the matter when thus presented for reconsideration.\n When this court, in the exercise of its appellate powers, is called upon to decide whether that which has been done in the lower court shall be reversed or affirmed, it is obvious that that which has been done must stand unless reversed by the affirmative action of a majority. It has \n\n[218 U.S. 205, 213]\n\u00a0\n therefore been the invariable practice to affirm, without opinion, any judgment or decree which is not decided to be erroneous by a majority of the court sitting in the cause. The earliest precedent is that of Etting v. Bank of United States, 11 Wheat. 59, 78, 6 L. ed. 419, 423. Chief Justice Marshall said at the conclusion of the opinion:\n'In the very elaborate arguments which have been made at the bar, several cases have heen cited which have been attentively considered. No attempt will be made to analyze them, or to decide on their application to the case before us, because the judges are divided respecting it. Consequently, the principles of law which have been argued cannot be settled; but the judgment is affirmed, the court being divided in opinion upon it.'\n\n In Durant v. Essex Co. 7 Wall. 107, 110, 19 L. ed. 154, 156, Mr. Justice Field, for this court, said, in respect of the effect of the affirmance by a divided court:\n'There is nothing in the fact that the judges of this court were divided in opinion upon the question whether the decree should be reversed or not, and, therefore, ordered an affirmance of the decree of the court below. The judgment of affirmance was the judgment of the entire court. The division of opinion between the judges was the reason for the entry of that judgment; but the reason is no part of the judgment itself.'\n\n To the same effect are Westhus v. Union Trust Co. 94 C. C. A. 95, 168 Fed. 617; Hartman v. Greenhow, \n102 \nU.S. 672, 676\n, 26 S. L. ed. 271, 273. A different rule seems to have been sanctioned in the English courts. Catherwood v. Caslon, 13 Mees. & W. 261; Beamish v. Beamish, 9 H. L. Cas. 274.\n Under the precedents of this court, and, as seems justified by reason as well as by authority, an affirmance by an equally divided court is, as between the parties, a conclusive determination and adjudication of the matter adjudged; but the principles of law involved not having been agreed upon by a majority of the court sitting \n\n[218 U.S. 205, 214]\n\u00a0\n prevents the case from becoming an authority for the determination of other cases, either in this or in inferior courts. The affirmance by a divided court in the second case shows this, for if it was not so, the second equal division could not have happened, for the case would have been controlled by the first equal division.\n We shall therefore proceed to determine the question of law presented by the certificate of the circuit court of appeals, feeling free to decide it as our judgments may dictate.\n The statutes involved and requiring consideration are the 29th section of the act of June 13, 1898 (30 Stat. at L. 464, chap. 448, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2307); the 30th section of the same act, as amended by  11 of the act of March 2, 1901 (31 Stat. at L. 948, chap. 806, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2308), and  7, 8, and 11 of the act of April 12, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 97 et seq., chap. 500, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, pp. 875, 876, 878). So much of the sections referred to as is material to the present question is set out in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n 1 Section 29 of the act of June 13, 1898, is as follows:\n'That any person or persons having in charge or trust, as administrators, executors, or trustees, any legacies or distributive shares arising from personal property, where the whole amount of such personal property as aforesaid shall exceed the sum of ten thousand dollars in actual value, passing, after the passage of this act, from any person possessed of such property, either by will or by the intestate laws of any state or territory, or any personal property or interest therein, transferred by deed, grant, bargain, sale, or gift, made or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment after the death of the grantor or bargainor, to any person or persons, or to any body or bodies, politic or corporate, in trust or otherwise, shall be, and hereby are, made subject to a duty or tax, to be paid to the United States, as follows, that is to say: . . .' 30 Stat. at L. 464, chap. 448, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2307\n\n\n\n So much of  30 of the act of June 13, 1898, as amended by  11 of the act of March 2, 1901, as is material, reads:\n'That the tax or duty aforesaid shall be due and payable in one year after the death of the testator, and shall be a lien and charge upon the property of every person who may die as aforesaid for twenty years, or until the same shall, within that period, be duly paid to and discharged by the United States; and every executor, administrator, or trustee having in charge or trust any legacy or distributive share, as aforesaid, shall give notice thereof, in writing, to the collector or deputy collector of the district where the deceased grantor or bargainor last resided within thirty days after he shall have taken charge of such trust, and every executor, administrator, or trustee, before payment and distribution to the legatees, or any parties entitled to beneficial interest therein, shall pay to the collector or deputy collector of the district of which the deceased person was a resident, or in which the property was located in case of nonresidents, the amount of the duty or tax assessed upon such legacy or distributive share,' etc.\n\n Sections 7, 8, and 11 of the act of April 12, 1902, are as follows: \n\n[218 U.S. 205, 215]\n\u00a0\n The 7th section of the act of April 12, 1902, which act we shall hereafter refer to as the repealing act, did not go into effect until July 1, 1902. That section explicitly repealed  29 of the act of June 13, 1898, which was the only section imposing a tax upon inheritances, and the only authority for the tax collected from the defendants in error. The claim of the United States was and is that, as the testator's death occurred prior to July 1, 1902, the tax demanded had been imposed as an obligation before the repeal of the taxing section, and that \n\n[218 U.S. 205, 216]\n\u00a0\n the liability thus imposed was saved by the 8th section of the repealing act. For convenience that section is here again set out:\n'Sec. 8. That all taxes or duties imposed by section twenty-nine of the act of June thirteenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, and amendments thereof, prior to the taking effect of this act, shall be subject, as to lien, charge, collection, and otherwise, to the provisions of section thirty of said act of June thirteenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, and amendments thereof, which are hereby continued in force, as follows. . . .'\n\n The question for solution must therefore turn upon the inquiry whether the tax in question had been imposed prior to the going into effect of the repealing act within the intent and effect of the saving clause just set out.\n There are cases which go so far as to say that the unqualified repeal of a law as effectually destroys rights and liabilities dependent upon it, not past and concluded, as if the statute had never existed. It is, however, putting it strongly enough to say that an unqualified repeal operates to destroy inchoate rights, as a release of imperfect obligations, and as a remission of penalties and forfeitures dependent upon the destroyed statute. United States v. Reisinger, \n128 U.S. 398\n, 32 L. ed. 480, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 99; Curtis v. Leavitt, 15 N. Y. 9, 152, et seq.; Belvidere v. Warren R. Co. 34 N. J. L. 193; 1 Lewis's Sutherland, Stat. Constr.  282 et seq.\n There has been a marked legislative trend in the direction of escaping from the serious consequence sometimes incident to this common- law rule of construction, indicated by general statutes saving liabilities, penalties, and forfeitures incurred under repealed statutes. Such a general statute was passed by Congress in 1817 (chap. 71, 16 Stat. at L. 431, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 6), the 4th section of which was carried into the revision of 1878, and is now in force as  13, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 6). That section reads as follows:\n'The repeal of any statute shall not have the effect to \n\n[218 U.S. 205, 217]\n\u00a0\n release or extinguish any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under such statute, unless the repealing act shall so expressly provide; and such statute shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purpose of sustaining any proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of such penalty, forfeiture, or liability.'\n\n This provision has been upheld by this court as a rule of construction applicable, when not otherwise provided, as a general saving clause, to be read and construed as a part of all subsequent repealing statutes, in order to give effect to the will and intent of Congress. United States v. Reisinger, \n128 U.S. 398\n, 32 L. ed. 480, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 99; Great Northern R. Co. v. United States, \n208 U.S. 452\n, 52 L. ed. 567, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 313.\n In the last case cited the court said of this section that--\n'As the section of the Revised Statutes in question has only the force of a statute, its provisions cannot justify a disregard of the will of Congress as manifested either expressly or by necessary implication in a subsequent enactment. But while this is true, the provisions of  13 are to be treated as if incorporated in and as a part of subsequent enactments, and therefore, under the general principles of construction requiring, if possible, that effect be given to all the parts of a law, the section must be enforced unless, either by express declaration or necessary implication, arising from the terms of the law, as a whole, it results that the legislative mind will be set at naught by giving effect to the provisions of  13. For the sake of brevity we do not stop to refer to the many cases from state courts of last resort, dealing with the operation of general state statutes like unto  13, Rev. Stat., because we think the views just stated are obvious and their correctness is established by a prior decision of this court concerning that section. United States v. Reisinger, \n128 U.S. 398\n, 32 L. ed. 480, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 99.'\n\n This section is not alone applicable to penalties and forfeitures \n\n[218 U.S. 205, 218]\n\u00a0\n under penal statutes. It extends as well to 'liabilities,' and a liability or obligation to pay a tax imposed under a repealed statute is not only within the letter, but the spirit and purpose, of the provision. Therefore we must take that general saving clause into consideration as a part of the legislation involved in the determination of whether a 'liability' had been incurred by the imposition of a tax prior to the act that destroyed the law under which it had been imposed.\n The repealing act here involved includes a saving clause, and if it necessarily, or by clear implication, conflicts with the general rule declared in  13, the latest expression of the legislative will must prevail. In the case of Great Northern R. Co. v. United States, cited above, the question was whether the saving clause in the Hepburn act was so plainly in conflict with the rule of construction found in  13 as to limit the actions or liabilities saved to those enumerated therein; but the court held that, as the later clause applied to remedies and procedure, it was not, by implication, in conflict with the general provision of  13, which saved penalties, forfeitures, and liabilities. \n208 U.S. 466\n, 467.\n The significance of  13 is therefore this: That if, prior to the repealing act, the defendants in error were under any liability or obligation to pay the tax or duty imposed by  29 of the act of June 13, 1898, that obligation or liability was not relieved by the mere repeal of that section, nor as a consequence of the saving clause in the repealing act, unless the special character of that clause, by plain implication, cuts down the scope and operation of the general rule in  13.\n In the light of these principles of interpretation we come, then, to the question as to whether, at the date of the repeal of  29 of the act of June 13, 1898, the legacies to the defendants in error were subject to any tax or duty under the repealed section which constituted a 'liability' under \n\n[218 U.S. 205, 219]\n\u00a0\n  13, or to a tax or duty 'imposed,' under the saving clause of the repealing act.\n The only section which imposes any tax upon inheritances is the 29th. Any legacy or distributive share, or gift in anticipation of death, 'passing after the passage of the act,' is, by the express terms of that section, 'made subject to a duty or tax to be paid to the United States, as follows,' etc.\n Section 30 of the same act deals only with the return, payment, and procedure for the collection of 'the tax or duty aforesaid,' referring to the tax imposed by  29.\n Now, what is the property, right, or thing which is made subject to the tax? This has been most conclusively answered by Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 56\n, 44 S. L. ed. 969, 975, where the section in question is construed as laying a tax upon the transmission, or the right to succeed to a legacy or distributive share or gift in contemplation of death, passing after the act.\n For reasons and upon grounds not necessary to be restated, it has been also conclusively decided in Vanderbilt v. Eidman, \n196 U.S. 480\n, 49 L. ed. 563, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 331, that the tax or duty does not attach to legacies or distributive shares until the right of succession becomes an absolute right of immediate possession or enjoyment. It was therefore held in the case cited that a legacy upon conditions which might never happen was not subject to the tax or duty prior to the time, if ever, when the right of possession or enjoyment should become absolute.\n To repeat, then: The subject of the tax or duty exacted by  29 is the right of succession which passes by death to a vested beneficial right of possession or enjoyment of a legacy or distributive share.\n Upon the facts certified, the right of succession which passed by the death of the testator was an absolute right to the immediate possession and enjoyment,-a right neither \n\n[218 U.S. 205, 220]\n\u00a0\n postponed until the falling in of a life estate, as in Mason v. Sargent, \n104 U.S. 689\n, 26 L. ed. 894, nor subject to contingencies, as in Vanderbilt v. Eidman, supra. No further event could make their title more certain nor their possession and enjoyment more secure. The law, then unrepealed and in full force, operated to fasten, at the moment this right of succession passed by death, a liability for the tax imposed upon the passing of every such inheritance or right of succession. The time for scheduling or listing was practically identical with the time for payment, and the listing or scheduling was required to be done by the executor charged with payment, but might be and was postponed for reasons of grace and of convenience. That is almost universal under any taxing system. The liability attaches at some time before the time for payment. But the liability for the payment of the tax exacted under  29 of the act of June 13, 1898, accrued or srose the moment the right of succession by death passed to the defendants in error, and the occurrence of no other fact or event was essential to the imposition of a liability for the statutory tax upon the interest thus acquired.\n Much has been urged because the tax was not 'due and payable' when the repealing act took effect, and the contention is that because not 'due and payable,' no tax had been theretofore imposed within the intent of the saving clause. What we have already said answers this. But let us see the very unreasonable result which would ensure if we are required to say that by 'tax or duty imposed under  29' Congress meant a tax or duty due and payable when the repealing act should go into effect.\n No one questions but that one effect of this saving clause would be to save any such tax as was 'due and payable' one year before July 1, 1902. This being so, it would be very unjust if the tax in the latter case is saved and the other remitted, inasmuch as the thing made subject to \n\n[218 U.S. 205, 221]\n\u00a0\n the tax would, in each case, be the same; namely, the transmission of a beneficial right to the possession and enjoyment of a legacy or distributive share at the death of a testator or intestate. In the one case, the tax paid upon the right passing by death would be preserved. In the other, a tax upon a like inheritance would be remitted. The only difference would be that, in one case, the time for payment had arrived, while, in the other, it had not, though, in the latter case, the ultimate obligation to pay was equally as certain and fixed as in the first case.\n Now, did Congress intend to make such an unjust distinction as would result from such an interpretation of the saving clause in question as shall make the time limit for payment the test as to whether one tax shall be preserved and the other remitted in a situation otherwise identical?\n The saving clause does not, in terms, limit the right saved to a tax or duty which should be due and payable at the date of the repeal. It is, perhaps, an obvious suggestion that if that had been the purpose of Congress, it would have been easy to make that purpose clear.\n But, in place of saying in so many words that 'all taxes or duties which should be due and payable prior to the taking effect of the act' should be subject to the provisions of  30, etc., the Congress said that 'all taxes or duties imposed by  29,' etc., prior to the taking effect of this act, should be subject to the provisions of  30. Now it is to be noticed that this  30, which is the remedial or procedure section, is not one of the sections repealed. The 29th section, which alone imposes any tax, is the one which is repealed. The plain purpose of the saving clause was to preserve some liability which had been imposed under  29, which would otherwise be lost. This it did by providing that all taxes 'imposed' prior to the going into effect of the act should, notwithstanding the repeal of the section which originated the tax, be preserved, and as to collection lien, etc., be \n\n[218 U.S. 205, 222]\n\u00a0\n subject to the unrepealed  30. It must also be borne in mind that this time limit for payment to 'one year after the death of the testator' came into the 30th section only by the amendment of March 2, 1901. Up to the time of that amendment, the only provision as to time was that still found in the later parts of the same section, namely, that 'before payment and distribution to the legatees' the executor, administrator, or trustee 'shall pay to the collector . . . the amount of the duty or tax assessed upon such legacy or distributive share, and shall also make and render (to the collector) a schedule, list, or statement, in duplicate, of the amount of such legacy or distributive share, together with the amount of duty which has accrued, or shall accrue thereon, verified,' etc. The same original section also provided that, in case of neglect to so pay or deliver the statement required 'within the time hereinbefore provided,' certain penalties should be incurred, and that the collector should make out schedules, etc. This reference to the 'time hereinbefore provided' is in the original section, and must, therefore, refer to a time before 'payment and distribution' to the legatees and distributees.\n It would seem to follow that the purpose and effect of the amendment making such tax 'due and payable in one year after the death of the testator' was to advance the time of payment so as to require payment within one year if there should be longer delay in paying legacies and distributive shares, leaving in full force the requirement that the tax should be paid before the payment of legacies and distributive shares, if such payment and distribution whould be made in less than one year. We have not passed over the fact that this time limit in terms applies only to the tax due under wills, and to the uncertainty as to the time for the apyment of the tax upon distributive shares. It, however, seems quite obvious that that time limit was intended to apply to shares in intestate estates, as well as \n\n[218 U.S. 205, 223]\n\u00a0\n to legacies from testators, and that the omission may be supplied by necessary implication.\n In has been suggested that the lien given by  30 only attaches when the tax is due and payable. The lien was in the section before the amendment, and, in view of its purpose, would attach with the obligation or liability for the tax. There is no reason which would justify the assumption that the lien only attached when the day of payment might arrive,-a date most indefinite before the insertion of the time limit by the amendment of 1902.\n But it has been urged that any conclusion which saves a tax from the effect of a repealing act which was not actually due and payable is in conflict with Mason v. Sargent, supra. That case arose under the inheritance tax law of 1864. [13 Stat. at L. 223, chap. 173.] The plaintiff's testator died while the law was in force, it having been repealed October 1, 1870. The legacy to the plaintiff, which was in that case held to have been illegally taxed, was one payable after the death of the widow of the testator, which did not occur until 1872, and after the repeal of the law under which the tax was claimed. But that case is distinguishable from this in more than one particular. The legacy sought to be taxed did not vest in possession and enjoyment before the repeal of the act under which it was supposed to be taxable. If, therefore, no taxable succession occurred during the existence of the inheritance tax law of 1864, the right to the tax would fail under the very test which this court, in Vanderbilt v. Eidman, made the test of whether a tax had been imposed during the operation of the act of June 13, 1898, and the very test which is applied in the present case.\n The precise question here involved, and upon which this case must turn, namely, whether a tax is not at once 'imposed,' by succeeding to an immediate right of possession and enjoyment, during the operation of the act of June 13, 1898, in such sense as to be within the \n\n[218 U.S. 205, 224]\n\u00a0\n intent of the saving clause in the act which repealed that act, was not and could not have been involved in the case cited. The terms, both of the act of 1864, as amended in 1866 [14 Stat. at L. 98, chap. 184], and of the act which repealed that act, and of the saving clause in the repealing act, are, in some important aspects, to be differentiated from the acts here involved. It is enough, however, to say of that case that no taxable succession having occurred before the repeal of the act, there was nothing to save by the saving clause in the repealing act. In the present case it is equally as clear that if no taxable succession actually vested prior to the repeal of the taxing act, no tax would be saved. If, however, there did occur such an absolute right to the possession and enjoyment of the legacies to the present defendants in error as made it subject at once to the imposition of a tax under the law in operation when such succession occurred, a very different question must be decided from any decided in Mason v. Sargent.\n The conclusion we reach is, that upon the passing by death of a vested right to the immediate possession or enjoyment of a legacy or distributive share, there was imposed the tax or duty exacted upon every such right of succession, which was saved by the saving clause of the repealing act.\n The question certified must be answered in the negative.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, dissenting:\n I am unable to agree to the judgment of the court. I regret that time does not serve to give adequate expression to my views or to consider opposing ones. Some of the elements of dissent I can only hastily give. The question of the interpretation of a statute is, however, seldom in broad compass. The purpose is to get at the meaning of the words, and fortunately there are wellknown rules \n\n[218 U.S. 205, 225]\n\u00a0\n to assist the process. The first of these is the motive of the law. Whatever construction advances that carries a presumption of truth.\n There must be a strict or liberal construction, according to the purpose of the law; the former, if it imposes burdens; the latter, if it relieves from them. The contentions of the government, it seems to me, reverse this order. Their consequences seem to me to be: The law is a taxing one; is concededly of doubtful meaning; it must nevertheless be construed against the taxpayer. It was intended to relieve from burdens; its ambiguities must be resolved to retain them.\n These contradictions between intention and result are intensified if we consider the general purpose of the law, proclaimed at the time of its enactment. It was intended as a repeal of war revenue taxation. In other words, to take from a time of peace burdens laid in time of war. A worthy purpose, I submit, and based on wisest considerations of governmental policy, and not to be defeated or impaired in any of its details by resolving the uncertainties of language against it.\n There was emphatic and illustrative unanimity in the Committee of Ways and Means of the House of Representatives that reported and recommended the law. There was a difference of opinion in the committee as to the extent of the reduction which should be made, resulting from a difference in other views of its members, but there was no difference as to the necessity of a reduction of revenue.\n The majority of the committee recommended a reduction of $73,000,000; the minority was of opinion it should be $123,000,000. In the reduction there was a special item of legacies. The figures need no comment. They display the purpose of Congress. Words, however, were added to emphasize it. 'Sound business judgment,' it was said, 'dictates a sweeping reduction of our revenues.' \n\n[218 U.S. 205, 226]\n\u00a0\n The final word of recommendation of the measure was that 'every consideration of prudence commends' its 'wisdon.' This, then, was the purpose of the measure, sanctioned by the highest considerations of judgment and wisdom. Should it not prevail, certainly have dominance in the interpretation of the law passed to effect it? Even as to a live and continuing law, the rule of interpretation is that taxes must be expressed in clare and unambiguous language. If there be doubt, it is to be resolved against the government. Eidman v. Martinez, \n184 U.S. 578\n, 46 L. ed. 697, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 515. Such a rule of interpretation certainly should be applicable to a statute repealing taxation. To what an anomalous contrast does its disregard bring us? Shall a law passed to supply the wants of a deficient treasury have a more restrictive construction than one passed against the burden of a constantly increasing surplus? Indeed, this case presents even a stronger contrast. Under the rule of interpretation announced in Eidman v. Martinez, a law providing for the exigencies of war cannot prevail against the right of the taxpayer to resist taxation, the authority for which is equivocally expressed. But peace legislation, it seems, may claim a more determined power, though it have no necessities but the reduction of revenue; though it proclaims that purpose, and is urged to it by governmental policy. It may have a double sense and yet be unfaltering in its exactions, resisting presumptions of law and legal rules, but a war measure may not.\n I cannot believe that Congress intended to leave uncertainty, or, if uncertainty should inadvertently result, that it was to be resolved to retain taxes, and not abolish them. And it had the means of certainty, and, I must assume, availed itself of them. Prior cases had given it examples of the interpretation of taxing law,-indeed, of the special kind of taxing laws which it was repealing; and we may be sure that it had those examples in mind in fixing the scope of its enactment. And this is in accordance \n\n[218 U.S. 205, 227]\n\u00a0\n with a familiar rule of interpretation which this court has applied and necessarily will be called upon to apply again. That is, that when provisions which have received judicial interpretation are used in a statute, they are supposed to be used with the meaning that had been given to them. Under any other rule judicial decisions would make 'not light, but darkness visible.'\n In Clapp v. Mason, \n94 U.S. 589\n, 24 L. ed. 212, a statute passed in 1864 [13 Stat. at L. 223, chap. 173] subjected to a tax legacies and successions. Under it a tax was assessed upon certain real estate deivised by Mason to his widow for her life, or until she should cease to occupy the same as a place of residence, and upon her death, or ceasing to occupy the same, to Clapp. The widow occupied the real estate until June 17, 1872. Mason, the testator, died December 4, 1867; the tax was assessed on the 15th of May, 1873. It was paid on the 31st, under protest, to avoid distraint or other forcible process to collect the same.\n Under the statute of 1864 the tax would have been a proper one, but by a statute passed July 14, 1870 [16 Stat. at L. 261, chap. 255], the tax imposed by the former act was repealed. The repealing clause, however, continued the provisions of former acts, levying and collecting all taxes properly assessed or liable to be assessed, or accruing under their provisions. It provided also that 'any act done, right accrued, or penalty incurred under former acts,' should be saved.\n The collector insisted that the tax upon succession in question had accrued before the repeal of the act of 1864; that is, upon the death of the testator. The devisees contended that it did not accrue until they came into possession of the land; and before that occurred, it was asserted, the statute assessing the tax had been repealed.\n The court stated the question to be when the right to the tax accrued,- 'at the death of the testator, or at the death of the widow, when the plaintiff became entitled to the possession of the land?' In answer to the question, the \n\n[218 U.S. 205, 228]\n\u00a0\n court conceded that the will of Mason conveyed an estate to William P. Mason and Charles H. Parker (those who took after the widow), and that, although they were not entitled to immediate possession, they had a vested estate. And it was conceded that not only vested estates, but those in expectancy, were within the statute. The admission, however, the court said, did not aid them in deciding the point before them, as the question of time still arose,-When was the vested estate taxable?\n The question was answered by saying, after a consideration of the provisions of the statute, that it would be difficult to carry out its 'system in any other manner than by the provision that the succession should not be deemed taxable until such time as the successor should be entitled to its possession.' It was further said:\n'The act of 1864 contains no statement or intimation that this duty creates any lien upon the land, or that any obligation arises, or that any right accrues at a period earlier than that fixed for the payment of the duty. See  133, 137.\n\n ... * *\n'It is manifest that the right does not accrue until the duty can be demanded; that is, when it is made payable; in other words, at the end of thirty days after becoming entitled to possession.'\n\n The questions were re-examined and decided same way in Mason v. Sargent, \n104 U.S. 689\n, 26 L. ed. 894. The latter case, however, exhibits more clearly the applicability of the principles discussed to the case at bar. Mason died December 4, 1867. He bequeathed by his will certain personal property to the plaintiffs in the action in trust for his widow, and upon her death one half to William P. Mason and one half to Eliza R. Cabot. The widow died in 1872. In April, 1873, the tax in question was assessed. It was paid under protest, and plaintiffs brought the action for the refunding of the tax, on the ground that the property \n\n[218 U.S. 205, 229]\n\u00a0\n did not vest in possession of the legatees until the death of the testator's widow, which occurred after the repeal of the legacy succession tax act, and that the tax had not accrued so as to come within the saving clause of the act of repeal.\n The act of 1864 (13 Stat. at L. 223, 285, chap. 173, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2268) subjected legacies and distributive shares of personal property to a tax passing from a decedent, in the hands of an executor or administrator, varying in amount according to the degree of relationship of the beneficiary to the decedent. It further provided that the tax or duty should be payable whenever the party interested in the legacy or shares should become entitled to the possession and enjoyment thereof. The repealing act contained the saving clause which has been already set out.\n The collector contended that the tax had accrued when the repealing act took effect, October 1, 1870. The opposing contention was that the tax did not become a claim in favor of the government until the legacy itself became payable, which was not until after the death of the widow, June 17, 1872. The latter contention was sustained, and the tax declared to have been illegally demanded.\n It was decided that the legacy was the subject of the tax; that it was exempt during the life of the widow, and only became payable upon her death; that it did 'not become a subject of taxation until the right' accrued 'to reduce it to possession.' The provision of the law which required the trustee to give written notice to the assessor of his trust within therty days after he should take charge of it was declared 'not material to the argument,' and that the provision of the act of 1864, that the tax or duty thereby imposed should be a lien or charge upon the property bequeathed for twenty years, or until the same be paid within that period, determined nothing as to the time when the tax accrued.\n Clapp v. Mason was cited as applicable, and the court \n\n[218 U.S. 205, 230]\n\u00a0\n concluded as follows: 'No right to the payment of the tax had accrued at the date when the repealing act took effect; and, therefore, none to collect it can be deduced from its saving clauses.'\n Clapp v. Mason and Mason v. Sargent were followed as determinative of when, under  7 of the act of April 12, 1902 [32 Stat. at L. 97, chap. 500, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 875] (the act now in question), the tax should be regarded as 'imposed' in Tilghman v. Eidman, by Circuit judge Lacombe at circuit, and also by the circuit court of appeals of the second circuit. 131 Fed. 652, 69 C. C. A. 139, 136 Fed. 141. The judgment was affirmed by this court by an equal division of its members. \n203 U.S. 580\n, 51 L. ed. 326, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 779.\n A distinction is made between those cases and that at bar, and there is some distinction in the facts; but not such, in my opinion, as to take this case out of the principle announced in them. They were made to turn upon the fact that the tax or duty was upon the legacy or distributive shares. In this they were applied in Sturges v. United States, \n117 U.S. 293\n, 29 L. ed. 920, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 767, and aollowed in Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 U.S. 41\n, 44 L. ed. 969, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 747, and Vanderbilt v. Eidman, \n196 U.S. 480\n, 49 L. ed. 563, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 331, in which the act of June 13, 1898, was interpreted. It is said in Knowlton v. Moore, 'that the provisions of the act of 1864 were in mind when' the act of June 13, 1898 [30 Stat. at L. 448, chap. 448, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2286], was drafted. The cases of Clapp v. Mason and Mason v. Sargent were decided when that act was drafted. Is it not a fair inference that it and its repealing act were intended to have the same meaning and interpretation which had been given to its prototype and its repealing act?\n Those cases were also made to turn on the fact that, as the tax was upon the legacy or distributive share, there could be no tax nor claim in favor of the government until such legacy or share was vested in the possession and enjoyment of the legatee or distributee. In this again they were followed in Vanderbilt v. Eidman. And it seems to me, therefore, that there is such resemblance of the provisions of the act of 1864 to those of the act of \n\n[218 U.S. 205, 231]\n\u00a0\n June 13, 1898, as to make the cases interpreting the former decisive precedents of the meaning of the latter.\n The time of payment is in both acts at a date subsequent to the death of the testator. In the act of 1898, one year after his death; in the act of 1864, when the legacy came into possession and enjoyment. This difference in time can make no difference with the principle that the tax does not accrue until it becomes due and payable. And, I submit, is not 'imposed' until then, does not become a claim in favor of the government until then, and, not being such, is not saved by  8 of the repealing act. The lien does not attach until then. By  30 of the act of 1898, the tax is due one year after the death of the testator, and is secured by a lien; but when the lien attaches is not stated. There is the same silence in the act of 1864. The omission was supplied by Mason v. Sargent, which declared that the lien presupposed the existence of the tax, and only attached when the tax accrued. This must also be the meaning of  30, and we have a further parallel between the acts, completing the application of the cited cases. Mark, too, the words of  8 of the repealing act, associating the tax and the lien, showing how closely the legislative mind followed the judicial decisions and gave its legislation, as I think, the certain meaning that the interpretation of the prior enactments afforded. Section 8 provides as follows: 'That all taxes or duties imposed by  29 . . . shall be subject as to lien, charge, collection, and otherwise to the provisions of  30. . . .'\n An argument is made to show that a tax may be said to be imposed, though it be not due and payable. The argument is answered, I think, by what I have said. A tax is not imposed by a mere provision for it. Illustrations of this will readily come to mind besides those afforded by the cited cases. However, I will not attempt to further review the contentions of the government or the opposing \n\n[218 U.S. 205, 232]\n\u00a0\n ones, nor consider from which the greater embarrassments, if any, will result. The force of the conflicting contentions, and of course they have force, establish the ambiguity of the statute and the different meanings that can be ascribed to it. In such situation the rule of interpretation which I have announced, and which I have shown is sanctioned by this court, should turn decision against the tax. I will not quote the circuit courts and the circuit courts of appeal, which ahve so thought and have pronounced against the government. They make a body of authority, persuasive in their numbers and rank. And this court has divided in opinion. I do not mention the fact as a circumstance which should preclude consideration of the question, but I bring it forward as an element of some power in the discussion. In may not have the 'true, fixed, and resting quality' of stare decisis, but it has nevertheless strong appeal and persuasion. It has persisted through quite a period of time and against many attempts to disturb it. It is certainly something more patent than inaction. It gave authority to the decision of the circuit court of appeals in Eidman v. Tilghman [69 C. C. A. 139, 136 Fed. 141], and that again determined other judgments and became a rule of decision for the settlement of estates.\n I think the question certified should be answered in the affirmative.\n I am authorized to say that the CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice Day concur in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n 'Sec. 7.

Woodworth for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 509, 513]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Fowler for respondent.\n\n\n[217 U.S. 509, 515]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The petitioner, Gustav Holmgren, was convicted and sentenced in the district court of the United States for the northern district of California of the crime of false swearing in naturalization proceedings, in violation of  5395 of the \n\n[217 U.S. 509, 516]\n\u00a0\n Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3654). The judgment was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals. 84 C. C. A. 301, 156 Fed. 439. The conviction was upon the third count of the indictment, which charged that in a naturalization proceeding, upon the application of one Frank Werta for admission to citizenship in the United States, pending September 21, 1903, in the superior court of the city and county of San Francisco. California, a court of record of the state of California, with common-law jurisdiction, a seal, and a clerk, the petitioner swore falsely in making the material statement, under oath, that he, the said Gustav Holmgren, had been acquainted with the said Frank Werta in the United States during the five years immediately preceding the application for naturalization, whereas, in truth and in fact, as he then well knew, the said Werta had not resided continuously in the United States for a period of five years, and the said Holmgren had not known the said Werta for more than four years prior to said application.\n The principal question in the case is whether, under  5395, United States Revised Statutes, a conviction can be had in a Federal court for a false oath in naturalization proceedings had in a state court.\n Preliminarily to a consideration of the proper construction of this section, we may notice the contention of the petitioner that there is no constitutional power in Congress to confer jurisdiction upon the courts of a state in naturalization proceedings, involving admission to citizenship in the United States.\n Article 1,  8, clause 4, of the Constitution of the United States, vests in Congress the power to establish an uniform rule of naturalization. Acting under this constitutional authority, from the earliest history of the government, Congress has passed acts regulating the naturalization of aliens, admitting them to citizenship in the United States, and has authorized such proceedings in the state as well as Federal courts. The validity of such proceedings by virtue of the power conferred \n\n[217 U.S. 509, 517]\n\u00a0\n by acts of Congress has been recognized from an early day. Campbell v. Gordon, 6 Cranch, 176, 182, 3 L. ed. 190, 192; Stark v. Chesapeake Ins. Co. 7 Cranch, 420, 3 L. ed. 391. The naturalization acts of the United States, from the first one, in 1790 [1 Stat. at L. 103, chap. 3], have conferred authority upon state courts to admit aliens to citizenship. Van Dyne, Naturalization, p. 11, and the following.\n It is undoubtedly true that the right to create courts for the states does not exist in Congress. The Constitution provides (art. 3,  1) that the judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such inferior courts as the Congress may, from time to time, ordain and establish. But it does not follow that Congress may not constitutionally authorize the magistrates or courts of a state to enforce a statute providing for a uniform system of naturalization, and defining certain proceedings which, when complied with, shall make the applicant a citizen of the United States. This Congress had undertaken to do in making provision for the naturalization of aliens to become citizens of the United States in a certain class of state courts,-those of record having common-law jurisdiction, a clerk and a seal. U. S. Rev. Stat.  2165, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1329, since superseded by the act of June 29, 1906 ( 34 Stat. at L. 596, chap. 3592, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 97).\n The question is not here presented whether the states can be required to enforce such naturalization laws against their consent, for it appears that the Constitution of the state of California, in  5, article 6, and the statutes in  76 of the Code of Civil Procedure of that state, grant to the courts the power of naturalization, and the right to issue papers therefor. Unless prohibited by state legislation, state courts and magistrates may exercise the powers conferred by Congress under such laws. Re Stephens, 4 Gray, 559. The indictment charges that Werta made application as an alien to be admitted to citizenship in the United States, the proceeding was had, and false oath charged was taken, under authority of the statutes of the United States. The present proceeding was to prosecute the petitioner for alleged false swearing un- \n\n[217 U.S. 509, 518]\n\u00a0\n der an oath administered under authority of a law of the United States. Where such is the case, we think the Congress of the United States may constitutionally provide for the punishment of such offenses, whether the oath is taken before a Federal court or officer, or before a state court or officer, acting under authority derived from the act of Congress. See Re Loney, \n134 \nU.S. 372, 374\n, 33 S. L . ed. 949, 950, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 584.\n We come, then, to the question whether the section under which the proceeding was had authorizes a prosecution for perjury when committed in naturalization proceedings in other than Federal courts. As we have seen, the statutes of the United States confer jurisdiction to admit aliens to citizenship in the United States, not only on Federal courts, but also upon certain state courts, and  5395 of the Revised Statutes provides:\n'In all cases where any oath or affidavit is made or taken under or by virtue of any law relating to the naturalization of aliens, or in any proceedings under such laws, any person taking or making such oath or affidavit, who knowingly swears falsely, shall be punished by imprisonment not more than five years nor less than one year, and by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars.'\n\n The terms of this section are certainly broad enough to include an oath or affidavit, whether taken in a Federal court or a state court, for the requirement of the statute is that such oath or affidavit be made or taken under or by virtue of any law relating to naturalization of aliens, or in any proceedings under any such laws. The false oath in question was taken under and by virtue of the Federal statutes regulating naturalization, and in a proceeding authorized under such laws, although in a state court.\n It is contended, however, that the history of this section (5395), and the effect of the revision of the laws embodied in the Revised Statutes of 1873, makes it applicable only to false swearing in the courts of the United States in such a naturalization proceedings as may be therein instituted. As car- \n\n[217 U.S. 509, 519]\n\u00a0\n mried into the Revised Statutes, this section was taken from  1 of the act of July 14, 1870, being an act to amend the naturalization laws and to punish crimes against the same, etc. 16 Stat. at L. 254, chap. 254. Section 4 of that act was as follows:\n'And be it further enacted, that the provisions of this act shall apply to all proceedings had or taken, or attempted to be had or taken, before any court in which any proceeding for naturalization shall be commenced, had, or taken, or attempted to be commenced; and the courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction of all offenses under the provisions of this act, in or before whatsoever court or tribunal the same shall have been committed.'\n\n In codifying the statutes, the 1st section of the act of July 14, 1870, was made  5395 of the Revised Statutes, and is part of title 70, chapter 4, 'Crimes against Justice.' Sections 2 and 3 of the act were made  5424 to 5428 of the Revised Statutes, and part of chapter 5, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3668-3670, entitled 'Crimes against the Operations of the Government.' Section 4 of the act of July 14, 1870, was made  5429 of the Revised Statutes, and reads as follows:\n'The provisions of the five preceding sections shall apply to all proceedings had or taken, or attempted to be had or taken, before any court in which any proceeding for naturalization may be commenced or attempted to be commenced.'\n\n The argument is that, inasmuch as  5395 is not one of the 'five preceding sections,' it is to be inferred that Congress intended to give jurisdiction to the Federal courts for violation of that section only in naturalization proceedings in the Federal courts, and not to include false swearing in naturalization proceedings before any court, which would include a state court. But we cannot agree to this contention. The Revised Statutes are the result of the revision and codification of the laws under authority of an act of Congress, whose purpose it was not to create a new system of laws, but to codify and arrange former laws, omitting redundant or ob- \n\n[217 U.S. 509, 520]\n\u00a0\n solete enactments, and making such amendments and changes as were necessary to correct contradictions, supply omissions, and amend imperfections in the original text. 14 Stat. at L. 75, chap. 140.\n The courts will not infer that Congress, in revising and consolidating the laws, intended to change their policy, in the absence of a clear expression of such purpose. United States v. Ryder, \n110 \nU.S. 729, 740\n, 28 S. L. ed. 308, 31 2, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 196. No reason is suggested for a change of the purposes of the law in the separation of the sections according to the codification in the manner we have stated. The purpose of the laws was still the same, and when we interpret this section of the statutes, in view of its origin, we think there can be no doubt of its meaning. The act of July 14, 1870, made its provision applicable to all proceedings had before any court in which naturalization proceedings might be commenced, and gave to the courts of the United States jurisdiction of all such offenses committed before any tribunal, state or Federal. The language of  5395 is broad enough to include proceedings in any court, and, considered in the light of its adoption from laws of the same purport, we have no doubt of the intention of Congress to continue to include all such proceedings.\n It is next contended that the court erred in permitting the indictment to go to the jury, and be taken with them into the jury room, which indictment contained an indorsement thereon, showing the conviction of the accused on the third count thereof at a former trial. The proceedings in this respect are thus set out in the record:\n'Thereupon, and before the jury retired to deliberate upon their verdict, the clerk of the court handed to the jury the forms of verdict with the indictment in the case. That said indictment was taken by them to the jury room, and retained by them during their entire deliberations in the cause. That the jury retired at 12:30 o'clock, and later returned to the court with a verdict of guilty on the third count of said indictment. That at the time said indictment was handed to \n\n[217 U.S. 509, 521]\n\u00a0\n the jury by the officials of the court, and was taken by said jury to the jury room, there were the following indorsements upon said indictment: 'Form No. 168. Back of cover of indictment, with plea and judgment. Arraigned Nov . 2, 1905. Mch. 14, 1906. Pleaded not guilty. Tried April 5, 6, 7, 1906. Verdict not guilty on the 1st and 2d counts of the indictment, and guilty on the 3d count of the indictment. April 13, 1906. New trial is granted.\"\n\n It would be sufficient to say of this objection that it was not taken until a motion was made for a new trial, which motion, with the accompanying affidavits to the effect that the jury had read and considered the indorsements upon the indictment, was considered, and the motion overruled by the trial court. It has been frequently decided that the allowance or refusal of a new trial rests in the sound discretion of the trial court, and its action in that respect cannot be made the basis of review by writ of error from this court. Indianapolis, & St. L. R. Co. v. Horst, \n93 \nU.S. 291, 301\n, 23 S. L. ed. 898, 901; Kerr v. Clampitt, \n95 U.S. 188\n, 24 L. ed. 493; Newcomb v. Wood, \n97 \nU.S. 581, 583\n, 24 S. L. ed. 1085, 1086\n\n\n It is contended by the petitioner that a contrary view to that taken by the circuit court of appeals in this case was taken in Ogden v. United States, 50 C. C. A. 380, 112 Fed. 523, circuit court of appeals of the third circuit. In that case, however, it appeared that the court below refused to consider the motion and affidavit showing that the indictment, with an indorsement of a former conviction thereon, had been taken to and kept in the jury room during their deliberations. The court recognized the rule that the overruling of a motion for a new trial is not a subject of review in an appellate court, but found that the court below had refused to consider the motion and affidavits, and declined to exercise its discretion, as it was its duty to do. It is true the court, after finding that reversible error had been committed by the failure to entertain the motion for a new trial, deemed it was its duty not merely to remand, so that the motion might be considered by the court below, but itself passed upon the motion for a new \n\n[217 U.S. 509, 522]\n\u00a0\n trial. The primary basis, however, upon which the court acted, was the failure of the court below to consider the motion for a new trial,-a circumstance which does not exist here. To the like effect is Mattox v. United States, \n146 U.S. 140\n, 36 L. ed. 917, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 50, where the court below refused to entertain affidavits showing the reading of a newspaper, containing an unfavorable article, during the deliberations of the jury, and also damaging remarks of an officer in charge of the jury during the progress of the trial. In both cases the basis of the action of the reviewing court was the refusal of the courts below to exercise the discretion vested in them by law.\n But it is urged that, notwithstanding the objection was first taken in this case upon the motion for a new trial, this court may notice a plain error not properly reserved in the record. Undoubtedly the court has this authority and does sometimes exercise it.\n But an examination of the record in this case does not satisfy us that we should exercise this right to review an error not properly reserved, and require the granting of a new trial because of the indorsements upon the indictment sent to the jury, together with the forms of verdict. The record contains all the testimony, and is ample to sustain the conviction of the defendant without giving weight to the effect of this indorsement. The indorsement itself shows that a new trial was granted upon the former conviction on the third count. This action of the court in setting aside what the jury had formerly done is quite as likely to influence the jury favorably to the accused, as was the fact of former conviction by the jury to work to his prejudice.\n We do not mean to indicate that such indorsements should be permitted to go to a jury, or that the fact of former conviction should be urged or referred to in the progress of the trial. It is undoubtedly the correct rule that the jury should be kept free from all such extraneous and improper influences. But in this case we do not find in the record any reason for the exercise of the authority granted to us under \n\n[217 U.S. 509, 523]\n\u00a0\n the 35th rule, to notice a plain error not properly reserved.\n It is further urged that the indictment, in the third count thereof, does not properly charge an offense against Holmgren. It is true that in the third count it appears that the name of Frank Werta, the alien, was written by mistake for that of Gustav Holmgren, in averring that the witness was duly and properly sworn, but this count also contains the averment that 'the said Gustav Holmgrem, having taken such oath to testify, as aforesaid, did then and there wilfully,' etc, and 'contrary to the said oath, testify in substance and to the effect,' etc. This objection does not appear to have been specifically pointed out in the demurrer or otherwise taken advantage of upon the trial. In this proceeding it is too late to urge such objections to a matter of form unless it is apparent that it affected the substantial rights of the accused. Rev. Stat.  1025, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 720; Connors v. United States, \n158 \nU.S. 408, 411\n, 39 S. L. ed. 1033, 1034, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 951; Armour Packing Co. v. United States, \n209 \nU.S. 56, 84\n, 52 S. L . ed. 681, 695, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 428.\n It is further alleged that the court erred in refusing to give the following request to charge concerning the testimony of Frank Werta, the alien seeking to be naturalized in the proceeding:\n'I charge you that if you believe the testimony of the witness Frank Werta, then that said witness was an accomplice in crime with the defendant; and I instruct you that before you can convict said defendant, the testimony of the witness Frank Werta should be corroborated by the testimony of at least one witness, or strong corroborating circumstances.'\n\n It may be doubtful whether Werta can be regarded as an accomplice, as the record tends to show that he had no part in procuring the testimony of Holmgren, and in nowise induced him to make the oath which was the basis for the proceedings. Be that as it may, the request did not properly state the law, as it assumed that Werta was an accomplice,-a conclusion which was controverted, and against which the jury might have found in the light of the testimony. It is \n\n[217 U.S. 509, 524]\n\u00a0\n undoubtedly the better practice for courts to caution juries against too much reliance upon the testimony of accomplices, and to require corroborating testimony before giving credence to them. But no such charge was asked to be presented to the jury by any proper request in the case, and the refusal to grant the one asked for was not error.\n Other questions are raised in the case as to the admissibility of certain testimony; we have examined them and find nothing prejudicial to the rights of the petitioner.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is therefore affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","68":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOLT v. U.S.(1910)\nNo. 231\nArgued: Decided: October 31, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 245, 246]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Hugh M. Caldwell, C. F. Riddell, and John Lewis Smith for plaintiff in error.\n Assistant Attorney General Fowler for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff in error was indicted in the circuit court for murder, alleged to have been committed 'within the Fort Worden Military Reservation, a place under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.' There was a trial and a verdict of guilty, without capital punishment, as allowed by statute. He was sentenced to imprisonment for life, and thereupon brought this writ of error. 168 Fed. 141. \n\n[218 U.S. 245, 247]\n\u00a0\n The seriousness of some of the questions raised is somewhat obscured by a number of meticulous objections. We shall dispose of the latter summarily, and shall discuss at length only matters that deserve discussion. We shall follow in the main the order adopted by the plaintiff in error.\n The indictment is well enough. The words quoted at the outset convey with clearness sufficient for justice that the Fort Worden Military Reservation was under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States at the time of the murder. It is alleged that Holt did with force and arms and assault make upon one Henry E. Johnson with a certain iron bar, and did then and there feloniously, wilfully, knowingly, and with malice aforethought, strike, beat, and mortally wound him, the said Henry E. Johnson, with said iron bar, etc. As the acts constituting the assault are alleged to have been made feloniously and with malice aforethought, there was no need to make such allegations in the preliminary averment of assault.\n It is pressed with more earnestness that the court erred in not granting leave to withdraw the plea of not guilty, and to interpose a plea in abatement and motion to quash. The ground on which leave was asked was an affidavit of the prisoner's counsel that they had been informed by Captain Newton, of the Coast Artillery Corps, that he testified before the grand jury to admissions by the prisoner, but that these admissions were obtained under circumstances that made them incompetent. The affidavit added that, aside from the above testimony, there was very little evidence against the accused. Without considering how far, if at all, the court is warranted in inquiring into the nature of the evidence on which a grand jury has acted, and how far, in case of such an inquiry, the discretion of the trial court is subject to review (United States v. Rosenburgh, 7 Wall. 580, 19 L. ed. 263), it is enough to say that there is no reason for reviewing it here. \n\n[218 U.S. 245, 248]\n\u00a0\n All that the affidavit disclosed was that evidence in its nature competent, but made incompetent by circumstances, had been considered along with the rest. The abuses of criminal practice would be enhanced if indictments could be upset on such a ground. McGregor v. United States, 69 C. C. A. 477, 134 Fed. 187, 192; Radford v. United States, 63 C. C. A. 491, 129 Fed. 49, 51; Chadwick v. United States, 72 C. C. A. 343, 141 Fed. 225, 235.\n Next it is said that there was error in not sustaining a challenge for cause to a juryman; with the result that the prisoner's peremptory challenges were diminished by one. On his examination it appeared that this juryman had not talked with anyone who purported to know about the case of his own knowledge, but that he had taken the newspaper statements for facts; that he had no opinion other than that derived from the papers, and that evidence would change it very easily, although it would take some evidence to remove it. He stated that if the evidence failed to prove the facts alleged in the newspapers, he would decide according to the evidence or lack of evidence at the trial, and that he thought he could try the case solely upon the evidence, fairly and impartially. The finding of the trial court upon the strength of the juryman's opinions and his partiality or impartiality ought not to be set aside by a reviewing court unless the error is manifest, which it is far from being in this case. See Reynolds v. United States, \n98 U.S. 145\n, 25 L. ed. 244; Hopt v. Utah, \n120 U.S. 430\n, 30 L. ed. 708, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 614; Spies v. Illinois, \n123 U.S. 131\n, 31 L. ed. 80, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 21, 22. If the decisions of the state of Washington are of especial importance, we do not understand Rose v. State, 2 Wash. 310, 312, 26 Pac. 264; State v. Croney, 31 Wash. 122, 125, 126, 71 Pac. 783, and intervening cases to be overruled by State v. Riley, 36 Wash. 441, 447, 448, 78 Pac. 1001\n\n\n Before the above-mentioned motion to withdraw the plea of not guilty was argued, the judge was asked to exclude the twelve jurors who had been selected al- \n\n[218 U.S. 245, 249]\n\u00a0\n though not sworn. He replied that he was unwilling to exclude the jury from any part of the proceedings in the trial. Later, after the jury had been sworn, he pursued the same course while hearing preliminary evidence of the circumstances in which the prisoner was alleged to have made statements, and while hearing arguments as to admitting the statements. The district attorney spoke of the admissibility of 'confessions' in the course of his remarks. Exceptions were taken and the judge's refusal is urged with much earnestness to have been error. But we are of opinion that it was within the discretion of the judge to allow the jury to remain in court. Technically the offer of the evidence had to be made in their presence before any question of excluding them could arise. They must have known, even if they left the court, that statements relied on as admitting part or the whole of the government's case were offered. The evidence to which they listened was simply evidence of facts deemed by the judge sufficient to show that the statements, if any, were not freely made, and it could not have prejudiced the prisoner. No evidence was admitted that the prisoner had made any confession, and his statements were excluded. Moreover, the judge said to the jury that they were to decide the case on the testimony as it came from the witnesses on the stand; not what counsel might say or the newspapers publish; that he was not excluding them, because he assumed that they were men of experience and common sense and could decide the case upon the evidence that the court admitted. He also told them in the strongest terms that the preliminary evidence that he was hearing had no bearing on the question they had to decide. No doubt the more conservative course is to exclude the jury during the consideration of the admissibility of confessions, but there is force in the judge's view that if juries are fit to play the part assigned to them by our law, they will be able to do what a judge had to do \n\n[218 U.S. 245, 250]\n\u00a0\n every time that he tries a case on the facts without them, and we cannot say that he was wrong in thinking that the men before him were competent for their task.\n Objections similar to the last are taken to the conduct of the district attorney. They are stated and argued, like the last, with many details, which we have examined, but think it unnecessary to reproduce. In his opening the district attorney stated that the prisoner admitted that a coat with soot marks upon it, and a gunner's badge were his, and was going on to recite further statements, when they were objected to. The district attorney answered that these were voluntary confessions, but that he would omit them, if objected to, until the proper time, and desisted. Objection was made to the word 'confessions,' and the judge replied that he did not hear any statement that the prisoner made any confession. No instruction was asked, but, as we have said, the judge told the jury that they were to regard only the evidence admitted by him, not statements of counsel, etc. The attempt to get in the evidence is criticized also as unduly pressed. We see no reason to differ from the judge's statement upon a motion for a new trial, that the United States attorney was guilty of no misconduct. The exceptions on this point also are overruled.\n We will take up in this connection another matter not excepted to, but made one of the grounds for demanding a new trial, and also some of its alleged consequences, because they also involve the question how far the jury lawfully may be trusted to do their duty when the judge is satisfied that they are worthy of the trust. The jurymen were allowed to separate during the trial, always being cautioned by the judge to refrain from talking about the case with anyone, and to avoid receiving any impression as to the merits except from the proceedings in court. The counsel for the prisoner filed his own affidavit that members of the jury had stated to him that \n\n[218 U.S. 245, 251]\n\u00a0\n they had read the Seattle daily papers with articles on the case, while the trial was going on. He set forth articles contained in those papers, and moved for a new trial. The court refused to receive counter affidavits, but, assuming in favor of the prisoner that the jurors had read the articles, he denied the motion. This court could not make that assumption if the result would be to order a new trial, but the probability that jurors, if allowed to separate, will see something of the public prints, is so obvious, that, for the purpose of passing on the permission to separate, it may be assumed that they did so in this case.\n We are dealing with a motion for a new trial, the denial of which cannot be treated as more than matter of discretion or as ground for reversal, except in very plain circumstances indeed. Mattox v. United States, \n146 U.S. 140\n, 36 L. ed. 917, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 50. See Holmgren v. United States, \n217 U.S. 509\n, 54 L. ed. 861, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 588. It would be hard to say that this case presented a sufficient exception to the general rule. The judge did not reject the affidavit, but decided against the motion on the assumption that more than it ventured to allege was true. As to his exercise of discretion, it is to be remembered that the statutes or decisions of many states expressly allow the separation of the jury, even in capital cases. Other states have provided the contrary. The practice has varied, with perhaps a slight present tendency in the more conservative direction. If the mere opportunity for prejudice or corruption is to raise a presumption that they exist, it will be hard to maintain jury trial under the conditions of the present day. Without intimating that the judge did not go further than we should think desirable on general principles, we do not see in the facts before us any conclusive ground for saying that his expressed belief that the trial was fair and that the prisoner has nothing to complain of is wrong.\n Several objections were taken to the admission and \n\n[218 U.S. 245, 252]\n\u00a0\n sufficiency of evidence. The first is merely an attempt to raise technical difficulties about a fact which no one really doubts; namely, that the band barracks, the undisputed place of the crime, were within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. A witness testified that they were within the inclosure of Fort Worden, under military guard and control, from which all unauthorized persons are excluded, and that he knew that the fence was coincident with the boundaries shown on a map objected to but admitted. He identified the band barracks as described in certain condemnation proceedings. The state of Washington had assented by statute to such proceedings and Congress had authorized them. The deeds and condemnation proceedings under which the United States claimed title were introduced. The witness relied in part upon the correctness of official maps in the Engineer's Department, made from original surveys under the authority of the War Department, but not within his personal knowledge, and he referred to a book showing the titles to Fort Worden compiled under the same authority. The documents referred to are not before us, but they properly were introduced, and, so far as we can see, justified the finding of the jury, even if the evidence of the de facto exercise of exclusive jurisdiction was not enough, or if the United States was called on to try title in a murder case. We think it unnecessary to discuss this objection in greater detail.\n Another objection is based upon an extravagant extension of the 5th Amendment. A question arose as to whether a blouse belonged to the prisoner. A witness testified that the prisoner put it on and it fitted him. It is objected that he did this under the same duress that made his statements inadmissible, and that it should be excluded for the same reasons. But the prohibition of compelling a man in a criminal court to be witness against himself is a prohibition of the use of physical or moral \n\n[218 U.S. 245, 253]\n\u00a0\n compulsion to extort communications from him, not an exclusion of his body as evidence when it may be material. The objection in principle would forbid a jury to look at a prisoner and compare his features with a photograph in proof. Moreover, we need not consider how far a court would go in compelling a man to exhibit himself. For when he is exhibited, whether voluntarily or by order, and even if the order goes too far, the evidence, if material, is competent. Adams v. New York, \n192 U.S. 585\n, 48 L. ed. 575, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 372.\n The remaining exceptions relate to the charge. One was to a refusal to embody an instruction requested as to reasonable doubt. The court, however, gave full and correct instructions on the matter, and indeed, rather anxiously repeated and impressed upon the jury the clearness of the belief they must entertain in order to convict. See Dunbar v. United States, \n156 \nU.S. 185, 199\n, 39 S. L. ed. 390, 395, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 325; 4 Wigmore, Ev.,  2497. Another exception was to the refusal to give an instruction that 'the presumption of innocence starts with the charge at the beginning of the trial, and goes with [the accused] until the determination of the case. This presumption of innocence is evidence in the defendant's favor,' etc. The judge said: 'The law presumes innocence in all criminal prosecutions. We begin with a legal presumption that the defendant, although accused, is an innocent man. Not that we take that to be an absolute rule, but it is the principle upon which prosecutions must be conducted; that the evidence must overcome the legal presumption of innocence. And in order to overcome the legal presumption, as I have already stated, the evidence must be clear and convincing, and sufficiently strong to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty,' with more to the same effect. This was correct, and avoided a tendency in the closing sentence quoted from the request to mislead. Agnew v. United States, \n165 \nU.S. 36, 51\n, 52 S., 41 L. ed. 624, 629, 630, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 235. See also 4 Wigmore, Ev.  2511. \n\n[218 U.S. 245, 254]\n\u00a0\n After the jury had been sent out, they returned and asked the court what constituted a reasonable doubt. The court replied: 'A reasonable doubt is an actual doubt that you are conscious of after going over in your minds the entire case, giving consideration to all the testimony and every part of it. If you then feel uncertain and not fully convinced that the defendant is guilty, and believe that you are acting in a reasonable manner, and if you believe that a reasonable man in any matter of like importance would hesitate to act because of such a doubt as you are conscious of having, that is a reasonable doubt, of which the defendant is entitled to have the benefit.' He denied the notion that any mere possibility was sufficient ground for such a doubt, and added that, in the performance of jury service, they should decide controversies as they would any important question in their own affairs. This was excepted to generally, and the court was asked to add that if the jury found one fact inconsistent with the guilt of the defendant, they should acquit. The court already had given this instruction in the charge, and was not called upon to repeat it. As against a general exception, the instructions given were correct. Some other details in the trial are criticized, but we have dealt with all that seem to us to deserve mention, and find no sufficient reason why the judgment should not be affirmed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","69":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOOE v. UNITED STATES(1910)\nNo. 13\nArgued: Decided: November 28, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 322, 323]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. L. T. Michener, W. W. Dudley, and P. G. Michener for appellants.\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 322, 325]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General John Q. Thompson and Mr. Charles F. Kincheloe for appellee.\n\n\n[218 U.S. 322, 326]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n The appellants, plaintiffs below, seek to recover from the United States the sum of $9,000, the amount which \n\n[218 U.S. 322, 327]\n\u00a0\n they allege is due them on account of the occupation and use, by the Civil Service Commission, of certain premises in the city of Washington, District of Columbia.\n The finding of fact by the court of claims-using largely the words of the finding-may be summarized as follows:\n On the 10th day of July, 1900, the Secretary of the Interior, proceeding under the appropriation act for the legislative, executive, and judicial expenses of the government for the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1901 (31 Stat. at L. 125, chap. 192), made a written agreement with plaintiffs for the leasing and renting to the government for the use of the Civil Service Commission of a certain building on E. and Eighth streets, in Washington, 'except the basement thereof,' for the period commencing August 1st, 1900, and ending June 30th, 1901, at the rate of $ 333,33 1\/3 per month, or $4,000 for the year,-the right being reserved to the government to terminate the lease after thirty days' written notice at the end of any calendar month.\n The commission, on August 1st, 1900, took possession and remained in exclusive possession of the building, including its basement, until the bringing of this suit. The amount appropriated by Congress for the rent of offices for the commission for the year ending June 30th, 1901, was $4,000, one twelfth of which was expended for such rent for July, 1900\n\n\n On the 3d of March, 1901, Congress appropriated for the rent of quarters for the commission the sum of $4,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1902. 31 Stat. at L. 1000, 100-1, chap. 830, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 283. The Secretary of the Interior, shortly after the beginning of that year, proposed to the plaintiffs a renewal of the lease for that year. But the plaintiffs expressed their unwillingness 'to rent the said building for another year at the rate of $4,000 per annum,' or to rent the entire building, including the basement, then occupied by the commission, \n\n[218 U.S. 322, 328]\n\u00a0\n at a rental less than $6,000 per annum. Without further action on either side, 'the defendants continued in possession of said building and basement during said year, paying,' however, to the plaintiffs, $4,000, the rent specified in the lease for the first year; to wit, $4,000.\n In his estimates submitted for appropriations by Congress for the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1903, the Secretary named $6,000 'for rent of quarters for the Civil Service Commission.' As the general legislative, executive, and judicial appropriation bill for that year did not, as it passed the House of Representatives, include that sum, the plaintiffs' agent, in writing, informed the chief clerk of the Interior Department that unless the Senate fixed the rent at $6,000, the plaintiffs would ask possession of the property at the earliest convenient time. Of this attitude of the plaintiffs the Senate was informed by plaintiffs' agent. He appeared before the House Committee on Appropriations, and by the Secretary of the Interior transmitted the letter of plaintiffs to the Senate Committee on Appropriations. Congress, however, refused to increase the appropriation to $6,000, and for the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1903, appropriated 'for rent of buildings for the Department of the Interior, namely, for . . . Civil Service Commission, four thousand dollars.' 32 Stat. at L. 162, chap. 594. No further action was taken by either party in relation to an increase of rent or the demanding of possession, and the United States continued in possession of the property, including the basement, for that fiscal year, paying rent at the rate of $ 4,000 per year. Although the Secretary of the Interior estimated an increase of $2,000 for quarters of the Civil Service Commission for the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1904, Congress appropriated only $4,500, 32 Stat. at L. 854, chap. 755. In consequence of this increase the Secretary sought to rent from the plaintiffs all the build- \n\n[218 U.S. 322, 329]\n\u00a0\n ing and premises for the use of the Civil Service Commission for the sum of $4,500, appropriated,' but plaintiffs refused to do that. The Secretary finally, August 18th, 1903, made a lease from claimants for all of said building, 'except the basement,' for the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1904, at the rate of $4,500 per year.\n For the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1905, Congress, March 18th, 1904, appropriated $4,500 for the rent of quarters for the commission. 33 Stat. at L. 85, chap. 716. In accordance with that appropriation, the Secretary proposed to the plaintiffs, in writing, to renew the lease of August 18th, 1903, for the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1905, at the rate of $4,500 per annum. The plaintiffs took no action on this proposal, except to write to the Secretary, requesting that the basement of the building, which had not been included in either of the leases to the government, be included 'in the lease at the rate of 30 cents per square foot for its floor space.' Neither party took any further steps in reference to the renewal of the lease, or for an increase of rental for the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1905, and the claimants were paid rent for that year at the rate of $4,500, as provided by the appropriation, and as specified in the lease for the preceding year. A like appropriation of $ 4,500 was amde for rent of quarters for the commission for the fiscal year 1906, and that body, without any express renewal of the lease for that year, continued in occupation of the entire building up to August 1st, 1905, for which the claimants have been paid at the rate of $4,500 per year.\n The court of claims further found: 'Although the claimants never rented to the government for the use of the Civil Service Commission, or for any other purpose, that part of the basement of said building not occupied by heating and ventilating plants and equipments thereof, yet the Civil Service Commission took possession of this portion of said basement, and continuously \n\n[218 U.S. 322, 330]\n\u00a0\n OCCUPIED AND USED THE SAME FROM THE 1ST Day of august, 1900, until the bringing of this action, August 1, 1905; and in a letter to the Acting Secretary of the Interior, dated November 28, 1904, relative to the matter of a renewal of the government's lease for the building for that fiscal year, the claimants, among other things, called attention to the fact that the basement of the building was then fully occupied by the Civil Service Commission. The fair rental value of that portion of the basement occupied and used as aforesaid was $400 per year, and the rental value of the entire building, including the basement, was not less then $6,000 per year. During the time that the defendants have occupied and used said building and basement belonging to the claimants, the claimants have receipted for rent for the same in full, except for the basement, which has been specially excluded from each of said receipts given by the claimants. With the exception of this exclusion of the basement from said receipts, it does not appear that any other protest was ever made by the claimants that said payments were not in full for the rent legally due to them for said building. The claimants, however, repeatedly insisted that the defendants were not paying enough rent for said building, and on one occasion asked for extra rent for said basement, as heretofore found.'\n The court below directed the petition to be dismissed and judgment to be entered for the government. That was accordingly done.\n The pleadings and facts indicate that the claim of the appellants is divided into two parts; one, arising out of the occupancy and use by the Civil Service Commission of the building above the basement; the other, for the occupancy and use by that body of the basement.\n Let us, at the outset, inquire as to the circumstance under which an officer of the United States, whether the \n\n[218 U.S. 322, 331]\n\u00a0\n head of a department or a subordinate, may or may not, by his acts, impose liability upon the government, in the absence of authority from Congress. The conclusion we have reached upon that inquiry is controlling.\n Looking at the statutes in force at the time the transactions here in question occurred, we find that by  3679 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2454), it was provided that 'no department of the government shall expend, in any one fiscal year, any sum in excess of appropriation made by Congress for that fiscal year, or involve the government in any contract for the future payment of money in excess of such appropriations;' and by  3732 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2504), that 'no contract or purchase on behalf of the United States shall be made, unless the same is authorized by law, or is under an appropriation adequate to its fulfilment, except in the War and Navy Departments, for clothing, subsistence, forage, fuel, quarters, or transportation, which, however, shall not exceed the necessities of the current year.'\n An act of Congress of June 22d, 1874, provided that 'hereafter no contract shall be made for the rent of any building or part of any building in Washington, not now in use by the government, to be used for the purposes of the government, until an appropriation therefor shall have been made in terms by Congress.' 18 Stat. at L. 133, 144, chap. 388. Again, by the deficiency apropriation act of March 3d, 1877, it was provided that 'hereafter no contract shall be made for the rent of any building, or part of any building, to be used for the purposes of the government in the District of Columbia, until an appropriation therefor shall have been made in terms by Congress, and that this clause be regarded as notice to all contractors or lessors of any such building or any part of building.' 19 Stat. at L. 363, 370, chap. 106, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2514.\n The above provisions were all in force when the Civil Service Commission was created. By the act creating that tribunal it was provided that 'it shall be the duty \n\n[218 U.S. 322, 332]\n\u00a0\n of the Secretary of the Interior to cause suitable and convenient rooms and accommodations to be assigned or provided, and to be furnished, heated, and lighted, at the city of Washington, for carrying on the work of said commission and said examinations, and to cause the necessary stationery and other articles to be supplied, and the necessary printing to be done for said commission.' 22 Stat. at L. 403, 405, chap. 27, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1220.\n We have seen that the occupancy by the Civil Service Commission of the plaintiffs' building commenced August 1st, 1900. Now, the general appropriation act for the legislative, executive, and judicial expenses of the government, covering the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1901, opened with the clause providing that 'the following sums be, and the same are hereby, appropriated out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, in full compensation for the service of the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1901, for the objects hereinafter expressed, namely . . . For rent of buildings for the Department of the Interior, namely, . . . Civil Service Commission, $4,000.' 31 Stat. at L. 86, 125, chap. 192. Each appropriation act for subsequent fiscal years, covering the whole period of the occupancy by the commission of the plaintiffs' building, opened with a similar provision. So that the plaintiffs and all others dealing with officers of the government were distinctly advised as to the amount appropriated by Congress for any specified purpose, and knew, or are to be deemed to have known, that when they received such specified amount for the purpose named, it was intended by Congress to be in full compensation for the service rendered for the government in that fiscal year. The plaintiffs received before the bringing of this suit the appropriation made by Congress specifically for rent of the building for the Civil Service Commission, during the entire period of the commission's occupancy and use of it. We recall, \n\n[218 U.S. 322, 333]\n\u00a0\n in this connection, the fact found by the court below, that the claimants' receipted bills recited that the amount paid to them was in full for the rent, as fixed by the appropriation acts of Congress, excepting always, it is true, the rent for the basement of their building. It is also true that the plaintiffs complained that the amount appropriated was inadequate, but they accepted and receipted, for it as the sum appropriated by Congress for purposes of rent for the commission, expecting or hoping, no doubt, that Congress would, in due time, remedy the wrong which, as they insisted, had been and was being done to them in respect both of the building and its basement.\n But it is said in this connection that the act of 1883 made it the duty of the Secretary of the Interior to cause suitable rooms to be provided for the commission, and as the plaintiffs' building was occupied and used by the commission, for public purposes, with his knowledge and consent, the government is under a liability to pay the claimants the reasonable value of such occupancy and use. This view cannot be accepted, except upon the theory that, during the period in question, it was within the power of the Secretary, by contract, in the matter of rent for a building for the commission, to exceed the sum appropriated by Congress for that purpose. We reject that theory as inconsistent with the acts of Congress, and therefore inadmissible. It is for Congress, proceeding under the Constitution, to say what amount may be drawn from the Treasury in pursuance of an appropriation. The statutes above referred to make it plain that the Secretary was without power to make any express contract for rent in excess of the appropriation made by Congress, particularly where, as here, Congress had taken care to say, in respect of each year's rent, that the appropriation shall be in full compensation for the specific purpose named in the appropriation act. It is equally \n\n[218 U.S. 322, 334]\n\u00a0\n clear that the Secretary could not, by his acts, create a state of things from which, in the absence of legislation on the subject, an implied contract could arise under which the government would be liable, by reason of its constitutional duty, to make just compensation for the use of private property taken for public purposes. In such a case the remedy is with Congress, and not with the courts. If an officer, upon his own responsibility, and without the authority of Congress, assumes to bind the government, by express or implied contract, to pay a sum in excess of that limited by Congress for the purposes of such a contract, the contract is a nullity, so far as the government is concerned, and no legal obligation arises upon its part to meet its provisions. If the circumstances justify such a course, Congress, in its discretion, can intervene and no justice to the owner of private property used by officers of the government in good faith, for public purposes, although without direct legislative authority. The plaintiffs' remedy is in that direction.\n What we have said is equally applicable to the claim of the plaintiffs for the reasonable value of the use of the basement of the building in question. Granting that the plaintiffs have not been paid for its use such sum as they are justly entitled to have received, we are still confronted with the facts heretofore referred to, that Congress had appropriated, each year of the commission's occupancy, a specific sum in full for rent of buildings for the use of that body; that it has in effect prohibited the use of the public money in excess of that sum for rent of buildings for that purpose; and that plaintiffs have already received the entire sums appropriated by Congress for rent. The conclusion necessarily follows that the government cannot, in this case, be made liable to suit, either under an express or implied contract, to pay for the use of plaintiffs' property any amount in excess of the sums appropriated by Congress for that purpose. \n\n[218 U.S. 322, 335]\n\u00a0\n But it is contended by the plaintiffs that their right to recover does not depend upon contract, expressed or implied, but upon the duty, expressly imposed by the Constitution, to make just compensation for private property taken for public use. In support of this view we are reminded that the Tucker act of March 3d, 1887, 24 Stat. at L. 505, chap. 359, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 752, for the first time, in express words, conferred on the court of claims jurisdiction to hear and determine claims against the government, 'founded upon the Constitution of the United States.' The claims here in question, it is argued, can be rested exclusively on the Constitution, without reference to any statute of the United States, or to any contract arising under an act of Congress. The argument is ingenious, but it is unsound. It cannot be said that any claim for a specific amount of money against the United States is founded on the Constitution, unless such claim be either expressly or by necessary implication authorized by some valid enactment of Congress. The creation of a Civil Service Commission, providing a building or rooms for its use, and the amount to be paid from time to time by the government as rent for such building and rooms, are all matters within the complete control of Congress. It is the Constitution which places these matters under the control of Congress. If an officer of the United States assumes, by virtue alone of his office, and without the authority of Congress, to take such matters under his control, he will not, in any legal or constitutional sense, represent the United States, and what he does or omits to do, without the authority of the Congress, cannot create a claim against the government, 'founded upon the Constitution.' It would be a claim having its origin in a violation of the Constitution. The constitutional prohibition against taking private property for public use without just compensation is directed against the government, and not against individual or publie officers \n\n[218 U.S. 322, 336]\n\u00a0\n proceeding without the authority of legislative enactment. The taking of private property by an officer of the United States for public use, without being authorized, expressly or by necessary implication, to do so by some act of Congress, is not the act of the government. So that whether we look at the jurisdiction of the court below, in respect either of claims alleged to be founded upon the Constitution or to arise from contract, the plaintiffs cannot maintain this suit against the government; for they have received the entire sums which Congress appropriated to be paid out of the Treasury on account of rent of buildings or quarters for the Civil Service Commission.\n There are other aspects of the case to which the elaborate arguments of counsel have been directed. We deem it unnecessary to notice them in this opinion. Nor do we deem it necessary to follow them in their extended and able discussion of the authorities.\n The judgment must be affirmed.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","70":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHUDSON OIL & SUPPLY CO. v.

The judgment of the court of appeals was remitted to and made the judgment of the latter court.\n The action was brought by Hunter, whom we shall call plaintiff, against the insurance company, which we shall refer to as defendant, upon five judgments obtained in the state of North Carolina, recovered by one Emrick Wadsworth, a citizen of North Carolina, and owned by plaintiff. The judgments were recovered upon policies of insurance issued by defendant, one of which was issued to a citizen of North Carolina while defendant was doing business there, the others to citizens of New York and New Jersey. They were assigned to Wadsworth long after \n\n[218 U.S. 573, 580]\n\u00a0\n defendant had attempted to remove move from North Carolina. Judgment was rendered for their full amount with interest and costs, to wit, the sum of $ 9,965, by direction of the appellate division of the court, to which the case was submitted upon an agreed statement of facts. The court of appeals reduced the same by the amount of the four judgments recovered on the policies issued in New York and New Jersey. The Federal question presented is whether due faith and credit was refused to the judgments, in violation of the Constitution of the United States.\n The judgments were obtained by default, after service made upon the insurance commissioner of the state. The decision of the case turns upon the validity of the service.\n The defendant is a life insurance company, organized under the laws of New York. Prior to March 13, 1899, it was duly admitted to do business in the state of North Carolina, it complying with the laws of the state successively passed, which required insurance companies to appoint agenst upon whom service of process could be made.\n On March 6, 1899, the legislature passed a law known as the Willard law. The law prescribed that no foreign insurance company should do business in the state until it had, by a duly executed instrument, filed in the office of the secretary of state, constituted and appointed the insurance commissioner its true and lawful attorney, upon whom all lawful process in any action or legal proceedings might be served, and agreed that such service should have the same force and validity as if served on the company, and that 'the authority thereof' of' should 'continue in force irrevocable so long as any liability of the company' should 'remain outstanding in this commonwealth.' Chapter 54 of the Laws of 1899\n\n\n On or about the 13th of Arril, defendant executed the power of attorney required, and thereupon a license \n\n[218 U.S. 573, 581]\n\u00a0\n was issued to it to do business, as provided by law, under which it did business in the state for a time.\n The legislature which passed the Willard law passed also a law called the Craig act, by which it was provided that any foreign insurance company desiring to do business in the state after June 1 then ensuing must become a domestic corporation of the state. There were severe penalties prescribed for the violation of the act. The company was subjected to a penalty of $200 a day for every day it 'continued to operate or do business without having complied with the requirements of the act,' and it was deprived of the right of suing in the state courts, or to enter into any new contracts, or enforce those it had made. In addition to the penalty of $200, it was subjected to a penalty of $500 for each day that it did business after the 1st day of June, 1899, 'without first becoming a domestic corporation.'\n The act took effect on the 10th of February, 1899. In May of that year the board of directors of defendant passed a resolution to withdraw from the state, and to dispense with and terminate the services of all of its agents. It also revoked the authority of the insurance commissioner to act as its attorney to receive service of process. A certified copy of the resolution was served on the commissioner, and the agents of the company were withdrawn from the state, the premiums upon the policies theretofore issued by it being remitted by mail to its home office, where the policies and premiums were payable, and losses upon policies being paid by check from its office. Outside of this the record shows four transactions: (1) The rewriting of a policy of insurance in 1899, originally issued in 1886, which was mailed from its office in New York; (2) sending a check in payment of a policy issued prior to May 17, 1899, to be delivered upon receipt of certain unpaid assessments; (3) the adjustment in North Carolina, in June, 1902, of a loss upon a policy issued in Washing- \n\n[218 U.S. 573, 582]\n\u00a0\n ton, District of Columbia, the beneficiary having removed to North Carolina; (4) the adjustment, by an attorney employed for the purpose, of a claim upon a policy written in North Carolina prior to May 17, 1899. The two first transactions were prior to the beginning of the actions in which the judgments were recovered, and the two last were subsequent to that time. These are the transactions upon which plaintiff relies to establish that defendant was doing business at that time in the state.\n Three of the policies upon which judgments were recovered were issued in the state of New York long prior to the year 1899. The fourth policy was issued in New Jersey, also prior to 1899. The assignments to Wadsworth were made in December and January, 1902, and the suits were begun on January 20, 1902.\n There is no controversy over the power of the state to pass the Willard and Craig acts, so called, or to make their provision conditions upon which foreign insurance corporations could do business in the state. The controversy is over the duration of the conditions. The decision upon that, plaintiff contends, depends upon the question whether the insurance company was doing business in the state at the time the actions on the policies were brought and process served; and, insisting that it was, cites Connecticut Mut. L. Ins. Co. v. Spratley, \n172 U.S. 602\n, 43 L. ed. 569, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 308; Mutual Reserve Fund Life Asso. v. Phelps, \n190 U.S. 147\n, 47 L. ed. 987, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 707. Plaintiff further insists that, even if it be assumed that defendant had withdrawn from the state in good faith, and had ceased to do business therein after May 18, 1899, it was still liable to be sued in the courts of the state 'in any action or local proceeding of every nature of which the courts of North Carolina had jurisdiction,' and that the insurance commissioner was its agent to receive service of process. This contention is based on the provision of the statute which continues the authority of the commissioner 'in force and irrevocable so long as any \n\n[218 U.S. 573, 583]\n\u00a0\n liability of said company remains outstanding in said state.'\n If the situation of defendant, regarding what it had done and its obligations, was exactly expressed by the contentions of plaintiff, they might be irresistible. But not only the Willard act, but the Craig act, must be considered in determining defendant's conduct. It had done business in the state, and the former act became a part of its obligations to its policy holders. The latter act imposed new conditions upon it, and as an alternative to compliance with them, required it to remove from the state. An evasion of the requirement was, as we have seen, severely penalized. Money penalties, one of $200 and one of $500, for every day it should do business after the 1st of June, 1899, were imposed upon it, and no contract it should make or had made could be enforced in the courts of the state. Such were the alternatives presented by the Craig act. In other words, defendant was given the choice to become a domestic corporation or go out of the state. It chose to go out of the state, and adopted the only way it could to do so. We think such course was open to it, and we see no reason to question its good faith.\n It is, however, contended that defendant 'persisted in doing business in the state, and was so found at the time of the service of process in question.' Four instances are adduced to sustain the contention, two of which occurred in 1899 and two in 1902. These instances have no relation to one another, and no relation to the transactions upon which the judgments were based. Between the first two and the last two there was an interval of three years, and yet it is insisted that there was such connection between them that they constituted doing business continuously in the state, and the defendant was hence precluded from revoking its power of attorney to the insurance commissioner. The contention of plaintiff, so far as based on the \n\n[218 U.S. 573, 584]\n\u00a0\n instances adduced, encounters a great difficulty. They were not new business. They related to old transactions, and were intended only to fulfil their obligations. This was the plain duty of defendant,-a duty which it could not evade, nor could the state even prevent it. Bedford v. Eastern Bldg. & L. Asso. \n181 U.S. 227\n, 45 L. ed. 834, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 597. Between doing business for such purposes and doing business generally there is quite a difference. If not, the consequences are somewhat serious. The Craig act, as we have seen, imposes a penalty of $700 a day for each day after the 1st day of June, 1899, that a foreign corporation shall do business in the state without conforming to the provisions of the act.\n Plaintiff, however, presses with earnestness, in support of his contention, the following cases: Connecticut Mut. L. Ins. Co. v. Spratley, \n172 U.S. 602\n, 43 L. ed. 569, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 308; Mutual Reserve Fund Life Asso. v. Phelps, \n190 U.S. 147\n, 47 L. ed. 987, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 707; Mutual Reserve L. Ins. Co. v. Birch, \n200 U.S. 612\n, 50 L. ed. 620, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 752; Commercial Mut. Acci. Co. v. Davis, \n213 U.S. 245\n, 53 L. ed. 782, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 445.\n In the Spratley Case the life insurance policy which was the subject of the suit was issued by the insurance company when it was concededly present and doing business in the state of Tennessee. The service was upon an agent by the name of Chaffee, sent to investigate into the circumstances of the death of Spratley and the claims of his widow. These facts distinguish the case from the one at bar. But certain language of the court is quoted to establish, not only was the insurance company so doing business in the state as to justify service of process upon the agent appointed by the company, but doing business generally. The court, through Mr. Justice Peckham, said:\n'We think the evidence in this case shows that the company was doing business within the state at the time of this service of process. From 1870 until 1894 it had done an active business throughout the state by its agents \n\n[218 U.S. 573, 585]\n\u00a0\n therein, and had issued policies of insurance upon the lives of citizens of the state. How many policies it had so issued does not appear. Its action in July, 1894, in assuming to withdraw from the state, was simply a recall of its agents doing business therein, the giving of a notice to the state insurance commissioner, and a refusal to take any new risks or to issue any new policies within the state. Its outstanding policies were not affected thereby, and it continued to collect the premiums upon them and to pay the losses arising thereunder, and it was doing so at the time of the service of process upon its agent.'\n\n And further:\n'It cannot be said with truth, as we think, that an insurance company does no business within a state unless it have agents therein who are continuously seeking new risks, and it is continuing to issue new policies upon such risks. Having succeeded in taking risks in the state through a number of years, it cannot be said to cease doing business therein when it ceases to obtain or ask for new risks or to issue new policies, while at the same time its old policies continue in force and the premiums thereon are continuously paid by the policy holders to an agent residing in another state, and who was once the agent in the state where the policy holders resided. This action on the part of the company constitutes doing business within the state, so far as is necessary, within the meaning of the law upon this subject. And this business was continuing at the time of the service of process on Mr. Chaffee in Memphis.'\n\n This reference to the law in the state must be considered. A statute of the state provided that process might be served upon any agent of a corporation doing business in the state, found within the county where the suit was brought, no matter what character of agent such person might be, and in the absence of such an agent it \n\n[218 U.S. 573, 586]\n\u00a0\n should be sufficient to serve process upon any person found in the county who represented the corporation at the time of the transaction out of which the suit arose took place. It was under this statute that service was made upon Chaffee. This service was held good, this court saying, in addition to what has been quoted above: 'Even though we might be unprepared to say that a service of process upon 'any agent' found within the county, as provided in the statute, would be sufficient in the case of a foreign corporation, the question for us to decide is whether, upon the facts of this case, the service of process upon the person named was a sufficient service to give jurisdiction to the court over this corporation.'\n Further explanation of the language of the court is contained in the following passage:\n'A vast mass of business is now done throughout the country by corporations which are chartered by states other than those in which they are transacting part of their business, and justice requires that some fair and reasonable means should exist for bringing such corporations within the jurisdiction of the courts of the state where the business was done, out of which the dispute arises.' (Italics ours.)\n\n Mutual Reserve Fund Life Asso. v. Phelps is distinguished from the case at bar by the same features that distinguish the Spratley Case from it. The suit was brought by a citizen of the state of Kentucky upon a policy issued when the association was doing a general business in the state through regular agents, under a license from the state. The commissioner subsequently canceled its license, and it withdrew its agents from the state. The service of process in the action was nevertheless made upon the commissioner and sustained. It was stipulated by the parties that outstanding polices were continued in force after the action of the commissioner, on which the association had collected and was collecting dues, premiums, and assessments, and this court held, on the au- \n\n[218 U.S. 573, 587]\n\u00a0\n thority of the Spratley Case, that the association was doing business in the state. These general words must be qualified, as we have seen, like words in the cited case should be qualified, to protect transactions which had been entered into, and to give them the benefit of the law in view of which they were made. This court said: 'The plaintiff was a citizen of Kentucky, and the cause of action arose out of transactions had between the plaintiff and defendant while the latter was carrying on business in the state of Kentucky, under license from the state.' And it was said of the statute that it and 'other kindred statutes enacted in various states indicate the purpose of the state that foreign corporations engaging in business within its limits shall submit the controversies growing out of that business to its courts, and not compel a citizen for such a controversy to seek, for the purpose of enforcing his claims, the state in which the corporation had its home.'\n Mutual Reserve L. Ins. Co. v. Birch was a like case. Certain judgments which were sued on in New York were obtained in actions upon policies issued when the insurance company was doing its regular business in the state of North Carolina, and antedated its resolution to withdraw from the state. The case was rested in the court of appeals of New York on Woodward v. Mutual Reserve L. Ins. Co. 178 N. Y. 490, 102 Am. St. Rep. 519, 71 N. E. 10. It was said in that case that the stipulation of the company in regard to service of process became an obligation of the company precisely as though it 'had been incorporated in the policies; and thereafter, whether the company continued to do business in the state or not, policy holders could commence action by service upon the secretary of state,' subsequently changed to the insurance commissioner. Woodward v. Mutual Reserve L. Ins. Co. was cited by this court in its opinion sustaining the judgment in the Birch Case.\n Commercial Mut. Acci. Co. v. Davis has the same \n\n[218 U.S. 573, 588]\n\u00a0\n characteristics as the cases which we have reviewed, and needs no other comment than that it repeated the doctrine of the other cases.\n The first contention of plaintiff is therefore untenable. The next contention is that, even if defendant did withdraw from the state in good faith, the authority to the insurance commissioner to receive service of process continued as long as the company had outstanding liabilities in the state. And this, it is insisted, constituted the duration of the authority not only for causes of action arising in the state, but for causes of action arising in other states. In other words, that the language of the statute is not limited by its purpose to protect the resident policy holders of the company, but for the benefit of every litigant upon any cause of action; and, to use the graphic language of the court of appeals, to 'perpetuate a local forum to which, under guise of an assignment to some resident, nonresidents of far distant states might flock for the purpose of instituting litigation upon contracts issued to them at their homes, against a corporation there readily subject to service, and which long before had attempted in good faith to withdraw from the jurisdiction thus hunted out.' [184 N. Y. 144, 30 L.R.A.(N.S.) 677, 76 N. E. 1074, 6 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 294.]\n This is certainly the logical consequence of plaintiff's contention, and to sustain it he relies upon Johnston v. Trade Ins. Co. 132 Mass. 432; Wilson v. Martin-Wilson Automatic Fire Alarm Co. 149 Mass. 24, 20 N. E. 318; Biggs v. Mutual Reserve Fund Life Asso. 128 N. C. 5, 37 S. E. 955. A statute like that of North Carolina was construed in the Massachusetts cases, and therefore the construction given to it is instructive. In all of the cases the corporation had 'a domicil of business in the commonwealth,' to use the language of the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts, and the court recognized that the right to sue upon cause of action arising in another state was not within 'the main purpose' of the statute passed on; indeed, that it 'was not framed for that purpose,' but decided that \n\n[218 U.S. 573, 589]\n\u00a0\n 'the words 'all lawful processes in any action or proceeding' must be held to include all actions which might lawfully be brought against a company thus having a domicil of business in this commonwealth.' In Wilson v. Martin-Wilson Automatic Fire Alarm Co. the contract sued on was made in the state, and was to be performed there.\n In Biggs v. Mutual Reserve Fund Life Asso. the policy on which the action was based was issued to a resident of the state. The language of the court was quite general. The court did not discuss whether it was \" ceasing to do business in the state' to transact that business through agents located outside of the state, by means of the mail,' though it may be said that the court expressed doubt of it by referring to the Spratley Case. It was said:\n'It is sufficient to point out that the statute requires the power of attorney to be irrevocable, not 'as long as the company continues to do business' in this state, but as long as 'any liability of the company remains outstanding' in this state, and the contract with the state, as expressed in the power of attorney filed by the company, so specifies. No amount of authorities having a more or less fancied analogy can overcome these plain words of the statute, and of the power of attorney drawn and filed in conformity thereto. Green v. Equitable Mut. Life & Endowment Asso. 105 Iowa, 628, 75 N. W. 635; Ben Franklin Ins. Co. v. Gillett, 54 Md. 213.'\n\n This general language must be considered in reference to the case,-a conclusion which is justified by the decision of the court in Moore v. Mutual Reserve Fund Life Asso. 129 N. C. 31, 39 S. E. 637, where it is said that the state, having the right to prescribe the terms upon which the insurance company might carry on its business in the state, and the company, 'being permitted, proceeded to make contracts with citizens of the state, and became liable to them under these contracts. One of the provisions upon which defendant was allowed to do business here was that James R. Young, insurance commissioner, and his successors in office, \n\n[218 U.S. 573, 590]\n\u00a0\n should be constituted its agent, upon whom service of process might be made, and that said agency should continue so long as the defendant had any liabilities remaining unsatisfied in this state, arising from or out of its said business of insurance.' As to the revocation of the authority of the commissioner, the court said:\n'It is conceded that, as a general rule, a principal has the right to revoke a power of attorney at any time, whether it is in terms irrevocable or not. But to this general rule there are well-established exceptions, as to where it is coupled with an interest, or where it is contractual in its nature, given for a consideration and for the protection of someone or some interest. In our opinion this power falls under this exception to the general rule. It was contractual in its nature, was given upon consideration that defendant should have the right to carry on its business in this state, and for the protection of those who should deal with the defendant.'\n\n Manifestly, this means who should deal with the defendant in the state. The facts in the case at bar are different from the cited cases. The policies upon which the four judgments were recovered were not issued in North Carolina, and, not having been issued under the faith of its laws, are not entitled to their remedial sanction. The facts in this case are also different from those in the Massachusetts cases. Defendant did not have 'a domicil of business' in the state, nor were the contracts to be performed there. It in good faith withdrew from the state,-withdrew, indeed, under the compulsion of law. We say 'under compulsion of law,' for clearly the Craig act required that as an alternative to compliance with its provisions. It presented a choice to defendant of one of two courses. Defendant accepted one of them, that is, withdrew from the state, and revoked the power which it had given to the insurance commissioner to accept service for it. Revoked it as far as it could do so. It \n\n[218 U.S. 573, 591]\n\u00a0\n could not revoke it as to any 'interest or right founded or created upon faith thereof,' and which 'required its perpetuation and continuance,' as the court of appeals has correctly said, and we think with that learned court, that it would be extremely inequitable to regard it as irrevocable to plaintiff and those in his situation. Indeed, it is not within the contemplation of the statute that the authority to the commissioner is to be available to those in the situation of plaintiff.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","72":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHUTCHINSON, PIERCE & CO. v.

Fenwick for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was a bill in equity for an injunction and accounting, the complainant alleging the defendant had infringed its technical trademark applied to shirts, and also was guilty of unfair competition. As complainant is a corporation of the state of New York and defendant is a citizen of the same state, the court's jurisdiction extends only to the use of the registered trademark in commerce between the states, with foreign nations, and the Indian tribes.\n There was no attempt to prove that defendant had passed off, or intended to pass off, his goods for complainant's, or had made profits, or that complainant had sustained damage. The cause proceeded solely on complainant's ownership of its technical trademark.\n The circuit court held that defendant's trademark or brand was clearly distinguishable from that of complainant, and said:\n'There is no reasonable probability of the ordinary purchaser being deceived into buying the defendant's manufacture as that of complainant. The rule is well established that a trademark, word, or symbol has the elements of a property right, and may not be unlawfully used by a rival in business, either alone or as an accessory to such prior appropriation; and in such cases a right to injunctive relief follows without proof of confusion of proprietorship, or that buyers have been actually misled by such use. But if a defendant's design or symbol is essentially different and distinguishable in appearance, so \n\n[217 U.S. 457, 460]\n\u00a0\n that by no possibility can his article be taken for complainant's genuine production, a cause of unlawful appropriation is not maintainable.' 90 C.

C. A. 1, 163 Fed. 42.\n Appellants thereupon petitioned for an appeal to this court, which was allowed.\n Sections 17 and 18 of the act of Congress approved February 20, 1905, in respect to trademarks, reads as follows:\n'Section 17. That the circuit and territorial courts of the United States and the supreme court of the District of Columbia shall have original jurisdiction, and the circuit courts of appeal of the United States and the court of appeals of the District of Columbia shall have appellate jurisdiction, of all suits at law or in equity respecting trademarks registered in accordance with the provisions of this act, arising under the present act, without regard to the amount in controversy.\n\n'Section 18. That writs of certiorari may be granted by the Supreme Court of the United States for the review of cases arising under this act in the same manner as provided for patent cases by the act creating the circuit court of appeals.' [33 Stat. at L. 728, chap. 592, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 1283.]\n\n We are of opinion that this appeal will not lie, and that the remedy by certiorari is exclusive. By the 6th section of the judiciary act of March 3, 1891, the final decisions of the circuit courts of appeal are made final 'in all cases arising under the patent laws, under the revenue laws, and under the criminal laws and in admiralty cases,' with power in this court to require any such cases to be certified thereto for its review and determination, 'with the same power and authority in the case as if it had been carried by appeal or writ of error to the Supreme Court.' [26 Stat. at L. 828, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549.]\n We think that the language of  18 places suits brought under the trademark act plainly within the scope of the act \n\n[217 U.S. 457, 461]\n\u00a0\n establishing the court of appeals, and that a final decision of that court can be reviewed in this court only upon certiorari, and that therefore the pending appeal must be dismissed.

The recovery \n\n[218 U.S. 551, 556]\n\u00a0\n was based upon the fact that the Illinois Central Railroad Company was at the time to which the tax related, in possession of the railroad, and was operating it under a power of attorney from the purchaser at a judicial sale, and had made the report which was required by the statute relating to the taxation of franchises. The judgment was affirmed by the court of appeals of Kentucky. 128 Ky. 268, 108 S. W. 245. The Illinois Central Company petitioned for a rehearing, and presented the Federal questions now urged under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The court entertained the petition and extended its opinion, holding that no right of the appellant under the 14th Amendment had been violated by the decision. Thereupon this writ of error was brought, and, as the state court passed upon the Federal questions, this court has jurisdiction. Mallett v. North Carolina, \n181 U.S. 589\n, 45 L. ed. 1015, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 730, 15 Am. Crim. Rep. 241; Leigh v. Green, \n193 U.S. 85\n, 48 L. ed. 626, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 390.\n The validity of the statutes of Kentucky providing for the taxation of franchises is not assailed, and nothing is shown which would open to dispute the taxable character of the particular franchise here involved. The plaintiff in error, the Illinois Central Railroad Company, contends that, by virtue of the judgment, it has been deprived of property without due process of law, first, in that there was no assessment upon which to base the recovery of the tax; and second, in that it has been held personally liable to pay a tax upon a franchise of which it was not the owner. The plaintiff in error also contends that it has been denied the equal protection of the laws, as it insists that all other railroad corporations were assessed for the purpose of franchise taxation upon a different basis and by a different method, and that, as to other railroad corporations, the assessments similar to the one in question were abandoned.\n The gist of the first contention-that there was no \n\n[218 U.S. 551, 557]\n\u00a0\n assessment-is that an assessment implies a record, and that there was no record, but only a memorandum; that an assessment must be a definite act, and that here it was only tentative.\n It appears that the railroad of the Chesapeake, Ohio, & Southwestern Railroad Company was sold at a judicial sale in the summer of 1896, to Edward H. Harriman, who thereupon, under date of August 19, 1896, executed a power of attorney to the Illinois Central Railroad Company, authorizing it 'to take charge of the business, maintenance, and operation of the railroad, . . . together with all the land, real estate, leaseholds, easements, . . . and all other corporate property, real and personal, lately belonging to the said Chesapeake, Ohio, & Southwestern Railroad Company, included in the said sale and conveyance, and all the rights, privileges, immunities, and franchises whatsoever' which he had acquired. It was expressly authorized to receive 'all the earnings of the said railroad,' to apply the same to the expenses incurred in its 'management, maintenance, and operation,' and to take all proceedings necessary or expedient for these purposes.\n On September 15, 1896, the Illinois Central Company made a report to the auditor of public accounts of Kentucky with respect to the railroad formerly the property of the Chesapeake, Ohio, & Southwestern Railroad Company, in accordance with the statute governing the assessment of franchises. This report came before the board of valuation and assessment, which was charged under the statute with the duty of making the assessment. It was placed in an envelop, or jacket, on the outside of which a proper form was provided for the entry of the amount of capital, surplus, undivided profits, all other assets, total capital, the amount to be deducted for tangible property, the value of the franchise, and the amount of the tax. Below this there were blank spaces for the \n\n[218 U.S. 551, 558]\n\u00a0\n insertion of the dates of the first and final notices to the corporation, of the notice to the county clerk, and of the payment of the tax. The form upon the jacket was filled out by the insertion of the name of the 'Chesapeake, Ohio, & Southwestern R. R. Co., Louisville, Ky.,' and the date of the report. In the columns provided for the purpose, entries were made, setting forth the 'Total Capital, $6,700,000,' 'Less Tangible Property, etc. $4,753,339,' 'Franchise, $1,946,661,' and 'Tax, $10,219.97.' This is the amount of the tax sued for and recovered in this action.\n These entries were made early in the year 1898. The fact that the making of the assessment for the year 1897 was delayed did not detract from the authority and duty to make it. Southern R. Co. v. Coulter, 113 Ky. 657, 68 S. W. 873. That the board of valuation and assessment was authorized to fix the value of the franchise, and to make the entries setting forth their determination, and that the entries upon the jacket were in fact made by the board in the discharge of its duty, do not admit of question. The commonwealth of Kentucky filed as a part of its petition in the suit a copy of the indorsement on the jacket as a correct copy of the assessment. This was introduced in evidence on the commonwealth's behalf. The testimony presented in defense did not in any way challenge the authenticity or official character of the jacket entries. On the contrary, the testimony of the former state auditor, who, as such, was chairman of the board of valuation and assessment, leaves no room for doubt on this point. It also sufficiently appears upon this record, and it is not open to dispute here, that due notice of the assessment was given.\n The point urged, in substance, is that the constitutional right of the plaintiff in error has been violated, because the state court has treated the entry on the jacket as a sufficient record of the assessment. It is said that this \n\n[218 U.S. 551, 559]\n\u00a0\n cannot be regarded as a record, because it lacks permanency. But this, of course, depends upon the means of preservation and the nature of the filing system adopted. There is no inherent reason why such a record should not be suitably preserved. It is unnecessary to review the numerous authorities which the industry of counsel has collated, for it may be assumed that an assessment should be recorded. It is obvious, however, that the state cannot be denied the right to collect its taxes, and the assessment cannot be held to have been in violation of the Constitution of the United States because for convenience it was recorded-in the form provided for the purpose-upon the jacket inclosing the report of the railroad company, instead of in a separate book. If the board did not proceed properly to make the assessment according to the statute, the corporation aggrieved had its remedy; if the assessment was otherwise properly made, it cannot be defeated because the determination was set forth in the manner described.\n The fact that the assessment was entered under the heading 'Chesapeake, Ohio, & Southwestern R. R. Co., Louisville, Ky.,' does not invalidate it. The franchise which was the subject of the assessment had belonged to the Chesapeake, Ohio, & Southwestern Railroad Company, and the entry suitably identified it. The report which was made by the Illinois Central Company used the same description. The information given by this report, prefacing the amount of capital, value of assets, earnings, etc., is as follows:\n'Name of corporation, Chesapeake, Ohio, & Southwestern Railroad company.\n\n'Name the principal place of business of the corporation, company, or association you represent. Louisville, Kentucky.\n\n'Give the name and official position of the officer making the report. \n\n[218 U.S. 551, 560]\n\u00a0\n 'Name, J. C. Welling. Position, Vice President, I. C. R. R. Co., Agt.\n\n'The kind of business in which the said corporation, company, or association is engaged.\n\n'Operating railroad from Louisville, Kentucky, to Memphis, Tennessee.'\n\n The conclusion that the assessment entered in this manner was made in accordance with the law of the state of Kentucky was necessarily involved in the decision of the court of appeals. And the fact that, upon the report made by the plaintiff in error in the circumstances stated, the as sessment was entered under the name of the company which had formerly owned the franchise, furnishes no ground for the contention here that there has been an absence of due process of law. Castillo v. McConnico, \n168 U.S. 674\n, 682-684; 42 L. ed. 622, 625, 626, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 229; Witherspoon v. Duncan, 4 Wall. 210, 18 L. ed. 339.\n But it is said that the assessment was only tentative, and that the entry was merely a memorandum. It does not appear to be tentative upon its face. That it was such in fact is a conclusion sought to be derived from the testimony of the former state auditor. His testimony was to the effect that he 'did not expect any tax to be paid' on the assessment; that the franchise assessments which were made in 1898 were opposed, that there was considerable discussion of the matter with the railroads, and that finally, in 1899, an agreement was reached by which the assessments of 1898 were abandoned. He says that 'in the matter of the Illinois Central Railroad Company, we agreed not to assess the C. & O. S. W. for the first two years; we agreed that-in other words, that the amount we assessed against the Illinois Central should be in full for all the properties they controlled for four years, this assessment, and the one sent out as final in 1898 we reconsidered and declined to assess any franchise tax against that road for one or two years, the first years,-two years, I think. In other words, the agreement of \n\n[218 U.S. 551, 561]\n\u00a0\n the board was to reconsider these assessments entirely, and take them back, in consideration of the fact that the road would pay the next two assessments on the basis agreed upon.' The question is at once presented whether, after making the assessment in 1898, the board had any authority to deal with it in this manner, or to enter into such a bargain with the railroad. This is a matter of state law, and the court of appeals of Kentucky had held that the board had no such power, and that the first assessment stood. In its opinion the court said:\n'The board made the assessment in the way that all other assessments were made. It gave notice of the assessment to the railroad company, as required by statute, and at the end of thirty days it gave notice, as provided by the statute, that the assessment had become final. When this had been done, the matter passed beyond the control of the board. A final assessment had been had, as provided by law, and if any injustice was done the taxpayer it was due entirely to his failure to appear before the board and ask a reduction of the assessment. No reliance could be placed in such proceedings if the validity of the record was made to depend upon the secret intentions of the assessing officer. The validity of their actions depends upon what they do, and not upon their undisclosed purposes. When the assessment had become final, and the railroad company owed the state the amount of taxes thus fixed, the assessing officers were without authority afterward to make any agreement with the railroad to the effect that if the railroad would pay the taxes for 1899, they would forego collecting the taxes for the previous years.'\n\n And on the petition for rehearing, the court added this statement:\n'When the board made an assessment and sent out the preliminary and the final notices, as provided by the statute, that the assessment had been made, its action was final, \n\n[218 U.S. 551, 562]\n\u00a0\n and the legal effect of its action must depend on what they did, and not on the secret intentions of the auditor.'\n\n This construction of the powers of the state officers under the statutes of the state relating to franchise assessments-this determination with regard to the finality of the assessment in question-does not violate any constitutional right of the plaintiff in error. The assessment was made in accordance with the law of the state; it was, under that law, a final assessment, and no ground is shown here for impugning it.\n It is insisted further that the enforcement of the tax by a judgment in personam against the plaintiff in error constitutes an unconstitutional deprivation of property, that is, assuming that, under the statutes of the state, as construed by its highest court, the plaintiff in error was liable for the tax, nevertheless it could not properly be held, because it was not the owner of the franchise upon which the tax was laid. But, by virtue of the arrangement with the purchaser at the judicial sale, the plaintiff in error was operating the railroad, and was in possession and full control of the railroad property and its earnings. It cannot be doubted that, under the Federal Constitution, the state is not precluded from fixing liability for the payment of the tax, to which the franchise is subject, upon the corporation actually exercising the franchise within the state, and in control of the railroad property and its earnings. There is no constitutional obligation requiring it to look further in order to secure payment of the tax which it is entitled to levy. Carstairs v. Cochran, \n193 U.S. 10\n, 16; 48 L. ed. 596, 597, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 318; First Nat. Bank v. Kentucky, 9 Wall. 353, 19 L. ed. 701.\n It is also contended that plaintiff in error has been denied the equal protection of the laws upon the ground that other railroad corporations have not been assessed upon the same basis or by the same method, or have not been held to the payment of taxes upon such an assessment. This defense was not pleaded in the answer of the \n\n[218 U.S. 551, 563]\n\u00a0\n Illinois Central Company, and, in any event, the meager testimony introduced at the hearing is utterly insufficient to afford a basis for the argument. It does not satisfactorily appear that other railroad corporations were not assessed in the same way and at the same time, or, assuming that they were so assessed, that they are not liable to pay taxes accordingly. The court of appeals of the commonwealth, in denying the petition for a rehearing, said: 'As shown by the opinions of this court, cited in the opinion herein, taxes have been imposed, based on the assessments in controversy. All other taxpayers than railroads were taxed, and if some railroads escaped, it is no reason that others should go free while all taxpayers of other classes paid their taxes. If any railroads escaped, they are still liable for their taxes unless barred by limitation.'\n No conclusion to the contrary is justified by the record, and the contention that the plaintiff in error has been denied the equal protection of the laws, as the case lies before us, is without merit.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","74":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN RE CLELAND(1910)\nNo. 12\nArgued: April 4, 1910Decided: May 31, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles D. Joslyn and Paul B. Boody for petitioner.\n Mr. De Forest Paine for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a petition for a writ of mandamus commanding the Honorable Henry H. Swan, sitting in the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Michigan, to dismiss a cause on the ground that the suit does not really and substantially involve a controversy within the jurisdiction of that court. Act of March 3, 1875, chap. 137,  5. 18 Stat. at L. 470, 472, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 508, 511. The suit in question was begun \n\n[218 U.S. 120, 121]\n\u00a0\n on March 30, 1901, by a shareholder in an insolvent Michigan corporation, a mutual building and loan association, to have a receiver appointed and the association wound up. There were provisions in the Michigan statutes for such cases, but after conference with the secretary of state, now the governor of Michigan, the attorney general of the state and officers of the corporation, it was decided that the most saving and beneficial course would be to have a receiver appointed by the United States court, the assets of the company being partly scattered in distant states. As the requirement of proceedings under the state law was understood to be mandatory upon the secretary of state, the beginning of this suit was hastened. To that end Aldrich, who had been counsel for the corporation, and who wanted to be appointed receiver, transferred and procured to be issued certificates of stock to a friend of his, Bishop, the original plaintiff, and Bishop thereupon signed and swore to the bill, alleging the par value of his stock to be over $2,000. No doubt he intended thereby to help Aldrich, but he also understood that he was acting for the benefit of all concerned, and undoubtedly one reason for applying to him was to save time in getting a nonresident shareholder, It was for the benefit of all, in fact. The answer to the present petition states that all the shareholders have come in. Moreover, although it was disputed at the bar, we see no ground for denying that, on the face of the bill, the jurisdiction of the court was established. The laws of Michigan did not exclude it, and the corporation was not so far in the hands of the state officers as to prevent action by the court. See further, Brown, B. & Co. v. Lake Superior Iron Co. \n134 U.S. 530\n, 33 L. ed. 1021, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 604.\n It is unnecessary to set forth the proceedings under the bill at length. They have gone on from March 30, 1901. Real estate has been sold by the receiver, assets collected, and all the debts of the corporation outside the claims of \n\n[218 U.S. 120, 122]\n\u00a0\n shareholders have been paid, except one disputed claim for $3,000. The main matter outstanding is a suit against directors and certain withdrawing shareholders for money alleged to have been paid improperly and upon other claims, which is on the docket for hearing. See Aldrich v. Gray, 77 C. C. A. 597, 147 Fed. 453, 8 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 832. It is enough to say that after considerable litigation and much expense and trouble, the proceedings are drawing to a close.\n The petitioner never has been admitted formally as a party to the suit, but he proved his claim as holder of shares of the par value of $2, 000 on May 29, 1902, and while, since that time, he has been active in trying to have the receiver removed, and in having him called to account, his various petitions have not been dismissed by the circuit court on the ground that he had no standing before it. It may be assumed for purposes of decision that he has a standing here.\n After continuing this activity for years, the petitioner now, without adequately explaining his delay and change of attitude, seeks to reduce all the proceedings to naught. Deputron v. Young, \n134 U.S. 241\n, 33 L. ed. 923, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 539. His pecuniary interest in doing so is infinitesimal, even if not actually contravened. It cannot be believed the motive for the petition is such as to appeal to the discretion of the court. But apart from questions of discretion, so far from its appearing to the satisfaction of the circuit court, as the statute requires, that the suit did not involve a controversy within its jurisdiction, the judge certifies that he is satisfied that it does involve such a controversy. Put-in-Bay Waterworks, Light & R. Co. v. Ryan, \n181 \nU.S. 409, 431\n, 45 S. L. ed. 927, 937, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 709. On the face of the record he was right, and the summary remedy of mandamus would not be proper, even if our conclusion from the evidence were different from his, which is not the case. Re Winn, \n213 \nU.S. 458, 468\n, 53 S. L. ed. 873, 877, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 515.\n It is said that, on the undisputed facts, Bishop was not \n\n[218 U.S. 120, 123]\n\u00a0\n a bona fide shareholder, and that the proceeding was collusive. But the first proposition is not true and the second is not law. Bishop became the absolute owner of the shares in his name. The answer to the petition so finds, and there is no question about it. See South Dakota v. North Carolina, \n192 \nU.S. 286, 310\n, 48 S. L. ed. 448, 457, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 269. Some of these shares had been issued to Aldrich in payment for service, others were issued by the corporation upon payment of $10, the proper sum at the start. It is said that, the corporation being insolvent, the issue of the certificate was a fraud on the other shareholders. No one eomplains here except the petitioner. It seems to have been to the advantage of all. Certainly it was not necessarily a fraud upon them. As to collusion, there is nothing unlawful in transferring shares to a man out and out, for the convenience of immediately beginning a suit that other shareholders have a right to begin, that all parties in interest want to have begun, and that the authorities of the opposing jurisdiction approve.\n Perhaps the most plausible ground would have been that Bishop's interest was not as great as his allegation implied, even granting his right as a shoreholder. But there is no reason to doubt that he thought that it was. See Barry v. Edmunds, \n116 U.S. 550\n, 29 L. ed. 729, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 501.

OF CITY OF NEW YORK(1910)\nNo. 12\nArgued: October 11, 1910Decided: November 14, 1910\n\n\n\n This is an application by the Metropolitan Trust Company of the City of New York, which had been impleaded as a defendant in the suit of Pollitz v. Wabash R. Co. for a writ of prohibition or mandamus, directed to the circuit court of the United \n\n[218 U.S. 312, 313]\n\u00a0\n States for the southern district of New York, to forbid the exercise of jurisdiction over the petitioner and over a decree dated January 10, 1908, in its favor in said suit, and in the alternative to provide that any order for the vacating of said decree should be set aside. A rule to show cause was issued, to which return has been made, and from the petition and return the following facts appear:\n On or about January 15, 1907, James Pollitz brought suit in the supreme court of the state of New York against the Wabash Railroad Company and others to declare illegal and void certain securities of the railroad company, issued in exchange for debenture bonds, pursuant to a plan complained of as injurious to the stockholders, and for a re-exchange, and, in default thereof, for an accounting by the defendants with respect to the new securities which had been issued.\n On January 25, 1907, the railroad company caused the case to be removed to the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York, on the ground that there was a separable controversy between it, as a citizen of the state of Ohio, and the complainant, a citizen of the state of New York.\n The complainant moved to remand the cause, and on February 21, 1907, the motion was denied. Thereupon application was made to this court for a writ of mandamus to compel the remand, and the petition was denied. Re Pollitz, \n206 U.S. 323\n, 51 L. ed. 1081, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 729.\n After the removal of the cause, the defendants demurred to the bill of complaint, the trust company demurring separately, and all the demurrers were overruled, save that of the trust company, which was sustained. A decree was entered on January 10, 1908, which, after overruling the other demurrers, provided as follows:\n'Ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that the demurrer of the defendant the Metropolitan Trust Company of the \n\n[218 U.S. 312, 314]\n\u00a0\n City of New York, be, and the same hereby is, sustained, and that the bill of complaint be, and the same hereby is, dismissed as to the defendant the Metropolitan Trust Company of the City of New York, with costs.'\n\n The defendants other than the trust company then answered. An earlier suit, to which the trust company was not a party, was pending in the same court, with regard to the same transaction, and the court, denying the motion of the complainant for leave to discontinue the first suit, ordered the suits to be consolidated. After hearing, a final decree was entered on February 23, 1909 [167 Fed. 145], dismissing the bill in each suit upon the merits.\n The complainant then appealed to the circuit court of appeals, but no review was sought of the decree of January 10, 1908, dismissing the bill in the second suit as against the trust company; and the trust company was not cited and did not in any way become a party to the appeal.\n On February 8, 1910, the circuit court of appeals decided that there was not a separable controversy between the complainant and the railroad company, and that the motion to remand should have been granted. The court accordingly reversed the final decree, with direction to the circuit court to permit the complainant to discontinue the first cause, and to remand the second cause to the supreme court of the state of New York. [100 C. C. A. 1, 176 Fed. 333.]\n Thereupon, on February 28, 1910, an order for remand was entered in the circuit court, which contained the following provision as to the trust company:\n'And it appearing that the defendant Metropolitan Trust Company duly demurred to the complaint, and that such demurrer was sustained and judgment entered January 10, 1908, dismissing the complaint as to said defendant, which has not been appealed from or reversed,\n\n'Ordered, adjudged and decreed that this judgment remanding said cause to the supreme court of the state \n\n[218 U.S. 312, 315]\n\u00a0\n of New York shall not apply to said defendant Metropolitan Trust Company.'\n\n On March 21, 1910, the complainant moved in the circuit court to vacate the decree entered January 10, 1908, and to remand the cause as to the trust company. The latter appeared specially and objected to the jurisdiction of the court. The court granted the motion to vacate the decree, and denied the motion to remand the cause as to the trust company, without prejudice, upon the ground that the application for such relief should be made to the judge who entered the order to remand as to the other defendants. [180 Fed. 950.]\n The trust company then applied to this court for a writ of prohibition or mandamus, as stated.\n Mr. Tompkins McIlvaine for petitioner. \n\n[218 U.S. 312, 316]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. Aspinwall Hodge for respondent.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Hughes:\n\n\n[218 U.S. 312, 318]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n When the complainant moved to remand the cause, the circuit court had jurisdiction to determine whether or not a separable controversy existed which justified the removal from the state court. Its decision was an act within its judicial authority, subject to review upon appeal after final decree. On the application made to \n\n[218 U.S. 312, 319]\n\u00a0\n this court in Re Pollitz, \n206 U.S. 323\n, 51 L. ed. 1081, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 729, for a writ of mandamus to compel the remand, the court said (pages 331, 333):\n'The issue on the motion to remand was whether such determination could be had without the presence of defendants other than the Wabash Railroad Company, and this was judicially determined by the circuit court, to which the decision was by law committed.\n\n'The application to this court is for the issue of the writ of mandamus, directing the circuit court to reverse its decision, although in its nature a judicial act, and within the scope of its jurisdiction and discretion.\n\n'But mandamus cannot be issued to compel the court below to decide a matter before it in a particular way, or to review its judicial action had in the exercise of legitimate jurisdiction, nor can the writ be used to perform the office of an appeal or writ of error.\n\n ... * *\n'If the ruling of the circuit court was erroneous, as is contended, but which we do not intimate, it may be reviewed after final decree on appeal or error.

Rep. 430.\n\n Having decided to retain the cause, the circuit court proceeded, as it was entitled to proceed, to try the issues. It heard the demurrers to the bill, and, overruling the others, it sustained that of the Metropolitan Trust Company. No leave was granted to amend the bill, and a decree was entered dismissing it as against the trust company. When, after final decree dismissing the bill as against the other defendants, the complainant appealed to the circuit court of appeals, the decree in favor of the trust company was not brought before the appellate \n\n[218 U.S. 312, 320]\n\u00a0\n court for review, and the trust company was not a party to the appeal.\n The decision of the circuit court of appeals, in reversing the final decree, and in directing the remand to the state court, was, of course, subject to the necessary limitation that it could apply only to the parties who had been brought before that court. It had no other purport. It is one of 'the ordinary rules respecting appeals' that 'all the parties to the record, who appear to have any interest in the order or ruling challenged, must be given an opportunity to be heard on such appeal.' Davis v. Mercantile Trust Co. \n152 U.S. 590\n, at page 593, 38 L. ed. 563, 564, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 693, 695. See also Terry v. Abraham (Terry v. Merchants' & P. Bank) \n93 U.S. 38\n, 23 L. ed. 794; Wilson v. Kiesel, \n164 \nU.S. 248, 251\n, 41 S. L. ed. 422, 423, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 124. If a party has not had this opportunity, he is not bound; as to him an essential element of appellate jurisdiction is lacking. Accordingly, when decree was entered in the court below upon the mandate of the circuit court of appeals, the trust company was expressly excepted from its operation.\n It is in this light that the subsequent proceeding in the circuit court must be examined. If that court had jurisdiction to vacate the decree of January 10, 1908, in favor of the trust company, it was by virtue of its own control over the decree, and not by force of the mandate of the appellate court. Nor could the court exercise the general power which it possesses to modify or set aside its orders or decrees prior to the expiration of the term at which the final decree is entered; for in this case that term had ended before the motion was made. Cameron v. M'Roberts, 3 Wheat. 591, 4 L. ed. 467; Sibbald v. United States, 12 Pet. 488, 9 L. ed. 1167; Bronson v. Schulten, \n104 \nU.S. 410, 415\n, 26 S. L. ed. 797, 799; Ayres v. Wiswall, \n112 \nU.S. 187, 190\n, 28 S. L. ed. 693, 694, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 90; Phillips v. Negley, \n117 \nU.S. 665, 674\n, 29 S. L. ed. 1013, 1015, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 901. The motion was not made for the purpose of correcting a clerical error or an inadvertence. After the term had expired, and after the complainant had exercised his right of appeal to procure a review of the errors of which he \n\n[218 U.S. 312, 321]\n\u00a0\n desired to complain, it was sought to set aside a decree which stood unreversed, and by which the trust company had been dismissed from the cause.\n To reach this result, the circuit court asserted the power to vacate the decree upon the ground that it had been rendered without jurisdiction; and the court held that it must be treated as a nullity. But the decree cannot be so regarded unless the court, upon the motion to remand, was without jurisdiction to determine whether a separable controversy existed, and hence not merely committed error, but exceeded its authority. The decree was not a nullity unless the order refusing to remand was a nullity; and the latter contention was negatived by the decision of this court upon the application for a writ of mandamus in Re Pollitz, supra. The reversal by the circuit court of appeals of the final decree as to the other defendants, and its direction to remand, did not make the decision of the court of first instance any the less 'a judicial act, and within the scope of its jurisdiction and discretion;' and as that reversal and direction did not affect the trust company, the decree in its favor remained in full force.\n The question is not with respect to the mere form of the application which was made to the circuit court for the purpose of setting the decree aside. When the motion was made, the court was without jurisdiction to vacate the decree. As the court, in granting the motion, exceeded its power, mandamus is the appropriate remedy.

Harrington for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 91, 99]\n\u00a0\n No appearance for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n This action was brought by the International Text-book Company in one of the courts of Kansas,-the court of Topeka,-to recover from Pigg, the defendant in error, the sum of $79.60, with interest, as due the plaintiff under a written contract between him and that company, made in 1905. The case was tried upon agreed facts, and judgment was rendered in favor of the defendant for his costs. That judgment was affirmed in a state district court, which held that the plaintiff was not entitled to maintain the action, and the latter judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of Kansas.\n It is assigned for error that the final judgment-based upon certain provisions of the statutes of Kansas, to be presently referred to-was in violation of the company's rights under the Constitution of the United States.\n The facts agreed to-using substantially the language of the parties- make substantially the following case:\n The International Text-book Company is a Pennsylvania corporation, and the proprietor of what is known as the International Correspondence Schools at Scranton, in that commonwealth. Those schools have courses in architecture, chemistry, civil, mechanical, electrical, and steam engineering, English branches, French, German, mathematics and mechanics, pedagogy, plumbing, heating, telegraphy, and many other subjects. It has a capital stock, and the profits arising from its business are distributed in dividends, or applied otherwise, as the company may elect. The executive offices of the company, as well as the teachers and instructors employed by it, reside and exercise their respective functions at Scranton. \n\n[217 U.S. 91, 100]\n\u00a0\n Its business is conducted by preparing and publishing instruction papers, text-books, and illustrative apparatus for courses of study to be pursued by means of correspondence, and the forwarding, from time to time, of such publications and apparatus to students. In the conduct of its business the company employs local or traveling agents, called solicitor-collectors, whose duties are to procure and forward to the company at Scranton, from persons in a specified territory, on blanks furnished by it, applications for scholarships in its correspondence schools, and also to collect and forward to the company deferred payments on scholarships. In order that applicants may adapt applications to their needs, each solicitor-collector is kept informed by correspondence with the company of the fees to be collected for the various scholarships offered, and of the contract charges to be made for cash or deferred payments, as well as the terms of payment acceptable to the company. In conformity with the contract between the company and its scholars, the scholarship and instruction papers, text- books and illustrative apparatus called for under each accepted application are sent by the company from Scranton directly to the applicant, and instruction is imparted by means of correspondence through the mails, between the company, at its office in that city, and the applicant, at his residence in another state.\n During the period covered by the present transaction, the company had a solicitor-collector for the territory that included Topeka, Kansas, and he solicited students to take correspondence courses in the plaintiff's schools. His office in Kansas was procured and maintained at his own expense, for the purpose of furthering the procuring of applications for scholarships and the collection of fees therefor. The company had no office of its own in that state. The solicitor-collector was paid a fixed salary by the company and a commission on the number of applications obtained and the collections made. He sent daily reports to the company for his territory, those reports showing that for March, 1906, the aggregate collections \n\n[217 U.S. 91, 101]\n\u00a0\n on scholarships and deferred payments on subscriptions approached $500.\n At the date of the agreement sued on, and at the time this suit was brought, numerous persons in Topeka were taking the plaintiff's course of instruction by correspondence through the mails. The contracts for those courses were procured by its solicitor-collector assigned to duty in Kansas, and, as stated, payments thereon were collected and remitted by him to the plaintiff at Scranton.\n The written contract in question, signed by the defendant at Topeka, Kansas, and accepted by the company at Scranton, showed that he had subscribed for a scholarship covering a course of instruction by correspondence in commercial law, and had agreed to pay therefor $84, in instalments. When this suit was brought, there remained unpaid on the principal of that subscription the sum of $79.60.\n The present action was brought to recover that sum, with interest, as due the company under the defendant's contract with it. The defendant did not deny making the contract, nor that he was indebted to the company in the amount for which he was sued. But it was adjudged, in conformity with his contention, that by reason of the company's failure to comply with certain provisions of the statutes of Kansas, it was not entitled to maintain this action in a court of Kansas.\n We will now refer to the provisions of the Kansas statute under which the Text-book Company was held not to be entitled to maintain the present action in the courts of the state. The statute, the plaintiff alleges, cannot be applied to it without violating its rights under the Constitution of the United States.\n By  1260 of the Kansas General Statutes of 1901 it is provided, among other things, that a corporation organized under the laws of any other state, territory, or foreign country, and seeking to do business in Kansas, may make application to the state charter board, composed of the attorney general, the secretary of state, and the state bank commissioner, for 'per- \n\n[217 U.S. 91, 102]\n\u00a0\n mission' to engage in business in that state as a foreign corporation. It is necessary that the application should be accompanied by a fee of $25, and as a condition precedent to obtaining authority to transact business in the state, a corporation of another state was required to file in the office of the secretary of state its written consent, irrevocable, that process against it might be served upon that officer.  1261. In passing upon the application, the charter board is authorized to make special inquiry in reference to the solvency of the corporation, and if they determind that such corporation was properly organized in accordance with the laws under which it was incorporated, 'that its capital is unimpaired, and that it is organized for a purpose for which a domestic corporation may be organized' in Kansas, then its application is to be granted, and a certificate issued, setting forth the fact that 'the application has been granted, and that such foreign corporation may engage in business in this state.' Before filing its charter, or a certified copy thereof, with the secretary of state, the corporation is required to pay to the state treasurer, for the benefit of the 'permanent school fund,' a specified per cent of its capital stock.  1263, 1264. The last-named section was the subject of extended examination in Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Kansas, recently decided (\n216 U.S. 1\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 190), and was held to be unconstitutional in its application to the Western Union Telegraph Company, seeking to do local business in Kansas.\n But the section which controlled the decision by the state court in the present case is  1283, which is as follows: 'It shall be the duty of the president and secretary or of the managing officer of each corporation for profit, doing business in this state, except banking, insurance, and railroad corporations, annually, on or before the 1st day of August, to prepare and deliver to the secretary of state a complete detailed statement of the condition of such corporation on the 30th day of June next preceding. Such statement shall set forth and exhibit the following, namely: 1st. The authorized capital \n\n[217 U.S. 91, 103]\n\u00a0\n stock. 2d. The paid-up capital stock. 3d. The par value and the market value per share of said stock. 4th. A complete and detailed statement of the assets and liabilities of the corporation. 5th. A full and complete list of the stockholders, with the postoffice address of each, and the number of shares held and paid for by each. 6th. The names and postoffice addresses of the officers, trustees, or directors and manager elected for the ensuing year, together with a certificate of the time and manner in which such election was held . . . and the failure of any such corporation to file the statement in this section provided for within ninety days from the time provided for filing the same shall work the forfeiture of the charter of any corporation organized under the laws of this state, and the charter board may, at any time thereafter, declare the charter of such corporation forfeited; and upon the declaration of any such forfeiture, it shall be the duty of the attorney general to apply to the district court of the proper county for the appointment of a receiver to close out the business of such corporation; and such failure to file such statement by any corporation doing business in this state, and not organized under the laws of this state, shall work a forfeiture of its right or authority to do business in this state, and the charter board may at any time declare such forfeiture, and shall forthwith publish such declaration in the official state paper. . . . No action shall be maintained or recovery had in any of the courts of this state by any corporation doing business in this state without first obtaining the certificate of the secretary of state that statements provided for in this section [ 1283] have been properly made.' Laws 1898, chap. 10,  12, as amended by Laws 1901, chap. 125,  3.\n\n 1. \nIn view of the nature and extent of the business of the International Text-book Company of Kansas, the first inquiry is whether the statutory prohibition against the maintaining of an action in a Kansas court by 'any corporation doing business in this [that] state' embraces the plaintiff corporation. It must be held, as the state court held, that it does; for \n\n[217 U.S. 91, 104]\n\u00a0\n it is conceded that the Text-book Company did not, before bringing this suit, make, deliver, and file with the secretary of state either the statement or certificate required by  1283; and upon any reasonable interpretation of the statute, that company, both at the date of the contract sued on, and when this action was brought, must be held as 'doing business' in Kansas. It had an agent in the state, who was employed to secure scholars for the schools conducted by correspondence from Scranton, and to receive and forward any money obtained from such scholars. Its transactions in Kansas, by means of which it secured applications from numerous persons for scholarships, were not single or casual transactions, such as might be deemed incidental to its general business as a foreign corporation, but were parts of its regular business continuously conducted in many states for the benefit of its correspondence schools. While the supreme court of Kansas has distinctly held that the statute did not embrace single transactions that were only incidentally necessary to the business of a foreign corporation, it also adjudged that the business done by the Text-book Company in Kansas was not of that kind, but indicated a purpose to regularly transact its business from time to time in Kansas, and therefore it was to be regarded as doing business in that state, within the meaning of the statute; and that it 'was the intention of the legislature that the state should reach every continuous exercise of a foreign franchise,' and that it should apply even where the business of the foreign corporation was 'purely interstate commerce.' John Deere Plow Co. v. Wyland, 69 Kan. 255, 257, 258, 76 Pac. 863, 2 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 304; State ex rel. Shawnee County v. American Book Co. 65 Kan. 847, 69 Pac. 563; Thomas v. Remington Paper Co. 67 Kan. 599, 73 Pac. 909; Sigel-Campion Live- stock Commission Co. v. Haston, 68 Kan. 749, 75 Pac. 1028. In our judgment, those rulings as to the scope of the statute were correct. They were in substantial harmony with the construction placed by this court upon a Colorado statute somewhat similar to the Kansas act. A statute passed in execution of a provision in the Colorado Constitution required foreign corporations, as a condition of their authority 'to do business' in that state, to make and file with the secretary of \n\n[217 U.S. 91, 105]\n\u00a0\n state a certificate covering certain specified matters. An Ohio corporation having made in Colorado a contract for the sale of machinery, to be sent to it from the latter state to Ohio, and the vendor having failed to perform the tract, a suit was brought against him in the Federal court, sitting in Colorado. One of the defenses was the failure of the Ohio corporation to make and file with the secretary of state the certificate required by the Colorado statute before it should be 'authorized or permitted to do any business' in Colorado. It became necessary to inquire whether the Ohio corporation, by reason of the above isolated contract, did business in Colorado within the meaning of the Constitution and laws of the latter state. This court said: 'Reasonably construed, the Constitution and statute of Colorado forbid, not the doing of a single act of business in the state, but the carrying on of business by a foreign corporation without the filing of the certificate and the appointment of an agent, as required by the statute. . . . The making in Colorado of the one contract sued on in this case, by which one party agreed to build and deliver in Ohio certain machinery and the other party to pay for it, did not constitute a carrying on of business in Colorado . . . . To require such a certificate as a prerequisite to the doing of a single act of business when there was no purpose to do any other business or have a place of business in the state would be unreasonable and incongruous.' Cooper Mfg. Co. v. Ferguson, \n113 \nU.S. 727, 728\n, 734 S., 28 L. ed. 1137, 1139, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 739, 741.\n In view of the agreed facts and the principles announced both by the Kansas supreme court and by this court, we hold that, within the meaning of  1283 of the Kansas statute, the International Text-book Company was doing business in the latter state at the time the contract in question was made, and was therefore within the terms of that section.\n\n 2. \nBut this view as to the meaning of the Kansas statute does not necessarily lead to an affirmance of the judgment below, if, as the plaintiff contends, the business in which it is regularly engaged is interstate in its nature, and if the statute, \n\n[217 U.S. 91, 106]\n\u00a0\n by its necessary operation, materially or directly burdens that business.\n It is true that the business in which the International Text-book Company is engaged is of a somewhat exceptional character, but, in our judgment, it was, in its essential characteristics, commerce among the states within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States. It involved, as already suggested, regular and practically continuous intercourse between the Text-book Company, located in Pennsylvania, and its scholars and agents in Kansas and other states. That intercourse was conducted by means of correspondence through the mails with such agents and scholars. While this mode of imparting and acquiring an education may not be such as is commonly adopted in this country, it is a lawful mode to accomplish the valuable purpose the parties have in view. More than that; this mode-looking at the contracts between the Text-book Company and its scholars-involved the transportation from the state where the school is located to the state in which the scholar resides, of books, apparatus, and papers, useful or necessary in the particular course of study the scholar is pursuing, and in respect of which he is entitled, from time to time, by virtue of his contract, to information and direction. Intercourse of that kind, between parties in different states,-particularly when it is in execution of a valid contract between them,-is as much intercourse in the constitutional sense, as intercourse by means of the telegraph,-'a new species of commerce,' to use the words of this court in Pensacola Teleg. Co. v. Western U. Teleg. Co. \n96 \nU.S. 1, 9\n, 24 S. L. ed. 708, 710. In the great case of Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 189, 6 L. ed. 23, 68, this court, speaking by Chief Justice Marshall, said: 'Commerce, undoubtedly, is traffic; but it is something more; it is intercourse.' Referring to the constitutional power of Congress to regulate commerce among the states and with foreign countries, this court said in the Pensacola Case, just cited, that 'it is not only the right, but the duty, of Congress, to see to it that intercourse among the states and the transmission \n\n[217 U.S. 91, 107]\n\u00a0\n of intelligence are not obstructed or unnecessarily encumbered by state legislation.' This principle has never been modified by any subsequent decision of this court.\n The same thought was expressed in Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Pendleton, \n122 \nU.S. 347, 356\n, 30 S. L. ed. 1187, 1188, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 306, 307, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1126, 1127, where the court said: 'Other commerce deals only with persons, or with visible and tangible things. But the telegraph transports nothing visible and tangible; it carries only ideas, wishes, orders, and intelligence.' It was said in the circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit, speaking by Judge Sanborn, in Butler Bros. Shoe Co. v. United States Rubber Co. 84 C. C. A. 167, 183, 156 Fed. 1, 17, that 'all interstate commerce is not sales of goods. Importation into one state from another is the indispensable element, the test, of interstate commerce; and every negotiation, contract, trade, and dealing between citizens of different states, which contemplates and causes such importation, whether it be of goods, persons, or information, is a transaction of interstate commerce.' If intercourse between persons in different states by means of telegraphic messages conveying intelligence or information is commerce among the states, which no state may directly burden or unnecessarily encumber, we cannot doubt that intercourse or communication between persons in different states, by means of correspondence through the mails, is commerce among the states within the meaning of the Constitution, especially where, as here, such intercourse and communication really relate to matters of regular, continuous business, and to the making of contracts and the transportation of books, papers, etc., appertaining to such business. In our further consideration of this case, we shall therefore assume that the business of the Text-book Company, by means of correspondence through the mails and otherwise between Kansas and Pennsylvania, was interstate in its nature.\n\n 3. \nWe must next inquire whether the statute of Kansas, if applied to the International Text-book Company, would directly burden its right by means of correspondence through the mails and by its agents, to secure written agreements with \n\n[217 U.S. 91, 108]\n\u00a0\n persons in other states, whereby such persons, for a valuable consideration, contract to pay a given amount for scholarships in its correspondence schools, and to have sent to them, as found necessary, from time to time, books, papers, apparatus, and information, needed in the prosecution, in their respective states, of the particular study which the scholar has elected to pursue under the guidance of those who conduct such schools at Scranton? Let us see what effect the statute, by its necessary operation, must have on the conduct of the company's business.\n In the first place, it is made a condition precedent to the authority of a corporation of another state, except banking, insurance, and railroad corporations, to do business in Kansas, that it shall prepare, deliver, and file with the secretary of state a detailed 'statement,' showing the amount of the authorized, paid-up, par, and market value of, its capital stock, its assets and liabilities, a list of its stockholders, with their respective postoffice addresses, and the shares held and paid for by each, and the names and postoffice addresses of the officers, trustees, or directors and managers.\n In the next place, the statute denies to the corporation doing business in Kansas the right to maintain an action in a Kansas court, unless it shall first obtain a certificate of the secretary of state to the effect that the statement required by  1283 has been properly made.\n Was it competent for the state to prescribe, as a condition of the right of the Text-book Company to do interstate business in Kansas, such as was transacted with Pigg, that it should prepare, deliver, and file with the secretary of state the statement mentioned in  1283? The above question must be answered in the negative upon the authority of former adjudications by this court. A case in point is Crutcher v. Kentucky, \n141 \nU.S. 47, 56\n, 57 S., 35 L. ed. 649, 652, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 851, 853, 854, often referred to and never qualified by any subsequent decision. That case arose under a statute of Kentucky regulating agencies of foreign express companies. The statute required as a condition of the right \n\n[217 U.S. 91, 109]\n\u00a0\n of the agent of an express company not incorporated by the laws of Kentucky, to do business in that commonwealth, to take out a license from the state auditor, and to make and file in the auditor's office a statement showing that the company had an actual capital of a given amount, either in cash or in safe investments, exclusive of costs. These requirements were held by this court to be in violation of the Constitution of the United States in their application to foreign corporations engaged in interstate commerce. The court said: 'If the subject was one which appertained to the jurisdiction of the state legislature, it may be that the requirements and conditions of doing business within the state would be promotive of the public good. It is clear, however, that it would be a regulation of interstate commerce in its application to corporations or associations engaged in that business; and that is a subject with belongs to the jurisdiction of the national, and not the state, legislature. Congress would undoubtedly have the right to exact from associations of that kind any guaranties it might deem necessary for the public security, and for the faithful transaction of business; and as it is within the province of Congress, it is to be presumed that Congress has done, or will do, all that is necessary and proper in that regard. Besides, it is not to be presumed that the state of its origin has neglected to require from any such corporation proper guaranties as to capital and other securities necessary for the public safety. If a partnership firm of individuals should undertake to carry on the business of interstate commerce between Kentucky and other states, it would not be within the province of the state legislature to exact conditions on which they should carry on their business, nor to require them to take out a license therefor. To carry on interstate commerce is not a franchise or a privilege granted by the state; it is a right which every citizen of the United States is entitled to exercise under the Constitution and laws of the United States; and the accession of mere corporate facilities, as  matter of convenience in carrying on their business, \n\n[217 U.S. 91, 110]\n\u00a0\n cannot have the effect of depriving them of such right, unless Congress should see fit to interpose some contrary regulation on the subject.' Again, in the same case: 'Would anyone pretend that a state legislature could prohibit a foreign corporation-an English or a French transportation company, for example-from coming into its borders and landing goods and passengers at its wharves, and soliciting goods and passengers for a return voyage, without first obtaining a license from some state officer, and filing a sworn statement as to the amount of its capital stock paid in? And why not? Evidently because the matter is not within the province of state legislation, but within that of national legislation.' Further, in the same case: 'We do not think that the difficulty is at all obviated by the fact that the express company, as incidental to its main business ( which is to carry goods between different states), does also some local business by carrying goods from one point to another within the state of Kentucky. This is, probably, quite as much for the accommodation of the people of that state as for the advantage of the company. But whether so or not, it does not obviate the objection that the regulation as to license and capital stock are imposed as conditions on the company's carrying on the business of interstate commerce, which was manifestly the principal object of its organization. These regulations are clearly a burden and a restriction upon that commerce. Whether intended as such or not, they operate as such. But taxes or license fees, in good faith imposed exclusively on express business carried on wholly within the state, would be open to no such objection.' To the same general effect are many other cases. Robbins v. Taxing Dist. \n120 U.S. 489\n, 30 L. ed. 694, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 45, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 592; Leloup v. Mobile, \n127 U.S. 640\n, 32 L. ed. 311, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 134, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1383; Stoutenburgh v. Hennick, \n129 U.S. 141\n, 32 L. ed. 637, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 256; Lyng v. Michigan, \n135 U.S. 166\n, 34 L. ed. 153, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 143, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 725; McCall v. California, \n136 U.S. 104\n, 34 L. ed. 391, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 181, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 881; Norfolk & W. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n136 U.S. 114\n, 34 L. ed. 394, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 178, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 958; Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Kansas, \n216 U.S. 1\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 190. It is true that the statute does not, in terms, require the corporation of another state engaged in interstate commerce to take \n\n[217 U.S. 91, 111]\n\u00a0\n out what is technically 'a license' to transact its business in Kansas. But it denies all authority to do business in Kansas unless the corporation makes, delivers, and files a 'statement' of the kind mentioned in  1283. The effect of such requirement is practically the same as if a formal license was required as a condition precedent to the right to do such business. In either case it imposes a condition upon a corporation of another state seeking to do business in Kansas, which, in the case of interstate business, is a regulation of interstate commerce and directly burdens such commerce. The state cannot thus burden interstate commerce. It follows that the particular clause of  1283 requiring that 'statement' is illegal and void.\n In this connection it is to be observed that by the statute the doors of Kansas courts are closed against the Text-book Company, unless it first obtains from the secretary of state a certificate showing that the 'statement' mentioned in  1283 has been properly made. In other words, although the Text-book Company may have a valid contract with a citizen of Kansas, one directly arising out of and connected with its interstate business, the statute denies its right to invoke the authority of a Kansas court to enforce its provisions unless it does what we hold it was not, under the Constitution, bound to do; namely, make, deliver, and file with the secretary of state the statement required by  1283. If the state could, under any circumstances, legally forbid its courts from taking jurisdiction of a suit brought by a corporation of another state, engaged in interstate business, upon a valid contract arising out of such business, and made with it by a citizen of Kansas, it could not impose on the company, as a condition of its authority to carry on its interstate business in Kansas, that it shall make, deliver, and file that statement with the secretary of state, and obtain his certificate that it had been properly made. This court held in Chambers v. Baltimore & O. R. Co. \n207 \nU.S. 142, 148\n, 52 S. L. ed. 143, 146, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 34, that a state may, subject to the restrictions of the Federal Constitution, 'determine the limits of the jurisdiction of its courts, and the character of the \n\n[217 U.S. 91, 112]\n\u00a0\n controversies which shall be heard in them.' But it also said in the same case: 'The right to sue and defend in the courts is the alternative of force. In an organized society it is the right conservative of all other rights, and lies at the foundation of orderly government. It is one of the highest and most essential privileges of citizenship, and must be allowed by each state to the citizens of all other states to the precise extent that it is allowed to its own citizens. Equality of treatment in this respect is not left to depend upon comity between the states, but is granted and protected by the Federal Constitution.' How far a corporation of one state is entitled to claim in another state, where it is doing business, equality of treatment with individual citizens in respect of the right to sue and defend in the courts, is a question which the exigencies of this case do not require to be definitely decided. It is sufficient to say that the requirement of the statement mentioned in  1283 of the statute imposes a direct burden on the plaintiff's right to engage in interstate business, and therefore is in violation of its constitutional rights. It is the established doctrine of this court that a state may not, in any form or under any guise, directly burden the prosecution of interstate business. But such a burden is imposed when the corporation of another state, lawfully engaged in interstate commerce, is required, as a condition of its right to prosecute its business in Kansas, to make and file a statement setting forth certain facts which the state, confessedly, could not control by legislation. It results that the provision as to the statement mentioned in  1283 must fall before the Constitution of the United States, and with it-according to the established rules of statutory construction-must fall that part of the same section which provides that the obtaining of the certificate of the secretary of state that such statement has been properly made shall be a condition precedent to the right of the plaintiff to maintain an action in the courts of Kansas. Section 1283, looking at the object for which it was enacted, must be regarded as an entirety. These \n\n[217 U.S. 91, 113]\n\u00a0\n parts of the statute are so connected with and dependent upon each other that the clause relating to actions brought in the courts of Kansas cannot be separated from the prior clause in the same section, referring to the statement to be filed with the secretary of state, and the former left in force after the latter is stricken down as invalid. As the clause about suits in the courts of Kansas expressly refers to the prior clauses in the same section prescribing the statement to be filed with the secretary of state, the clause relating to suits would be meaningless without reference to the latter. We cannot suppose, from the words of the statute, that the legislature would have adopted the regulation about actions in the state courts, except for the purpose of enforcing the prior clause in the same section, relating to the statement to be filed with the secretary of state. The several parts of the section are not capable of separation if effect be given to the legislative intent. It is well settled that if a statute is in part unconstitutional, the whole statute must be deemed invalid, if the parts not held to be invalid are so connected with the general scope of the statute that they cannot be separately enforced, or, if so enforced, will not effectuate the manifest intent of the legislature. In Allen v. Louisiana, \n103 \nU.S. 80, 84\n, 26 S. L. ed. 318, 319, this court referred with approval to what Chief Justice Shaw said on this point in Warren v. Charlestown, 2 Gray, 84. Referring to the rule obtaining in cases of statutes in part constitutional and in part unconstitutional, that eminent jurist said: 'But, if they are so mutually connected with and dependent on each other, as conditions, considerations, or compensations for each other, as to warrant a belief that the legislature intended them as a whole, and that, if all could not be carried into effect, the legislature would not pass the residue independently, and some parts are unconstitutional, all the provisions which are thus dependent, conditional, or connected, must fall with them.' See also Poindexter v. Greenhow, \n114 U.S. 270\n, 29 L. ed. 185, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 903, 962; Spraigue v. Thompson, \n118 U.S. 90\n, 30 L. ed. 115, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 988; Huntington v. Worthen, \n120 U.S. 97\n, 30 L. ed. 588, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 469. \n\n[217 U.S. 91, 114]\n\u00a0\n It results that as the part of  1283 which relates to the statement to be filed with the secretary is unconstitutional, and as the clause in the same section, relating to suits in the state court, is so dependent upon and connected with that part as to be meaningless when standing alone, the section must be held inoperative in all its parts, and as not being in the way of the enforcement in any state court of competent jurisdiction of the plaintiff's right to a judgment against the defendant for the amount conceded to be due from him to the Textbook Company under his contract. The judgment must be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice Moody heard the argument of this case, participated in its decision in conference, and approves the reversal of the judgment upon the grounds stated in this opinion.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice McKenna dissent. dissent.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","79":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION v.

Illinois C. R. Co. [\n215 U.S. 452\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 155]. The complaints made to the Commission were alike in both cases, and they were heard before that body at the same time, and one report was made in both cases. The order in both cases was the same. Like bills for injunction were filed in the court below, and there also they were heard together and were disposed of in one opinion. There is only this difference between the two cases. In this the bill for injunction contained the following averment concerning a small number out of the thousands of coal cars forming part of the equipment of the road:\n'That your orator has purchased and now operates on its line 360 steel hopper-bottom coal cars; that said cars are of an extreme height, to wit, 10 feet; that, by reason of such height, said cars can be unloaded only upon specially constructed trestles; that no consignees to whom coal is shipped from mines on your orator's line own or have the use of such trestles, and that such cars are not available for commercial shipment of coal. And your orator avers that it at all times restricts these cars to the service of hauling your orator's own fuel supply, and that, by reason of such restriction, and by reason of the fact that your orator alone has the means of unloading said hopper-bottom cars, said cars never constitute a part of your orator's equipment available for commercial shipments of coal.'\n\n The answer of the Commission denied all knowledge of the truth of the averments thus made, and called for proof on the subject. No proof was made, and the cause was submitted to the court below on bill and answer. In view of this fact, and in consideration, moreover, of the weight which the law gives to the finding of the Commission as to the existence of unlawful preference, and the operative effect of the order which the Commission made, until set aside, we think the mere \n\n[215 U.S. 479, 481]\n\u00a0\n averment of the facts referred to in no way causes this case to differ from the Illinois Central Case. Of course, under these circumstances, we intimate no opinion as to how far, had the facts alleged as to the hopper cars been established, they would, to the extent of such cars, have taken this case out of the rule announced in the Illinois Central Case. It follows that the judgment must be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion.\n Mr. Justice Brewer dissents. \n\n\n\n","80":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION v. CHICAGO B. & Q R CO(1910)\nNo. 641\nArgued: Decided: May 31, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. Wade H. Ellis, Luther M. Walter, and Edwin P. Grosvenor for appellant.\n Messrs. William D. McHugh and Samuel A. Lynde for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case was argued and submitted with Nos. 663 and 664, as involving the same general questions. It was disposed of in the court below with those cases in the same opinion (171 Fed. 680) and on the same ground; to wit, that the effect of the order of the Commission to enjoin which the suit was brought apportioned 'out the country into zones tributary to given trade centers, and not tributary to others,' resulting in protection and favor to the first. The case is here on appeal from an order \n\n[218 U.S. 113, 114]\n\u00a0\n granting a preliminary injunction, which was moved upon the bill (to which there was a demurrer by the Interstate Commerce Commission), and upon certain supporting affidavits.\n The order enjoined was made by the Commission in a proceeding instituted before it by one George J. Kendally, in which he attacked certain rates charged by certain carriers from New York, Chicago, St. Louis, Omaha, and points taking similar rates to Denver, on the ground that the same were excessive and discriminatory, and attacked rates from Denver to Salt Lake City on similar grounds. By an amended eomplaint certain commodity rates were also attacked.\n After hearing and argument, the Commission made its report, from which the following is an extract:\n'In the Burnham, H. M. Dry Goods Co. v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. supra (14 Inters. Com. Rep. 299), we found that the defendant carriers had for years maintained a line of proportional class rates between Chicago and the Twin Cities, applicable on traffic from the Atlantic seaboard, one third less than their local class rates between Chicago and the Twin Cities, and that their local rates had not thereby or therefore been pulled down or reduced. We cannot accept the theory that if in this case the through rates from Chicago and St. Louis to Denver are reduced, like reductions in the local rates from Chicago or St. Louis to the Missouri river, or from the Missouri river to Denver, must automatically follow. If rates applicable only to through business, and that are materially lower than the local rates, can be maintained between Chicago and St. Paul, and in the many other instances which could be cited where the carriers adopt and maintain the same principle, without forcing reductions in the local rates, it is obvious that the same thing can be done between Chicago and the Missouri river, or between Chicago and Denver. As has been seen, the class rates from the Missouri river to Denver, short \n\n[218 U.S. 113, 115]\n\u00a0\n line distance 538 miles, are on a scale of $1.25 per 100 pounds, first class, and from Denver to Utah common points, about 650 miles, they are on a scale of $1.64 per 100 pounds, first class. Measured by any test, these rates are in both instances unreasonable and excessive. It seems obvious that they must be rivised, either by voluntary action of the carriers in conformity with the principles announced in Spokane v. Northern P. R. Co. supra (15 Inters. Com. Rep. 376), or in some other proceeding before this Commission. For that reason no reduction of those rates will be ordered in this case, although upon the record we are convinced that they are unwarrantedly high, and that reasonable reduction therein would not work any undue reduction in the revenues of defendants. If those rates are reduced so that the combination on the Missouri river or on Denver results in reasonable through rates, it does not necessarily follow that these through rates must again be reduced. Certainly it is better in every instance where important readjustment of rates is necessary to have it worked out by the carriers or with their co-operation, if that be possible.\n\n'The present class rates from Chicago to the Missouri river are, in cents per 100 pounds, as follows: Class . . . 1 2 3 4 5 A B C D E Rate . . . 80 65 45 32 27 32 27 22 18 1\/2 16\n\n'The present class rates from Chicago to Denver are, in cents per 100 pounds, as follows: Class 1 2 3 4 5 A B C D E Rate 205 165 125 97 77 92 72 62 53 1\/2 46 being made up of the sums of the class rates from Chicago to the Missouri river crossings, as above, and the class rates from the Missouri river to Denver, as follows: Class . . . 1 2 3 4 5 A B C D E Rate . . . 125 100 80 65 50 60 45 40 35 30\n\n'The present class rates from St. Louis to Denver are, in cents per 100 pounds, as follows: \n\n[218 U.S. 113, 116]\n\u00a0\n Class 1 2 3 4 5 A B C D E Rate 185 145 115 92 72 84 1\/2 64 1\/2 57 48 1\/2 41 being made up of the class rates from St. Louis to the Missouri river, in cents per 100 pounds, as follows: Class . . . 1 2 3 4 5 A B C D E Rate . . . 60 45 35 27 22 24 1\/2 19 1\/2 17 13 1\/2 11 and the above-named class rates from the Missouri river to Denver.\n\n'As hereinbefore stated, we find that this rate adjustment is unjustly discriminatory in favor of the Missouri river cities and against Denver. The through class rates from Chicago to Denver and from St. Louis Denver are unreasonably high in and of themselves. The reduction of those rates as herein ordered will not involve any unreasonable or undue reduction of the revenues of the defendants affected thereby, and for these reasons and upon the whole record we are of the opinion that, for the future, reasonable class rates from Chicago to Denver should not exceed, in cents per 100 pounds, the following: Class 1 2 3 4 5 A B C D E Rate 180 145 110 85 67 80 1\/2 63 54 47 40 and that reasonable class rates from St. Louis to Denver should not exceed, in cents per 100 pounds, the following: Class 1 2 3 4 5 A B C D E Rate 162 127 101 80 1\/2 63 74 56 50 42 36'\n\n An order was directed to be entered in accordance with those views, which was done, and the railroads were required thereby to cease and desist, on or before the 1st of May, 1909, and for a period of two years, to exact for the transportation of traffic rates in excess of those above mentioned, respectively, from Chicago and St. Louis to Denver, and to establish on or before that date and maintain said rates between said cities.\n The railroads affected, to wit, Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy Railroad Company, the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company, Chicago & Northwestern \n\n[218 U.S. 113, 117]\n\u00a0\n Railway Company, Chicago, Milwaukee, & St. Paul Railway Company, the Atchison, Topeka, & Santa Fe Railway Company, Missouri Pacific Railway Company, Union Pacific Railroad Company, and the Wabash Railroad Company, filed a bill to enjoin the enforcement of the order.\n In their bill the companies described their respective roads and the termini of the roads, and alleged that the companies were respectively engaged as common carriers in the transportation of property by railroad by continuous carriage or shipment from and to the points designated in the report and order of the commission. The bill alleged the relation of the carriers to one another, and the extent of their roads westward and eastward, and their relation to roads east of Chicago and the Mississippi river. The manner of charging and adjusting rates is described in the bill, and the classification of freight which existed, as in the bill in Nos. 663 and 664.\n In the bill in those cases, the Mississippi river was alleged to be a basing point for freight destined to the Missouri river cities. In the case at bar the Missouri river is added as a basing point in the making of rates for the transportation of merchandise originating east of the Mississippi river, destined to territory between the rivers and to the Missouri river cities and west thereof. And it is alleged that the making of such basing points 'has been due both to natural physical conditions and to the natural development of railroad construction and operation to and beyond said rivers and in territory between the same, and has naturally resulted in the evolution and development of railroad transportation, and the business and commerce in and though Western territory.'\n The facts which caused such result are set out at length and are in substance that railroads were built westward to certain points, and that other and independent roads were constructed farther westward, each road charging its \n\n[218 U.S. 113, 118]\n\u00a0\n separate rate, and that the places to which and from which the roads were built were natural distributing centers, 'and were able to compete on the basis of equality with each other in the distribution and sale of their merchandise.'\n The relation of the two rivers as basing points and why the Missouri was made one is set forth in the following paragraph:\n'Your orators further aver that long prior to the construction of any railroad westward across the Missouri river to the city of Denver, the said Missouri river had been made a basing point in the making of rates to territory west of said Missouri river, and that, as is above stated, for many years the only railroads serving the said Missouri river cities were lines of railroads entering said cities from the east, and terminating there, and lines of railroad beginning at said cities and extending west therefrom, and that at the time the said four lines of railroad of your orators, the Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy Railroad Company, the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company, the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, and the Atchison, Topeka, & Santa Fe Railway Company, were constructed west of and across the said Missouri river to the city of Denver, or other Colorado common points, the said Missouri river cities and the commercial interests therein had become extensive and important, and the competition with the railroads whose lines terminated at said Missouri river cities had become so active and the competition between the several distributing points on said Missouri river and east thereof had become so extensive and important that the said four companies whose lines were extended across said river and westward therefrom were compelled, by reason of commercial and competitive conditions, to recognize, adopt, and apply at said Missouri river cities the said system of basing rates on the Missouri river which had always \n\n[218 U.S. 113, 119]\n\u00a0\n theretofore obtained, as hereinabove set forth.' That is, as had obtained on the Mississippi river.\n\n The other allegations supplement the above, and are substantially like those which formed the basis of the contentions made and argued in the other cases.\n The bill, as we have said, was supported by affidavits. They were substantially the same and set forth the acquaintance of their makers with railroad construction, development, and management. They set forth with detail the facts and circumstances which their makers conceived to be determinative of the questions involved, and a justification of the system of rate making established by the companies, and which, they averred, affected 'vitally all the important lines of business of the Western country.' They further averred that a change in the system, whereby the practices under it 'should be forbidden, would be a change which would revolutionize the methods of doing business throughout the Western country, and would work injury to the west and its business, the extent of which would be so great as to be difficult of computation.'\n It will be seen, therefore, that this case and the other cases are alike except as to the points of destination of the roads and the cities that are concerned with the rates charged and reduced. This, and they turn on the same question of the power of the Commission, the effect of its order on business conditions and the systems of rate making by the railroads, its effect upon the revenues of the companies, and by their reduction to cause a deprivation of the property of the companies without due process of law, in violation of the 5th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n Further elaboration we think is unnecessary; and on the authority of cases Nos. 663 and 664, the decree of the Circuit Court is reversed and the case remanded, with directions to set aside the injunction and dismiss the bill.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","81":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION v. CHICAGO, R. I. & P .R. CO.(1910)\nNo. 663\nArgued: Decided: May 31, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 88, 89]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wade H. Ellis, Luther M. Walter, and Edwin P. Grosvenor for appellant in No. 663.\n Messrs. John Lee Webster, George T. Bell, and John H. Atwood for appellants in No. 664.\n Messrs. Frederick Manley Ives and Everett M. Burdett as amici curice in support of position of appellants.\n Messrs. William D. McHugh and Colin C. H. Fyffe for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The question in the case is the validity of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, reducing the class rates charged by the appellee railroad companies on through freight shipped from the Atlantic seaboard to \n\n[218 U.S. 88, 90]\n\u00a0\n Kansas City and St. Joseph, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, cities on the Missouri river, and called throughout the record, and in this opinion, Missouri river cities.\n The through class rates were reduced from 1\/147, 2\/120, 3\/93, 4\/68, 5\/57 in CENTS PER 100 POUNDS TO 1\/138, 2\/113, 3\/88, 4\/64, 5\/54. the numbers above the lines indicate the classes and the numbers below the lines the rates.\n The reduction was made in that part of the through rate which applied to the haul between the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Explaining its order of reduction, the Commission said the through rates from Atlantic seaboard terminals to the Missouri river cities are made by adding together the rates from points of origin to the Mississippi river crossings, using proportional rates when such were available, and the local rates from the Mississippi crossings to the Missouri river cities. The through rates the Commission pronounced to be unreasonably high, 'because those portions of the through rates which apply between the Mississippi river crossings and the Missouri river cities are too high. These are defendants' 'separately established rates,' which are 'applied to the through transportation,' and therefore the through rates should be adjusted by reduction of those factors or parts thereof which are found to be unreasonable.'\n The division of the rates, as established by the railroad, was as follows: From New York to the several Mississippi river crossings on traffic moving through them to points beyond, in cents per 100 pounds, 1\/87, 2\/75, 3\/58, 4\/41, 5\/35. From the Mississippi river crossings to the Missouri river cities, 1\/60, 2\/45, 3\/35, 4\/27, 5\/22. The latter are local class rates under the Western classification, and are those which the Commission adjudged too high, and which it reduced in cents per 100 pounds, to the following: 1\/51, 2\/38, 3\/30, 4\/23, 5\/19. The amount of reduction it will be observed, is 9 cents on first-class freight and a proportional reduction on the other four classes.\n The order of the Commission required the railroad \n\n[218 U.S. 88, 91]\n\u00a0\n companies to cease and desist on or before the 25th of August, 1908, from charging, demanding, or collecting anything in excess of the rates last above set out, and the companies were required to put such rates in force before the 25th of August, 1908, and maintain them for a period of not less than two years.\n The proceedings before the Commission were begun by a petition filed by appellants in case No. 664, who were doing business in Kansas City and St. Joseph, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska. They alleged that they were engaged in either the mercantile or manufacturing business, and in buying and selling various commodities shipped from the Atlantic seaboard to them, respectively, under the definite freight classifications maintained by the railroad companies. The rates, according to the classifications, from New York to St. Paul and Minneapolis, and rates from New York to Chicago, and from the latter city to Kansas City, St. Joseph, and Omaha, the petition alleged, 'are arrived at by adding to the rates from Mississippi river points, as shown above, the following rates, subject to official classification, to wit: 87 cents, 75 cents, 58 cents, 41 cents, and 35 cents per hundred pounds for said five classes, respectively; that the aforesaid through rates, applying from New York to Kansas City, are observed by defendant carriers on traffic moving by way of Chicago; that in the division of said through rates from Atlantic seaboard to said three Missouri river cities, Kansas City, St. Joseph, and Omaha, each of said defendant railroad companies allows and pays to said Eastern connections 72.3 cents, 62.4 cents, 48.4 cents, 34.3 cents, and 29.4 cents per hundred pounds on the said five classes, respectively; and charges, accepts, and retains, as their respective shares of said through rates upon the several classes aforesaid, 74.7 cents, 57.6 cents, 44.6 cents, 33.7 cents and 27.6 cents per hundred pounds.'\n A table showing the distance of the various roads from New York to St. Paul and Minneapolis and the Missouri \n\n[218 U.S. 88, 92]\n\u00a0\n river cities is given, which shows that the distances are not materially different, and also shows distances west of Chicago.\n It is alleged that the rates charged and the classifications enforced by the company for the transportation of property from the Atlantic seaboard and other producing territory to the Missouri river cities 'are in themselves unreasonable and relatively unjust, unfair, and prejudicial as compared with rates from the same territory to St. Paul and Minneapolis,' through the volume or tariff and the cost of handling it is not greater. Discrimination is alleged, with a detail of circumstances, against the Missouri river cities, and the violation of the interstate commerce act. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n What are conceived to be reasonable rates are set out, and that the rates charged are alleged to be discriminatory against the complainants, and are excessive and unreasonable in and of themselves, because higher and greater than enough to pay the cost of transportation and maintenance and a fair profit on the valuation of the property employed.\n The railroad companies filed separate answers, in which they admitted the charges and rates set out in the petition and the division thereof, but denied discrimination in favor of St. Paul and Minneapolis against the Missouri river cities, and alleged competitive conditions existing as to the firstnamed cities. They deny that the rates from the Atlantic seaboard to the lastnamed cities, suggested by the petitioners, would be reasonable or just, or that the rates charged are unduly high or excessive, or discriminate against the Missouri river cities or the petitioners.\n The Chicago & Northwestern Railway Company filed an amended answer, in which it alleged that the complaint related to the through rates from the Atlantic seaboard to the Missouri river cities, and that they were alleged to \n\n[218 U.S. 88, 93]\n\u00a0\n be unfair and prejudicial compared to rates to St. Paul and Minneapolis, and 'unreasonable and excessive in and of themselves.' And, further, that the rates had been fixed and established by the railroad companies by virtue of joint traffic agreements, and had been duly filed, posted, and published by the companies, and that all the companies to such agreements were necessary parties. Fifty or more companies were named.\n The Eastern companies (those operating east of Chicago), answering, denied that there was any agreement between them and the original respondents for the shipment and division of through rates between the Atlantic seaboard and St. Paul and Minneapolis, and alleged that, in conjunction with their several connections, they receive to Chicago the same rate in cents per hundred pounds as applied upon like tariff originating at the same points of origin and terminating at Chicago, and are not concerned with the rates or proportional rates charged or accepted by the different carriers from Chicago to St. Paul or Minneapolis. They also denied that they were parties to any joint tariff or class rates from the Atlantic seaboard to the Missouri river cities. They admitted participation in joint through class rates to Mississippi river points, and denied that they, however, were unreasonable or unjust in or of themselves, or as respectively applied to shipments destined to St. Paul or Minneapolis, or shipments destined to points west of the Mississippi river.\n They further alleged as follows:\n'That the rates from New York city to East St. Louis, Illinois, are computed at 116 per cent of the rates from New York to Chicago, according to relative distances, that the rates from New York to East St. Louis are part of a general structure of rates whereby all rates from New York and other Eastern points to points in the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Wisconsin, and the province of Ontario are made \n\n[218 U.S. 88, 94]\n\u00a0\n upon the bases of percentages of the rates from the points of origin to Chicago; that the said rates for the first five classes governed by the official classification from New York to East St. Louis of 87 cents, 75 cents, 58 cents, 41 cents, and 35 cents per hundred pounds, respectively, are applied as proportional rates to the various Mississippi river crossings north of East St. Louis, to and including East Dubuque, Illinois, and that from other Eastern points than New York city the rates to East St. Louis apply equally to said Mississippi river crossings, and all of such rates to said Mississippi river crossings apply uniformly upon all shipments destined to all points west of the Mississippi river and east of Pacific coast terminals and points taking the same rates. Respondents allege that all of the rates from Eastern points to said Mississippi river crossings are just and reasonable in and of themselves, and as applied to shipments destined to any point west of the Mississippi river and east of Pacific coast terminals.\n\n They alleged that the rates to the Mississippi river crossings are governed by the official classification, and those from the latter crossings to the Missouri river points are governed by the Western classification, and that innumerable articles are differently classified in such classifications. That it would be impossible to establish joint through rates on the basis set out in the petition without simultaneously applying the offcial classification to all traffic from all Eastern points and all points intermediate between the rivers, and establishing relative through class rates from all such Eastern points to all such intermediate points between the rivers, and that this would require a general revision and reduction of rates, which would cause great hardship and irreparable injury to the respondents and other interstate carriers not parties to the proceeding.\n It is alleged that the reasonableness of the rates from Eastern points to Chicago and to the Mississippi river is \n\n[218 U.S. 88, 95]\n\u00a0\n not questioned by petitioners, and that the grievance of the latter, if they have any, lies in the rates applied by the original respondents from Chicago and the Mississippi river crossings to the Missouri river cities on shipments originating at Eastern points. They hence prayed to be dismissed. They were subsequently dismissed.\n The Sioux City Commercial Club intervened and supported the petition, and prayed that whatever should be done for the other Missouri river cities should be done for Sioux City. The St. Paul Jobbers & Manufacturers Association and the Minneapolis Commercial Club intervened and in substance coincided with the views and interest of the defendant carriers.\n A great deal of testimony was taken and the order made which has been recited. The appellee companies then filed a bill in the circuit court of the United States for the northern district of Illinois, eastern division, for a temporary and permanent injunction against the order, that it be annulled, and the Interstate Commerce Commission be enjoined from enforcing it. A temporary injunction was granted. It was made permanent on final hearing, the court dividing. 171 Fed. 680.\n The pleadings in the case are very voluminous. They consist of the bill of the railroad companies, the answers to it by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the intervening petitions of certain other railroad companies, and mercantile and manufacturing concerns.\n Even a summary of the pleadings would be very long, and we shall, therefore, say but little more than that the allegations of the bill and those of the answer of the Commission, and its denials, and such as tend to the support of the respective contentions of the companies and the Commission, upon which we shall hereafter comment. We may, however, say further that emphasis is given to certain matters. The companies make prominent that two classifications of freight are in force upon which tariff rates \n\n[218 U.S. 88, 96]\n\u00a0\n are based: The official classification from the Atlantic seaboard to the Mississippi river, and the Western classification, between the river and the Missouri river cities; that the classifications materially differ and constrain different rates; that those between the rivers are just and reasonable and apply to all merchandise, whatever be its point of origin. That business conditions have grown up and are dependent upon the rates established, which will be disturbed by their alteration; that their alteration as required by the order of the Commission will compel a discrimination between shippers and localities, to do which is in excess of the powers of the Commission.\n It is alleged that the rates are fair compared to the cost of service, absolutely and relatively, and that the rates east of the Mississippi river are not changed, the order affecting alone the proportion of the through rates charged by the complainant carriers, and will compel new through rates, which will not affect the proportion thereof received by the Eastern carriers.\n And it is alleged that the Commission only has power to establish, after hearing on complaint, through rates and joint rates, and prescribe the just and reasonable proportions of such rates between the carriers only when they (the carriers) fail to agree upon the proportion or division thereof, and that there was no evidence that they had failed to agree upon such rates or the proportion and divisions thereof, and that, therefore, the order exceeds the power of the Commission, and deprives the companies of their property without due process of law, in violation of the 5th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n It is further alleged that there was no evidence that the rates between the rivers are unjust or unreasonable except by comparison with other rates; that no evidence was offered of cost of service or of the various elements proper to be considered in determining whether a rate is just and \n\n[218 U.S. 88, 97]\n\u00a0\n reasonable in and of itself, and that 'the whole and only reason and the whole and only conclusion' of the Commission upon which the reduction was ordered was because the Commission decided that merchandise shipped from the Atlantic seaboard should be transported by the companies at a lower charge than that exacted for the transportation of an equal amount of merchandise when the same was shipped from St. Louis, Chicago, or other points west of the Atlantic seaboard. And this, it alleged, is in excess of the powers of the Commission, misapplies the law, and compels the companies to serve a certain class of shippers at an unreasonable rate, and to take a rate lower than is charged other shippers for a like service, which involves less expense to the companies.\n A loss of revenue is alleged, which will result in a deprivation of their property without due process of law, and that the enforcement of the order, even if it be finally set aside, will cause great disturbance to the business of the companies.\n The Commission meets those points with denials of the facts alleged and their consequences, and opposes them as well by other facts and considerations.\n It asserts that the bill has no equity because all the matters and things set forth therein are cognizable before it (the Commission), and it has the power to suspend, modify, or amend its order as upon a proper showing might be proper; that it has information for such action, for, under the law, the operation and operating results of each railroad are required to be filed with it, 'and the subject is under constant investigation.' And in such investigation, it was alleged, many elements must enter, and that the fixed charges of maintenance and operation and the cost of operation and handling of different classes of freight, state and interstate, hauled on the same train, widely different in character and value, cannot mathematically be determined so as to apportion to each class \n\n[218 U.S. 88, 98]\n\u00a0\n of traffic its proper division of costs, and that no method of apportionment can be devised except that which involves the exercise of judgment, and the results vary according to the method used. The Commission, therefore, says that the statements and allegations of the bill are mere conclusions and opinions, which necessarily involve consideration of all these complex and difficult problems, and should not be accepted for the purpose of setting aside its order.\n Supplementing this, the Commission sets forth that on the hearing before it, oral and documentary evidence was taken, to which it gave full consideration, and to the reports filed by the companies with it in accordance with the statute, and that its order was made in accordance with the statute, and that, so far from exceeding its powers, it might have made a greater reduction; but it left the companies on the Atlantic seaboard business destined to Missouri points to charge 100 per cent more than the same railroads voluntarily charge on transcontinental business, and it is alleged that it appeared from the testimony of one witness that the latter business yielded some profit, and by another witness, testifying as an expert, that a rate 50 per cent higher would be 'too large, of course.'\n The Commission alleges the reasonableness of the rates ordered by it, and that they are less than the companies charge and accept for transcontinental freight originating at the Atlantic seaboard and destined to Pacific coast terminals, the expense of service being no greater. A comparison is made also with Montana points and Spokane points, showing the rates to be less than to the Missouri river cities, carried on the same railroads. So also to Oklahoma common points. So also for traffic originating at Pittsburg and carried through Chicago to Missouri river points, and at Chicago destined to Texas common points. \n\n[218 U.S. 88, 99]\n\u00a0\n The reason given by the Commission for not disturbing the rates of the Eastern roads is that neither the complainant before it nor the companies charged that these rates were excessive, nor was a reduction of them sought; but, on the contrary, it was conceded that such rates were just and reasonable. The Eastern carriers were, therefore, dismissed from the proceedings.\n The other allegations but give further details and illustrations of the foregoing.\n An order was made allowing the Illinois Central Railway Company, the Atchison, Topeka, & Santa Fe Railroad Company, the Chicage & Alton Railroad Company, the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, the Missouri, Kansas, & Texas Railway Company, and the St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad Company to file petitions of intervention. The allegations of these petitions are substantially the same as those of the bill. The answer filed by the Interstate Commerce Commission to the bill was taken as filed to the intervening petition.\n Leave to intervene was also given to certain business houses of Milwaukee, St. Louis, Chicago, Detroit, and Cleveland. Their petition set forth with some detail the discrimination, as it was alleged, that would be worked against them in favor of merchants at the Atlantic seaboard and Missouri river cities by the order of the Commission, and also the disturbance of the commercial conditions which would result from the order. The Burham Hanna Dry Goods Company, one of the complainants before the Commission, and a number of other corporations and copartnerships were allowed to file petitions in intervention. The petitions defended the order of the Commission, and again asserted that the rates between the Mississippi and the Missouri rivers were unreasonable.\n Evidence was taken and the court made the temporary injunction permanent. \n\n[218 U.S. 88, 100]\n\u00a0\n The court carried into and made the foundation of its opinion the conception it had formen and expressed upon granting the preliminary injunction; that is, that the purpose of the Commission was not so much the reduction of unreasonable rates, as protection of the Missouri river cities against competition. The court said: 'Indeed, the contest, in its larger aspect, is a contest not so much between the shippers and the railroads, as between the commercial and manufacturing interests of the Missouri river cities and of the Atlantic seaboard on the one part (their interests being identical), and the commercial and manufacturing interests of what is known as the Central Traffic territory (the territory west of Buffalo, Pittsburg, and Parkersburg, and east of the Mississippi river) on the other part.'\n To support this view it was said that the differential of 9 cents on merchandise from Atlantic seaboard to the Missouri river cites, whatever be the principle upon which the order was based, will be 'to proteet to a certain degree the Missouri river jobbers and manufacturers within a certain zone of territory against the jobbers and manufacturers of Central Traffic Association territory . . . as also to open up to the Atlantic seaboard,' in its trade with the Missouri river, 'zones of territory, the advantages contained in the differential against the competition of both the intervening Central Traffic Association territory and the Missouri river territory.' And this, it was asserted was the exercise of a 'power artificially to apportion out the country into zones tributary to given trade centers, to be predetermined by the Commission, and nontributary to others.' This, it was further said, was a 'power essentially different in principle from the mere power of naming rates that are reasonable.'\n We make these quotations from the opinion of the court because they put, in a clear and condensed way, the ultimate contention of the companies, and the evil, as they see \n\n[218 U.S. 88, 101]\n\u00a0\n it, in the order of the Commission, and which is intended to be exhibited by their voluminous pleadings and arguments. And such, it is insisted, was the conscious purpose of the Commission,-a view in which the circuit court concurred, deducting it from certain avowals of the Commission in its report.\n Such purpose and the want of power in the Commission to execute it is the foundation of the court's opinion. No analysis of the facts was made which concerned any other proposition or issue. The question involved, the court said, was not one of fact, but one of power; it is not whether, by the application of correct principles, a given rate had been decided to be unreasonable, but whether the principles applied are those within the power of the Commission. If this be so, we may wonder at the voluminous pleadings and the equally voluminous evidence. The elements of it were on the face of the report of the Commission. The court certainly thought it could be discerned on the face of the pleadings when passing on the motion for preliminary injunction. This question, then, we must regard as paramount, and to it we will address ourselves. It may be that no other question is necessary to be decided. What the court would have done with all other questions, we are not able to say. It took occasion to remark:\n'It must be understood, however, that these orders of the Commission are enjoined simply because, in our judgment, they lay upon the commerce and manufacturing of the localities affected an artificial hand that Congress never intended should be put forth, and therefore are outside the power conferred on the Commission by Congress; for with the question of a reduction in rates, or a readjustment of rates, from which such artificial results have been eliminated, we are not now dealing.'\n\n A member of the court dissented from its judgment, and declared the grievance that the companies asserted \n\n[218 U.S. 88, 102]\n\u00a0\n against the order of the Commission was not sustained by the evidence.\n Is it true that the Interstate Commerce Commission by its order exercised a power 'artificially to apportion out the country into zones tributary to given trade centers,' and intentionally exercised it to protect the Missouri river cities against the competition of other cities? If that be the necessary conclusion, the judgment of the circuit court, it may be contended, was right. Such conclusion we should certainly be reluctant to adopt. From whatever standpoint the powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission may be viewed, they touch many interests, they may have great consequences. They are expected to be exercised in the coldest neutrality. The Commission was instituted to prevent discrimination between persons and places. It would indeed be an abuse of its powers to exercise them so as to cause either. And the training that is required, the comprehensive knowledge which is possessed, guards or tends to guard against the accidental abuse of its powers, or, if such abuse occur, to correct it. The possession of such advantages is one of its defenses. It alleges that by  12 of the interstate commerce act it is given authority to inquire into the management of the business of all common carriers subject to the provisions of the act, and is required to keep itself informed as to the manner and method in which the same is conducted, and is 'authorized and required to execute and enforce the provisions of the act.' Other sections are more specific in grants of power. Rates may not only be investigated and be pronounced unjust or unreasonable or discriminatory, but other rates may be prescribed. These, we repeat, are great powers, and means of their proper exercise are conferred. Investigation may be conducted, and, as the Commission says in its answer, 'that to enable it to perform its duties, such information as shows the operations and operating results \n\n[218 U.S. 88, 103]\n\u00a0\n of each railway is required to be filed with it, and the subject is under constant investigation.'\n The outlook of the Commission and its powers must be greater than the interest of the railroads or of that which may affect those interests. It must be as comprehensive as the interest of the whole country. If the problems which are presented to it, therefore, are complex and diffoult, the means of solving them are as great and adequate as can be provided. And arguments which point out and assail the imperfection which may appear in the result, this court has taken occasion to characterize. '[They] assail,' it was said, 'the wisdom of Congress in conferring upon the Commission the power which has been lodged in that body to consider complaints as to violations of the statute, and to correct them if found to exist, or attack as crude or inexpedient the action of the Commission in performance of the administrative functions vested in it, and upon such assumption invoke the exercise of unwarranted judicial power to correct the assumed evils.'

It was, of course, recognized in that case that there must be power in the Commission to make the order which might be subject to attack, but want of power was distinguished from the mere expediency or wisdom of making it, which, it was declared, was not open to judicial review.\n We return, therefore, to the question of the power of the Commission and its purpose. The complainant before that body presented two issues: The effect of the rates from the Atlantic seaboard as discriminating against the Missouri river cites in favor of St. Paul and Minneapolis, and their unreasonableness of and in themselves. The first we may immediately put out of view. It was decided adversely to the complainants before the Commission, and we may say at the outset that the contention of the railroad \n\n[218 U.S. 88, 104]\n\u00a0\n companies that it was the only issue presented to the Commission is not justified.\n The second issue was decided in favor of the complainants, the Commission finding that the through rates were unreasonable of and in themselves, and was caused by the charge from the Mississippi river crossings to the Missouri river cities. The grounds of its decision and principles upon which it proceeded the Commission set forth in its report, and to some extent all of the factors upon which the decision is based and supported. Indeed, the pleadings in the case and the argument of counsel are but fuller explanations of the elements set out in the report. The controversy, therefore, is not so much as to what these factors are as what they establish as to the power of the Commission to make the order. The effect of the order, it is contended, as we have seen, is to create artificial zones, tributary to certain trade centers, or, as it is expressed by the railroad companies, the effect of the order is to destroy the system of rates which has existed ever since the railroads were constructed, and to 'overturn the equality of opportunity in competition' which certain commercial centers possessed under that system, and to substitute an artificial system, the feature of which is special advantages in rates to special sections. And it is said the order was entered for such purpose. The appellee interveners, who are merchants and jobbers of the territory known as the Central Freight Association territory, attack the order on the ground (a) that it violates  2 of the interstate commerce act, in that it compels a charge to them for like kind of traffic under substantially similar circumstances and conditions greater than is charged to their competitors in seaboard territory and on the Missouri river (b) the order is in contravention of  3, in that it gives an unreasonable preference to merchants and jobbers in the seaboard territory and on the Missouri river over merchants and jobbers in Central \n\n[218 U.S. 88, 105]\n\u00a0\n Freight Association territory (c) that it arbitrarily attempts to change existing commercial conditions upon which the various distributing centers of the seaboard, Middle West, and West have become established; (d) the power of the Commission is limited to the reduction of unreasonable rates, and that the rates reduced are not shown to be such in themselves; (e) the order is void, it being an attempt at legislation on the subject of general adjustment of rates.\n These contentions present the full offending of the order, and the summary of them is that rates long established have been changed, commercial conditions are disturbed, and equal opportunities of competition of certain commercial centers which have grown up have been taken away, and undue protection given to others. This seems very formidable in the recitation. But it is met by counterchargers of discrimination, and that the equal opportunities of competition contended for is a power which has grown up and is supported by the existence of unjust freight rates. It is certain that the subject has taken on more complexity than it had before the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Commission has made this the basis of a motion to dismiss the suit as to the intervening railroads and all the intervening merchants and manufacturers, on the ground, as to the railroads, among others, that the order does not run against or operate upon them, and that no right of theirs can be determined by the decree. On the ground as to the interveners, that over the matters herein the courts exercise only the jurisdiction conferred by the act to regulate commerce, and not general equity pow ers, and that the matter to be determined is not the respective rights of shippers or localities, but the validity of the order of the Commission, and that the interveners have a complete remedy by application to the Commission. And we may say here, as adding to the compley effect and interest of the ques- \n\n[218 U.S. 88, 106]\n\u00a0\n tions presented, that the chambers of commerce and boards of trades of certain Eastern cities have presented a brief in defense of the order, asserting a vital interest in its preservation, and exhibiting and illustrating the discrimination which, as they contend, exists against them by the breaking of rates at the Mississippi river crossings.\n Let us see, therefore, upon what grounds the Commission proceeded. The Commission is accused by the railroad companies of attempting to substitute an artificial system of ratemaking for a long-established system, and to protect or foster particular localities of production and distribution. Certain remarks of the Commission are cited to support the charge. We think the charge puts out of view all else that was said by the Commission, puts out of view the comprehensive consideration the Commission took as exhibited in the explicit declaration, made after quoting the local class rates between the rivers in cents per hundred pounds, that 'these are the rates that are added to the rates up to the Mississippi river crossings to make up the through rates from the Atlantic seaboard to the Missouri river cities. Are these rates, as so used, and the through rates resulting therefrom, unwarrantably high or unduly discriminatory or unjustly prejudicial? Can they be changed without doing injustice elsewhere?'\n We think the charge also puts out of view the disclaimers of such purpose in the answer of the Commission in its report to Congress, and its insistence that it is constrained by the law to act only on complaint to it, and that it is open at all times to be appealed to redress the grievances any shipper or locality may have. Nor did the Commission ignore or underestimate the manner in which the lines of railroads had been extended, or the system of rates or rate making which had resulted. That is the system of making rates upon certain basing lines or points. Rates 'break' at such points, it was proved, as a result \n\n[218 U.S. 88, 107]\n\u00a0\n of building independent lines westward. In other words, lines of railroads were built to certain cities from the East, seeking such cities, it may be, because of their natural situation and facilities, and other independent lines building westward, each line fixing its own rates or uniting according to circumstances in joint rates. It is the observance of such points that give and maintain, as we understand the contention of the railroads, to certain cities 'the equal opportunity in the distribution of merchandise with the merchants in the East, and with the merchants to the West of said cities, so far as their business is affected by trade rates.' That this was carefully considered is manifest, for the Commission resisted the argument which was made against basing rates on such points, saying:\n'We are not impressed with the view that the system of making rates on certain basing lines should be abolished. No system of rate making has been suggested as a substitute for it, except one based upon the postage- stamp theory, or one based strictly upon mileage. Either of these would create revolution in transportation affairs and chaos in commercial affairs that have been builded upon the system of rate making now in effect. It must not, however, be assumed that a basing line for rates may be established and be made an impassable barrier for through rates, or that cities or markets located at or upon such basing line have any inviolable possession of, or hold upon, the right to distribute traffic in or from the territory lying beyond. Develop ment of natural resources, increase in pop ulation, growth of manufacturing or pro ducing facilities, and increased traffic on railroads, create changed conditions which may warrant changes in rates and in rate adjustments in order to afford just and reasonable opportunity for interchange of traffic between points of production and points of large consumption.'\n\n It was the sense of the Commission, however, that such \n\n[218 U.S. 88, 108]\n\u00a0\n points could not be immovable forever and fixed forever against power of changing, or that through rates based on such points must be exempt from regulation, no matter what their character, or be constituted at the will of the railroad of the sum of local rates or the sum of rates from one basing point to another, however unjust the rates might be. Indeed, as pointed out in the brief of the appellants in No. 664, the railway companies adhere to no such construction of rates. As there said, 'the Pacific coast terminal rates, the Washington and Spokane common-point rates, the Oklahoma rates, and the El Paso and Texas common-point rates, are each and all a departure therefrom, and all are much less than the rates ordered by the Commission.'\n As we have said, the Commission is the tribunal that is intrusted with the execution of the interstate commerce laws, and has been given very comprehensive powers in the investigation of and determination of the proportion which the rates charged shall bear to the service rendered, and this power exists, whether the system of rates be old or new. If old, interests will have probably become attached to them, and, it may be, will be disturbed or disordered if they be changed. Such circumstance is, of course, proper to be considered, and constitutes an element in the problem of regulation, but it does not take jurisdiction away to entertain and attempt to resolve the problem. And it may be that there cannot be an accommodation of all interests in one proceeding. This the Commission has realized and expressed. The Commission, meeting a possible suggestion that if the part of the through haul, which consisted of the rate between the rivers, was too high, all rates between the rivers might be too high, said:\n'If the local class rates of defendants between the Mississippi and Missouri rivers were reduced, it would give the same degree of advantage to all the producing and distributing centers on and east of the Missouri river, \n\n[218 U.S. 88, 109]\n\u00a0\n and their relative advantages or disadvantages would not be changed, while a very serious inroad upon the revenues of the carriers would inevitably result, and at a time of industrial depression when it could not well be borne. Such a change would necessitate corresponding changes in the rates to and from intermediate points, and would probably be reflected in changes in commodity rates as well. The local class rates between the rivers are high, but this is not the time to precipitate such a violent change as would follow an important reduction of them. The first-class rate from Buffalo to Chicago, about 540 miles, and from Pittsburg to Chicago, about 465 miles, is 45 cents. From Cincinnati to Chicago, 306 miles, it is 40 cents.'\n\n We may say in passing that the passage thus quoted is one of those which is adduced to support the contention that the Commission's purpose was to introduce a new system of rate making and build up certain distributing centers. We do not think so. It only shows that the accusation that all rates between the rivers were too high might be justified, but that it would be unjust to the carriers to reduce them at that time. It is somewhat strange that that which was done in the interest of the carriers should be brought forward by them to attack the action of the Commission. It is very clear that by a voluntary reduction by them of such rates, the equality of opportunity dependent upon them would be restored. We make this observation to bring out clearly the relation of the railroad companies to the grievance complained of. That the companies may complain of the reduction made by the Commission so far as it affects their revenues is one thing. To complain of it as it may affect shippers or trade centers is another We have said several times that we will not listen to a party who complains of a grievance which is not his. Clark v. Kansas City, \n176 \nU.S. 114, 118\n, 44 S. L. ed. 392, 396, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 284; Smiley v. Kansas, \n196 U.S. 447\n, 49 L. ed. 546, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 289.\n But, it may be said, such limitations upon the com- \n\n[218 U.S. 88, 110]\n\u00a0\n panies is not of consequence, for shippers and trade centers are here with complaints. It is doubtful if they are properly here, or rather, were properly permitted to intervene. We have said that the act to regulate commerce was intended to be an effective means for redressing wrongs resulting from unjust discrimination and undue preference, and this must be so, whether persons or places be sufferers. Texas & P. R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co. \n204 U.S. 426\n, 51 L. ed. 553, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 350, 9 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 1075. We have also said that the primary jurisdiction is with the Commission, the power of the courts being that of review, and is confined in that review to questions of constitutional power and all pertinent questions as to whether the action of the Commission is within the scope of the delegated authority under which it purports to have been made. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Illinois C. R. Co. \n215 \nU.S. 452, 478\n, 54 S. L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 155, 163.\n The order of the Commission, besides, is strictly limited. It was intended to determine nothing, and it determines nothing but that the through rates on Atlantic seaboard shipments to the Missouri river cities are too high. That order is alone open to review. Whether other persons, cities, or areas of territory have grounds of complaint, the way is open by application to the Commission for inquiry and remedy. In that inquiry many elements may enter upon which the judgment of the Commission should first pass, and of which the courts should not be called upon in advance to intimate an opinion. The reasons for this we have indicated, and they will be found at length in the cases which we have cited.\n One question remains for discussion,-the finding of the Commission upon the character of the rate, whether it is unreasonable as decided. Such decision, we have said with tiresome repetition, is peculiarly the province of the Commission to make, and that its findings are fortified by presumptions of truth, 'due to the judgments of a tribunal appointed by law and informed by experience.' Illinois C. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce \n\n[218 U.S. 88, 111]\n\u00a0\n Commission, \n206 U.S. 454\n, 51 L. ed. 1133, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 700, and cases cited. The testimony in this case does not shake the strength of such presumptions. We have seen that the circuit court refrained from expressing an opinion upon anything but the power of the Commission. Circuit Judge Baker, dissenting from that view, went further and said:\n'Complainants are common carriers whose rates on certain traffic are directed to be reduced by the order complained of. Two grounds for injunction are alleged. One is that the new rates are confiscatory. There is no proof whatever that the rates which the Commission prescribed as just and reasonable are not sufficient to pay the cost of handling that traffic, to cover that traffc's full proportion of maintenance and overhead expenses, and to return to the carriers an ample net profit. Furthermore, proof is lacking that, if the carriers should reduce other rates to correct what they claim is the maladjustment caused by the Commission's order, the reduction would not leave them abundant net returns. For the purposes of this hearing, therefore, it must stand as an agreed fact that the present reduction is neither directly nor indirectly obnoxious to the charge of taking private property without just compensation.' [171 Fed. 689.]\n\n We concur in these conclusions.\n Decree reversed and the case remanded with directions to dismiss the bill and all proceedings in the Circuit Court.\n\n Mr. Justice White, dissenting:\n The court below enjoined the execution of the order of the Commission because it was of the opinion that that body had exceeded the powers conferred upon it by the act to regulate commerce, since it had based its order upon the assumption that it was its duty under the act to secure a relatively equal share of the volume of interstate commerce to communities and places, and therefore that it was its province to alter otherwise legal rates for the \n\n[218 U.S. 88, 112]\n\u00a0\n purpose of correcting the inequalities which otherwise would arise from the competitive rivalry between sections and places. As, in my opinion, the court below was correct in the view which it took of the order of the Commission, and was right in holding that the power which the order manifested was not conferred by law, I dissent from the judgment of reversal now announced. It does not, however, seem to me necessary that I should do more than state the fact of my dissent for the following reasons: The judgment of reversal is based not upon the ruling that the Commission possessed the authority to make the order if it was based upon the assertion of power upon which the court below found the order must necessarily rest, but exclusively upon the theory that the court below, while rightly holding the the Commission had not the power which it assumed that body had exerted in making the order, had nevertheless mistakenly enjoined the order, because it did not exert, or attempt to exert, the power which the court conceived had been called into play in making it. In other words, although the opinion now announced excludes the authority which the lower court deemed the Commission had exerted by the order in question, it nevertheless maintains the order because of the conclusion that the order was but an exertion by the Commission of its authority on complaint that a rate was unreasonable of itself, to correct such rate by substituting a reasonable rate therefor. Although I am unable to agree with the reasonong by which the court now gives to the order of the Commission the narrow basis thus stated, as the solution of that question depends upon the idiosyncrasies of this particular case and involves no principle of general importance, it seems to me I am called upon to do no more than simply to state my inability to agree.\n Mr. Justice Holmes and Mr. Justice Lurton join in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act Feb. 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379 (U.

Then this bill was brought; the attorney general filed a certificate that the case was of general public importance; act of June 29, 1906, chap. 3591,  5, 34 Stat. at L. 590; act of February 11, 1903, chap. 544,  1, 32 Stat. at L. 823, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 1211; the Interstate Commerce Commission demurred; the case was brought up before three circuit judges; a preliminary injunction was issued on the ground that the appellant, the Interstate Commerce Commission, had exceeded its power, and an appeal was taken at once and directly to this court, as allowed by the act of 1906. 166 Fed. 498.\n The Rahway Valley road is about 10 miles long. It runs southeasterly from Summit through Kenilworth to Roselle, its terminus on the Lehigh Valley Railroad, and also southwesterly from Kenilworth to Aldene, its terminus on the Central Railroad of New Jersey, all the places named being \n\n[216 U.S. 531, 536]\n\u00a0\n in New Jersey. The Delaware, Lackawanna, & Western Railroad Company, the appellee, is a common carrier subject to the acts of Congress regulating commerce. Between Denville, New Jersey, and Hoboken, it has two branches or lines, the northerly, the Boonton branch, being devoted specially to freight, the southerly, the Morris & Essex line, devoted as exclusively as may be to passenger traffic. This southerly branch passes through Summit, and the Rahway Valley Railroad Company petitioned for and got an order requiring the appellee to make a switch connection with its road at that place. As the order interferes with the just-stated policy of the appellee as to its southerly line, it resisted the petition and brought this suit.\n The material part of the act of Congress upon which the Commission relies is as follows:\n'Any common carrier subject to the provisions of this act, upon application of any lateral, branch line of railroad, or of any shipper tendering interstate traffic for transportation, shall construct, maintain, and operate, upon reasonable terms, a switch connection with any such lateral, branch line of railroad, or private side track which may be constructed to connect with its railroad, where such connection is reasonably practicable, and can be put in with safety, and will furnish sufficient business to justify the construction and maintenance of the same; and shall furnish cars for the movement of such traffic to the best of its ability, without discrimination in favor of or against any such shipper. If any common carrier shall fail to install and operate any such switch or connection, as aforesaid, on application therefor in writing by any shipper, such shipper may make complaint to the Commission, as provided in  13 of this act, and the Commission shall hear and investigate vestigate the same, and shall determine as to the safety and practicability thereof and justification and reasonable compensation therefor, and the Commission may make an order, as provided in  15 of this act, directing the common carrier to comply with the provisions \n\n[216 U.S. 531, 537]\n\u00a0\n of this section in accordance with such order, and such order shall be enforced as hereinafter provided for the enforcement of all other orders by the Commission, other than orders for the payment of money.' [34 Stat. at L. 584, chap. 3591,  1, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 1152.]\n\n The question is raised whether the Rahway road is a 'lateral, branch line of railroad' relatively to the appellee. There certainly is force in the contention that the words of the statute mean a railroad naturally tributary to the line of the common carrier ordered to make the connection, and dependent upon it for an outlet to the markets of the country, which, according to the bill, the Rahway road is not. There is force in the argument that a road already having connection with the roads of two carriers subject to the act, and having joint routes and through rates with them, cannot be regarded as a lateral, branch line of railroad of another road situated like the appellee. On the other hand, it would be going far to lay down the universal proposition that a feeder might not be a lateral, branch road of one line at one end, and of another at the other. We leave this doubtful question on one side, because we agree with the circuit judges in the considerations upon which they decided the case.\n The statute creates a new right not existing outside of it. Wisconsin, M. & P. R. Co. v. Jacobson, \n179 \nU.S. 287, 296\n, 45 S. L. ed. 194, 199, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 115. It is plain from the provisions of the act, the history of the amendments, and justice, that the object was not to give a roving commission to every road that might see fit to make a descent upon a main line, but primarily, at least, to provide for shippers seeking an outlet either by a private road or a branch. The remedy given by the section creating the right is given only on complaint by the shipper. We are of opinion that the remedy is exclusive, on familiar principles, and that the general powers given by other sections cannot be taken to authorize a complaint to the Commission by a branch railroad company under  1. If they were applicable to a branch road, they would have been equally applicable to shippers, and there was no more reason to men- \n\n[216 U.S. 531, 538]\n\u00a0\n tion complaints by shippers than by others. The argument that shippers were mentioned to insure their rights in case of a refusal to connect with a lateral line is excluded by the form of the statute, which obviously is providing the only remedy that Congress has in mind. It may or may not be true that the distinction is not very effective, but it stands in the law, and must be accepted as the limit of the Commission's power.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","83":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION v.

Dickinson for appellee.\n\n\n[215 U.S. 452, 459]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n Whether a duty rested upon the Illinois Central Railroad Company to obey an order made by the Interstate Commerce Commission is the question here to be decided.\n On the ground that preferences were created and discriminations engendered by regulations established by the railroad company concerning the daily distribution of coal cars to mines along its line in periods when the supply of such cars was inadequate to meet the demand upon it for the movement of coal, the order in question commanded the railroad company to desist from enforcing the regulations found to be preferential, and for a future period of two years to \n\n[215 U.S. 452, 460]\n\u00a0\n deliver cars to mines along its line in conformity with the rule announced by the Commission.\n A clearer perception of the question to be considered will be afforded by giving a brief statement of the cause of car shortage referred to, accompanied with a mere outline of the steps generally taken by carriers to deal with the subject, and the particular method applied by the Illinois Central Railroad Company prior to the date when the complaint was made against it, concerning which the order previously referred to was entered.\n It is conceded in argument that bituminous coal mines, which are the character of mines here involved, must dispose of their product as soon as the coal is delivered at the surface, as it is not practicable for an operator to store such coal, and the amount that a mine will produce is therefore directly dependent upon the quantity that can be taken away day by day. As a result of this situation, it is also conceded that railroads upon whose lines coal mines are situated pursue a system by which daily deliveries of cars, based upon requisitions of the respective mines, are made to such mines to permit of the removal of their available output for that day.\n Notwithstanding full performance by railway carriers of the duty to have a legally sufficient supply of coal cars, it is conceded that unforeseen periods arise when a shortage of such cars to meet the demand for the transportation of coal takes place, because, among other things, ( a) of the wide fluctuation between the demands for the transportation of bituminous coal at different and uncertain periods; (b) the large unmber of loaded coal cars delivered by a carrier beyond its own line for transportation over other roads, consequent upon the fact that the coal produced at a particular point is normally distributed for consumption over an extensive area; and (c) because the cars thus parted with are subject to longer detentions than usually obtain in the case of shipments of other articles, owing to the fact that bituminous coal is often shipped by mining operators to distant points, to be sold after \n\n[215 U.S. 452, 461]\n\u00a0\n arrival, and is hence hald at the terminal points awaiting sale, or because, owing to the cost of handling coal, and the difficulty of storing such coal, the car in which it is shipped is often used by the shipper or purchaser at the terminal points as a convenient means of storage or as an instrument for delivery, without the expense of breaking bulk, to other and distant points.\n It is disclosed that the railroads of the United States generally, at various times, put in force regulations for the distribution of coal cars. Generally speaking, these regulations provide for fixing the capacity of coal mines in order to determine the number of cars to which each might normally be entitled to daily move its output of coal. And these regulations also provide for a method of determining the pro rata share of the cars daily allotted for distribution in times of car shortage. Neither the method by which capacity was to be ascertained nor the regulation for daily distribution upon the basis of such capacity in case of shortage were identical among the various railroad systems of the United States. The divergence, and even conflict, between those systems, is illustrated by the cases of Logan Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co. 154 Fed. 497; United States ex rel. Pitcairn Coal Co. v. Baltimore & O. R. Co. 91 C. C. A. 147, 165 Fed. 113; cases cited at pages 503 and 504 of the report of the Logan Coal Co. Case, and the case of Majestic Coal & Coke Co. v. Illinois C. R. Co. 162 Fed. 810.\n In a general sense, however, all the regulations of the various railroads, either for ascertaining the capacity of coal mines, or in order to determine the pro rata share for daily distribution of cars to the respective mines in case of shortage, dealt with four classes of cars: 1, system cars, that is, cars owned by the carrier and in use for the transportation of coal; 2, company fuel cars, that is, cars belonging to the company, and used by it when necessary for the movement of coal from the mines on its own line, and which coal had been bought by the carrier, and was used solely for its own fuel purposes; 3, private cars, that is, cars either owned by coal mining companies or shippers or \n\n[215 U.S. 452, 462]\n\u00a0\n consumers, and used for the benefit of their owners in conveying coal from the mines to designated points of delivery; 4, foreign railway fuel cars, that is, cars owned by other railroad companies, and which were by them delivered to the carriers on whose lines mines were situated, for the purpose of enabling the cars to be loaded with coal and returned to the company by whom the cars had been furnished, the coal being intended for use as fuel by such foreign railroad companies.\n The various regulations, irrespective of minor differences between them, fell upon one or the other side of this broad line of division. One system took into account class 2, the fuel cars of the carrier, class 3, the private cars, and class 4, the cars of foreign railroads, and deducted from the rated capacity of the mine the sum of coal delivered by that mine in such cars, and upon the basis thus resulting apportioned ratably, in case of shortage, the system cars; that is, those embraced in class 1. On the other hand, the other class of regulation not only took no account of the cars in classes 2, 3, and 4, as a means of rating the capacity of the mine, but moreover did not charge against any mine, for the purpose of ascertaining the daily pro rata of the cars to which such mine was entitled, any car whatever furnished such mine on such day embraced within classes 2, 3, and 4, that is, any company fuel car, foreign railway fuel car, or private car. By this system, therefore, where a mine was entitled daily to a given pro rata of the cars subject to general distribution, it received its full share of such cars, and in addition on that day also received such of the company fuel cars, foreign railway fuel cars, and private cars as might have been sent to it for loading on that day. This absolute disregard in the allotment of the company fuel cars, foreign railway fuel cars, and private cars was not in all respects common to all the systems which took no account of such cars in fixing capacity, since in some of the regulations one or the other of the classes was taken into account in fixing the pro rata for distribution.\n Previous to 1907, the Railroad Commission of the State of Ohio filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission two \n\n[215 U.S. 452, 463]\n\u00a0\n complaints against the Hocking Valley and another railroad company. These complaints were based upon the ground that the failure of the railroads in times of car shortage to include in the pro rata of cars for distribution foreign railway fuel cars and private cars, and to charge the mines which had received such cars with the same as part of their distributive share, created an undue preference, and worked unjust discrimination, in violation of the act to regulate commerce. On July 11, 1907, the report and opinion of the Commission was announced in the cases referred to. 12 Inters. Com. Rep. 398. It was declared that the complaints were well founded, and the relief prayed was awarded. Nine days afterwards,- presumptively in ignorance of the finding of the Commission, just referred to,-the Illinois Central Railroad Company promulgated rules governing the distribution of cars to coal mines. Although by these rules foreign fuel cars, private cars, and company fuel cars were not taken into account in ascertaining the capacity of a mine or mines, such cars were expressly directed not to be counted for the purpose of the daily distribution of cars among the respective mines. On August 15 following, however, presumably to cause the regulations to conform to the interpretation of the interstate commerce act adopted by the Commission in the Hocking Valley Case, a circular was issued by the Illinois Central Railroad Company, to go into effect September 1, 1907, canceling the circular of July 20, 1907, and directing that account should be taken in the distribution of cars to a particular mine or mines of both foreign railway fuel and private cars. Before the date fixed for the going into effect of this last-named circular, the Majestic Coal & Coke Company, a West Virginia corporation, filed a suit against the Illinois Central Railroad Company in the United States circuit court for the northern district of Illinois, complaining that to charge against its distributive share of coal cars, in the event of a car shortage, the fuel cars and private cars furnished it, would violate its legal rights. After hearing a temporary injunction preventing the \n\n[215 U.S. 452, 464]\n\u00a0\n going into effect of the regulations in the particulars mentioned, was issued. The distribution of coal cars thereafter continued to be made as provided in the prior circular.\n With this prelude we come more immediately to the origin of the controversy before us.\n On October 31, 1907, the Illinois Collieries Company filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission a complaint against the Illinois Central Railroad Company. The regulations of the railroad company as to the distribution of coal cars were assailed as unjustly discriminatory, in violation of the act to regulate commerce, particularly as respected the practice of not taking into consideration foreign railway fuel cars and private cars in determining the distribution of coal cars among the various coal operators along the lines of the railroad on interstate shipments of coal. It appears that the complaint just referred to was heard before the Commission, with two other complaints against other railroads, involving the same general subject. In its report, which was filed in all three of the cases on April 13, 1908 (13 Inters. Com. Rep. 451), the Commission held that not to count, in times of car shortage, when the daily distributions were made against the mine receiving the same, company fuel cars, foreign railway fuel cars, and private cars, was a violation of the act to regulate commerce. In announcing this conclusion, reference was made to the previous opinion of the Commission in the Hocking Valley Case, supra, and it was declared that the Illinois Central Railroad Company, on the hearing before the Commission, had conceded the controlling effect of the previous ruling of the Commission. Considering the temporary injunction issued by the circuit court of the United States for the northern district of Illinois, the Commission declared that, in view of the decision of this court in the case of the Texas & P. R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co. \n204 U.S. 426\n, 51 L. ed. 553, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 350, 9 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 1075, it was the duty of the Commission to order the carrier to desist from the unlawful discrimination.\n Although the complaint in the case of the Illinois Central \n\n[215 U.S. 452, 465]\n\u00a0\n Railroad Company differed from the complaints in the two other cases which were considered and passed upon by the Commission at the same time, in that it did not assail the failure to take into account the company fuel cars in making distribution in times of car shortage, nevertheless the Commission declared that the Illinois Central Railroad Company, both in its brief and argument, had conceded the importance of the subject to that company, and had invoked the action of the Commission thereon.\n The order of the Commission, as heretofore stated, therefore, not only directed the desisting from the practice of failing to take into account the foreign railway fuel cars, private cars, and the company fuel cars, but also required the carriers to establish regulations for a period of two years from July 1, 1908, providing for the counting of all such cars. The general scope of the order was, however, qualified by expressly authorizing a railroad company to deliver to a particular mine all the foreign railway fuel cars, the private cars, and the company fuel cars consigned or assigned to said mine, even although the number thereof might exceed the pro rata share of the cars attributable to said mine when ascertained by taking into account all the cars which the order required to be considered. Where, however, the number of such cars was less than the pro rata share of the mine, the order only permitted the carrier to add a sufficient number of system cars to make up the rightful pro rata number.\n Being unwilling to comply with the order of the Commission, the Illinois Central Railroad Company commenced the suit which is now before us to enjoin in all respects the enforcement of the order of the Commission. It was averred that, although the company was adequately equipped with coal cars, and with sufficient motive power and operative forces, yet at times an inadequate supply of coal cars to meet the demand arose from the circumstances which we have previously stated. It was alleged that the regulations adopted by the company for ascertaining the capacity of the mines \n\n[215 U.S. 452, 466]\n\u00a0\n and for the distribution of cars were, in all respects, just and reasonable, and it was charged that the order of the Commission, directing the taking into account of private cars in the distribution of cars, was unjust, unreasonable, oppressive, and unlawful, because it deprived the owners of such cars of the right to the use of their own property. It was further alleged that, as to the foreign railway fuel cars, the order was also unjust, unreasonable, oppressive, and unlawful, because such cars constituted no part of the equipment of the road, and failing to count them could not constitute an unlawful discrimination or the giving of an unjust preference within the intendment of the act to regulate commerce. Besides charging that the order to count the company fuel cars was unjust, unreasonable, etc., it was averred that the attempt of the Commission to deal with such cars was beyond its power, and was but an effort to deprive the company of its lawful right to freely contract for the purchase of the fuel necessary for the operation of its road. In addition, the proceedings in the suit brought by the Majestic Coal Company were set out, the granting of a temporary injunction therein as to counting foreign railway fuel cars and private cars was alleged, and it was charged that, in any event, as to those two classes of cars, the order of the Commission was not lawful, since it compelled the company to violate the injunction which was yet in force. The Commission answered by asserting the validity in all respects of the order by it made, substantially upon the grounds which had been set out in its report and opinion announced when the order was made. All the averments in the complaint as to want of power were traversed, and it was expressly charged that the subject of the distribution of coal cars, as dealt with by the order, was within the administrative power delegated to the Commission by the terms of the act to regulate commerce. The nature and character of the preferences and discriminations which had led the Commission to conclude that unlawful discrimination and unjust preference arose from the failure to count the classes of cars referred to \n\n[215 U.S. 452, 467]\n\u00a0\n was alleged in subdivision 14 of the answer, a portion whereof is reproduced in the margin. A certificate as to the public importance of the cause was filed by the attorney general, in compliance with  5 of the act of June 29, 1906 (34 Stat. at L. 584, chap. 3591, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 1149), and the cause was\n 14. Defendant avers that the allotment by complainant of said foreign railway fuel cars, private cars, and complainant's fuel cars to the mines receiving them, in addition to the full distributive shares of such mines in the general distribution of cars by complainant, and the failure by complainant to count and charge said foreign railway fuel cars, private cars, and company cars against the mines receiving them, in said general distribution, results in undue and unreasonable preference or advantage to the mines and operators receiving such cars, and subjects the owners and operators of mines which do not receive such cars to undue and unreasonable prejudice and disadvantage in the following respects, to wit:\n\n\n (a)\n That the operator receiving the foreign railway fuel cars, private cars, or company fuel cars thereby receives a higher percentage of cars than mines of equal capacity which do not receive such cars.\n\n\n (b)\n That the operator receiving the foreign railway fuel cars, private cars, or company fuel cars may operate his mine to a fuller capacity, and thereby reduce the cost of coal per ton, resulting in an increased profit on his commercial coal.\n\n\n (c)\n That the operator receiving foreign railway fuel cars, private cars, or company fuel cars is enabled to increase the number of working places in the mine, is enabled to develop his mine more rapidly, is enabled to increase his capacity rating, and in future reratings of such mine by complainant, for the purposes of car distribution, the mine would receive a higher rating, and consequently a larger number of cars in complainant's general distribution of cars.\n\n\n (d)\n That the operator receiving the foreign railway fuel cars, private cars, or company fuel cars is enabled thereby to secure and hold a larger, more efficient, and regular working force of miners and laborers.\n\n\n (e)\n That the development of the mines which do not receive the foreign railway fuel cars, private cars, or company fuel cars is retarded in inverse ratio as the development of the mines receiving said cars is accelerated.\n\n\n (f)\n That, by the arbitrary allotment of the foreign railway fuel cars, private cars, or company fuel cars, the complainant and the so-called foreign railways are enabled to secure low prices on railway fuel because the operator receiving such cars is enabled to produce his commercial coal at much lower prices than do the mines which do not receive such arbitrary cars.\n\n\n (g)\n That the operator of the mine receiving the foreign railway fuel cars, private cars, or company fuel cars is thereby enabled to make contracts for the delivery of coal, distributed over a long period, to an extent that the operator of the mines which do not receive such cars cannot do. \n\n[215 U.S. 452, 468]\n\u00a0\n thereafter submitted at the same time with one brought by the Alton Railroad, involving a similar question, to a circuit court held by Judges Grosscup, Baker, and Kohlsatt. A single opinion was announced in both cases. 173 Fed. 930. While deciding that the complainants were not entitled to relief in so far as the order of the Commission concerned the counting of foreign railway fuel cars and private cars, it was yet held that the railway companies were entitled to an injunction restraining the enforcement of the orders of the Commission in so far as they directed the taking into account of the cars employed by the company in hauling its own fuel. The conclusion on this latter subject was based upon the theory that, as the railroad companies took the coal which they bought for their own use from the tipple of a coal mine, and thereafter moved it for their own account, and not for commercial purposes, that the cars used for that purpose could not be treated as being engaged in commerce as 'commerce, under these circumstances ends at the tipple.' The court, however, observed:\n'But this does not mean that these cars do not affect the problem of an equitable distribution of commercial equipment. The mine operators are objects of interest under the interstate commerce law, not as diggers of coal, but as shippers who tender a commercial product for transportation by interstate common carriers. The basis, therefore, on which the mines in a district should be rated is not their average output as a physical question, but the average output which they respectively tender for transportation in commerce.'\n\n And in accord with this reasoning it was in conclusion \n\n[215 U.S. 452, 469]\n\u00a0\n remarked that the complainants, as to the cars used for hauling their fuel, were entitled to an injunction 'against their being compelled to take fuel cars into consideration except as a means in determining the true capacities of the mines to tender coal to them for transportation in commerce.'\n From the final decree enjoining the Commission from enforcing its order, in so far as it directed the taking into account the company fuel cars in the distribution of coal cars in times of car shortage, and in so far as it directed the future taking such cars into account, the Interstate Commerce Commission appeals.\n It is stated in the brief of counsel for the railroad company that, at the hearing below, despite the scope of the prayer of the bill, no question was raised by the railroad company as to the validity of the order of the commission to the extent that it controlled private cars and foreign railway fuel cars. Irrespective, however, of this admission, as the Interstate Commerce Commission alone has appealed, the correctness of the conclusions of the court below on these subjects is not open to inquiry. And this also renders it unnecessary to consider in any respect the effect of the injunction to which we have previously referred as issued in the suit filed on behalf of the Majestic Coal Company, since such injunction only related to foreign railway fuel cars and private cars. Besides, it is stated in the brief of counsel that, before the decision of this case, the preliminary injunction in favor of the Majestic Coal Company was dissolved, and no appeal was taken therefrom.\n In consequence of one of the comprehensive amendments to the act to regulate commerce, adopted in 1906 ( 4, act June 29, 1906, 34 Stat. at L. 589, chap. 3591, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 1158), it is now provided that 'all orders of the Commission, except orders for the payment of money, shall take effect within such reasonable time, not less than thirty days, and shall continue in force for such period of time, not exceeding two years, as shall be prescribed in the order of the Commission, unless the same shall be \n\n[215 U.S. 452, 470]\n\u00a0\n suspended or modified or set aside by the Commission, or be suspended or set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction.' The statute endowing the Commission with large administrative functions, and generally giving effect to its orders concerning complaints before it without exacting that they be previously submitted to judicial authority for sanction, it becomes necessary to determine the extent of the powers which courts may exert on the subject.\n Beyond controversy, in determining whether an order of the Commission shall be suspended or set aside, we must consider (a) all relevant questions of constitutional power or right; (b) all pertinent questions as to whether the administrative order is within the scope of the delegated authority under which it purports to have been made; and (c) a proposition which we state independently, although in its essence it may be contained in the previous one, viz., whether, even although the order be in form within the delegated power, nevertheless it must be treated as not embraced therein, because the exertion of authority which is questioned has been manifested in such an unreasonable manner as to cause it, in truth, to be within the elementary rule that the substance, and not the shadow, determines the validity of the exercise of the power. Postal Teleg. Cable Co. v. Adams, \n155 \nU.S. 688, 698\n, 39 S. L. ed. 311, 316, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 1, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 268, 360. Plain as it is that the powers just stated are of the essence of judicial authority, and which, therefore, may not be curtailed, and whose discharge may not be by us in a proper case avoided, it is equally plain that such perennial powers lend no support whatever to the proposition that we may, under the guise of exerting judicial power, usurp merely administrative functions by setting aside a lawful administrative order upon our conception as to whether the administrative power has been wisely exercised.\n Power to make the order, and not the mere expediency or wisdom of having made it, is the question. While, as we have seen, the court below reasoned that the transportation of coal bought from a mine by the railroad company for its own use, after delivery to it in its coal cars at the tipple, was \n\n[215 U.S. 452, 471]\n\u00a0\n not commerce, because 'commerce, under these circumstances, ends at the tipple,' it yet reasoned that such coal was within the control of the interstate commerce law to the extent that a regulation compelling its consideration, for the purpose of rating the capacity of a mine as a basis for fixing its pro rata share of cars in times of shortage, would be valid. Because of this reasoning, it is insisted, it appears that the court below but substituted a regulation which it deemed wise for one which it considered the Commission had inexpediently adopted, and this upon the assumption by the court that its authority was not limited to determining power. Without intimating an opinion as to the merits of the proposition, we put it aside as irrelevant, since we must decide whether the action of the court below was correct, irrespective of the reasoning by which such action was induced. We further also dismiss from view a contention, strenuously insisted upon in argument by the government, to the effect that, in determining the issue of power, we must treat the railroad company as being at fault for the failure to daily deliver all the cars called for in times of car shortage. We put it aside because it is in direct conflict with facts expressly admitted or impliedly conceded in the answer of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and from which facts we must take it for granted that the equipment of coal cars of the railroad company was reasonably adequate to meet all normal conditions, although it became insufficient at times because of extraordinary circumstances, against which it was, in reason, impossible to provide.\n We think the issues for decision will be best disposed of by at once considering the contentions advanced by the railroad company to establish that there was a want of power in the Commission to make that portion of the order which the court below enjoined. The contentions on this subject are stated in argument in many different forms, and, if not in some respects contradictory, are, at all events, confusing, since, considered logically, we think they virtually intermingle power \n\n[215 U.S. 452, 472]\n\u00a0\n and expediency as if they were one and the same thing. We shall not, therefore, in making an analysis of the contentions, follow their mere form of statement, but shall treat them all as reducible to two propositions, viz.: First. That the act to regulate commerce has not delegated to the Commission authority to consider, where a complaint is made on such subject, the question of the distribution of company fuel cars in times of car shortage as a means of prohibiting unjust preference or undue discrimination. Second. That, even if such power has been delegated to the Commission by the act to regulate commerce, the order whose continued enforcement was enjoined by the court below was beyond the authority conferred by the statute.\n As the Interstate Commerce Commission alone has appealed, it is patent that those portions of the order of the Commission which concern foreign railway fuel cars and private cars, and which the court below refused to enjoin, are not open to inquiry. The suggestion at once presents itself whether, if these subjects are not open, they do not necessarily carry with them the question of company fuel cars, on the ground that the three classes rest upon one and the same consideration, and that to divorce them would bring about conditions of preference and discrimination which the act to regulate commerce expressly prohibits. In view, however, of the great importance of the questions directly arising for decision, and the fact that the court below has treated the company fuel cars as distinct, we shall not be sedulous to pursue the suggestion, and come at once to the propositions of power previously stated.\n First. That the act to regulate commerce has not delegated to the Commission authority to regulate the distribution of company fuel cars in times of car shortage as a means of prohibiting unjust preferences or undue discrimination.\n When coal is received from the tipple of a coal mine into coal cars by a railway company, and the coal is intended for its own use and is transported by it, it is said there is no \n\n[215 U.S. 452, 473]\n\u00a0\n consignor, no consignee, and no freight to be paid, and therefore, although there may be transportation, there is no shipment, and hence no commerce. In changed form, these propositions but embody the reasoning which led the court below to its conclusion that, under the circumstances, commerce ended at the tipple of the mine. The deduction from the proposition is, as the movement of coal under the conditions stated is not commerce, it is therefore not within the authority delegated to the Commission by the act of Congress, as all such acts have relation to the regulation of commerce, and do not, therefore, embrace that which is not commerce. It is to be observed, in passing, that if the proposition be well founded, it not only challenges the authority of the Commission, but extends much further, and in effect denies the power of Congress to confer authority upon the Commission over the subject. In all its aspects the proposition calls in question the construction given to the law by the Commission in every case where the subject has been before it, and also assails the correctness of numerous decisions in the lower Federal court, to which we have previously referred, where the subject, in various forms, was considered. It goes further than this, since it, in effect, seeks to avoid the fair inferences arising from the regulations adopted by the railroad company. Those regulations, in providing for the obligation of the railroad company to supply cars, and recognizing the duty of equality of treatment, found it necessary, by express provision, to provide that private cars, foreign railway cars, and company fuel cars should not be counted against the mine on the day when furnished, thus implying that, under the general rule of equality, if not restricted, it was considered the duty would exist to consider such cars. The contention, moreover, conflicts with the rule which, as we have seen, obtains in other and great systems of railroad, by which, for the purpose of avoiding inequality and preference, foreign railway fuel cars, private cars, and company fuel cars are made one of the factors upon which a mine is rated in order \n\n[215 U.S. 452, 474]\n\u00a0\n to fix the basis upon which its distributive share of cars is to be allotted in case of car shortage. And from this it must follow, if the proposition contended for be maintained, that it would not only relieve the railroad company, whose rights are here involved, from the obligation of taking into account its fuel cars in the making of the distribution, but from the duty even to consider them for the purpose of capacity rating. As a result, it would lead to the overthrow of the system of rating prevailing on other railroads, by which, as we have said, such cars are taken into account,-a consequence which is well illustrated by the ease of Logan Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co. 154 Fed. 497.\n Under these conditions, it is clear that doubt, if it exist, must be resolved against the soundness of the contentions relied on. But that rule of construction need not be invoked, as, we think, when the erroneous assumption upon which the proposition must rest is considered, its unsoundness is readily demonstrable. That assumption is this: that commerce, in the constitutional sense, only embraces shipment in a technical sense, and does not, therefore, extend to carriers engaged in interstate commerce, certainly in so far as so engaged, and the instrumentalities by which such commerce is carried on,-a doctrine the unsoundness of which has been apparent ever since the decision in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 6 L. ed. 23, and which has not since been open to question. It may not be doubted that the equipment of a railroad company engaged, in interstate commerce, included in which are its coal cars, are instruments of such commerce. From this it necessarily follows that such cars are embraced within the governmental power of regulation, which extends, in time of car shortage, to compelling a just and equal distribution, and the prevention of an unjust and discriminatory one.\n The corporation, as a carrier engaged in interstate commerce, being, then, as to its interstate commerce business, subject to the control exerted by the act to regulate commerce, and the instrumentalities employed for the purpose \n\n[215 U.S. 452, 475]\n\u00a0\n of such commerce being likewise so subject to control, we are brought to consider the remaining proposition, which is:\n Second. That, even if power has been delegated to the Commission by the act to regulate commerce, the order whose continued enforcement was enjoined by the court below was beyond the authority delegated by the statute.\n In view of the facts found by the Commission as to preferences and discriminations resulting from the failure to count the company fuel cars in the daily distribution in times of car shortage, and in further view of the far-reaching preferences and discriminations alleged in the answer of the Commission in this case, and which must be taken as true, as the cause was submitted on bill and answer, it is beyond controversy that the subject with which the order dealt was within the sweeping provisions of  3 of the act to regulate commerce, prohibiting preferences and discriminations. [24 Stat. at L. 380, chap. 104, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3155.] But it is contended that although this be the case, as the order of the Commission not only forbade the preferences and discriminations complained of, but also commanded the establishment of a rule excluding such discriminations for a future definite period of not exceeding two years, the order transcended the authority conferred upon the commission. This proceeds upon the assumption that  4 of the act to regulate commerce, as enacted by the act of June 29, 1906, while conferring upon the Commission the authority, upon complaint duly made, to declare a rate or practice affecting rates illegal, and to establish a new and reasonable rule or practice affecting such rates for a term not exceeding two years, has no relation to complaints concerning preferences or discriminations, unless such practices, when complained of, are of a character to affect rates, which it is insisted is not here the case. The pertinent part of the section in question (4) reads as follows:\n'That the Commission is authorized and empowered, and it shall be its duty, whenever, after full hearing upon a complaint made as provided in section 13 of this act, or upon \n\n[215 U.S. 452, 476]\n\u00a0\n complaint of any common carrier, it shall be of the opinion that any of the rates or charges whatsoever, demanded, charged, or collected by any common carrier or carriers, subject to the provisions of this act, for the transportation of persons or property, as defined in the first section of this act, or that any regulations or practices whatsoever of such carrier or carriers affecting such rates, are unjust or unreasonable, or unjustly discriminatory, or unduly preferential or prejudicial, or otherwise in violation of any of the provisions of this act, to determine and prescribe what will be the just and reasonable rate or rates, charge or charges, to be thereafter observed in such case as the maximum to be charged; and what regulation or practice in respect to such transportation is just, fair, and reasonable to be thereafter followed; and to make an order that the carrier shall cease and desist from such violation, to the extent to which the Commission find the same to exist, and shall not thereafter publish, demand, or collect any rate or charge for such transportation in excess of the maximum rate or charge so prescribed, and shall conform to the regulation or practice so prescribed.\n\n'All orders of the Commission, except orders for the payment of money, shall take effect within such reasonable time, not less than thirty days, and shall continue in force for such period of time, not exceeding two years, as shall be prescribed in the order of the Commission, unless the same shall be suspended or modified or set aside by the Commission, or be suspended or set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction.'\n\n The contention gives to the words found in the earlier part of the section, 'any regulation or practice whatsoever of such carrier or carriers affecting such rates,' a dominant and controlling power, so as to cause them to limit every other provision in the section, however general in its language. We do not stop to critically examine the provision relied upon, for the purpose of pointing out, as a matter of grammatical construction, the error of the contention, because we think, when the text of the section is taken into view and all its provisions \n\n[215 U.S. 452, 477]\n\u00a0\n are given their natural significance, it obviously appears that the construction relied upon is without foundation, and that to sustain it would be to frustrate the very purpose which it is clear, when the entire provision is considered, it was designed to accomplish, and thus would be destructive of the plain intent of Congress in enacting the provision. The antecedent construction which the interstate commerce act had necessitated, and the remedial character of the amendments adopted in 1906, all serve to establish the want of merit in the contention relied upon. It addition, to adopt it would require us to hold that Congress, in enlarging the power of the Commission over rates, had so drafted the amendment as to cripple and paralyze its power in correcting abuses as to preferences and discriminations which, as this court has hitherto pointed out, it was the great and fundamental purpose of Congress to further.\n Conceding, for the sake of the argument, the existence of the preferences and discriminations charged, it is insisted, when the findings made by the Commission are taken into view and the pleadings as an entirety are considered, it results that the discriminations and preferences arose from the fact that the railroad company chose to purchase its coal for its fuel supply from a particular mine or mines, and that, as it had a right to do so, it is impossible, without destroying freedom of contract, to predicate illegal preferences or wrongful discriminations from the fact of purchase. But the proposition overlooks the fact that the regulation addresses itself, not to the right to purchase, but to the duty to make equal distribution of cars. The right to buy is one thing, and the power to use the equipment of the road for the purpose of moving the articles purchased in such a way as to discriminate or give preference are wholly distinct and different things. The insistence that the necessary effect of an order compelling the counting of company fuel cars in fixing, in case of shortage, the share of cars a mine from which coal has been purchased will be entitled to, will be to bring about \n\n[215 U.S. 452, 478]\n\u00a0\n a discrimination against the mine from which the company buys its coal, and a preference in favor of other mines, but inveighs against the expediency of the order. And this is true also of a statement in another form of the same proposition; that is, that if, when coal is bought from a mine by a railroad, the road is compelled to count the cars in which the coal is moved in case of car shortage, a preference will result in favor of the mine selling coal and making delivery thereof at the tipple of the mine to a person who is able to consume it without the necessity of transporting it by rail. At best, these arguments but suggest the complexity of the subject, and the difficulty involved in making any order which may not be amenable to the criticism that it leads to or may beget some inequality. Indeed, the arguments just stated, and others of a like character which we do not deem it essential to specially refer to, but assail the wisdom of Congress in conferring upon the Commission the power which has been lodged in that body to consider complaints as to violations of the statute, and to correct them if found to exist, or attack as crude or inexpendient the action of the Commission in performance of the administrative functions vested in it, and upon such assumption invoke the exercise of unwarranted judicial power to correct the assumed evils. It follows from what we have said that the court below erred in enjoining the order of the Commission, in so far as it related to company fuel cars, and its decree is therefore reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice Brewer dissents. \n\n\n\n","84":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION v.

The order was made in a proceeding instituted by the Commission upon its own motion, and required the establishment of through routes and joint rates for passengers and their baggage, east and \n\n[216 U.S. 538, 543]\n\u00a0\n west, from and to points on the Chicago & Northwestern Railway between Chicago and Council Bluffs, Iowa, inclusive; and from and to points on the Union Pacific Railroad between Colorado common points and Omaha, Nebraska, and Kansas City, Missouri, inclusive; via Portland, Oregon; to and from points on the Northern Pacific Railway between Portland and Seattle. The joint rates are to be the same as the present rates between the same points via the Northern Pacific road and its connections. This order concerns passenger travel in one direction only. It does not affect round trips, and it does not deal with freight.\n The points between Portland and Seattle can be reached from the places mentioned at the other end of the route, by way of the Northern Pacific alone from St. Paul, or by way of the Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy to Billings, Montana, and then by the Northern Pacific for the last thousand miles; the Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy being jointly owned and controlled by the Northern Pacific and the Great Northern roads. But an average of 8,000 persons a year go by way of the Union Pacific to Portland, where, to go further, passengers have to change to the Northern Pacific line. Under present arrangements, the Union Pacific issues a coupon with its tickets, entitling the holder to a first-class passage on from Portland, but he has to exchange the coupon for a ticket, to recheck his baggage, and to pay the additional Pullman fare. The effect of the order is to put the Union Pacific on an equal footing with the Northern Pacific in the use, for through travel, of the road belonging to the latter between Portland and Seattle. It is said that this road, with the expensive terminals of the Northern Pacific at Tacoma and Seattle, would not be supported by local business, but depends on the traffic of the whole Northern Pacific system. Therefore, the Northern Pacific objects to the order and brings this bill.\n The authority of the Commission to establish through routes and joint rates is conditioned by the proviso that 'no \n\n[216 U.S. 538, 544]\n\u00a0\n reasonable or satisfactory through route exists.' Act of June 29, 1906, chap. 3591,  4. 34 Stat. at L. 589, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 1158. It is urged that this condition is addressed only to the opinion of the Commission, and cannot be reexamined by the courts as a jurisdictional fact. The difficulty of distinguishing between a rule of law for the guidance of a court and a limit set to its power is sometimes considerable. Words that might seem to concern jurisdiction may be read as simply imposing a rule of decision, and often will be read in that way when dealing with a court of general powers. Fauntleroy v. Lum, \n210 \nU.S. 230, 235\n, 52 S. L. ed. 1039, 1041, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 641. But even in such a case there may be a difference of opinion (id. 245), and when we are dealing with an administrative order that seriously affects property rights, and does so by way rather of fiat than of adjudication, there seems to be no reason for not taking the proviso of the statute in its natural sense. See Interstate Commerce Commission v. Illinois C. R. Co. \n215 \nU.S. 452, 470\n, 54 S. L. Ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 155.\n We are of opinion, then, that the Commission had no power to make the order if a reasonable and satisfactory through route already existed, and that the existence of such a route may be inquired into by the courts. How far the courts should go in that inquiry we need not now decide. No doubt, in complex and delicate cases great weight, at least, would be attached to the judgment of the Commission. But in the present instance there is no room for difference as to the facts, and the majority of the Commission plainly could not and would not have made the declaration in their order that there was no such through route, but for a view of the law upon which this court must pass. It is admitted that the Northern Pacific route is shorter than that of the Union Pacific by way of Portland, and the running time somewhat less; and it is added by the majority that the 'passenger goes in as good a car and is provided with as good a berth and as good a meal.'\n There is some suggestion that at times the northern route may not be as good as the southern, although at other times \n\n[216 U.S. 538, 545]\n\u00a0\n it may be better; but the ground of the order avowedly was that the personal preferences of many travelers is to go by the southern way. If they do, it is said, they can select from a great variety of routes as far as Ogden, Utah; they can visit cities not reached by the northern lines; they can search over a wide area for homesteads; they can behold the natural beauties that may be rivaled but not repeated on the other roads. It appears to us that these grounds do not justify the order. The most that can be said of them is that they are reasons for desiring a second through route, but they are not reasons warranting the declaration that 'no reasonable or satisfactory through route exists.' Obviously, that is not true, except by an artificial use of words. It cannot be said that there is no such route, because the public would prefer two. The condition in the statute is not to be trified away. Except in case of a need such as the statute implies, the injustice pointed out by the chairman in his dissent is not permitted by the law.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","85":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJ J MCCASKILL CO. v. U S(1910)\nNo. 103\nArgued: January 25, 1910Decided: February 28, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 504, 505]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William W. Flournoy for appellant.\n Assistant Attorney General Russell for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This suit was brought by the United States to cancel a patent issued to one William Josiah Ward, and a deed made by him and his wife to J. J. McCaskill & Company, and by the latter to the J. J. McCaskill Company, the appellant. The allegations of the bill are that the N. 1\/2 of the N.E. 1\/4, S.W. 1\/4 of the N.E. 1\/4, and S.E. 1\/4 of N.W. 1\/4 of section 8, township 1 N., 17 W., in the county of Walton, state of Florida, being public lands of the United States, William Josiah Ward, on the 18th of September, 1900, filed his application upon them for a homestead in the land office in Gainesville, Florida. That he subsequently commuted the entry by paying the government price therefor, making proof of settlement, cultivation, and improvement for the period of time required by law, and that on January 13, 1903, a cash entry certificate No. 18,026 was issued to him and a patent on the 3d of June, 1903. It is alleged, with detail of circumstances, that the statement of Ward and the proof presented by him on the hearing for final proof were false, fraudulent, and untrue. The allegations will be given later. The bill further alleges that the land embraced in the patent was conveyed by Ward to J. J. McCaskill & Company ( the bill as originally filed alleged that the conveyance had been made to the McCaskill Company), a copartnership composed of J. J. McCaskill and E. L. McCaskill, then engaged in the manufacture of lumber at Freeport, Florida. That they afterward incorporated by the corporate name of the J. J. McCaskill Company, with the said J. J. McCaskill as president and Robert E. L. McCaskill as secretary, owning a large majority of the stock of the corporation, with the entire manage- \n\n[216 U.S. 504, 506]\n\u00a0\n ment and control of its business and affairs. That the company took over from the said J. J. McCaskill or J. J. McCaskill & Company the homestead entry of Ward, with full knowledge of its president and secretary of the negotiations between the company and the entryman by Warren Ward, an agent of the company, 'and with all the knowledge and notice of the said McCaskill & Cpmpany of the fraud and duplicity practised by William Josiah Ward in obtaining the patent from the United States.'\n The answer of the company alleged that conveyance was made by William Josiah Ward to J. J. McCaskill after the patent was issued for the sum of $ 425; that McCaskill, for a valuable consideration, sold and conveyed the same to the McCaskill Company; that the conveyance was made in good faith, without notice or knowledge of any kind whatsoever of any irregularity or fraud upon the part of Ward, if any there was, and that he was a bona fide purchaser of the property; and that the company was a bond fide purchaser, for a valuable consideration, from J. J. McCaskill, and without knowledge or notice of any irregularity or fraud practised by Ward. The usual replication was filed and an examiner was appointed to take the proofs on the issues made.\n Upon report to the court, a decree was entered overruling the objections of the company to the evidence and the motion to strike it out, and adjudged and decreed that the patent be declared null and void, and that it be surrendered by the company, the decree finding it to be in its possession, to the clerk of the court, to be inscribed by him 'null and void.' It was further adjudged and decreed that the deed from William Josiah Ward to J. J. McCaskill & Company, and the deed from the latter to the J. J. McCaskill Company, be vacated and annulled, and the company be enjoined forever from setting up or claiming title to the land by reason of the patent or any of the conveyances from Ward. The decree was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals. \n\n[216 U.S. 504, 507]\n\u00a0\n There are twenty-three assignments of errors, eighteen of which are addressed to rulings on evidence and five attack, in general terms, the decree canceling the patent and the conveyance by Ward. These five were alone discussed in the oral argument and in the brief on file under the following divisions:\n'1. Are the averments of the bill of complaint sufficient to give the court of equity jurisdiction?\n\n'2. Do the facts proved by the government sustain the averment that the final proof of the entryman was false, fraudulent, and untrue?\n\n'3. Will this court review decisions by the land office officials upon questions of fact?\n\n'4. Does the appellant occupy the position of an innocent purchaser, and is the government precluded because of his rights as such?'\n\n\n 1. \nTo support the first proposition it is urged that the bill does not allege the facts upon which the charge of fraud in obtaining the patent was based, and therefore 'presents no issue for trial, and should fail upon demurrer.' But there was no demurrer filed to the bill. The only answer to paragraphs 4 and 5 (set out below) was that, as to the facts of the former, the company was not advised; that, as to the facts of the latter, it had 'no knowledge,' and denied, therefore, that they were true, and demanded strict proof of them. The first and only explicit objection to the bill for insufficiency is made in the brief filed in this court. But, conceding it covered by the assignments of error discussed by counsel, and entertaining it, we think that it is without foundation. The following are its averments:\n'Your orator shows unto your honor that the said William Josiah Ward, in the commutation proof taken on the 29th day of December, 1902, alleged himself, and made it appear by the testimony of others, that he had established a residence upon said land on March 10th, 1901, and that he continuously resided thereon from that date until and up to the date of submission of final proof, except for absences on two or three \n\n[216 U.S. 504, 508]\n\u00a0\n occasions of not exceeding three months, due to the illness of his wife; that he had improved the tract by erection of a house thereon and by cultivating 1\/2 acre for two seasons, and the whole amount of improvements being alleged to be of the value of forty ($40) dollars, and that he had complied with the law entitling him to a patent to said lands.\n\n'Your orator further shows unto the court that the statement of the said Ward and the proof presented by him on the hearing for final proof was false, fraudulent, and untrue; that he did not have the improvements that he alleged that he had on said premises, and had not cultivated the said land; that the improvements accomplished on said entry consisted of nothing more than a pine-pole cabin, never completed, without floor, door, or chimney; that there was obsolutely no means of entrance or exit thereto or therefrom, unless through the uninclosed gable ends of said cabin; that the interstices between the poles of said cabin were never closed in any fashion; that the only ground on said entry which had undergone cultivation was a space within an inclosure of 30 by 35 feet; that the said Ward never resided upon said land, but during the period allowed for residence on the homestead entry, entryman actually resided at his home, where for a long time he had maintained his residence, 3 1\/2 miles distant from said entry.'\n\n Appellant relies for its contention upon United States v. Throckmorton, \n98 U.S. 61\n, 25 L. ed. 93; Vance v. Burbank, \n101 U.S. 514\n, 25 L. ed. 929; Maxwell Land-Grant Case, \n121 U.S. 325\n, 30 L. ed. 949, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1015; and other cases of like kind. We will not take the time to review them. It is enough to say that it was pointed out in United States v. Minor, \n114 U.S. 233\n, 29 L. ed. 110, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 836, that they do not apply to a case like that at bar, where the charge is that there was fraud and perjury in ex parte proceedings before the land office. See also United States v. San Jacinto Tin Co. \n125 U.S. 273\n, 31 L. ed. 747, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 850; Moffat v. United States, \n112 U.S. 24\n, 28 L. ed. 623, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 10; United States v. Iron Silver Min. Co. \n128 U.S. 673\n, 32 L. ed. 571, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 195; Colorado Coal & I. Co. v. United States, \n123 U.S. 307\n, 31 L. ed. 182, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 131; United States v. Beebe, 127 \n\n[216 U.S. 504, 509]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 338, 32 L. ed. 121, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1083; United States v. Budd, \n144 U.S. 154\n, 36 L. ed. 384, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 575; United States v. American Bell Teleph. Co. \n167 U.S. 224\n, 42 L. ed. 144, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 809.\n\n 2. \nThis division involves the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the decree. The argument at bar has not kept this division separate from the first or the first from it. They are manifestly different. The first concerns the sufficiency of the bill, this the sufficiency of the evidence. In other words, whether the evidence has established the averments of the bill, assuming them to be sufficiently specific, by clear and satisfactory proof. And it may be conceded that that is the degree of proof that the cases require. It was said in Maxwell Land-Grant Case, supra, that when a court of equity is asked to set aside a patent 'for fraud or mistake . . . the testimony on which this is done must be clear, unequivocal, and convincing, and that it cannot be done upon a bare preponderance of evidence which leaves the issue in doubt.'\n Does the case at bar fill the measure of proof required by the cases? In this inquiry we start with the finding of the two lower courts in the affirmative. Appellant attacks the finding, but, as we have said, does not keep the discussion of this inquiry separate from the consideration of the sufficiency of the bill. In both, stress is put upon the same proposition. It is contended that the allegations of the bill that the proofs submitted by Ward to the land office were fraudulent and untrue was a mere legal conclusion, and that, besides, it was solely the province of the land office officials to determine such matter, and 'thus may, in their discretion, issue patents to persons upon evidence of improvement and cultivation of greater or less value and extent, the extent in value of the improvement being solely in their discretion.' It is further argued that 'the statutes governing the disposition of the public lands required neither a limited amount of improvement nor an absolute continuous residence;' and 'that when an entryman has clearly set forth the amount of the improvements, however shall, and the Department has issued a patent thereupon, then the question of the amount or extent is forever \n\n[216 U.S. 504, 510]\n\u00a0\n put at rest.' The purpose of the law, it is further argued, 'is to give a part of the public domain to the poor man, and that therefore temporary abandonment, for the purpose of earning a livelihood or support his family, or to secure funds with which to make improvements, or on account of sickness, as in the case at bar, is permissible.' The value and amount of improvement, it is finally urged, is immaterial except to detract from the good faith of the entryman, 'and then only when accompanied with evidence of the ability of the entryman to make more improvements than in fact were made.' These tests may be accepted, arguendo, and the fraud of Ward is established.\n The averment of the bill is that he deceived the land office by false testimony of the extent of his improvements, cultivation, and residence, and secured his patent by that deception. In other words, that the judgment and discretion of the land office were invoked, not upon the actual extent of his improvements, cultivation, and residence, but upon a misrepresentation of their extent. See United States v. Minor, supra.\n It may be well here to consider what the law requires. It gives the right of entry of 160 acres of land as a homestead, upon the condition, however, which must be established by affidavit, that the 'application is honestly and in good faith made for the purpose of actual settlement and cultivation, and not for the benefit of any other person.' That applicant will honestly endeavor to comply with the requirements of settlement and cultivation, and does not apply to enter the same for the purpose of speculation. The purpose of the law, therefore, is to give a home, and, to secure the gift, the applicant must show that he has made the land a home. Five years of residence and cultivation for the term of five years he must show by two credible witnesses.\n Residence and cultivation of the land are the price that is exacted for its payment. It is in the power of the settler to modify the terms somewhat. He may substitute for a residence and cultivation for five years a residence and cultiva- \n\n[216 U.S. 504, 511]\n\u00a0\n tion for not less than fourteen months; but he must make 'proof of settlement and of residence and cultivation for such period of fourteen months,' and pay the price provided by law for the land entered. This is known as the 'commutation' of his homestead entry.\n In view of these provisions of law, we may judge of what Ward did. He entered the land as a homestead, and on the 8th of September, 1900, filed the affidavit required, stating that he made his application honestly and in good faith, for the purpose of actual cultivation and settlement, and not for the benefit of any other person. On the 29th of December, 1902, he produced two witnesses to establish his residence, cultivation, and character of his improvements, one of whom testified that he was well acquainted with Ward and the land embraced in Ward's claim; that it was 'low, piney woods land, very wet in rainy seasons.' His testimony as to Ward's residence and cultivation of the land is best exhibited by the following questions and answers:\n Q. 5. When did claimant settle upon the homestead, and at what date did he establish actual residence thereon?\n A. About the 9th of March, 1901\n\n\n ... * *\n Q. 6. Have claimant and family resided continuously on the homestead since first establishing residence thereon?\n A. I don't think they have continuously. I have seen them absent from it a time or two.\n Q. 7. For what period or periods has the settler been absent from the land since making settlement, and for what purpose; and, if temporarily absent, did claimant's family reside upon and cultivate the land during such absence?\n A. I have known of their being absent a time or two, but he has not been off of it over three months at the longest period. His wife is very feeble, and the land is so low and wet that, on account of her health, as well as to make a support, he was compelled to be absent. I presume he has been on it nearly every week. \n\n[216 U.S. 504, 512]\n\u00a0\n The other witness was even more definite. Answering a question as to the continuity of the residence of Ward and his family on the land, he said that he could not say 'whether continuous or not, have not been there all the time; they were there every time I have been there, but on one or two occasions have seen them off the land.' And further, as to the absence of Ward and his family, he said: 'I don't know exactly how long, but am satisfied they have not been absent over six months at the longest for the purpose of making a support, and on account of the land being so low and wet and unfit for cultivation.' Both witnesses gave the extent of cultivation to be 1\/2 acre for two years, and the improvement to consist of a house and garden of the value of forty or fifty dollars.\n Ward himself testified that he established his residence on the 10th of March, 1901, and that his improvement consisted of a small dwelling house and a garden of about 1\/2 acre of land, worth about $40. He testified further as follows:\n Q. 5. Of whom does your family consist? and have you and your family resided continuously on the land since first establishing residence thereon?\n A. Myself and wife. No, not continuously; that is, not every day and night.\n ... * *\n Q. 6. For what period or periods have you been absent from the homestead since making settlement, and for what purpose; and, if temporarily absent, did your family reside upon and cultivate the land during such absence?\n A. Was absent two or three times, not over three months at longest period, on account of my wife's health. She is very feeble, and the land is so low and wet that it was impossible to keep her on the place all the time.\n And he further testified that he had not sold, conveyed, or mortgaged any portion of the land. This testimony would have established, if true, that Ward, with his family, took up \n\n[216 U.S. 504, 513]\n\u00a0\n his residence on the land on the 10th of March, 1901; that his improvement consisted of a small dwelling house, fit for habitation, and a garden of 1\/2 acre, cultivated two seasons, and that, after making his settlement, he was absent only 'two or three times, not over three months,' at longest, 'on account of his (witness') health.' This was the testimony upon which the Land Department acted. What is the evidence in this case? His two sons never saw him on the land, but always saw him at his residence, 4 or 5 miles from the land. He testifies himself that he never moved his family there; that the house was built of pine poles, was 12 by 14 in dimensions, had no floor, no chimney, no 'ceiling or boards on between the poles or the interstices;' that he fenced and cultivated 'a small piece, not larger than the house,' and this was inclosed by rails and poles and planted two years. His residence upon the land is described in the following questions and answers:\n Q. Did you ever have your family there on any night? Ever spend any night with your family there?\n A. I stayed there at night myself. My wife did not go there. She was very sickly.\n Q. About how many nights in the week did you spend there?\n A. I do not think I stayed in the same week more than one night in the week.\n And there is other testimony showing that the house was unfit for habitation. A special agent of the General Land Office inspected the place. He found, he said, 'a little pole cabin, 11 X 13, not completed, and there was no door to go in and out of. There was no window, no chimney, the openings between the poles were not closed, the gable ends were not closed.' He further testified that there was no evidence of any residence or habitation there at all. And further, 'there was a little inclosure, 30 X 35 feet, a little amount that was about a quarter of a mile from the house.' This witness also testified to the conversation with Ward, in which the latter told \n\n[216 U.S. 504, 514]\n\u00a0\n him that he (Ward) had not lived on the homestead entry, and that he thought that he was going to lose it. We think that this testimony sustains the averments of the bill that the patent was obained by fraud. This is not a case where the courts are undertaking to review the decisions of the land office officials on questions of fact, nor to reverse their discretion, properly exercised. It is a case of fraud upon them, and obtaining a patent by means of that fraud.\n Does appellant occupy the position of the innocent purchaser, and is the government precluded from receiving the relief prayed for in the bill because of such fact? The answer to the question depends upon a proposition of law, and whether J. J. McCaskill had knowledge of the fraudulent acts of Ward. This knowledge was, in effect, found by both the lower courts, and giving to their finding the strength that should be accorded to it, we pass to the consideration of the proposition of law that the knowledge of J. J. McCaskill, though president of the McCaskill Company, cannot be imputed to it, because, as appellant, the argument is that while knowledge of an agent is the knowledge of the principal, an 'exception to the rule is that, if the agent is acting in a matter in which he has a personal interest, or in connection with which he is interested with a third person, the presumption is that he will not communicate the facts in controversy.' And it is urged that 'the rule should be more rigidly applied in cases of fraud or torts.' For these propositions appellant cites Clark v. Metropolitan Bank, 3 Duer, 241; Frenkel v. Hudson, 82 Ala. 162, 60 Am. Rep. 736, 2 So. 758; Allen v. South Boston R. Co. 150 Mass. 206, 5 L.R.A. 716, 15 Am. St. Rep. 185, 22 N. E. 917; Innerarity v. Merchants' Nat. Bank, 139 Mass. 332, 52 Am. Rep. 710, 1 N. E. 282; Atlantic Nat. Bank v. Harris, 118 Mass. 147; Loring v. Brodie, 134 Mass. 453; First Nat. Bank v. Christopher, 40 N. J. L. 435, 29 Am. Rep. 262.\n Undoubtedly a corporation is, in law, a person or entity entirely distinct from its stockholders and officers. It may have interest distinct from theirs. Their interests, it may be conceived, may be adverse to its interest, and hence has arisen \n\n[216 U.S. 504, 515]\n\u00a0\n against the presumption that their knowledge is its knowledge, the counter presumption that, in transactions with it, when their interest is adverse, their knowledge will not be attributed to it. But while this presumption should be enforced to protect the corporation, it should not be carried so far as to enable the corporation to become a means of fraud or a means to evade its responsibilities. A growing tendency is therefore exhibited in the courts to look beyond the corporate form to the purpose of it, and to the officers who are identified with that purpose. Illustrations are given of this in Cook on Corporations,  663, 664, and 727. The principle was enforced in this court in Simmons Creek Coal Co. v. Doran, \n142 U.S. 417\n, 35 L. ed. 1063, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 239. In that case a corporation claimed title to land through a deed of its corporators, one of whom became its president. Of the effect of this the court said: 'Associated together to carry forward a common enterprise, the knowledge or actual notice of all these corporators and the president was the knowledge or notice of the company; and, if constructive notice bound them, it bound the company.'\n The case at bar is within the principle. The bill alleges that J. J. McCaskill and Robert E. L. McCaskill were copartners and engaged in the manufacture of lumber at Freeport, Florida. They incorporated this business, it is alleged, under the laws of Florida, 'by the corporate name of J. J. McCaskill Company, with the said J. J. McCaskill as president and the said Robert E. L. McCaskill as secretary, owning a large majority of the stock of said corporation, with the entire management and control of the business and affairs of said corporation.' There is no denial of this allegation. The interest of the corporators and the corporation thus shown to be identical, not adverse, we think the ruling in Simmons Creek Coal Co. v. Doran is applicable.\n This discussion disposes of the five assignments of error which were presented at the oral argument. The other assignments of error are based on rulings upon the admission of evidence. \n\n[216 U.S. 504, 516]\n\u00a0\n These assignments are grouped by counsel in two classes: (1) one to three being based upon the action of the trial court in admitting the testimony of Antonine Paul, which we have given; (2) four to eighteen attack the ruling of the court in admitting testimony of the purchase by the company of other homestead claims.\n To support the contention that the court erred in its ruling admitting the testimony of Paul, it is urged that no foundation had been laid for it by an indication of time, place, and circumstances. The record shows that these conditions were satisfied. The witness's attention was drawn to the statement by him to Paul, and he himself testified that it was made at his dwelling house, and testified that he signed the statement.\n It is clear, therefore, that the witness was given opportunity to explain. The circumstances and occasion of making the statement were drawn to his attention and the person to whom it was made. He knew that Paul was a government agent, seeking the exact facts as to his, the witness's, settlement upon the land. He could not have underrated the importance of the relation of the statement to his testimony, and the necessity of a clear explanation of it.\n The statement was made the basis of a report to the land office, and was introduced in evidence over the objection of the company's counsel. This seems more to have been done for a connected statement of the facts than for proof of them. The facts were testified to by Paul. We cannot see that there was prejudicial error in the ruling of the court.\n The assignments of error in the second class are also without merit. The purpose of the testimony of other transactions, counsel say, was 'to show a systematic course of dealing by McCaskill, such as would support a contention that he had guilty knowledge of whatever fraud might exist in the procurement of the patent in litigation.' It is admitted that the testimony was competent for such purpose, but it is contended it should have been accompanied by evidence showing that such other transactions were false and fraudulent, and this, \n\n[216 U.S. 504, 517]\n\u00a0\n it is insisted, was not done. If so, the testimony was harmless. In other words, if the testimony was not followed up by other testimony which was necessary to give it effect, we may assume that the court below gave to it no value or probative strength. It must be kept in mind that the case was tried by the court.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","86":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJ W FRELLSEN & CO. v. CRANDELL(1910)\nNo. 129\nArgued: Decided: April 4, 1910\n\n\n\n Congress, by an act entitled, 'An Act to Aid the State of Louisiana in Draining the Swamp Lands Therein,' approved March 2, 1849 (9 Stat. at L. 352, chap. 87), granted to that state 'the whole of those swamp and may be or are found unfit for cultivation.' may be or are found unfit for chiltivation.' See also 9 Stat. at L. 519, chap. 84. In 1880, the general assembly of the state of Louisiana, by an act known as 'act 23 of 1880,' approved March 8, 1880 (La. Laws 1880, p. 25), authorized the governor of the state to institute proceedings to recover all of those lands not already conveyed to the state, or, if improperly failed to be conveyed, their value in money or government scrip, 'provided, that the state shall \n\n[217 U.S. 71, 72]\n\u00a0\n incur no cost or expense in the prosecution of the said claims other than an allowance to be made by the governor out of the lands, money, or scrip that may be recovered.' On March 20, 1880, the governor made a contract with John McEnery to recover from the United States the unconveyed balance of the lands, or their value in money or scrip, and agreed to pay him '50 per centum of the lands, money, or scrip recovered, to be paid as provided in said act 23.' It also provided: 'Where lands in kind are recovered, the compensation, as aforesaid, of the said McEnery, shall be represented in scrip or certificates, to be issued by the register of the land office of the state, and locatable upon any lands owned by the state.' A large amount of lands were recovered, and the register of the state land office issued to John McEnery certificates in terms made locatable upon and vacant land granted to the state by the act of Congress heretofore referred to. These certificates were sold and assigned by McEnery, and his assignees located them upon public lands, some of which had not been recovered by McEnery under his contract. To some of the assignees patents were thereafter issued, while others held simply certificates of location. By act 106 of 1888 (La. Laws 1888, p. 171), act 23 of 1880 was repealed, and by  2 of the repealing act it was provided 'that the act or agreement made between Louis A. Wiltz, governor of the state, and John McEnery, made March 20, 1880, purporting to be under the authority of said act No. 23, is hereby abrogated and terminated.' This repealing act took effect January 1, 1889. By act No. 125, approved July 8, 1902 (La. Laws 1902, p. 209), it was provided that the swamp and overflowed lands donated by Congress to the state should be subject to entry and sale at the rate of $ 1.50 per acre. On July 7, 1906, the legislature passed act No. 85 of 1906 ( La. Laws 1906, p. 141), declaring 'that present holders and owners of patents for public lands, issued by the state of Louisiana, their heirs, assignees, or transferees, shall be confirmed as applicants for said lands, from the date of the issuance of said patents, where the said patents \n\n[217 U.S. 71, 73]\n\u00a0\n were not paid for in money, but were paid for by certificates or warrants for scrip, which were not legally receivable in payment for such patents, and authorizing such present holders and owners, their heirs, assignees, or transferees, of said patents, to validate and perfect their title to the lands covered by said patents, or to any part or subdivision of such lands, within one year from date of passage of this act, by paying therefor, in cash, the price of $1.50 per acre.' The act further provided that upon payment of such amount 'the said patents shall be valid and legal for all purposes, as if payment therefor had been made in cash at the date of their issuance.'\n Petitioners, claiming that the location of these certificates upon lands not recovered by McEnery, and the issuance of patents therefor, were illegal, tendered on March 28, 1905, to the proper officers, $1.50 per acre for a large body of lands which were covered by these certificates and patents. They demanded that warrants should be issued to them for the lands, which was refused. On July 11, 1906, they filed their petition in the twenty-second judicial district court for the parish of East Baton Rouge, state of Louisiana, averring that they were the first and only applicants for said lands under the provisions of said act No. 125 of 1902, or of any other law of the state since the date of the issuance of said illegal certificates and patents, and that, by making the legal tender, they became vested with the right to acquire said lands.\n The district court sustained the exception of no cause of action, and entered judgment dismissing the suit. This judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the state (120 La. 712, 45 So. 558), and from that court was brought here on writ of error.\n Messrs. P. M. Milner and H. G. Morgan for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[217 U.S. 71, 74]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. Blance Monroe, R. G. Pleasant, A. P. Pujo, Bernard Titche, Leland H. Moss, Wynne G. Rogers, C. D. Moss, C. A. McCoy, R. L. Knox, E. D. Miller, Harry H. Hall, Monte M. Lemann, and Walter Guion for defendants in error.\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 71, 75]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court, after reading the following memorandum:\n This opinion, including the preliminary statement, was prepared by our Brother Brewer, and had been approved before his lamented death. It was recirculated and again agreed to, and is adopted as the opinion of the court.\n Petitioners contend that by their tender they made a contract with the state for a conveyance of the lands in controversy; that this contract was broken, and that they were deprived of their rights thereunder by the legislation of the state and the action of its officers in pursuance thereof; that thus a Federal question arises under art. 1,  10, of the Constitution of the United States, which forbids a state to pass a 'law impairing the obligation of contracts.' Their argument is briefly this: The lands were not obtained by McEnery under his contract with the state; the statute authorizing that contract provided that his payment should be solely out of the lands obtained by him from the United States. Notwithstanding this limitation, certificates were issued to him authorizing location upon any lands included within the grant of Congress by the act of 1849, and they were in fact located upon the lands in controversy,-lands which were not obtained by McEnery; that this location, even when followed by patent, did not segregate these lands from the public domain of the state, and they remained therefore open to purchase by anyone complying with the statutes; that petitioners were the first and only parties who tendered to the state the prescribed price; that thereby they acquired a vested right to a conveyance by the state of the legal title.\n But it is not contended that the patents were not signed by the proper officers and in due form to convey the title of the state to the patentees. It is not suggested that McEnery received any greater amount of lands than he was entitled to receive under his contract, and it does not appear from the \n\n[217 U.S. 71, 76]\n\u00a0\n record that the patents, on their face, disclosed any invalidity in the title conveyed. While an examination of the records would, if the facts stated in the petition are true, show that they were improperly issued, yet this could be ascertained only by looking beyond the face of the patent. Now, whether the patents were wrongfully issued or could be set aside was a matter to be settled between the state and the patentee. The state undoubtedly received something, for the acceptance of every McEnery certificate released the state pro tanto from its obligation under the contract to McEnery. Whether it should remain satisfied with that payment or not was for the state to determine. If it were not satisfied, it could take proper proceedings to set aside the patent, but no individual was authorized to act for the state.\n The rule in respect to the administration of the public domain of the United States is well settled. In Doolan v. Carr, \n125 \nU.S. 618, 624\n, 31 S. L. ed. 844, 846, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1228, 1231, Mr. Justice Miller said:\n'There is no question as to the principle that where the officers of the government have issued a patent in due form of law, which, on its face, is sufficient to convey the title to the land described in it, such patent is to be treated as valid in actions at law, as distinguished from suits in equity, subject, however, at all times, to the inquiry whether such officers had the lawful authority to make a conveyance of the title. But it those officers acted without authority, if the land which they purported to convey had never been within their control, or had been withdrawn from that control at the time they undertook to exercise such authority, then their act was void,-void for want of power in them to act on the subject-matter of the patent, nor merely voidable; in which latter case, if the circumstances justified such a decree, a direct proceeding, with proper averments and evidence, would be required to establish that it was voidable, and should therefore be avoided.'\n\n In Hastings & D. R. Co. v. Whitney, \n132 \nU.S. 357, 363\n, 33 S. L. ed. 363, 366, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 112, 114, Mr. Justice Lamar, who had been Secretary of the \n\n[217 U.S. 71, 77]\n\u00a0\n Interior, discussed the question of a homestead entry, and, after referring to Kansas P. R. Co. v. Dunmeyer, \n113 U.S. 629\n, 28 L. ed. 1122, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 566, added:\n'Counsel for plaintiff in error contends that the case just cited has no application to the one we are now considering, the difference being that in that case the entry existing at the time of the location of the road was an entry valid in all respects, while the entry in this case was invalid on its face and in its inception; and that this entry, having been made by an agent of the applicant, and based upon an affidavit which failed to show the settlement and improvement required by law, was, on its face, not such a proceeding in the proper land office as could attach even an inchoate right to the land.\n\n'We do not think this contention can be maintained. Under the homestead law three things are needed to be done in order to constitute an entry on public lands. . . . If either one of these integral parts of an entry is defective, that is, if the affidavit be insufficient in its showing, or if the application itself is informal, or if the payment is not made in actual cash, the register and receiver are justified in rejecting the application. But if, notwithstanding these defects, the application is allowed by the land officers, and a certificate of entry is delivered to the applicant, and the entry is made of record, such entry may be afterwards canceled on account of these defects by the Commissioner, or, on appeal, by the Secretary of the Interior; or, as is often the practice, the entry may be suspended, a hearing ordered, and the party notified to show by supplemental proof a full compliance with the requirements of the Department; and on failure to do so, the entry may then be canceled. But these defects, whether they be of form or substance, by no means render the entry absolutely a nullity. So long as it remains a subsisting entry of record, whose legality has been passed upon by the land authorities, and their action remains unreversed, it is such an appropriation of the tract as segregates if from the public domain, and therefore precludes it from subsequent grants.' \n\n[217 U.S. 71, 78]\n\u00a0\n In Re Emblen, \n161 \nU.S. 52, 56\n, 40 S. L. ed. 613, 616, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 487, 488, Mr. Justice Gray thus stated the law:\n\n'After the patent has once been issued, the original contest is no longer within the jurisdiction of the Land Department. The patent conveys the legal title to the patentee, and cannot be revoked or set aside, except upon judicial procedings instituted in behalf of the United States. The only remedy of Emblen is by bill in equity to charge Weed with a trust in his favor. All this is clearly settled by previous decisions of this court, including some of those on which the petitioner most relies. Johnson v. Towsley, 13 Wall. 72, 20 L. ed. 485; Moore v. Rob. \n96 U.S. 530\n, 24 L. ed. 848; Marquez v. Frisbie, \n101 U.S. 473\n, 25 L. ed. 800; St. Louis Smelting & Ref. Co. v. Kemp, \n104 U.S. 636\n, 26 L. ed. 875; Steel v. St. Louis Smelting & Ref.

Rep. 460.\n Obviously, in this case the supreme court of Louisiana followed the practice obtaining in respect to the public lands of the United States. But if it had not, and had declared simply the law of the state of Louisiana, its decision would doubtless be controlling on this court, for, in the matter of the sale and conveyance of lands belonging to the public, no one state is obliged to follow the legislation or decisions of another state, or even those of the United States, but may administer its public lands in any way that it sees fit, so long as it does not conflict with rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.\n Counsel criticize the opinion of the supreme court of Louisiana, in that it speaks of all the lands as having gone to patent, while it is said in the petition that some of the assignees 'stood upon the certificates.' Whether the language of the petition technically justifies the construction placed upon it by the supreme court of the state is immaterial. Certainly, there is no naming of any single tract as covered by certificate alone, and not patented, and if any tract was held under a certificate of location, it was, within the scope of the rul- \n\n[217 U.S. 71, 79]\n\u00a0\n ing of the supreme court, not subject to other entry or purchase.\n We see no error in the ruling of the Supreme Court, and its judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","87":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJAVIERRE v. CENTRAL ALTAGRACIA(1910)\nNo. 171\nArgued: April 26, 1910Decided: May 16, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles Hartzell and Manuel Rodriguez Serra for appellants.[ Javierre v. Central Altagracia \n217 U.S. 502\n (1910) ]\n\n\n[217 U.S. 502, 504]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Hugo Kohlman, F. L. Cornwell, and N. B. K. Pettingill for appellee.\n\n\n[217 U.S. 502, 506]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an appeal from a decree enjoining the appellants from delivering sugar cane grown on the haciendas Florentina and Estero to the Central Eureka for the term of five crops, beginning with the crop of the year 1906-7, or so long within that term as the appellee is ready to grind and pay for the same; and also from 'selling, donating, renting, or mortgaging said haciendas,' without stipulating for the carrying out of a contract made with the appellee. The contract referred to bound the appellants to have the cane grown on the haciendas ground at the sugar factory of the appellee for the term just stated, at a certain price, with mutual agreements, not necessary to set forth, but, so far as appears, fair, and made upon equal terms. It was subject to a proviso, however, that if, on January 15, 1908, the projected Eureka Central should have been erected, or should be in course of construction, the appellants might cancel the contract, giving notice on October 1, 1907. The notice was given, but the appellee contended that the Eureka Central referred to was abandoned, and that the central relied upon as the ground for the notice was one got up by the appellants, and named Eureka, with a view to getting out of their contract with the appellee.\n The findings of fact are not entirely satisfactory upon the point in issue. They set out evidence and avoid a conclusion more definite than that which we shall state. It appears, however, that for some years one Swift had been negotiating for the construction of a Central Eureka, and was continuing his efforts on December 10, 1906, when the contract was made. But in October, 1906, Javierre had telegraphed to him that negotiations with him were at an end, and there was evidence that Javierre and others had met and made an agreement on October 20 to form a corporation to set up the 'said central,' to be called the Central Eureka, 'it being almost sure' that Swift had failed. The parties were to sell their cane to this \n\n[217 U.S. 502, 507]\n\u00a0\n central for ten years. The court studiously avoids finding that this agreement was made, but does find that if Javierre signed it, he did not consider himself bound by it, and, as has been seen, the contract with the appellee was of later date. The court also finds that it was not generally known that the planters had held the alleged meeting, or were contemplating the erection of the central, and, after stating other details, finds that the appellants have not proved, by a preponderance of evidence, that the contract referred to the Central Eureka started by them, or that the Central Eureka mentioned was other than the one projected by Swift. It ruled that the burden of proof was on the appellants, and thereupon made the decree.\n There is some preliminary argument that the finding concerning the continuance of Swift's efforts is not warranted by the pleadings. If this were true, no objection seems to have been made in the court below, where no doubt an amendment would have been allowed, if necessary. But it is a mistake. The bill merely alleges that Swift's arrangement failed 'during the latter part' of 1906, and qualifies even this by the further allegation that, in the beginning of December, Javierre stated to the officers of the complainant (appellee) that he was still bound to Swift, but that the thing had failed, and that he was disposed to make a contract with them if he could have a clause providing for the case of Swift's success. The only real questions concern the ruling on the burden of proof and the propriety of the relief in such a case as this.\n As to the burden of proof, if that really in any way determined the result, the ruling was correct. The appellants were seeking to escape from the contract made by them on the ground of a condition subsequent, embodied in a proviso. It was for them to show that the facts of the condition had come to pass. It is said that the bill alleges affirmatively a conspiracy to evade the undertaking, but that is merely by way of replication to the answer setting up the condition, and is nothing but a specific mode of denying that the condition had \n\n[217 U.S. 502, 508]\n\u00a0\n been fulfilled. An allegation of fact that is material only as an indirect negative of something to be proved by the other party does not shift the burden of proof. Starratt v. Mullen, 148 Mass. 570, 2 L.R.A. 697, 20 N. E. 178. So there is nothing but the general question to be considered, and that is answered by the statement of it, and by repeated decisions of this court. When a proviso like this carves an exception out of the body of a statute or contract, those who set up such exception must prove it. Schlemmer v. Buffalo, R. & P. R. Co. \n205 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, 51 S. L. ed. 681, 685, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 407; Ryan v. Carter, \n93 U.S. 78\n, 23 L. ed. 807; United States v. Cook, 17 Wall. 168, 21 L. ed. 538; United States v. Dickson, 15 Pet. 141, 165, 10 L. ed. 689. Therefore, it was for the appellants to prove that the central referred to by the contract had been built or started. It was not enough to prove that a central had been built and called by the same name.\n The doubt as to the relief granted below is more serious, and, in the opinion of the majority of the court, must prevail. According to that opinion, a suit for damages would have given adequate relief, and therefore the appellee should have been confined to its remedy at law. Again, the court would not undertake to decree specific performance and to require and to supervise the raising of the crop and the grinding of the sugar, for even the now remaining period of the decree. There is a certain anomaly in granting the half-way relief of an injunction against disposing of the crops elsewhere when the court is not prepared to enforce the performance to accomplish which indirectly is the only object of the negative decree. There is, too, a want of mutuality in the remedy, whatever that objection may amount to, as it is hard to see how an injunction could have been granted against the appellee had the case been reversed. Rutland Marble Co. v. Ripley, 10 Wall. 339, 19 L. ed. 955. Notwithstanding these considerations, I should have preferred to affirm the decree, but, as my reasons have been stated to my brethren, and have not prevailed, it is unnecessary to repeat them now.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","88":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJENNINGS v.

McKenney, John Spalding Flannery, and William Hitz for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Lurton delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case turns primarily upon the question of whether the supreme court of the District exceeded its jurisdic- \n\n[218 U.S. 255, 256]\n\u00a0\n tion in allowing a bill of exceptions after the close of the term at which the judgment sought to be reversed had become final. The judgment was rendered on December 20, 1907. The term closed December 31st, and a new term began on January 1, 1908. On January 10, 1908 an appeal bond was approved and filed. On January 14th the appellant, having given eight days' notice, under rule 55 of the court, presented a bill of exceptions to the court for allowance. The stipulation in respect of this recites: 'In pursuance of common-law rule No. 55, counsel for the appellee was present, having received the eight-day notice, together with a copy of appellant's proposed bill of exceptions, required by said rule. The proposed bill of exceptions was submitted to the court by counsel for the appellant in the presence of, and without objection from, counsel for the appellee.'\n Common-law rule 55, under which the appellant claimed the right to have his bill of exceptions filed within thirty-eight days after the rendition of the judgment, was applicable only so long as the judgment term was running, and did not operate to extend the power of the trial judge over the record beyond the term. No order had been made in term time for the filing of such a delayed bill. Not only had the term closed, but an appeal had been allowed and perfected. The trial court had thereby lost control of the cause, and had no authority to add to or take from the record.\n In Michigan Ins. Co. v. Eldred, \n143 \nU.S. 293, 298\n, 36 S. L. ed. 162, 163, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 450, 452, this court said:\n'By the uniform course of decision, no exceptions to rulings at a trial can be considered by this court unless they were taken at the trial, and were also embodied in a formal bill of exceptions presented to the judge at the same term, or within a further time allowed by order entered at that term, or by standing rule of court, or by consent of parties; and, save under very extraordinary circum- \n\n[218 U.S. 255, 257]\n\u00a0\n stances, they must be allowed by the judge and filed with the clerk during the same term. After the term has expired, without the court's control over the case being reserved by standing rule or special order, and especially after a writ of error has been entered in this court, all authority of the court below to allow a bill of exceptions then first presented, or to alter or amend a bill of exceptions already allowed and filed, is at an end.'\n\n See also Morse v. Anderson, \n150 U.S. 156\n, 37 L. ed. 1037, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 43; Muller v. Ehlers, \n91 U.S. 249\n, 23 L. ed. 319; Merchants's Ins. Co. v. Buckner (C. C. A. 6th C.) 39 C. C. A. 19, 98 Fed. 222.\n But it is urged that if the appellee consented that an order might be entered nuncpro tunc, permitting the filing and allowance of a bill of exceptions, such consent should be given the force of an order in term or a rule of court. But if this be granted, the order in this case does not profess to have been founded upon consent. The stipulation recites that the proposed bill was presented to the court 'in the presence of, and without objection from, counsel for the appellee.'\n The proceeding was coram non judice. Appellee was not in court or before a court. The judge and the court had lost all power over the cause, the parties, and the record. The appellant was pretending to proceed under rule 55. The appellee might well sit silent and let the matter rest upon the claim; it was not asked to say whether it consented. A different case might arise if, by its failure to object, the appellant had been misled to his injury. But there was nothing left undone which might have been done, and nothing done to his prejudice. The plain question was, Did the court have power, under rule 55, or under any order of the court or controlling practice, to allow a bill of exceptions after the close of the term? The appellee might fairly say nothing.\n So grave a matter as the allowance of a bill of exceptions after the close of the term and after the court had lost \n\n[218 U.S. 255, 258]\n\u00a0\n all judicial power over the record should not rest upon a mere implication from silence. There should be express consent, or conduct which should equitably estop the opposite party from denying that he had consented. There was nothing of that kind in this case, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","89":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKENYON v.

Beall for defendants in error.\n\n\n[218 U.S. 281, 285]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This action was brought in 1894, in the circuit court of Grundy county, state of Missouri, to set aside a deed of real property made by James H. Kerfoot to the First National Bank of Trenton, Missouri, and also a deed by which that bank purported to convey the same property to the defendants Hervey Kerfoot, Alwilda Kerfoot, and Lester R. Kerfoot, and for the recovery of possession. The plaintiffs in the action, which was brought shortly after the death of James H. Kerfoot, were Homer Hall, administrator of his estate, and Robert Earl Kerfoot, his infant grandson, who claimed to be his only heir at law, and sued by Homer Hall as next friend. The petition contained two counts, one in equity, the other in ejectment. Upon the trial, the circuit court found the issues for defendants, and the judgment in their favor was affirmed by the supreme court of Missouri. 145 Mo. 418, 46 S. W. 1000. On his coming of age, Robert Earl Kerfoot sued out this writ of error.\n The plaintiff in error challenges the conveyance made by James H. Kerfoot to the bank, upon the ground that under  5137 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3460), \n\n[218 U.S. 281, 286]\n\u00a0\n relating to national banks, the bank was without power to take the property, and hence that no title passed by the deed, but that it remained in the grantor, and descended to the plaintiff in error as his heir at law. It appears that the deed, which was absolute in form, with warranty, and expressing a substantial consideration, was executed in pursuance of an arrangement by which the title to the property was to be held in trust, to be conveyed upon the direction of the grantor; and the supreme court of Missouri decided that a trust was in fact declared by the grantor in favor of Hervey, Alwilda, and Lester R. Kerfoot, to whom ran a quitclaim deed, which he prepared and forwarded to the bank, to be signed and acknowledged by it and then returned to him.\n But while the purpose of this transaction was not one of those described in the statute for which a national bank may purchase and hold real estate, it does not follow that the deed was a nullity, and that it failed to convey title to the property.\n In the absence of a clear expression of legislative intention to the contrary, a conveyance of real estate to a corporation for a purpose not authorized by its charter is not void, but voidable, and the sovereign alone can object. Neither the grantor nor his heirs nor third persons can impugn it upon the ground that the grantee has exceeded its powers. Smith v. Sheeley, 12 Wall. 358, 20 L. ed. 430; Union Nat. Bank v. Matthews, \n98 U.S. 621\n, 25 L. ed. 188; National Bank v. Whitney, \n103 U.S. 99\n, 26 L. ed. 443; Reynolds v. First Nat. Bank, \n112 U.S. 405\n, 28 L. ed. 733, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 213; Fritts v. Palmer, \n132 U.S. 282\n, 33 L. ed. 317, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 93; Leazure v. Hillegas, 7 Serg. & R. 313. Thus, although the statute by clear implication forbids a national bank from making a loan upon real estate, the security is not void, and it cannot be successfully assailed by the debtor or by subsequent mortgagees because the bank was without authority to take it; and the disregard of the provisions of the act of Congress upon that subject only lays the bank open to proceedings \n\n[218 U.S. 281, 287]\n\u00a0\n by the government for exercising powers not conferred by law. Union Nat. Bank v. Matthews and National Bank v. Whitney, supra; Swope v. Leffingwell, \n105 U.S. 3\n, 26 L. ed. 939.\n In Union Nat. Bank v. Matthews, supra, viewing that case in this aspect, the court said:\n'The opinion of the supreme court of Missouri assumes that the loan was made upon real-estate security within the meaning of the statute, and their judgment is founded upon that view. These things render it proper to consider the case in that aspect. But, conceding them to be as claimed, the consequence insisted upon by no means necessarily follows. The statute does not declare such a security void. It is silent upon the subject. If Congress so meant, it would have been easy to say so; and it is hardly to be believed that this would not have been done, instead of leaving the question to be settled by the uncertain result of litigation and judicial decision. Where usurious interest is contracted for, a forfeiture is prescribed and explicitly defined.\n\n ... * *\n'Where a corporation is incompetent by its charter to take a title to real estate, a conveyance to it is not void, but only voidable, and the sovereign alone can object. It is valid until assailed in a direct proceeding instituted for that purpose. Leazure v. Hillegas, supra; Goundie v. Northampton Water Co. 7 Pa. 233; Runyan v. Coster, 14 Pet. 122, 10 L. ed. 382; Banks v. Poitiaux, 3 Rand. (Va.) 136, 15 Am. Dec. 706; McIndoe v. St. Louis, 10 Mo. 577. See also Union Gold-Min. Co. v. Rocky Mountain Nat. Bank, \n96 U.S. 640\n, 24 L. ed. 648.'\n\n This rule, while recognizing the authority of the government to which the corporation is amenable, has the salutary effect of assuring the security of titles and of avoiding the injurious consequences which would otherwise result. In the present case a trust was declared, and this trust should not be permitted to fail and the property \n\n[218 U.S. 281, 288]\n\u00a0\n to be diverted from those for whom it was intended, by treating the conveyance to the bank as a nullity, in the absence of a clear statement of legislative intent that it should be so regarded.\n The cases in this court which are relied upon by the plaintiff in error are not applicable to the facts here presented, and are in no way inconsistent with the doctrine to which we have referred. McCormick v. Market Nat. Bank, \n165 U.S. 538\n, 41 L. ed. 817, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 433; California Nat. Bank v. Kennedy, \n167 U.S. 362\n, 42 L. ed. 198, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 831; First Nat. Bank v. Hawkins, \n174 U.S. 364\n, 43 L. ed. 1007, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 739.\n It was also urged by the plaintiff in error that the deed was not accepted by the bank, and was inoperative for that reason. The supreme court of Missouri held upon the evidence that it was accepted, and this court, on a question of that character, does not review the findings of fact which have been made in the state court. Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas, \n212 U.S. 86\n, 53 L. ed. 417, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 220; Egan v. Hart, \n165 U.S. 188\n, 41 L. ed. 680, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 300; Clipper Min. Co. v.

MUSSELMAN GROCER CO.(1910)\nNo. 149\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. G. M. Valentine, E. L. Hamilton, \n\n[217 U.S. 461, 462]\n\u00a0\n G. W. Bridgman, and E. B.

Quinby for defendant in error.\n\n\n[217 U.S. 461, 469]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case involves the inquiry whether act No. 223 of the Public Acts of the state of Michigan of the year 1905, commonly known as the 'sales-in- bulk act,' is repugnant to the 14th Amendment. The act is copied in bthe margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[217 U.S. 461, 470]\n\u00a0\n The controversy thus arose: Early in the year 1906, Frank B. Ford operated a store in the village of Berrien Springs, Michigan, consisting of various departments,-hardware, grocery, meat market, and furniture department, and buggies and machinery department. Prior to May 23, 1906, Ford made sale of the stock included in the buggies and machinery department. On the day mentioned, plaintiff in error, after taking an inventory of the stock in the grocery department, valuing it at cost, less 10 per cent, purchased the same for $2,100, deducting an indebtedness due from Ford of $415.45, and paying the balance in cash. In making purchase, the requirements of the sales-in bulk act referred to were not complied with in any particular. After the sale, Ford still owned the meat market, worth between eight hundred and a thousand dollars, and the stock of hardware, worth between five and six thousand dollars. He afterwards sold the stock of hardware for about forty-one hundred dollars, and on such \n\n[217 U.S. 461, 471]\n\u00a0\n sale the requirements of the sales-in-bulk act were complied with. The meat market was also disposed of, and in February, 1907, bankruptcy proceedings were commenced against Ford, with what result the record does not disclose.\n After the sale of the stock of the grocery department to Kidd, Dater , & Price Company, plaintiff in error, the Musselman Grocer Company, defendant in error, sued Ford upon an account, and joined as garnishee the Kidd, Dater & Price Company, upon the theory that the latter company incurred a liability to respond as garnishees for the property acquired from Ford, because of noncompliance with the requirements of the act in question. Upon the trial it was contended by counsel for Kidd, Dater, & Price Company that, if valid, the statute did not authorize garnishment proceedings for its enforcement, and that the act was invalid because repugnant both to the Constitution of the state and to the Constitution of the United States. The last contention, with which alone we are concerned, was thus expressed:\n'The act violates  1 of the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution, which provides that no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.'\n\n The trial court held the contentions as to the proper construction of the statute and its constitutionality to be without merit, and, by direction, a verdict was returned for the plaintiff, upon which judgment was duly entered. Upon appeal, the supreme court of Michigan affirmed the judgment. 151 Mich. 478, 115 N. W. 409. It held the sales-in-bulk act to be constitutional, without discussion, upon the authority of a previous decision (Spurr v. Travis, 145 Mich. 721, 116 Am. St. Rep. 330, 108 N. W. 1090, 9 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 250), and further decided that the failure to comply with the act made the sale by Ford to Kidd, Dater, & Price Company void as to creditors, and that the plaintiff in garnishment was entitled to avail of the gar- \n\n[217 U.S. 461, 472]\n\u00a0\n nishment provisions of the compiled laws of the state. This writ of error was then prosecuted.\n The errors assigned embody the proposition that the sales-in-bulk act in question was not a valid exercise of the police powers of the state, and is hence repugnant to the 14th Amendment, because wanting in due process of law and denying the equal protection of the laws. Substantially the same arguments are urged as were presented in Lemieux v. Young, \n211 U.S. 489\n, 53 L. ed. 295, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174, decided after this writ of error was sued out. In the Lemieux Case the validity of legislation of the general character of that embodied in the Michigan statute was passed on. The Connecticut law, the constitutionality of which was particularly involved, was held to be a valid exercise of the police power of the state, and not to be repugnant to the due process or equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment, although it avoided, as against creditors, sales by retail dealers in commodities of their entire stock at a single transaction, and not in the regular course of business, unless notice of intention to make such sale was recorded seven days before its consummation. The opinion in that case thus concluded:\n'As the subject to which the statute relates was clearly within the police powers of the state, the statute cannot be held to be repugnant to the due-process clause of the 14th Amendment, because of the nature or character of the regulations which the statute embodies, unless it clearly appears that those regulations are so beyond all reasonable relation to the subject to which they are applied as to amount to mere arbitrary usurpation of power. Booth v. Illinois, \n184 U.S. 425\n, 46 L. ed. 623, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 425. This, we think, is clearly not the case. So, also, as the statute makes a classification based upon a reasonable distinction, and one which, as we have seen, has been generally applied in the exertion of the police power over the subject, there is no foundation for the proposition that the result of the enforcement of the statute will be to deny the equal protection of the laws.'\n\n These principles are decisive against the contentions made \n\n[217 U.S. 461, 473]\n\u00a0\n in this case, as we do not find in the provisions of the Michigan statute, when compared with the Connecticut statute, such differences as would warrant us in holding that the regulations of the Michigan statute are so beyond all reasonable relation to the subject to which they are applied as to amount to mere arbitrary usurpation of power. The purpose of both statutes is the same; vix., to prevent the defrauding of creditors by the secret sale of substantially all of a merchant's stock of goods in bulk, and both require notice of such sale, and make void as to creditors a sale without notice. The differences between the two statutes are pointed out by counsel in a summary which we excerpt in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[217 U.S. 461, 474]\n\u00a0\n It is apparent, we think, from this summary, that the statutes are alike fundamentally, and differ only in minor and incidental provisions. In some respects the Michigan law is more comprehensive than the Connecticut law, as the latter law was limited to retail merchants, while the Michigan law affects wholesalers as well as retailers. The requirement of the Michigan law, that a full and detailed inventory shall be made, does not seem to us to be oppressive and arbitrary, as, in bona fide purchases of stocks of goods in bulk, a careful purchaser is solicitous to demand such an inventory, and in the purchase in question an inventory was in fact made. Nor can we say, in view of the ruling in the Lemieux Case, to the effect that a state may, without violating the Constitution of the United States, require that creditors be constructively notified of the proposed sale of a stock of goods in bulk, that a requirement for what is in effect actual notice to each creditor is so unreasonable as to be a mere arbitrary exertion of power, beyond the authority of the legislature to exert. We do not deem it necessary to further pursue the subject, as we think it clearly results, from the ruling in Lemieux v. Young, that the Michigan statute in no way offends against the Constitution of the United States, and therefore that the court below was right in so deciding.\nAFFIRMED.\n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 1.

STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA(1910)\nNo. 445\nArgued: Decided: January 31, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. Hannis Taylor, Maynard F. Stiles, and John G. Carlisle for plaintiff in error. \n\n[216 U.S. 92, 93]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John F. Dillon, C. W. Campbell, Frank Cox, Harry Hubbard, Edward C. Lyon, Malcolm Jackson, John A. Sheppard.\n Wells Goodykoontz, James F. Brown, William R. Lilly, and William G. Conley for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n These writs of error are taken in a suit by the state of West Virginia, brought in May, 1894, for the sale of so much of a tract of 500, 000 acres of land granted to Robert Morris in 1795 as is within the state and liable to be sold for the benefit of the school fund. See 64 W. Va. 545, 63 S. E. 495; id. 546, 584, 63 S. E. 468; id. 610, 63 S. E. 495. The Constitution of the state provides as follows: 'It shall be the duty of every owner of land to have it entered on the land books of the county in which it, or a part of it, is situated, and to cause himself to be charged with the taxes thereon and pay the same. When for any five successive years after the year 1869, the owner of any tract of land containing 1,000 acres or more, shall not have been charged on such books with state tax on said land, then, by operation hereof, the land shall be forfeited and the title thereto vest in the state.' Art. 13,  6. By chapter 105 of the Code of the state, as amended by the act of February 23, 1893, chap. 24, a suit like the present is to be brought by the state for the sale of land so forfeited, and the former owner is to receive the surplus proceeds if he files a petition and proves title, or, if he prefers, may redeem. Further details are stated in King v. Mullins, \n171 U.S. 404\n, 43 L. ed. 214, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 925, where the validity of the system \n\n[216 U.S. 92, 94]\n\u00a0\n created by the Constitution and statute referred to was considered and maintained in a suit concerning this same tract. See also King v. Panther Lumber Co. \n171 U.S. 437\n, 43 L. ed. 227, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 573; Swann v. West Virginia, \n188 U.S. 739\n, 47 L. ed. 677, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 848.\n These provisions being in the interest of actual settlement in the country, the Constitution also provides that all titles of the state to forfeited lands, etc., not redeemed or redeemable, shall be vested in any person, other than the one in default, his heirs or devisees, for so much thereof as he shall have held for ten years under color of title, having paid taxes on the same for any five of the ten years, with ulterior provisions if there be no such person. The statute further provides for bringing in parties interested, and enacts that land already sold under the statute, on which taxes since have been regularly paid, or land transferred by the Constitution, shall be dismissed from the suit, and thus exempts it both from sale in that suit and from the redemption incident to the proceedings for a sale. 6. The redemption allowed is only from the title still remaining in the state, and does not affect titles under previous sales or the Constitution; the petitioner acquires no other title than that which was vested in him immediately before forfeiture.  17. By  20, the bar of the final decree is limited in accord with these provisions of  17.\n After the bill in this case had been filed and several times amended, the plaintiff in error, King, answered, in June, 1896, setting up title to the 500,000 acres, charging that the statute which attempts to work out a forfeiture of land etc., is contrary to the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, but asking 'if it would be adjudged that said tract of land is forfeited to the state of West Virginia by reason of the nonassessment thereof,' etc., that a decree be made allowing him to redeem. The answer also set out a very long list of claims to parcels of the tract, and charged that the persons making them should be made parties defendant to the bill. There were parties intervening at this stage, but they do not seem to need notice. The case was sent to a commissioner, who found, \n\n[216 U.S. 92, 95]\n\u00a0\n among other things, that about 10,000 acres of the land were not subject to junior claims, and that the taxes and interest were $2,195.65. On his report coming in, King paid $3,090.08 for taxes and costs, and thereupon, on September 30, 1897, a decree was entered declaring that King 'has the right, superior to all others, to redeem said land so far as the record in this case shows,' and that the portion of the land lying in West Virginia, 'so far as the title thereto is in said state,' which portion is adjudged to be bounded as set forth in the decree, 'is hereby, by the said Henry C. King, fully redeemed; and all forfeitures of said land, and taxes and interest heretofore charged or chargeable thereon, are hereby released and discharged.' 'But it is provided that this redemption shall not affect the rights of any person not party to this suit may have, if any, under the provisions of  3, article 13, of the Constitution of the state of West Virginia, such rights and claims not being in any manner adjudged or determined hereby.' In fact, whatever it said, the decree could not grant a redemption affecting anybody's right but that of the state. The rights of purchasers at court sales and transferees under the Constitution are protected by  17 of the act of 1893, as pointed out by the supreme court of appeals. 64 W. Va. 590, 599, 63 S. E. 468.\n The state appealed in October, 1898, to the supreme court of appeals, and on February 7, 1900, the decree 'in so far as it allows the appellee, Henry C. King, to redeem the land described in this decree by reason of the payment of the sum of $3,090.08, costs, taxes, and interest as fixed by the circuit court, and in so far as it ascertains such costs, taxes, and interest,' was reversed and in all other respects affirmed. The cause was ordered to be remanded with directions to permit King to amend his petition so as to carefully describe and accurately locate the portion of said land he desired to redeem. 47 W. Va. 437, 35 S. E. 30. A little later in the same year (1900) the state submitted a fifth amended bill, making the persons mentioned in King's answer as having interest in the \n\n[216 U.S. 92, 96]\n\u00a0\n tract parties, and asked the directions of the court, King now, contrary to his answer above stated, protesting, on the ground of the above- mentioned decree. The bill was ordered to be filed, and in March, 1901, King filed an amended answer and petition, stating that he had not been able in the time allowed to define all the land, but that he did there give a careful description of certain portions upon which he desired to pay such future sum as was properly chargeable thereon. Schedules were set forth and the prayer was to be permitted to pay the sum properly chargeable upon the land above described and to be described in a supplemental petition.\n In many instances the land claimed by the newly joined parties was dismissed without controversy from the suit, as subject neither to sale nor to redemption under the Constitution and laws. In others, the land claimed was within the boundaries established by the above-mentioned decree of September 30, 1897, but was alleged to be outside the true lines of the Morris grant, the correctness of the decree being denied. And again, claims inconsistent with King's right to redeem, that were not admitted by him, were set up on the footing of purchases from the state. On July 5, 1901, the case was referred to a commissioner to report, among other things, the quantity, description, and location of the portions of the Morris grant and other land concerned, to which the title then remained in the state, and which was subject to sale. On July 14, King answered the answers of some of the new parties, claiming portions of the land. In September, he applied for a prohibition against the proceeding in the county court, which was denied on the ground that the court had jurisdiction, and that, if it made a mistacke, it would be only error to be corrected in the usual way. King v. Doolittle, 51 W. Va. 91, 41 S. E. 145. The commissioner proceeded to take evidence, King being represented at the hearing, and this lasted until April 6, 1903, when the report was filed. On December 6, 1905, the court made a decree establishing very different boundaries from those fixed by the decree of September 30, 1897, and cutting down the Morris \n\n[216 U.S. 92, 97]\n\u00a0\n grant to about 97,000 or, as the plaintiff in error says 90,000 acres. Meantime the state made a sixth, seventh, and eighth amendment to its bill, bringing in new defendants, but these seem to need no further mention.\n Motions had been made by Egbert Mills to dismiss a tract of 112 acres from the suit, and by the Spruce Coal & Lumber Company to dismiss a tract of 7,000 acres, and by others, on the ground that, as has been stated by the statute under which the suit was instituted, whenever it should appear to the court that any part of the land in question had been sold by the state in former similar proceedings, etc., or was held under  3 of article 13 of the state Constitution, the bill should be dismissed as to such part.\n On February 23, 1905, the act of 1893 was amended so as to allow defendant claimants to file deeds or certified copies of deeds made under an order of court in previous proceedings for the sale of school land, or patents from Virginia or West Virginia, purporting to convey any part of the land in suit; and it was enacted that if the state or some other claimant did not, within thirty days, allege and prove by a proper certificate that such part again had become forfeited since the date of the conveyance, the court should have no jurisdiction to sell such part or to permit redemption of it, but should enter an order dismissing the suit as to such part. (It was left an open quetsion in 64 W. Va. 594, 63 S. E. 468, whether this did not enlarge King's rights, in case of a second forfeiture.) It was enacted also that if it should appear that any part of the land had been held for ten years under color or claim of title, and that taxes had been paid for five of the ten years, or if it should appear that the land had been held under color of title and taxes paid for five years since 1865, the suit should be dismissed as to such part. The court further was authorized to dismiss the suit in whole or in part if satisfied by report of the commissioner of school lands and inquiry that the whole or part of the lands was not liable to sale. Previous sales of school lands were validated so far as to pass the title of the state. After \n\n[216 U.S. 92, 98]\n\u00a0\n this amendment new motions were filed on June 1, 1905, and subsequently, with copies of patents and deeds, if not previously filed. King objected on the ground that if  3 of article 13 of the Constitution was construed to apply to land forfeited after the Constitution was adopted, it was contrary to the Constitution of the United States, and that  6 of chapter 105 was also, if construed not to permit King to redeem all the land described in his petition. Time was allowed until the first day of the next October term for the state or any other claimant to show any defenses to these motions, and no defense appearing, on December 7, 1905, the day after the new boundary decree, and on later days, the motions were granted and the suit dismissed as to the tracts of land concerned.\n The dismissals were on two grounds: That the tracts concerned were outside the Morris grant as bounded by the new decree, and that they were held under grants from the state, etc., and therefore were within chap. 105,  6, of the Code, as amended and article 13,  3, of the Constitution. On December 3, 1907, King appealed to the supreme court of appeals, but on December 22, 1908, the decrees were affirmed. It was held that the above- mentioned tracts claimed by Egbert Mills (No. 446 in this court) and the Spruce Coal & Lumber Company (No. 445 in this court) were outside the Morris grant. 64 W. Va. 545, 63 S. E. 495. The new boundary was upheld in 64 W. Va. 546, 63 S. E. 468. In that case it was decided that the defendants made parties after the first boundary decree of September 30, 1897, were not bound by it as partially affirmed, even if they had instigated and contributed to the appeal. pp. 559, et seq. See Rumford Chemical Works v. Hygienic Chemical Co. \n215 U.S. 156\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 45. Finally, in 64 W. Va. 610, 63 S. E. 495, the court sustained a dismissal of land claimed by Buskirk (No. 447 in this court) on the ground that it had been sold as school land pending the present proceedings, and so the right to redeem was gone; and moreover, the sale was validated by the amendment of 1905 to the act of 1893, as above set forth. In 64 W. Va. at 564, 63 S. E. 468, is a separate opinion \n\n[216 U.S. 92, 99]\n\u00a0\n discussing the amendment of 1905, and deciding that it merely made legitimate rules of evidence, and changed no rights.\n To complete the history of the case, even if not material, it may be added that petitions for rehearing were presented and disallowed, but that on January 21, 1909, it was decreed that the boundary decree of December 6, 1905, should be 'so modified and limited in effect as not to affect or impair any right vested in any person by the decree entered herein by the circuit court of Wyoming county on the 30th day of September, 1897, as modified and partially affirmed by a decree entered by this court on the 7th day of February, 1900, and to the like extent the decree made and entered herein on the 22d day of December, 1908, by this court, in so far as the same affirms said decree of December 6th, 1905, is hereby so modified and limited.' The decrees as to the defendants in error were not modified, but still stand. Perhaps the meaning of this last decree is as contended for by some of the defendants in error, that, as between the state and King on one side, and the defendants brought in after September 30, 1897, on the other, the new boundaries shall prevail; but that, as between those who were parties before September 30, 1897, the old boundaries still are to be taken as correct; so that if, within the latter bounds, there is land to which the state alone has title, King still may redeem. The court has indicated a tendency to believe that the old decree still bound the state (King v. Mason, 60 W. Va. 607, 56 S. E. 377), while it clearly holds that it does not bind parties afterwards introduced. (64 W. Va. 546, 561, 63 S. E. 468). At all events, we are of opinion that this modification does not affect the cases before this court.\n The present writs of error are for the purpose of reversing the decrees as to boundary and dismissal that have been mentioned. The defendants in error move to dismiss, and we are of opinion that the motion should be granted. The only serious question in the case, if we assume that King saved it, is whether the West Virginia Constitution and statute are consistent with the 14th Amendment. But that question \n\n[216 U.S. 92, 100]\n\u00a0\n was answered in King v. Mullins, \n171 U.S. 404\n, 43 L. ed. 214, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 925. The construction of the state Constitution by the state court as not confined in its operation to title vested and remaining in the state when the Constitution went into effect (which, of course, is final) is the only natural construction and was to be expected; then, as now, it was obvious that the right to redeem under the statute would not exist in case part of the land had been sold to a junior purchaser, so that in that case there would not be a 'revestiture commensurate with the divestiture,' as it is argued that there should be; and to say the least, it is not surprising that it is held that the right may be lost by transfer pending the proceedings. The whole discussion upon this point is little more than an attempt, in respectful form, to reargue by unreal distinctions what was decided in the former case. The question is not open and we shall discuss it no more. It hardly is necesary to add that, on a writ of error, we do not deal with the facts (Behn v. Campbell, \n205 \nU.S. 403, 407\n, 51 S. L. ed. 857, 858, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 502), and therefore the decision that most of the tracts in question are not within the boundaries of the Morris grant disposes of King's rights here.\n But an attempt is made to maintain that King got vested rights under the first boundary decree September 30, 1897, and his payment of the sum fixed in that decree, coupled with the partial affirmance of the same. But the construction and effect of that decree, how far it bound the state, and whether or not it bound parties subsequently coming in, were matters of state procedure alone. The cases remained within the jurisdiction of the state court, and if, by local practice, the lower or higher court had power to change an earlier decree in the cause by direct order, or indirectly, by construction, which latter we by no means intimate was done, it is a matter that cannot be complained of here. See Patterson v. Colorado, \n205 \nU.S. 454, 460\n, 51 S. L. ed. 879, 880, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 556, 10 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 689. It is said that the decree established the law of the case, but that phrase expresses only the practice of courts generally to refuse to reopen what has been decided, not a limit to their power. Remington v. Central P. R. Co. \n\n[216 U.S. 92, 101]\n\u00a0\n \n198 \nU.S. 95, 99\n, 100 S., 49 L. ed. 959, 963, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 577. See Great Western Teleg. Co. v. Burnham, \n162 \nU.S. 339, 343\n, 40 S. L. ed. 991, 993, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 850. In some states it is true that a stricter rule is applied (Northern P. R. Co. v. Ellis, \n144 U.S. 458\n, 36 L. ed. 504, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 724), but there is nothing in the Constitution of the United States to require it, or to prevent a state from allowing past action to be modified while a case remains in court. See San Francisco v. Itsell, \n133 U.S. 65\n, 33 L. ed. 570, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 241. The highest court of the state is the final judge of the powers conferred by the state laws in that regard. It was said by the supreme court of appeals in this case that 'the decree adds nothing to King's rights.' 64 W. Va. 599, 63 S. E. 468.\n In view of what we have said, it hardly is necessary to consider the amendment of the Code, chap. 105, and the act of 1893 by the act of 1905. It is argued that the state court misconstrued the statute, but we have nothing to do with that. Judge Brannon clearly shows (64 W. Va. 584, 591, et seq., 63 S. E. 468) that the amendment does not even change the burden of proof as to the validity or invalidity of other sales or conveyances set up. Id. 594. The limitation of thirty days to overcome the effect of filing a deed or patent from the state is thought to be merely directory, and it is pointed out that in fact King was allowed five months, and that he did nothing. The limitation is held to be reasonable, and, even if void, to be separable from the rest of the act,-another point on which the state's decision is final. Giving prima facie effect to the document cannot be questioned seriously. Marx v. Hanthorn, \n148 U.S. 172\n, 37 L. ed. 410, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 508. The other provisions of the act are shown to take no right from King that he had under the previous law, and are held to be consistent with the state constitution. In our opinion there was no question raised in these cases that properly could be brought before this court for review.\n Writs of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","93":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKNAPP v. MILWAUKEE TRUST CO.(1910)\nNo. 206\nArgued: Decided: March 7, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 545, 546]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William Duff Haynie for appellant.\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 545, 549]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George P. Miller Edward P. Vilas for appellees.\n\n\n[216 U.S. 545, 552]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The Standard Telephone & Electric Company, a Wisconsin corporation, was adjudicated a bankrupt in the district court of the United States for the eastern district of Wisconsin. Under its articles of association it was authorized to carry on the business of selling appliances for telephone purposes and operating telephone exchanges. It had established and was operating a telephone exchange at the village of Sheridan, Wisconsin, and was carrying on the business of manufacturing and selling telephone apparatus in the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where it had a stock in trade and trade fixtures. The trustee in bankruptcy filed a petition to sell all the property of the bankrupt. Appellant Knapp, as trustee of certain mortgagees given by the telephone company, intervened, and asked to have the lien of the mortgage established as the first lien on the property and satisfied out of the proceeds of the sale. The property was sold, and the question is as to the lien of these mortgages upon the fund.\n The trustee in bankruptcy answered the petition of Knapp, trustee under the mortgage, averring that it was a chattel mortgage, and fraudulent and void as to creditors, because of certain agreements contained therein, because it was on after-acquired property, and because of the failure to file an affidavit of renewal, as required by the Wisconsin statutes. The referee in bankruptcy found the facts, and held the mortgage void. Upon hearing, the district judge reached a like conclusion. 157 Fed. 106.\n The circuit court of appeals of the seventh circuit, upon appeal, affirmed the decree of the district court, holding the mortgage void for the reasons set forth at large in the opinion of the district judge. 89 C. C. A. 467, 162 Fed. 675.\n A motion has been filed to dismiss the appeal for want of findings of fact and conclusions of law in the circuit court of appeals, as required by general order in bankruptcy No. 36. Whether or not such a finding of facts was required depends \n\n[216 U.S. 545, 553]\n\u00a0\n upon the character of the present proceeding. General order in bankruptcy No. 36, authorized under subdivision b of  25 of the bankruptcy act [30 Stat. at L. 553, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3432], provides for appeals under the act to this court from the circuit court of appeals within thirty days after the judgment or decree, and for the making and filing of a finding of facts and conclusions of law separately stated, and that the record upon such appeal shall consist only of the pleadings, the judgment or decree, the finding of facts, and conclusions of law.\n Section 25b provides for appeals from any final decision of a court of appeals allowing or rejecting a claim under the act, under such rules and within such time as may be prescribed by the Supreme Court of the United States. Such appeals are allowed when the amount in controversy exceeds the sum of $2,000, and the question involved might have been taken by appeal or writ of error from the highest court of a state to the Supreme Court of the United States; or where some justice of the Supreme Court of the United States shall certify that, in his opinion, the determination of the question or questions involved in the allowance or rejection of such claim is essential to a uniform construction of the bankruptcy act throughout the United States.\n Under authority of subdivision b,  25, general order No. 36 was adopted, and in the cases enumerated a finding of facts and conclusions of law must be made in the circuit court of appeals, and the appeal taken within thirty days after the entry of the judgment or decree.\n The case at bar is not of that class; it is an intervention in a bankruptcy proceeding, and, within the meaning of the act, a controversy arising in a bankruptcy proceeding, and the appellate jurisdiction is the same as in like cases under the court of appeals act. Bankruptcy act,  24 a; Hewit v. Berlin Mach. Works, \n194 U.S. 296\n, 48 L. ed. 986, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 690; Coder v. Artz, \n213 U.S. 223\n, 53 L. ed. 772, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 436, and cases therein cited.\n As the appeal was in the manner provided for in the court of appeals act, no special finding of facts was required under \n\n[216 U.S. 545, 554]\n\u00a0\n general order No. 36, and the motion to dismiss the appeal must be overruled.\n The mortgages in question, which were upon all the property and estate of the mortgagor, acquired or to be acquired, in connection with or in relation to the business of the mortgagor, contain, among others, the following provisions:\n'Nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent said first party from carrying on, in the due and regular course, its said business, and collecting the indebtedness and moneys due or to become due therein, and applying the same to its own use, except as hereinafter provided.'\n\n The mortgage makes provision for a sinking fund of $2,000 annually, $ 500 quarterly, out of the proceeds of the business, or, if necessary, from the general resources; and the mortgage contains this further provision:\n'Said first party further agrees that no dividend shall be declared or paid on its capital stock at any time when any portion of said sinking fund or the interest on said bonds shall not have been duly provided for, according to the terms of this indenture.\n\n'Provided, however, That said trustee be and he is hereby empowered and authorized in his discretion, and in case he does not procure for the sinking fund any of said bonds at par and accrued interest, upon application in writing by said first party to waive the making by said party of full or any payment into or provision for said sinking fund for any quarter year, and in the event of said trustee electing not to require said first party to make such payment into or provision for such sinking fund, the moneys which would otherwise have been placed therein for the purchase of said bonds as aforesaid shall remain at the disposition of said first party, to be divided as dividends, or to enlarge, extend, improve, repair, renew, or rehabilitate its said described business and property.'\n\n It will be seen that under these provisions the mortgagor is allowed to remain in possession of the property, applying the proceeds thereof to his own use, except that no dividends shall \n\n[216 U.S. 545, 555]\n\u00a0\n be declared or paid without first making provision for the sinking fund and the interest on the bonds, and with this important proviso,-that the trustee under the mortgage may, in his discretion, in case he does not procure for the sinking fund bonds at par and accrued interest, upon the application of the mortgagor, waive the payment into or provision for the sinking fund for any quarter year, and, in such case, the moneys which would otherwise go into the moneys which would otherwise go into the sinking fund for the purchase of bonds shall remain at the disposition of the mortgagor, to be distributed as dividends, or to be used for the benefit of the business and property in the manner described.\n Section 2310, Wisconsin Statutes, provides:\n'Every sale made by a vendor of goods and chattels in his possession or under his control, and every assignment of goods and chattels, unless the same be accompanied by an immediate delivery, and be followed by an actual and continued change of possession of the things sold or assigned, shall be presumed to be fraudulent and void as against the creditors of the vendor, or the creditors of the person making such assignment, or subsequent purchasers in good faith, and thall be conclusive evidence of fraud, unless it shall be made to appear on the part of the persons claiming under such sale or assignment, that the same was made in good faith and without any intent to defraud such creditors or purchasers.'\n\n Section 2313 provides that no mortgage or sale of personal property shall be valid against any other persons than the parties thereto, unless the possession of the mortgaged property be delivered to and retained by the mortgagee, or unless the mortgage, or a copy thereof, be filed as required by the statute, except as otherwise provided therein.\n Section 2316b provides that a mortgagor in possession of a stock of goods from which he is permitted to make sales and apply the proceeds upon the debt shall file a statement showing the amount of sales, amount applied on mortgage, and amount of new stock bought every sixty days, and, upon his failure to file such statement, the debt shall become immedi- \n\n[216 U.S. 545, 556]\n\u00a0\n ately due, and after fifteen days the mortgage shall cease to be a lien, except between the parties thereto.\n It was found as a matter of fact that no statement was filed of the amount of the sales, amount of new stock bought, amount applied on mortgage, etc., every sixty days, as required by the Wisconsin statute,  2316b; that since the execution of the mortgage the company, in the course of its business, made sales from the mortgaged property and applied the proceeds to its own use; that the property was in possession of the mortgagor; that Knapp, the trustee, knew that the business was being so transacted; that it was understood that the business should be so transacted and sales of the mortgaged property so applied to the mortgagor's use.\n While there was a finding that no intentional bad faith was shown, still we agree with the court of appeals and the district judge that, under the law of Wisconsin, as construed by her highest court, such conditions as were contained in these mortgages rendered them fraudulent in law and void as to creditors. Merchants' & M. Sav. Bank v. Lovejoy, 84 Wis. 601, 55 N. W. 108; Bank of Kaukauna v. Joannes, 98 Wis. 321, 73 N. W. 997; Charles Baumbach Co. v. Hobkirk, 104 Wis. 488, 80 N. W. 740; Franzke v. Hitchon, 105 Wis. 11, 80 N. W. 931; Durr v. Wildish, 108 Wis. 401, 84 N. W. 437.\n In this case the stipulations of the mortgages practically permitted the mortgagor to dispose of the property for his own benefit, except that it must make certain provisions for a sinking fund and interest on the bonds; and, with the consent of the trustee, no provision need be made for the sinking fund or interest, and the moneys which otherwise would have been placed therein for the purchase of bonds might be applied for the benefit of the mortgagor, whether as dividends or for the benefit of its business and property. Such provisions are clearly within the Wisconsin decisions, for they permit the mortgagor to have the benefit of the property, to keep it in his possession, and to appropriate the proceeds to his own use. The Wisconsin decisions render such mortgages invalid as to creditors, because the effect of such provisions is to give the \n\n[216 U.S. 545, 557]\n\u00a0\n beneficial use of the mortgaged property to the mortgagor in possession, and to make possible the use of the mortgage as a protection against creditors of the mortgagor when they shall undertake to assert their rights.\n But it is said the trustee in bankruptcy may not defend against these mortgages. It is contended that they are good as between the parties, and that, as to them, the trustee in bankruptcy occupies no better position than the bankrupt. This question was raised and decided in Security Warehousing Co. v. Hand, \n206 U.S. 415\n, 51 L. ed. 1117, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 720, 11 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 789. That case arose in Wisconsin, and it was therein held that, under the Wisconsin law, an attempted pledge of property, without change of possession, was void under the laws of that state. In that case, as in this one, the question was raised as to whether the trustee in bankruptcy could question the transaction, and it was contended that, being valid as between the parties, the trustee took only the right and title of the bankrupt. The question was fully considered therein, and the previous cases in this court were reviewed. The principle was recognized that the trustee in bankruptcy stands in the shoes of the bankrupt, and that the property in his hands is subject to the equities impressed upon it while in the hands of the bankrupt.\n But it was held that the attempt to create a lien upon the property of the bankrupt was void as to general creditors under the laws of Wisconsin. Applying  70a of the bankruptcy act, it was held that the trustee in bankruptcy was vested by operation of the bankrupt law with the title of the property transferred by the bankrupt in fraud of creditors, and also that the trustee took the property which, prior to the filing of the petition, might have been levied upon and sold by judicial process against the bankrupt. It was therefore held that, as there had been no valid pledge of the property, for want of change of possession, it could have been levied upon and sold under judicial process against the bankrupt at the time of the adjudication in bankruptcy, and passed to the trustee in bankruptcy. \n\n[216 U.S. 545, 558]\n\u00a0\n The principles announced in Security Warehousing Co. v. Hand, supra, when applied to the present case, are decisive of the question here presented. Under the Wisconsin statutes and decisions of the highest court of that state the conditions contained upon the face of this mortgage were such as to render it fraudulent in law and void as to creditors, and prior to the filing of the petition in bankruptcy the property might have been levied upon and sold by judicial process against the bankrupt.\n It is true that in Security Warehousing Co. v. Hand the court said that the attempted pledge was a 'mere pretense, a sham;' but the courts of Wisconsin have held that such provisions as are in these mortgages, giving the bankrupt the right to dispose of the mortgaged property for its own benefit, rendered the conveyance fraudulent in law, and therefore void as to creditors. This brings the conveyance within the terms of the bankrupt act, as one which the trustee may attack, as conclusively as it would if fraudulent intent in fact were shown to exist.\n In Mueller v. Bruss, 112 Wis. 406, 88 N. W. 229, it was held that a trustee in bankruptcy could maintain an action to set aside a fraudulent conveyance, but that the complaint must aver and the trustee must show that the estate had not sufficient assets in the trustee's hands to satisfy the claims filed against the debtor. And it is insisted that a showing of this character is lacking in the present case. Without deciding that under the bankruptcy act the answer of the trustee in bankruptcy was required to make this averment, accompanied by proof, if necessary, it is sufficient upon this point to say that the intervening petition of the trustee of the mortgage sought to assert a lien upon all the property of the bankrupt in the trustee's hands. The suggestion in appellant's brief, that the trustee in bankruptcy may possibly recover against directors and officers of the corporation for dereliction of duty, and against stockholders for unpaid subscriptions and additional liability on their part, presents no reason why he may not resist an \n\n[216 U.S. 545, 559]\n\u00a0\n attempt to take all the available property in his hands to apply on a mortgage void as to creditors at the time of the adjudication.\n We are of opinion, for the reasons stated, that the mortgages in question are void, and that, under the bankruptcy law, the trustee can assert their invalidity.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 89 Fed. xiv, 32 C.

U S(1910)\nNo. 220\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1910\n\n\n\n This case is before us on a writ of certiorari to the United States circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit. The question is the proper classification, under the tariff act of July 24, 1897 (30 Stat. at L. 151, chap. 11, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1626), of a Japanese beverage Known as 'sake.' 'Sake' is not named in that act, but  7 (p. 205), frequently spoken of as 'the similitude section,' reads as follows:\n'That each and every imported article, not enumerated in this act, which is similar, either in material, quality, texture, or the use to which it may be applied, to any article enumerated in this act as chargeable with duty, shall pay the same rate of duty which is levied on the enumerated article which it most resembles in any of the particulars before mentioned; and if any nonenumerated article equally resembles two or more enumerated articles on which different rates of duty are chargeable, there shall be levied on such nonenumerated \n\n[215 U.S. 392, 393]\n\u00a0\n article the same rate of duty as is chargeable on the article which it resembles, paying the highest rate of duty.'\n\n In November, 1904, petitioner imported some sake at the port of San Francisco, and, following prior rulings, the collector, under the similitude section, held it similar to still wine containing more than 14 per of absolute alcohol, and dutiable accordingly at 50 cents per gallon, under paragraph 296 (p. 174). The petitioner protested and claimed that it was either a nonenumerated manufactured article, dutiable at 20 per cent ad valorem, under  6 (p. 205), or, by reason of similitude to ale, porter, or beer, at 20 cents per gallon under paragraph 297 (p. 174). Both the board of general appraisers and the circuit court sustained the protest, feeling themselves constrained by the decision of the dircuit court for the southern district of New York (Nishimiya v. United States, 131 Fed. 650), and that of the circuit court of appeals for the second circuit ( United States v. Nishimiya, 69 C. C. A. 588, 137 Fed. 396). On appeal, the United States circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed the decision of the circuit court and sustained the classification made by the collector.\n Thomas Fitch, W. Wickham Smith, J. M. Thurston, Stanley Jackson, and J. J. Dunne for petitioner.\n\n\n[215 U.S. 392, 395]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. C. McReynolds and Attorney General Wickersham for respondent.\n\n\n\n[215 U.S. 392, 396]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n Something can be said on both sides of the question of similarity, and, if the case turned simply upon that question, it might be difficult to reach a satisfactory conclusion. In such a case the construction given by the department charged with the execution of the tariff acts is entitled to great weight. As said by Mr. Justice McKenna, delivering the opinion of the court in United States v. Cerecedo Hermanos y Compania, \n209 \nU.S. 337, 339\n, 52 S. L. ed. 821, 822, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 532, 533:\n'We have said that when the meaning of a statute is doubtful, great weight should be given to the construction placed upon it by the department charged with its execution. Robertson v. Downing, \n127 U.S. 607\n, 32 L. ed. 269, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1328; United States v. Healey, \n160 U.S. 136\n, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 247. And we have decided that the re- enactment by Congress, without change, of a statute which had previously received long-continued executive construction, is an adoption by Congress of such construction. United States v. Falk & Bros. \n204 \nU.S. 143, 152\n, 51 S. L. ed. 411, 414, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 191.'\n\n In the decision of this case, Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Peckham concurred solely because of the prior administrative construction.\n Prior to 1894, sake was classified by similitude to distilled liquor, and subjected to a duty of $2.50 per froof gallon, under paragraph 329, act 1890 (26 Stat. at L. 567, 589, chap. 1244), and $2, under paragraph 11, act 1883 (22 Stat. at L. 488, 494, chap. 121, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2247). \n\n[215 U.S. 392, 397]\n\u00a0\n In July, 1894, Y. Woozens protested against this classification, claiming the liquor was dutiable under the act of 1890 by similitude to still wine. He was sustained by the board of general appraisers in opinion dated October 4, 1894 (T. D. 15,392, G. a. 2786). The Treasury Department acquiesced, and has acted accordingly until the present time; no protest against the practice was entered until March, 1902. Three years after the ruling in the Woozens case, Congress passed the tariff act of 1897, which in no way modified the provisions upon which the appraisers had previously based their decision. This in effect confirmed their action. In March, 1902, Hackfeld & Company, Honolulu, protested against the classification of 'sake' by similitude to still wine, but the prior ruling was sustained by the appraisers and the importer acquiesced in the decision. In the tariff act of 1909, sake is specially enumerated with still wine ( paragraph 307):\n'Still wines, including ginger wine or ginger cordial, vermuth, and rice wine or sake, and similar beverages not specially provided for in this section . . . if containing more than fourteen per centum of absolute alcohol, sixty cents per gallon.' 36 Stat. at L. 11, 40.*\n\n In April, 1903, Nishimiya imported some sake at New York, and protested against the classification by similitude to still wine. The board of appraisers sustained the collector, but, on appeal to the circuit court for the southern district of New York, the circuit judge thought that sake was not sufficiently like either wine or beer to be classified by similitude, and held it to be a nonenumerated manufactured article. This conclusion was sustained by the circuit court of appeals for the second circuit. United States v. Nishimiya, supra.\n Thus it appears that, prior to 1894, sake was classified by similitude to distilled liquor, and then, on a protest by an importer, it was classified by similitude to still wine, and that ruling has been followed from that time to the present, receiving in the meantime at least a qualified approval by\n * U. S. Comp. St. Supp. 1909, p. 693. \n\n[215 U.S. 392, 398]\n\u00a0\n Congress. It was accepted without challenge until 1902. Then, a protest against it having been overruled, it remained unchallenged for another year. After this, and in the latest tariff act, Congress has in terms put sake in the category with still wines.\n Under these circumstances, we think the intent of Congress in respect to the classification of sake is clearly manifested, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","95":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKUHN v. FAIRMONT COAL CO.(1910)\nNo. 50\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1910\n\n\n\n\n Mr. Homer W. Williams for Kuhn.\n\n\n[215 U.S. 349, 351]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edward A. Brannon, Z. Taylor Vinson, and Vinson & Thompson for the Fairmont Coal Company.\n\n\n[215 U.S. 349, 353]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case is here on a question propounded under the authority of the judiciary act of March 3d, 1891, relating to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States. 26 Stat. at L. 828, chap. 517,  6, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549. The facts out of which the question arises are substantially as will be now stated.\n On the 21st day of November, 1889, the plaintiff, Kuhn, a citizen of Hoio, sold and conveyed to Camden all the coal underlying a certain tract of land in West Virginia of which he, Kuhn, was the owner in fee. The deed contained these clauses: 'The parties of the first part do grant unto the said Johnson N. Camden all the coal and mining privileges necessary and convenient for the removal of the same, in, upon, and under a certain tract or parcel of land situated in the county of Marion, on the waters of the West Fork river, bounded and described as follows, to wit: . . . Together with the right to enter upon and under said land, and to mine, excavate, and remove all of said coal, and to remove upon and under the said lands the coal from and under adjacent, coterminous, and neighboring lands, and also the right to enter upon and under the tract of land hereinbefore described \n\n[215 U.S. 349, 354]\n\u00a0\n and make all necessary structures, roads, ways excavations, air shafts, drains, drain ways and openings necessary or convenient for the mining andremoval of said coal and the coal from coterminous and neighboring lands to market.'\n The present action of trespass on the case was brought January 18th, 1906. The declaration alleged that the coal covered by the above deed passed to the defendant, the Fairmont Coal Company, a West Virginia corporation, on the ___ of January, 1906; that the plaintiff Kuhn was entitled of right to have all his surface and other strata overlying the coal supported in its natural state, either by pillars or blocks of coal or by artificial support; that on the day named the defendant company mined and removed coal from under the land, leaving, however, large blocks or pillars of coal as a means of supporting the overlying surface; that the coal company, disregarding the plaintiff's rights, did knowingly, wilfully, and negligently, without making any compensation therefor, or for the damages arising therefrom, mine and remove all of said blocks and pillars of coal so left, by reason whereof and because of the failure to provide any proper or sufficient artificial or other support for the overlying surface, the plaintiff's surface land, or a large portion thereof, was caused to fall; and that it was cracked, broken, and rent, causing large holes and fissures to appear upon the surface, and destroying the water and water courses.\n The contract under which the title to the coal originally passed was executed in West Virginia, and the plaintiff's cause of action arose in that state.\n A demurrer to the declaration was sustained by the circuit court, an elaborate opinion being delivered by Judge Dayton. 152 Fed. 1013. The case was then taken upon writ of error to the circuit court of appeals.\n It appears from the statement of the case made by the circuit court of appeals, that, in the year 1902, after Kuhn's deed to Camden, one Griffin brought, in a court of West \n\n[215 U.S. 349, 355]\n\u00a0\n Virginia, an action, similar in all respects to the present one, against the Fairmont Coal Company, the successor of Camden. His rights arose from a deed almost identical with that executed by Kuhn to Camden. That case was ruled in favor of the coal company, and subsequently was taken to the supreme court of West Virginia, which announced its opinion therein in November, 1905. A petition for rehearing having been filed, the judgment was stayed. But the petition was overruled March 27th, 1906, on which day, after Kuhn's suit was brought, the decision previously announced in the Griffin Case became final under the rules of the supreme court of the state. Griffin v. Fairmont Coal Co. 59 W. Va. 480, 2 L.R.A. (N.S.) 1115, 53 S. E. 24.\n The contention by the coal company in the court below was that, as the decision in the Griffin Case covered substantially the same question as the one here involved, it was the duty of the Federal court to accept that decision as controlling the rights of the present parties, whatever might be its own opinion as to the law applicable to this case. The contention of Kuhn was that the Federal court was under a duty to determine the rights of the present parties upon its own independent judgment, giving to the decision in the state court only such weight as should be accorded to it according to the established principles in the law of contracts and of sound reasoning; also, that the Federal court was not bound by a decision of the state court in an action of trespass on the case for a tort not involving the title to land.\n Such being the issue, the circuit court of appeals, proceeding under the judiciary act of March 3d, 1891, chap. 517, have sent up the following question to be answered:\n'Is this court bound by the decision of the supreme court in the case of Griffin v. Fairmont Coal Co., that being an action by the plaintiff against the defendant for damages for a tort, and this being an action for damages for a tort based on facts and circumstances almost identical, the language of the deeds with reference to the granting clause being \n\n[215 U.S. 349, 356]\n\u00a0\n in fact identical, that case having been decided after the contract upon which defendant relies was executed, after the injury complained of was sustained, and after this action was instituted?'\n\n There is no room for doubt as to the scope of the decision in the Griffin Case. The syllabus-which, in West Virginia, is the law of the case, whatever may be the reasoning employed in the opinion of the court-is as follows: '1. Deeds conveying coal with rights of removal should be construed in the same way as other written instruments, and the intention of the parties, as manifest by the language used in the deed itself, should govern. 2. The vendor of land may sell and convey his coal, and grant to the vendee the right to enter upon and under said land, and to mine, excavate, and remove all of the coal purchased and paid for by him, and, if the removal of the coal necessarily causes the surface to subside or break, the grantor cannot be heard to complain thereof. 3. Where a deed conveys the coal under a tract of land, together with the right to enter upon and under said land, and to mine, excavate, and remove all of it, there is no implied reservation in such an instrument that the grantee must leave enough coal to support the surface in its original position. 4. It is the duty of the court to construe contracts as they are made by the parties thereto, and to give full force and effect to the language used, when it is clear, plain, simple, and unambiguous. 5. It is only where the language of a contract is ambiguous and uncertain, and susceptible of more than one construction, that a court may, under the well-established rules of construction, interfere to reach a proper construction and make certain that which in itself is uncertain.'\n Nor can it be doubted that the point decided in the Griffin Case had not been previously adjudged by the supreme court of that state. Counsel for the coal company expressly state that the question here involved was never before the legislature or courts of West Virginia until the deed involved in the \n\n[215 U.S. 349, 357]\n\u00a0\n Griffin Case came before the supreme court of that state for construction; that 'until then there was no law and no local custom upon the subject in force in West Virginia;' and that 'only after the holding of the state court in the Griffin Case could it be said that the narrow question therein decided had become a rule of property in that state.'\n In this view of the case, was not the Federal court bound to determine the dispute between the parties according to its own independent judgment as to what rights were acquired by them under the contract relating to the coal? If the Federal court was of opinion that the coal company was under a legal obligation, while taking out the coal in question, to use such precautions and to proceed in such way as not to destroy or materially injure the surface land, was it bound to adjudge the contrary simply because, in a single case, to which Kuhn was not a party, and which was determined after the right of the present parties had accrued and become fixed under their contract, and after the injury complained of had occurred, the state court took a different view of the law? If, when the jurisdiction of the Federal court was invoked, Kuhn, the citizen of Ohio, had, in its judgment, a valid cause of action against the coal company for the injury of which he complained, was that court obliged to subordinate its view of the law to that expressed by the state court?\n In cases too numerous to be here cited, the general subject suggested by these questions has been considered by this court. It will be both unnecessary and impracticable to enter upon an extended review of those cases. They are familiar to the profession. But in the course of this opinion we will refer to a few of them.\n The question as to the binding force of state decisions received very full consideration in Burgess v. Seligman, \n107 \nU.S. 20, 33\n, 27 S. L. ed. 359, 365, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 10. After judgment in that case by the United States circuit court, the supreme court of the state rendered two judgments, each of which was adverse to the grounds upon which the circuit court had proceeded, and the \n\n[215 U.S. 349, 358]\n\u00a0\n contention was that this court should follow those decisions of the state court, and reverse the judgment of the circuit court. The opinion in that case states that, in order to avoid misapprehension, the court had given the subject special consideration, and the extended note at the close of that opinion shows that the prior cases were all closely scrutinized by the eminent justice who wrote the opinion. A conclusion was reached that received the approval of all the members of the court. We place in the margin1 an extract from the opinion \n\n[215 U.S. 349, 359]\n\u00a0\n of Mr. Justice Bradley. In Bucher v. Cheshire R. Co. \n125 U.S. 555\n, 31 L. ed. 795, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 974, Mr. Justice Miller, speaking for the court observed: 'It may be said generally that wherever the decisions of the state courts relate to some law of a local character, which may have become established by those courts, or has always been a part of the law of the state, that the decisions upon the subject are usually conclusive, and always entitled to the highest respect of the Federal courts. The whole of this subject has recently been very ably reviewed in the case of Burgess v. Seligman, \n107 U.S. 20\n, 27 L. ed. 359, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 10. Where such local law or custom has been established by repeated decisions of the highest courts of a state, it becomes also the law governing the courts of the United States sitting in that state.' See also Jackson ex dem. St. John v. Chew, 12 Wheat. 153, 6 L. ed. 583.\n Up to the present time these principles have not been modified or disregarded by this court. On the contrary, they have been reaffirmed without substantial qualification in many subsequent cases, some of which are here cited. East Alabama R. Co. v. Doe, \n114 U.S. 340\n, 29 L. ed. 136, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 869; Bucher v. Cheshire R. Co. \n125 U.S. 555\n, 31 L. ed. 795, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 974; Gormly v. Clark, \n134 U.S. 338\n, 33 L. ed. 909, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 554; Baltimore & O. R. Co. v. Baugh, \n149 U.S. 368\n, 37 L. ed. 772, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 914; Folsom v. Township 96, \n159 U.S. 611\n, 40 L. ed. 278, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174; Barber v. Pittsburgh, Ft. W. & C. R. Co. \n166 U.S. 83\n, 41 L. ed. 925, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 448; Stanly County v. Coler, \n190 U.S. 437\n, 47 L. ed. 1126, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 811; Julian v. Central Trust Co. \n193 U.S. 93\n, 48 L. ed. 629, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 399; Wicomico Councy v. Bancroft, \n203 U.S. 112\n, 51 L. ed. 112, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 21; Presidio County v. NoelYoung Bond & Stock Co. \n212 U.S. 58\n, 53 L. ed. 402, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 237. \n\n[215 U.S. 349, 360]\n\u00a0\n We take it, then, that it is no longer to be questioned that the Federal courts, in determining cases before them, are to be guided by the following rules: 1. When administering state laws and determining rights accruing under those laws, the jurisdiction of the Federal court is an independent one, not subordinate to, but coordinate and concurrent with, the jurisdiction of the state courts. 2. Where, before the rights of the parties accrued, certain rules relating to real estates have been so established by state decisions as to become rules of property and action in the state, those rules are accepted by the Federal court as authoritative declarations of the law of the state. 3. But where the law of the state has not been thus settled, it is not only the right, but the duty, of the Federal court to exercise its own judgment, as it also always does when the case before it depends upon the doctrines of commercial law and general jurisprudence. 4. So, when contracts and transactions are entered into and rights have accrued under a particular state of the local decisions, or when there has been no decision by the state court on the particular question involved, then the Federal courts properly claim the right to give effect to their own judgment as to what is the law of the state applicable to the case, even where a different view has been expressed by the state court after the rights of parties accrued. But even in such cases, for the sake of comity and to avoid confusion, the Federal court should always lean to an agreement with the state court if the question is balanced with doubt.\n The court took care, in Burgess v. Seligman, to say that the Federal court would not only fail in its duty, but would defeat the object for which the national courts were given jurisdiction of controversies between citizens of different states, if, while leaning to an agreement with the state court, it did not exercise an independent judgment in cases involving principles not settled by previous adjudications.\n It would seem that according to those principles, now firmly established, the duty was upon the Federal court, in \n\n[215 U.S. 349, 361]\n\u00a0\n the present case, to exercise its independent judgment as to what were the relative rights and obligations of the parties under their written contract. The question before it was as to the liability of the coal company for an injury arising from the failure of that corporation, while mining and taking out the coal, to furnish sufficient support to the overlying or surface land. Whether such a case involves a rule of property in any proper sense of those terms, or only a question of general law, within the province of the Federal court to determine for itself, the fact exists that there had been no determination of the question by the state court before the rights of the parties accrued and became fixed under their contract, or before the injury complained of. In either case, the Federal court was bound under established doctrines to exercise its own independent judgment, with a leaning, however, as just suggested, for the sake of harmony, to an agreement with the state court, if the question of law involved was deemed to be doubtful. If, before the rights of the parties in this case were fixed by written contract, it had become a settled rule of law in West Virginia, as manifested by decisions of its highest court, that the grantee or his successors in such a deed as is here involved was under no legal obligation to guard the surface land of the grantor against injury resulting from the mining and removal of the coal purchased, a wholly different question would have been presented.\n There are adjudged cases involving the meaning of written contracts having more or less connection with land that were not regarded as involving a rule in the law of real estate, but as only presenting questions of general law, touching which the Federal courts have always exercised their own judgment, and in respect to which they are not bound to accept the views of the state courts. Let us look at some of those cases. They may throw light upon the present discussion.\n In Chicago v. Robbins, 2 Black, 418, 429, 17 L. ed. 298, 304, which was \n\n[215 U.S. 349, 362]\n\u00a0\n an action on the case for damages, the question was as to the right of the city of Chicago-which was under a duty to see that its streets were kept in safe condition for persons and property-to hold one Robbins liable in damages for so using his lot on a public street as to cause injury to a passer-by. The city was held liable to the latter, and sued Robbins on that account. The state court, in a similar case, decided for the defendant, and it was contended that the Federal court should accept the views of the local court as to the legal rights of the parties. But this court, speaking by Mr. Justice Davis, said: 'Where rules of property in a state are fully settled by a series of adjudications, this court adopts the decisions of the state courts. But where private rights are to be determined by the application of commonlaw rules alone, this court, although entertaining for state tribunals the highest respect, does not feel bound by their decisions.'\n In Lane v. Vick, 3 How. 464, 472, 476, 11 L. ed. 681, 685, 687, the nature of the controversy was such as to require a construction of a will which, among other property, devised certain real estate which, at the time of such, was within the limits of Vicksburg, Mississippi. There had been a construction of the will by the supreme court of the state (1 How. [ Miss.] 379, 31 Am. Dec. 167), and that construction, it was insisted, was binding on the Federal court. But this court said: 'Every instrument of writing should be so construed as to effectuate, if practicable, the intention of the parties to it. This principle applies with peculiar force to a will. . . . The parties in that case were not the same as those now before this court; and that decision does not affect the interests of the complainants here. The question before the Mississippi court was whether certain grounds within the town plat had been dedicated to public use. The construction of the will was incidental to the main object of the suit, and, of course, was not binding on anyone claiming under the will. With the greatest respect, it may be proper to say, that this court does not follow the state courts in their construction of a will or any other \n\n[215 U.S. 349, 363]\n\u00a0\n instrument, as they do in the construction of statutes. Where, as in the case of Jackson ex dem. St. John v. Chew, 12 Wheat. 167, 6 L. ed. 588, the construction of a will had been settled by the highest courts of the state, and had long been acquiesced in as a rule of property, this court would follow it, because it had become a rule of property. The construction of a statute by the supreme court of a state is followed without reference to the interests it may affect, or the parties to the suit in which its construction was involved. But the mere construction of a will by a state court does not, as the construction of a statute of the state, constitute a rule of decision for the courts of the United States. In the case of Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, 10 L. ed. 865, the effect of the 34th section of the judiciary act of 1789, [1 Stat. at L. 92, chap. 20, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 581] and the construction of instruments by the state courts, are considered with greater precision than is found in some of the preceding cases on the same subject.'\n In Foxcroft v. Mallett, 4 How. 353, 379, 11 L. ed. 1008, 1019, the object of the action was to recover certain land in Maine. The case turned in part on the construction to be given to a mortgage of certain land to Williams College, and to local adjudications relating to those lands, which, it was contended, were conclusive on the parties. 'But,' this court said, 'on examining the particulars of the cases cited to govern this ( Williams College v. Mallett, 12 Me. 398; Williams College v. Mallett, 16 Me. 84; Randell v. Mallett, 14 Me. 51), it will be seen that the construction of the mortgage to the college, in respect to this reservation or condition, never appears to have been agitated.If it had been, the decision would be entitled to high respect, though it should not be regarded as conclusive on the mere construction of a deed as to matters and language belonging to the common law, and not to any local statute. Williams v. Suffolk Ins. Co. 3 Sumn. 270, 277, Fed. Cas. No. 17,738.'\n In Russell v. Southard, 12 How. 139, 147, 13 L. ed. 927, 930, the controlling question was whether, in any case, it was admissible to show by extraneous evidence that a deed on its face of certain real estate in Kentucky was really intended by the parties as a security for a loan and as a mortgage. The court, speaking \n\n[215 U.S. 349, 364]\n\u00a0\n by Mr. Justice Curtis, after citing adjudged cases sustaining the proposition that evidence of that kind was admissible in certain states, said: 'It is suggested that a different rule is held by the highest court of equity in Kentucky. If it were, with great respect for that learned court, this court would not feel bound thereby. This being a suit in equity, and oral evidence being admitted or rejected, not by the mere force of any state statute, but upon the principles of general equity jurisprudence, this court must be governed by its own views of those principles,'-citing Robinson v. Campbell, 3 Wheat. 212, 4 L. ed. 372; United States v. Howland, 4 Wheat. 108, 4 L. ed. 526; Boyle v. Zacharie, 6 Pet. 658, 8 L. ed. 536; Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, 10 L. ed. 865; Foxcroft v. Mallett, 4 How. 379, 11 L. ed. 1019\n\n\n In Yates v. Milwaukee, 10 Wall. 497, 506, 19 L. ed. 984, 987, the question was as to the nature and extent of the right of an owner of land in Wisconsin, bordering on a public navigable water, to make a landing, wharf, or pier for his own use or for the use of the public. There was a question in the case of dedication to public use, and the city of Milwaukee sought to change or remove the wharf erected by the riparian owner in front of his lot. This court, speaking by Mr. Justice Miller, said: 'This question of dedication, on which the whole of that case turned, was one of fact, to be determined by ascertaining the intention of those who laid out the lots, from what they did, and from the application of general common-law principles to their acts. This does not depend upon state statute or local state law. The law which governs the case is the common law, on which this court has never acknowledged the right of the state courts to control our decisions, except, perhaps, in a class of cases where the state courts have established, by repeated decisions, a rule of property in regard to land titles peculiar to the state.'\n In Louisville Trust Co. v. Cincinnati, 22 C. C. A. 334, 338, 341, 41 U. S. App. 36, 45, 51, 76 Fed. 296, 300, 304, which was a suit by a Kentucky corporation, it became necessary to determine the force and effect of a mortgage originating in a state statute of Ohio and certain \n\n[215 U.S. 349, 365]\n\u00a0\n municipal ordinances covering street easements in Cincinnati. The state court, in a suit to which the trustee in the mortgage was not a party, passed a decree declaring the scope, effect, and duration of contracts or ordinances under which the mortgage, easements, and franchises originated. It was insisted that the Federal court was bound to accept the views of the state court. But the circuit court of appeals, held by Judges Taft, Lurton, and Hammond, ruled otherwise. Judge Lurton, speaking for all the members of that court, made an extended review of the authorities, and observed that if the state decision was regarded as conclusive upon the parties, 'the constitutional right of the complainant, as a citizen of a state other than Ohio, to have its rights as a mortgagee defined and adjudged by a court of the United States, is of no real value. If this court cannot for itself examine these street contracts and determine their validity, effect, and duration, and must follow the interpretation and construction placed on them by another court in a suit begun after its rights as mortgagee had accrued, and to which it was not a party, then the right of such a mortgagee to have a hearing before judgment and a trial before execution is a matter of form without substance. The better forum for a suitor so situated would be a court of the state. . . . The validity, effect, and duration of the street easements granted or claimed under these laws and ordinances is a question which this complainant is entitled to have decided by the courts of the United States, and the opinion of the supreme court of Ohio, while entitled to the highest respect as a tribunal of exalted ability, can be given no greater weight or respect than its reasoning shall demand, where the contract rights of a citizen of another state are involved, who was neither a party nor privy to the suit in which that opinion was delivered. The special fact, therefore, which justifies us in determining for ourselves the true meaning and validity of the Ohio statutes and city ordinances out of which the rights of this complainant spring is the fact that it is a citizen of \n\n[215 U.S. 349, 366]\n\u00a0\n another state, and that the contract under which it has acquired an interest originated prior to the judicial opinion relied upon as foreclosing our judgment.'\n Upon the general question as to the duty of the Federal court to exercise its independent judgment where there had not been a decision of the state court on the question involved, before the rights of the parties accrued, Carroll County v. Smith, \n111 U.S. 556\n, 28 L. ed. 517, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 539, and Great Southern Fire Proof Hotel Co. v. Jones, \n193 \nU.S. 532, 548\n, 48 S. L. ed. 778, 787, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 576, are pertinent. In the first- named case the court was confronted with a question as to the validity under the state Constitution of a certain statute of the state. Mr. Justice Matthews, delivering the unanimous judgment of the court, said: 'It was not a rule previously established, so as to have become recognized as settled law, and which, of course, all parties to transactions afterwards entered into would be presumed to know and to conform to. When, therefore, it is presented for application by the courts of the United States, in a litigation growing out of the same facts, of which they have jurisdiction by reason of the citizenship of the parties, the plaintiff has a right, under the Constitution of the United States, to the independent judgment of those courts, to determine for themselves what is the law of the state, by which his rights are fixed and governed. It was to that very end that the Constitution granted to citizens of one state, suing in another, the choice of resorting to a Federal tribunal. Burgess v. Seligman, \n107 \nU.S. 20, 33\n, 27 S. L. ed. 359, 365, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 10.' The other case-Great Southern Fire Proof Hotel Co. v. Jones-presented a controversy between citizens of different states. It was sought by the plaintiffs, citizens of Pennsylvania, to enforce a mechanics' lien upon certain real property in Ohio. The main question was as to the validity of a statute of Ohio under which the alleged lien arose. It was contended that a particular decision of the state court, holding the statute to be a violation of the state Constitution, was conclusive upon the Federal court. But this court, following the rules announced in Burgess v. Seligman, rejected \n\n[215 U.S. 349, 367]\n\u00a0\n that view by a unanimous vote. It said: 'If, prior to the making of the contracts between the plaintiffs and McClain, the state court had adjudged that the statute in question was in violation of the state Constitution, it would have been the duty of the circuit court, and equally the duty of this court, whatever the opinion of either court as to the proper construction of that instrument, to accept such prior decision as determining the rights of the parties accruing thereafter. But the decision of the state court, as to the constitutionality of the statute in question, having been rendered after the rights of parties to this suit had been fixed by their contracts, the circuit court would have been derelict in duty if it had not exercised its independent judgment touching the validity of the statute here in question. In making this declaration we must not be understood as at all qualifying the principle that, in all cases, it is the duty of the Federal court to lean to an agreement with the state court, where the issue relates to matters depending upon the construction of the Constitution or laws of the state.'\n It has been suggested-and the suggestion cannot be passed without notice-that the views we have expressed herein are not in harmony with some recent utterances of this court, and we are referred to East Central Eureka Min. Co. v. Central Eureka Min. Co. \n204 \nU.S. 266, 272\n, 51 S. L. ed. 476, 481, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 258. That case involved, among other questions, the meaning of a deed for mining property. This court, in its opinion, referred to a decision of the state court as to the real object of the deed, and expressed its concurrence with the views of that court. That was quite sufficient to dispose of the case. But in the opinion it was further said: 'The construction and effect of a conveyance between private parties is a matter as to which we follow the court of the state'-citing Brine v. Hartford F. Ins. Co. \n96 \nU.S. 627, 636\n, 24 S. L. ed. 858, 861; De Vaughn v. Hutchinson, \n165 U.S. 566\n, 41 L. ed. 827, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 461. Even if the broad language just quoted seems to give some support to the contention of the defendant, it is to be observed that no reference is made in the opinion to the \n\n[215 U.S. 349, 368]\n\u00a0\n numerous cases, some of which are above cited, holding that the Federal court is not bound, in cases between citizens of different states, to follow the state decision, if it was rendered after the date of the transaction out of which the rights of the parties arose. Certainly there was no purpose on the part of the court to overrule or to modify the doctrines of those cases; and the broad language quoted from East Central Eureka Min. Co. v. Central Eureka Min. Co. must therefore be interpreted in the light of the particular cases cited to support the view which that language imports. What were those cases and what did they decide?\n Brine v. Hartford F. Ins. Co., one of the cases cited, was a suit in the Federal circuit court to foreclose a mortgage on real estate. A foreclosure and sale were had, and the decree, following the established rules of the Federal court, allowed the defendant to pay the mortgage debt in one hundred days; and if the debt was not paid within that time, then the master was ordered to sell the land for cash, in accordance with the course and practice of the Federal court. When the mortgage was made, there was in force in Illionis, and had been for many years, a statute which, if controlling, allowed the defendant in a foreclosure suit twelve months after sale to redeem the land sold. Thus, there was a conflict between the local statute and the rules and practice obtaining in the Federal court, and the question was whether the state statute or those rules governed the rights of the parties as to the time of redemption. This court held that the statute of the state, being in force when the mortgage in question was executed, entered into the contract between the parties and, must control the determination of their rights. Speaking by Mr. Justice Miller, it said: 'The legislature of Illinois has prescribed, as an essential element of the transfer by the courts in foreclosure suits, that there shall remain to the mortgagor the right of redemption for twelve months, and to judgment creditors a similar right for fifteen months, after the sale, before the right of the purchaser to the title becomes vested.\n This \n\n[215 U.S. 349, 369]\n\u00a0\n right, as a condition on which the title passes, is as obligatory on the Federal courts as on the state courts, because in both cases it is made a rule of property by the legislature, which had the power to prescribe such a rule. . . . At all events, the decisions of this court are numerous that the laws which prescribe the mode of enforcing a contract, which are in existence when it is made, are so far a part of the contract that no changes in these laws which seriously interfere with that enforcement are valid, because they impair its obligation, within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States. Edwards v. Kearzey, \n96 U.S. 595\n, 24 L. ed. 793. That this very right of redemption, after a sale under a decree of foreclosure, is a part of the contract of mortgage, where the law giving the right exists when the contract is made, is very clearly stated by Mr. Chief Justice Taney, in the case of Bronson v. Kinzie, 1 How. 311, 11 L. ed. 143. De Vaughn v. Hutchinson, \n165 U.S. 566\n, 41 L. ed. 827, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 461, the other case cited, involved the construction of a will made in 1867, devising real estate in the District of Columbia, and the decision was based upon the law of Maryland as it had been often declared by the courts of Maryland to be while this District was part of that state,-indeed, as it was from the time Maryland became an independent state.\n It thus appears that, in the Brine Case, the rights of the parties were determined in conformity with a valid local statute in force when those rights accrued; while in the DeVaughn Case, the decision was based upon the law of Maryland, while the District was a part of that state, evidenced by a series of decisions made by the highest court of Maryland, before the rights of parties accrued. Nothing in this opinion is opposed to anything said or decided in either of those cases. The question here involved as to the scope and effect of the writing given by Kuhn to Camden does not depend upon any statute of West Virginia, nor upon any rule established by a course of decisions made before the rights of parties accrued. So that the words above quoted from East Central Eureka Min. Co. v. Central Eureka Min. Co. must not be interpreted as applicable to \n\n[215 U.S. 349, 370]\n\u00a0\n a case like the one before us, nor as denying the authority and duty of the Federal court, when determining the effect of conveyances or written instruments between private parties, citizens of different states, to exercise its own independent judgment where no authoritative state decision had been rendered by the state court before the rights of the parties accrued and became fixed.\n Without expressing any opinion as to the rights of the parties under their contract, we need only say that, for the reasons stated, the question sent to this court by the Circuit Court of Appeals is answered in the negative. It will be so certified.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes, dissenting:\n This is a question of the title to real estate. It does not matter in what form of action it arises, the decision must be the same in an action of tort that it would be in a writ of right. The title to real estate in general depends upon the statutes and decisions of the state within which it lies. I think it a thing to be regretted if, while in the great mass of cases the state courts finally determine who is the owner of land, how much he owns, and what he conveys by his deed, the courts of the United States, when by accident and exception the same question comes before them, do not follow what, for all ordinary purposes, is the law.\n I admit that plenty of language can be found in the earlier cases to support the present decision. That is not surprising, in view of the uncertainty and vacillation of the theory upon which Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, 10 L. ed. 865, and the later extensions of its doctrine, have proceeded. But I suppose it will be admitted on the other side that even the independent jurisdiction of the circuit courts of the United States is a jurisdiction only to declare the law, at least, in a case like the present, and only to declare the law of the state. It is not an authority to make it. Swift v. Tyson was justified on the ground \n\n[215 U.S. 349, 371]\n\u00a0\n that that was all that the state courts did. But, as has been pointed out by a recent accomplished and able writer, that fiction had to be abandoned and was abandoned when this court came to decide the municipal-bond cases, beginning with Gelpcke v. Dubuque, 1 Wall. 175, 17 L. ed. 520. Gray, Nature & Sources of the Law,  535-550. In those cases the court followed Chief Justice Taney in Ohio L. Ins. & T. Co. v. Debolt, 16 How. 416, 14 L. ed. 997, in recognizing the fact that decisions of state courts of last resort make law for the state. The principle is that a change of judicial decision after a contract has been made on the faith of an earlier one the other way is a change of the law.\n The cases of the class to which I refer have not stood on the ground that this court agreed with the first decision, but on the ground that the state decision made the law for the state, and therefore should be given only a prospective operation when contracts had been entered into under the law as earlier declared. Douglass v. Pike County, \n101 U.S. 677\n, 25 L. ed. 968; Green County v. Conness, \n109 U.S. 104\n, 27 L. ed. 872, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 69. In various instances this court has changed its decision or rendered different decisions on similar facts arising in different states, in order to conform to what is recognized as the local law. Fairfield v. Gallatin County, \n100 U.S. 47\n, 25 L. ed. 544.\n Whether Swift v. Tyson can be reconciled with Gelpcke v. Dubuque, I do not care to inquire. I assume both cases to represent settled doctrines, whether reconcilable or not. But the moment you leave those principles which it is desirable to make uniform throughout the United States, and which the decisions of this court tend to make uniform, obviously it is most undesirable for the courts of the United States to appear as interjecting an occasional arbitrary exception to a rule that in every other case prevails. I never yet have heard a statement of any reason justifying the power, and I find it hard to imagine one. The rule in Gelpcke v. Dubuque gives no help when the contract or grant in question has not been made on the faith of a previous declaration of \n\n[215 U.S. 349, 372]\n\u00a0\n law. I know of no authority in this court to say that, in general, state decisions shall make law only for the future. Judicial decisions have had retrospective operation for near a thousand years. There were enough difficulties in the way, even in cases like Gelpcke v. Dubuque, but in them there was a suggestion or smack of constitutional right. Here there is nothing of that sort. It is said that we must exercise our independent judgment-but as to what? Surely, as to the law of the states. Whence does that law issue? Certainly not from us. But it does issue, and has been recognized by this court as issuing, from the state courts as well as from the state legislatures. When we know what the source of the law has said that it shall be, our authority is at an end. The law of a state does not become something outside of the state court, and independent of it, by being called the common law. Whatever it is called, it is the law as declared by the state judges, and nothing else.\n If, as I believe, my reasoning is correct, it justifies our stopping when we come to a kind of case that, by nature and necessity, is peculiarly local, and one as to which the latest intimations, and, indeed, decisions, of this court are wholly in accord with what I think to be sound law. I refer to the language of the court, speaking through Mr. Justice Miller, in Brine v. Hartford F. Ins. Co. \n96 U.S. 627\n, 24 L. ed. 858. To administer a different law 'is to introduce into the jurisprudence of the state of Illinois the discordant elements of a substantial right which is protected in one set of courts and denied in the other, with no superior to decide which is right.' I refer also to the unanimous decision in East Central Eureka Min. Co. v. Central Eureka Min. Co. \n204 \nU.S. 266, 272\n, 51 S. L. ed. 476, 481, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 258. It is admitted that we are bound by a settled course of decisions, irrespective of contract, because they make the law. I see no reason why we are less bound by a single one.\n Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice McKenna concur in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"We do not consider ourselves bound to follow the decisions of the state court in this case. When the transactions incontroversy occurred, and when the case was under the consideration of the circuit court. no construction of the statute had been given by the state tribunals contrary to that given by the circuit court. The Federal courts have an independent jurisdiction in the administration of state laws, coordinate with, and not subordinate to, that of the state courts, and are bound to exercise their own judgment as to the meaning and effect of those laws. The existence of two co-ordinate jurisdictions in the same territory is peculiar, and the results would be anomalous and inconvenient but for the exercise of mutual respect and deference. Since the ordinary administration of the law is carried on by the state courts, it necessarily happens that by the course of their decisions certain rules are established which become rules of property and action in the state, and have all the effect of law, and which it would be wrong to disturb. This is especially true with regard to the law of real estate and the construction of state constitutions and statutes. Such established rules are always regarded by the Federal courts, no less than by the state courts themselves, as authoritative declarations of what the law is. But where the law has not been thus settled, it is the right and duty of the Federal courts to exercise their own judgment; as they also always do in reference to the doctrines of commercial law and general jurisprudence. So, when contracts and transactions have been entered into, and rights have accrued thereon under a particular state of the decisions, or when there has been no decision, of the state tribunal, the Federal courts properly claim the right to adopt their own interpretation of the law applicable to the case, although a different interpretation may be adopted by the state courts after such rights have accrued. But, even in such cases, for the sake of harmony and to avoid confusion, the Federal courts will lean towards an agreement of views with the state courts if the question seems to them balanced with doubt. Acting on these principles, founded, as they are, on comity and good sense, the courts of the United States, without sacrificing their own dignity as independent tribunals, endeavor to avoid, and in most cases do avoid, any unseemly conflict with the well-considered decisions of the state courts. As, however, the very object of giving to the national courts jurisdiction to administer the laws of the states in controversies between citizens of different states was to institute independent tribunals, which it might be supposed would be unaffected by local prejudices and sectional views, it would be a dereliction of their duty not to exercise an independent judgment in cases not foreclosed by previous adjudications.' \n\n\n\n\n","96":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLADEW v. TENNESSEE COPPER CO.(1910)\nNo. 495\nArgued: October 19, 1910Decided: November 28, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 357, 358]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry B. Closson for appellants.\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 357, 359]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John H. Frantz, Howard Cornick, and Martin H. Vogel for appellee.\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 357, 361]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n This action in equity was brought by the present appellants, citizens of New York and of West Virginia, against the appellees, the Tennessee Copper Company, a corporation of New Jersey, and the Ducktown Sulphur, Copper, & Iron Company, Limited, a British corporation, each of those corporations having its chief office and place of business in Polk county, Tennessee, within the territorial jurisdiction of the circuit court.\n The business of each defendant is the mining, manufacturing, and producing of copper and sulphur ores and products. The plaintiffs are the joint owners in fee and in possession of more than 6,000 acres of land in Fannin, Gilmer, and Pickens counties, Georgia, and have the timber rights in other lands, exceeding 18,000 acres, in the same counties, just beyond the boundary line between Tennessee and Georgia. All these lands are devoted to forestry, have been and are of the greatest value, and contain various kinds of valuable trees. The plaintiffs employ the forests in the production of timber and bark. But for the acts of the defendants, as hereinafter stated, the lands would be sufficient to afford a continuous supply of lumber and bark in large quantities and for an indefinite period in the future. The lands have upon them forests and trees of different growth, which must receive attention and treatment in order to meet the future needs of forestry and bark industry. Before the commission by the defendants of the acts complained of, the \n\n[218 U.S. 357, 362]\n\u00a0\n forest and timber rights and holdings of plaintiffs approached $100,000 in value, and the damage alleged to be committed by the defendants will exceed $50,000.\n The defendants conduct their business in Tennessee within a short distance of plaintiffs' lands. Recently, before the bringing of this action, the defendants erected, or caused to be constructed, and still own, operate, and control, furnaces, smelters, and ovens, all in close proximity to one another, upon lands owned or leased by them in Polk county, Tennessee. In view of those facts the plaintiffs allege that both in law and equity they are possessed of 'a right and claim in, to, and against the lands and tenements of the defendants in the nature of an easement thereupon that the same shall not be used in a manner to injure or destroy the said lands and forests [in Georgia] of your orators, adjacent thereto, as aforesaid. But the defendants, by means of said furnaces, smelters, and ovens maintained by them upon their lands as aforesaid, and in other ways, are, and for some time past have been, generating and causing to be discharged into the atmosphere, vast quantities of smoke, sulphur fumes, and noxious and poisonous vapors and gases and other deleterious substances. Within a short distance from the works and property of the defendants the said smoke, fumes, vapors, and gases and other deleterious substances so generated by each respectively inextricably mingle and are together discharged upon the lands and forests and trees of your orators, and as a result thereof great damage has been done and injury is threatened, as hereinafter appears.'\n The plaintiffs further allege that said fumes, gases, and vapors have already destroyed a considerable portion of their forests and trees; that unless they receive the relief asked their entire holdings will be destroyed, and their property and interests rendered valueless; that such fumes, gases, and vapors have descended upon \n\n[218 U.S. 357, 363]\n\u00a0\n plaintiffs' forests and trees, killing the trees and ruining the timber; that the destruction so created and produced is constantly increasing in extent, and includes forests and trees of every variety and species, and in all stages of growth and development; that the taller trees that serve to protect the smaller growth have been the first to suffer damage and destruction; that the enlargement of the zone of destruction is due to the fact that the death of the trees already brought about permits the smoke, fumes, gases, and vapors that are constantly increasing in quantity to travel farther before being absorbed; that the forests and timber, destroyed as stated, would have made good lumber, railroad ties, and tan bark, and could have been utilized for purposes of trade and commerce; and that the acts of the defendants, unless restrained by the court, will destroy all the forests, old and young, as well as the timber and bark rights of the plaintiffs.\n The bill also alleges that the smoke, fumes, gases, and vapors so generated and discharged on the property of the plaintiffs will destroy all forms of plant and tree life, including vegetables, crops, grasses, and orchards; that by such destruction the soil loses all moisture and compactness, and, being washed away by the rains, the remaining part of plaintiffs' lands will be rendered bare and barren; that the smoke, fumes, gases, and vapors are unwholesome and injurious to the life and health of all coming in contact with them, and render the lands unfit for occupancy; and that the plaintiffs, as well as the Bureau of Forestry of the United States, have frequently demanded that defendants abate the above nuisance, but the latter have refused to obey such demand, leaving plaintiffs no other alternative except to seek an injunction to prevent the above wrongs.\n The specific relief asked is a decree that the defendants shall not use their property in Tennessee so as to destroy \n\n[218 U.S. 357, 364]\n\u00a0\n or injure the plaintiffs' lands and forests in Georgia; that the alleged nuisance maintained by defendants be abated under the direction of the court, through its own officers or oherwise, as shall seem suitable and right; and that the defendants be enjoined 'from maintaining, operating, directing, or permitting upon their land or premises [in Tennessee] the operation or maintenance of any oven, roast heap, pit, furnace, or appliance generating or giving forth any of the smoke, gases, fumes, or vapors hereinbefore complained of, or otherwise generating, producing, or causing any foul or dense or copper or sulphurous smoke, or any noxious, poisonous, unhealthy, or disagreeable, or in any manner injurious, vapor, gas, fume, or odor upon the territory or lands of your orators' [in Georgia].\n Such was the case made by the plaintiffs' allegations in their bill.\n The summons was served in Polk county, Tennessee, on the general manager of the Tennessee Copper Company, the highest officer of that corporation; on the British corporation, by leaving a copy with its acting general manager in the same county. Each defendant corporation has, as already indicated, its main office, and is conducting its business, in that county.\n The copper company, the New Jersey corporation, appeared for the special and sole purpose of objecting to the jurisdiction of the circuit court. The British corporation appeared for the special purpose only of entering a motion to dismiss the bill for want of jurisdiction as to it, as well as for want of proper parties. The court, speaking by Judge Sanford, who delivered a well-considered opinion in the case, sustained the motion of the Tennessee corporation, and dismissed the bill as to it. The motion of the British company was overruled, the court holding that it had jurisdiction over the alien corporation. 179 Fed. 245. There was no appeal by the latter corporation. \n\n[218 U.S. 357, 365]\n\u00a0\n The present appeal was taken only from that part of the decree dismissing the bill as to the New Jersey corporation.\n The plaintiffs, we have seen, are citizens of New York and West Virginia, while the Tennessee Copper Company is a corporation of New Jersey. But under the statutes regulating the jurisdiction of the circuit courts of the United States, diversity of citizenship-nothing more appearing-will not give authority to circuit courts of the United States to render a judgment in personam where, as here, neither the plaintiffs nor the defendants are inhabitants of the district in which the suit was brought, and where the defendant appears specially and objects to jurisdiction being exercised over it. The defendant corporation, not an inhabitant of the district where suit is brought, cannot be compelled against its will to submit to such jurisdiction for the purposes merely of a personal judgment. 18 Stat. at L. 470,  1, chap. 137, as amended and corrected in 1887 and 1888; 24 Stat. at L. 552, chap. 373; 25 Stat. at L. 433, chap. 866; U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508; Macon Grocery Co. v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. \n215 \nU.S. 501, 508\n, 510 S., 54 L. ed. 300, 304, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 184, and authorities there cited.\n The plaintiffs insist, however, that jurisdiction can be sustained by  8 of the act of March 3d, 1875, determining the jurisdiction of the circuit courts of the United States. 18 Stat. at L. 470, chap. 137. The 1st section of that act, as amended by the above act of 1888, 25 Stat. at L. 433, chap. 866, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508, correcting the enrolment of the act of March 3d, 1887 (24 Stat. at L. 552, chap. 373), provides that a suit founded only on the fact of the diversity of citizenship between the parties shall be brought only in the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant. But the plaintiffs contend that that section is not to be interpreted apart from the other sections of the same act. Section 8 has relation to the 1st section, and contains provisions that refer to an exceptional class of cases. \n\n[218 U.S. 357, 366]\n\u00a0\n The two sections relate to the same general subject, and must be regarded as embodying a scheme of jurisdiction. Considered together, they mean that, if jurisdiction is founded only on diversity of citizenship, the circuit court may, without its process being personally served on the defendant, within its jurisdiction, exert the jurisdiction given by the 8th section in the particular cases and for the special purposes therein specified,- its power in such cases being, of course, restricted as in that section prescribed. Such is the argument of the plaintiffs.\n The 8th section of the act of 1875 provides: 'That when in any suit commenced in any circuit court of the United States, to enforce any legal or equitable lien upon, or claim to, or to remove any encumbrance or lien or cloud upon the title to, real or personal property within the district where such suit is brought, one or more of the defendants therein shall not be an inhabitant of, or found within, the said district, or shall not voluntarily appear thereto, it shall be lawful for the court to make an order directing such absent defendant or defendants to appear, plead, answer, or demur, by a day certain to be designated, which order shall be served on such absent defendant or defendants, if practicable, wherever found, and also upon the person or persons in possession or charge of said property, if any there be; or where such personal service upon such absent defendant or defendants is not practicable, such order shall be published in such manner as the court may direct, not less than once a week for six consecutive weeks; and in case such absent defendant shall not appear, plead, answer, or demur within the time so limited, or within some further time to be allowed by the court, in its discretion, and upon proof of the service or publication of said order, and of the performance of the directions contained in the same, it shall be lawful for the court to entertain jurisdiction, and proceed to the hearing and adjudication of such suit \n\n[218 U.S. 357, 367]\n\u00a0\n in the same manner as if such absent defendant had been served with process within the said district; but said adjudication shall, as regards said absent defendant or defendants without appearance, effect only the property which shall have been the subject of the suit, and under the jurisdiction of the court therein, within such district. . . .'\n Substantially, the contentions of plaintiffs are that the mode in which the defendant uses its real property in Tennessee, within the jurisdiction of the circuit court, creates a nuisance injuriously affecting their property near by in the state of Georgia; that, according to the settled principles of law, they are entitled to have the defendant corporation restrained from so using its Tennessee property as to injure their property in Georgia; and that the right to such protection against the effects of that nuisance, as maintained by the defendant in Tennessee, should, within the fair meaning of the act of 1875, be deemed a 'claim to . . . real property . . . within the district where such suit is brought,'- such property, it is alleged, being so used in Tennessee as to create a nuisance, causing injury to the plaintiff's property in Georgia.\n Manifestly, unless the plaintiffs can sustain this proposition and bring their case within the 8th section of act of 1875, there is no ground whatever to maintain the jurisdiction of the circuit court as to the defendant corporation; certainly not, as we have said, for the purposes of a personal judgment against the defendant company, since neither the plaintiffs nor the defendant are inhabitants of the district in which the suit was brought, and the defendant corporation refuses to voluntarily appear and submit to the jurisdiction of the court.\n We are of opinion that under no reasonable interpretation of the 8th section can the plaintiffs' case be held to belong to the class of exceptional cases mentioned in \n\n[218 U.S. 357, 368]\n\u00a0\n that section. In no just sense can their cause of action be said to constitute 'a claim to' real property in the district. They cannot be regarded as having a 'claim to' the leased land or premises on which the alleged nuisance is maintained. It may be that what the defendant is charged with doing creates a nuisance. It may also be that the defendant company wrongfully uses and has used its property in Tennessee in such way as to seriously injure the property of plaintiffs, near by in Georgia, and that plaintiffs are legally entitled by some mode of proceeding in some court to have the alleged nuisance abated, and their property in Georgia protected in the manner asked by them. But it does not follow that they can invoke the authority of the circuit court of the United States for the protection of their property against the defendant's acts. The jurisdiction of the circuit courts is determined by acts of Congress enacted in pursuance of the Constitution. Apart from the powers that are inherent in a judical tribunal, after such tribunal has been lawfully created, the circuit courts can exercise no jurisdiction not conferred upon them by legislative enactment. It is quite sufficient now to say, without discussion, that it would be a most violent construction of the 8th section of the act of 1875 to hold that the right to have abated the nuisance in question arising from the use in Tennessee of defendant's property, because of the injurious effects upon plaintiffs' real property in Georgia, creates, in the meaning of the statute, a 'claim to' real property within the district where the suit is brought. There is absolutely no foundation for such a position. We do not mean to say that Congress, in cases of controversies between citizens of different states, might not so enlarge the scope of the statute regulating the jurisdiction of the Federal courts as to enable the circuit court, sitting in Tennessee, to suppress the nuisance in question. Upon that question \n\n[218 U.S. 357, 369]\n\u00a0\n we have no occasion at this time to express an opinion. Still less do we say that the plaintiffs have not an efficient remedy in some court, either against the defendant corporation, or against the several individuals who, under its sanction, or by its authority, are maintaining in Tennessee the nuisance complained of. We only mean to say-and cannot properly go further in this case-that the statute in question does not cover this particular case, and that the United States circuit court, sitting in Tennessee,-the New Jersey company refusing to voluntarily appear in the suit as a defendant,-is without jurisdiction to give the plaintiffs, citizens of New York and West Virginia, the particular relief asked against that corporation.\n The bill was properly dismissed for want of jurisdiction in the Circuit Court, and the decree below is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.

The allegations of the complaint are lengthy, but the material facts set forth are as follows: The plaintiff was incorporated in 1867 as a rural cemetery under a general act. The land in question had been dedicated as a burying ground, being at that time outside the city limits, and a mile or two away from dwellings and business. It was conveyed to the plaintiff, and later a grant of the same was obtained from the city in consideration of $24,139.79, which sum the city retains. The land has been used as a cemetery ever since; forty thousand lots have been sold, and over two million dollars have been spent by the lot owners, and other large sums by the plaintiff, in preparing and embellishing the grounds. By the terms of the abovementioned general statute the lots, after a burial in them, are inalienable, and descend to the heirs of the owner, and the plaintiff is bound to apply the proceeds of sales to the improvement, embellishment, and preservation of the grounds. There is land still unsold, estimated to be worth $75,000. There now are many dwellings near the cemetery, but it is alleged to be in no way injurious to health, or offensive, or otherwise an interference with the enjoyment of property or life. There also is an allegation that there are within the city large tracts, some of them vacant and some of them containing several hundred acres, in several of which interments could be made more than a mile distant from any inhabitants or highway. The ordinance in question begins with a recital that 'the burial of the dead within the city and county of San Francisco is dangerous to life and detrimental to the public health,' and goes on to forbid such burial under a penalty of fine, imprisonment, or both. The complaint sets up that it violates article 1,  8, and the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. \n\n[216 U.S. 358, 364]\n\u00a0\n The answer denied some of the above statements on the ground of ignorance, and categorically denied the averment as to the large vacant tracts available for burying within the city. The defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings, the notice showing the ground to be that the complaint did not state a cause of action, but going on to say that the motion would be made upon all the papers on file. The motion was granted, and an exception to the judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. 152 Cal. 464, 93 Pac. 70, 14 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 1080. As the state court and the arguments before us assumed the material allegations of the complaint to be true, we shall assume that the judgment was ordered upon the complaint without regard to the denials in the answer, although it was then on file.\n The only question that needs to be answered, if not the only one before us, is whether the plaintiff's property is taken contrary to the 14th Amendment. In considering it, the allegation as to the large tracts available for burying purposes may be laid on one side. The plaintiff has no grievance with regard to them. The Winnebago (Iroquois Transp. Co. v. Delaney Forge & Iron Co.) \n205 \nU.S. 354, 360\n, 51 S. L. ed. 836, 839, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 509. Moreover, it is said by the supreme court of the state that burial within the San Francisco city or county limits already was forbidden by statute, except in existing cemeteries or such as might be established by the board of supervisors. The board of supervisors passed the ordinance now complained of; so that, as pointed out by the court, the ordinance in effect merely prohibited burials in existing cemeteries. It was, therefore, a specific determination by the lawmaking authority as to the relation of those cemeteries to their respective neighborhoods, and the question is whether the court can say that it was wrong.\n To aid its contention, and in support of the averment that its cemetery, although now bordered by many dwellings, is in no way harmful, the plaintiff refers to opinions of scientific men who have maintained that the popular belief is a superstition. Of these we are asked, by implication, to take judicial \n\n[216 U.S. 358, 365]\n\u00a0\n notice, to adopt, them, and, on the strength of our acceptance, to declare the foundation of the ordinance a mistake and the ordinance void. It may be, in a matter of this kind, were the finding of fact is merely a premise to laying down a rule of law, that this court has power to form its own judgment without the aid of a jury. Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. \n211 \nU.S. 210, 227\n, 53 S. L. ed. 150, 159, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 67. But whatever the tribunal, in questions of this kind great caution must be used in overruling the decision of the local authorities, or in allowing it to be overruled. No doubt this court has gone a certain distance in that direction. Dobbins v. Los Angeles, \n195 U.S. 223\n, 49 L. ed. 169, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 18; Lochner v. New York, \n198 U.S. 45\n, 58, et seq., 49 L. ed. 937, 942, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 539, 3 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 1133. But it has expressed through the mouth of the same judge who delivered the judgment in the case last cited the great reluctance that it feels to interfere with the deliberate decisions of the highest court of the state whose people are directly concerned. Welch v. Swasey, \n214 \nU.S. 91, 106\n, 53 S. L. ed. 923, 930, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 567. The reluctance must be redoubled when, as here, the opinion of that court confirms a specific determination concerning the same spot, previously reached by the body that made the law. See French v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co. \n181 \nU.S. 324, 341\n, 45 S. L. ed. 879, 888, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 625; Smith v. Worcester, 182 Mass. 232, 234, 235, 59 L.R.A. 728, 65 N. E. 40.\n But the propriety of deferring a good deal to the tribunals on the spot is not the only ground for caution. If every member of this bench clearly agreed that burying grounds were centers of safety, and thought the board of supervisors and the supreme court of California wholly wrong, it would not dispose of the case. There are other things to be considered. Opinion still may be divided, and if, on the hypothesis that the danger is real, the ordinance would be valid, we should not overthrow it merely because of our adherence to the other belief. Similar arguments were pressed upon this court with regard to vaccination, but they did not prevail. On the contrary, evidence that vaccination was deleterious was held properly to have been excluded. Jacobson v. Massachusetts, \n197 U.S. 11\n, 49 L. ed. 643, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 358, 3 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 765, S. C. 183 Mass. 242, 67 L.R.A. 935, 66 N. E. 719. See \n\n[216 U.S. 358, 366]\n\u00a0\n Otis v. Parker, \n187 \nU.S. 606, 608\n, 609 S., 47 L. ed. 323, 327, 328, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 168. Again, there may have been other grounds fortifying the ordinance besides those recited in the preamble. And yet again, the extent to which legislation may modify and restrict the uses of property consistently with the Constitution is not a question for pure abstract theory alone. Tradition and the habits of the community count for more than logic. Since, as before the making of constitutions, regulation of burial and prohibition of it in certain spots, especially in crowded cities, have been familiar to the Western world. This is shown sufficiently by the cases cited by the court below; e. g., Coates v. New York, 7 Cow. 585; Kincaid's Appeal, 66 Pa. 411, 5 Am. Rep. 377; Sohicr v. Trinity Church, 109 Mass. 1, 21; Carpenter v. Yeadon, 86 C. C. A. 122, 158 Fed. 766. The plaintiff must wait until there is a change of practice, or at least an established consensus of civilized opinion, before it can expect this court to overthrow the rules that the lawmakers and the court of his own state uphold.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McKenna took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","98":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEHIGH VALLEY R. CO. v. CORNELL STEAMBOAT CO(1910)\nNo. 18\nArgued: October 27, 1910Decided: November 7, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. William S. Montgomery and George H. Emerson for appellant.[ Lehigh Valley R Co v. Cornell Steamboat Co \n218 U.S. 264\n (1910) ]\n\n\n[218 U.S. 264, 266]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. Parker Kirlin and Amos Van Etten for appellee.\n\n\n[218 U.S. 264, 269]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a libel for contribution. The libel was excepted to by the claimant and was dismissed on the ground that the district court, sitting as a court of admiralty, had no jurisdiction to enforce contribution between the parties on the facts.\n The facts alleged are as follows. The appellant was in possession of the tug Slatington under a demise, and the tug was crossing the North river with car float No. 22 alongside on the port side. The tug Ira M. Hedges was coming up the river on the port side with two stone scows in tow, one on each side. There was a collision between one of those scows, the Helen, and car float No. 22, which was caused or contributed to by the Ira M. Hedges. The owner of the Helen, not being the owner of the Ira M. Hedges, brought an action at common law and recovered a judgment against the appellant, the owner of the Ira M. Hedges not being made a party defendant in that suit. The appellant paid the judgment and brought this libel against the Ira M. Hedges, in terms to recover the amount of the claim set forth in the libel, but, it fairly may be held, in substance to recover, if not the whole, \n\n[218 U.S. 264, 270]\n\u00a0\n then contribution for what the libellant has had to expend.\n The first question is whether this court has jurisdiction of the appeal. It is said that the dismissal of the libel, although expressed to be for want of jurisdiction, really is on the merits, because payment of a judgment at common law is not a ground for contribution from a joint wrongdoer, not a party to the suit. There sometimes is difficulty in distinguishing between matters going to the jurisdiction and those determining the merits. Fauntleroy v. Lum, \n210 \nU.S. 230, 235\n, 52 S. L. ed. 1039, 1041, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 641), and, no doubt, this case presents that difficulty. But perhaps it may be said that the two considerations coalesce here. The admiralty has a limited jurisdiction. If there are no merits in the claim, it is of a kind that the admiralty not only ought not to enforce, but has no power to enforce. At all events, the form of the decree must be taken to express the meaning of the judge. If the decree was founded, as it purports to be, on a denial of jurisdiction in the court, this court has jurisdiction of the appeal. For all admiralty jurisdiction belongs to courts of the United States as such, and therefore the denial of jurisdiction brings the appeal within the established rule. See The Jefferson, \n215 \nU.S. 130, 138\n, 54 S. L. ed. 125, 128, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 54.\n Coming to the substance, we are of opinion that the decision was wrong. The right to contribution belongs to the substantive law of the admiralty. Erie R. Co. v. Erie & W. Transp. Co. \n204 U.S. 220\n, 51 L. ed. 450, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 246. It is not a mere incident of a form of procedure. Therefore the fact, over which the libellant had no control, that the injured party saw fit to sue at common law, cannot take that right away. The passing of the claim against the libellant into the form of a judgment before the claim was satisfied has no bearing upon the question whether the right to contribution remains. It does not matter to this question, even if it be true, as thought by the court below, \n\n[218 U.S. 264, 271]\n\u00a0\n that the libellant might have required the owner of the Ira M. Hedges to be made a party. For it still would have rested with the plaintiff in the former suit to collect from the appellant alone if it saw fit, and, if it had done so, it is at best but a speculation to suggest that the libellant could have recovered from its codefendant at common law.\n The question as to what is conclusively established by the common-law judgment is not before us, but only the jurisdiction of the court. But we may add that the appellant seeks to recover contribution for the amount paid, not as res judicata, but as one of the consequences of a joint tort from which it could not escape, and which its fellow wrongdoer was bound to contemplate. The claimant, of course, does not desire to dispute the appellant's negligence. It is free to deny its own. Whether if it were so minded it could controvert the amount of the damage as determined by the judgment need not be discussed. No doubt it would have been a prudent course for the appellant to give notice to the owner of the Ira M. Hedges to take part in the defense, with a view to its possible ultimate liability. Whether a failure to do so would affect its rights is not before us to decide. We do not mean to intimate that the failure is material where there has been a bona fide defense. Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","99":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEWIS v.

Fauntleroy for plaintiff in error.\n Solicitor General Bowers and Assistant Attorney General Harr for defendant in error.\n\n Per Curiam:\n Lewis was indicted December 1, 1905, in the district court of the United States for the eastern district of Missouri, charged with depositing certain letters in a post-office of the United States in pursuance of a scheme to defraud, in violation of  5480 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3696).\n General orders continuing all pending criminal cases were thereafter entered at each term until November 5, 1907, when plaintiff in error, defendant below, moved for a discharge from the accusations of the indictment, upon the ground that his right to a speedy trial had been denied. The court ordered that unless the cause should be proceeded with at that term the motion would be sustained; but later all pending criminal cases were again continued by general order.\n At the following May term, defendant below again filed a motion to discharge, and the United States attorney asked leave to enter a nolle prosequi. Defendant's motion was overruled and the nolle prosequi entered, releasing and discharging defendant from further prosecution upon the indictment. A motion to set aside the nolle prosequi was made and overruled, and this writ of error direct to this court sued out under  5 of the act of March 3, 1891. [26 Stat. at L. 827, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549.]\n It thus appears that this is an appeal by a person indicted for crime from an order of the court releasing and discharging him from further prosecution under the indictment. Plaintiff in error could not complain until he was made to suffer (Ohio ex rel. Lloyd v. Dollison, \n194 U.S. 445\n, 48 L. ed. 1062, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 703), and when discharged from custody he is not legally aggrieved, and therefore cannot appeal (Com. v. Graves, 112 Mass. 282; Anglo-American Provision Co. v. Davis Provision Co. \n191 U.S. 376\n, 48 L. ed. 228, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 93). \n\n[216 U.S. 611, 613]\n\u00a0\n The indictment having been dismissed, the question as to plaintiff in error's constitutional right to a speedy trial is not involved in such a real sense as to give this court jurisdiction (Lampasas v. Bell, \n180 U.S. 276\n, 45 L. ed. 527, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 368) for certain violations of  5480 of the Revised Statutes, alleged to have been committed on the 1st day of February, 1904. That indictment having been nolle prossed, and no new indictment appearing to have been returned against him within three years from the date of the commission of the alleged offenses, or, if returned, to be still pending, it is manifest that he has been discharged by the statute of limitations, and that this case, in the circumstances disclosed, has become merely a moot case.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","100":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLORD v. U S(1910)\nNo. 162\nArgued: April 20, 1910Decided: May 2, 1910\n\n\n\n The appellants, doing business as architects under the name of Lord & Hewlett, brought this action to recover from the United States the sum of $ 75,000 as due them on account of certain transactions relating to a public building which the United States proposed to have constructed and used by the Department of Agriculture.\n The court of claims adjudged, upon the facts found, that the plaintiffs had no cause of action against the United States, and dismissed the claimants' petition.\n The material facts are as will be now stated: By the act of March 2d, 1901, chap. 805, Congress appropriated the sum of $5,000, to be immediately available, \n\n[217 U.S. 340, 341]\n\u00a0\n 'to enable the Secretary of Agriculture to have prepared, under his direction, plans for a fireproof administrative building, to be erected on the grounds of the Department of Agriculture, in the city of Washington, said plans, and such recommendations thereon as the Secretary of Agriculture may deem necessary, to be transmitted to Congress at its next regular session.' 31 Stat. at L. 922, 938.\n Thereafter, the Supervising Architect of the Treasury Department prepared what is described in the record as a 'programme and conditions of a competition for a building for the Department of Agriculture.' That programme was approved by the Secretary of Agriculture. It recited the purpose to obtain designs for the proposed building by competition between ten architects of good professional standing and citizens of the United States, to be designated by a special commission, and consisting of the Secretary of Agriculture, the Supervising Architect of the Treasury, and three named persons not in the service of the government, who should report as to the relative merits of the designs submitted. The programme contained, among other provisions, the following: 'It must be understood, however, that while the ultimate purpose of the competition is the selection of an architect, the act does not provide for a building, but simply for a design to be approved by Congress at the next session; and, therefore, while it is to be supposed that the architect or firm of architects whose design shall be placed first in this competition will receive the commission to carry out the work when the building is authorized, it must be understood that the Secretary of Agriculture has no authority at this time to enter into any contract further than is provided for by this programme. The programme sets forth, approximately, the conditions and location of the building, modifications of which may become necessary. If Congress provides for the erection of the building, the selected architect is then to prepare such design or designs as may, in the judgment of the Supervising Architect of the Treasury, be necessary to meet the \n\n[217 U.S. 340, 342]\n\u00a0\n conditions finally adopted by him. . . . The three members of this commission, not in government service, shall receive in full compensation for their services, including traveling and subsistence expenses, the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250). . . . A uniform sum of three hundred and fifty dollars ($350) will be paid to each of the competitors invited, with the understanding and agreement that unless otherwise provided for by act of Congress, the architect or architects whose design shall be placed first will be awarded the commission for carrying out the work, at a fee computed on the basis of the schedule of charges adopted by the American Institute of Architects. It must be understood that no claim shall be made upon the United States by any competitor for any fee, percentage, or payment whatever, or for any expense incident to or growing out of his participation in this competition, other than is expressly provided for by the terms mentioned herein.'\n On the 24th of October, 1901, the appellants-who were among the ten architects selected to furnish necessary designs in competition-received notice from the Secretary of Agriculture that their plans for the building were selected by the commission, and they received and accepted the compensation ($350) which had been fixed by the programme of competition as full compensation for this preliminary work. Subsequently, October 28th, 1901, the Secretary of Agriculture notified Congress that the award had been made to the appellants.\n However, the parties, after discussion, concurred in the view that, as the Department proposed a building of increased size and of more expensive materials, the cost would probably amount to $2,500,000, and a bill appropriating that amount was sent to Congress for its consideration and action. But Congress took no action on the general subject of a public building for the Agricultural Department until February 9th, 1903, when, without the knowledge of the Secretary of Agriculture, it passed an act entitled, 'An Act for the Erection of a \n\n[217 U.S. 340, 343]\n\u00a0\n Building for the Use and Accommodation of the Department of Agriculture.' That act, it may be observed, did not refer to the above act of 1901, or to anything done under it. It yet provided for a commodious fireproof building on the grounds of the Department of Agriculture for the use of that Department and its Bureaus, 'to be constructed in accordance with plans to be procured, based on accurate estimates, providing for the erection of said building, complete in all of its details, as herein described, and within the total cost of not exceeding the sum herein stipulated, and he is hereby authorized, after procuring such plans, and after due advertisement for proposals, to enter into contracts within the limit of cost hereby fixed, and subject to appropriations to be made by Congress, for the erection of said building complete, including heating and ventilating apparatus, elevators, and approaches, and the removal of the present building or buildings of the Department of Agriculture on said grounds. Sec. 2. That the supervision of the construction of said building shall be placed in charge of an officer of the government especially qualified for the duty, to be appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture, subject to the approval of the head of the Department in which such officer is employed, who shall receive for his additional services an increase of 25 per centum of his present salary, such increase to be paid out of the appropriation for the building herein authorized. Sec. 3, That the limit of cost for the construction of said building complete, including heating and ventilating apparatus, elevators, and approaches, and the cost for removal of the present building or buildings of the Department of Agriculture, is hereby fixed at $1,500,000, and no contract shall be entered into or expenditure authorized in excess of said amount.' 32 Stat. at L. 806, chap. 528.\n The sundry civil appropriation act of March 3d, 1903, contained this additional provision: 'To commence the erection of a new building for the Department of Agriculture, authorized by the act approved February ninth, nineteen hundred \n\n[217 U.S. 340, 344]\n\u00a0\n and three, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, of which sum one hundred thousand dollars shall be immediately evailable; and the Secretary of Agriculture is hereby authorized to enter into a contract or contracts for the completion of said building within the limit of cost of one million, five hundred thousand dollars, fixed by said act.' 32 Stat. at L. 1139, chap. 1007\n\n\n Shortly after the passage of the act of March 2d, 1901, the Supervising Architect of the Treasury, Taylor, was designated by the Secretary of Agriculture as expert adviser, and an advisory building committee, of which B. T. Galloway was chairman, was also formed. It was found by the court of claims that 'neither Mr. Taylor nor any of the members of this committee had authority to enter into any contract or agreement with the claimants, which arrangement was continued under the act of 1903 until May 4, 1903, when Taylor was superseded as expert adviser to the Secretary of Agriculture by the appointment of Capt. John S. Sewell in his stead.'\n After the passage of the act of February 9th, 1903, negotiations were had with the claimants, in relation to the detail of plans and specifications for the erection of a building provided for in that act. But it is found that at no time prior to May 4th, 1903, when Sewell succeeded Taylor as expert adviser, 'had the claimants and the Secretary of Agriculture or any person or committee appointed by him to act for him, agreed upon or accepted any specific plans or specifications theretofore prepared and submitted by claimants for the erection of said building.' On the contrary, they could not agree, and their relations were terminated by the letter from the advisory committee, addressed to the appellants, under date of April 15th, 1903. Subsequently, negotiations between the parties were resumed, Capt. Sewell representing the Department as expert adviser. The findings state: 'On May 4, 1903, and subsequent thereto, the negotiations between claimants and Captain Sewell, superintendent, as aforesaid, had \n\n[217 U.S. 340, 345]\n\u00a0\n to do exclusively with the preparation and execution of a written contract providing for their employment as architects for said building. Captain Sewell had prepared and submitted to claimants two forms of contracts wherein claimants' compensation for services as architects for said building was fixed at 3 1\/2 per cent of contract price. After much lengthy correspondence, discussing the propriety of such a fee, and likewise the respective duties of the architects and superintendent of construction, provided for by the act of February 9, 1903, claimants declined to accept the terms of the said agreement, at the same time insisting that the compensation provided for in the original programme of the Secretary, to wit, 5 per cent, should obtain; that they were employed under and by virtue of said programme, and subsequent proceedings thereto.'\n The findings further show that on February 16th, 1903, Taylor, who was then expert adviser to the Secretary, had submitted to claimants for their examination and approval a form of contract looking toward their employment as architects for the construction of said building, in which contract the compensation set forth was 5 per cent of the sum expended in the erection of the same. Claimants do not appear to have examined, approved, executed, or returned said contract. What disposition was ever made of it is not shown. Finally, on May 13th, 1903, the Secretary of Agriculture addressed a letter to the claimants, in which he referred to the failure of the claimants to accept the above contracts submitted to them by the Department, and announced his purpose to look elsewhere than to them for assistance.\n Messrs. Charles Fuller, Paul Fuller, and Benjamin F. Tracy for appellants.\n\n\n[217 U.S. 340, 347]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General John Q. Thompson and Mr. George M. Anderson for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n This statement of the controlling facts is quite sufficient to show that the judgment below was right. We perceive no ground whatever for a judgment against the United States. Nothing done under the act of March 2d, 1901, created any obligation upon the part of the Secretary of Agriculture, as representing the United States, to proceed under the plans made by the appellants for the construction of the building \n\n[217 U.S. 340, 348]\n\u00a0\n referred to in that act. The 'programme' of competition, devised under that act by the Architect of the Treasury, under the direction of the Secretary, contemplated the payment of $350 to each of the ten competing architects, in full compensation for their services in preparing and submitting designs. That amount was paid to the appellants. And they were expressly informed by the above act that the plans and recommendations of the Secretary were to be transmitted to Congress. Besides, the programme of competition explicitly stated that the act did not provide for a building, but only for disigns to be approved by Congress. The Secretary was without authority under the act of 1901 to make any binding contract for the erection of the proposed building; and Congress, it seems, took no action in reference to the designs prepared by the appellants under that act. Nothing more was done by either side until Congress, by the act of February 9th, 1903, made independent provisions for the erection of a building for the use of the Department of Agriculture, at a cost not exceeding $1,500,000. But no contract was made under that act with the appellants. On the contrary, the minds of the parties never met as to the terms of any contract in execution of the provisions of the act of February 9th, 1903. The appellants declined to accept the contract prepared and submitted by the Department. Clearly, the appellants were not entitled, simply because of the acceptance of their plans, prepared under the act of 1901, to construct the building provided for in the separate, independent act of February 9th, 1903; and as no contract was made with them by the Secretary under the latter act, they have no cause of action against the United States.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","101":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOS ANGELES FARMING & MILLING CO. v.

In its complaint, the city of Los Angeles sets forth that it is the owner of the paramount right to take and use all of the water of said river, from its sources to the southern boundary of the city, so far as it is necessary to furnish a supply for the use of the city and its inhabitants; that the plaintiff in error owns its lands subject to such paramount right of the city to the use of the water, and claims adversely to the city and its estate and interest in said water right.\n The defendant answered, and, among other things, set up a denial of the alleged paramount rights of the city in the waters of the Los Angeles river, and alleges that it and its predecessors had been in the exclusive possession of said lands for more than fifty years, under claim of title, using the waters of the river riparian or appurtenant to its estate; that the value of the premises was over $500,000; that its lands were some 10 miles above the city, on the river; that the title to the lands and waters in controversy was first owned by the Crown of Spain, thence passing to the Republic of Mexico, which Republic, on June 17, 1846, granted to the predecessors of the Milling Company certain lands, which included the lands in controversy; that, by the treaty between the Republic of Mexico and the United States, the sovereign rights and titles of said Republic of Mexico in said property passed to and vested in the United States; that California upon its admission to the Union, was prohibited from passing any laws disposing of the public lands of the United States, or from doing any acts whereby the title of the United States in the public lands within its limits should be impaired or questioned; that the laws of the United States were extended over California, September 29, 1850; that the Congress of the United States passed an act, approved March 3, 1851 [9 Stat. at L. 631, chap. 41], providing for the ascertainment and settlement of the land \n\n[217 U.S. 217, 220]\n\u00a0\n claims derived from Spain or Mexico in the state of California, and created a board of land commissioners for that purpose; that all lands, the claim to which was rejected, or had not been presented, to said board, should be held and considered as part of the public domain of the United States; that claims of towns or cities should be presented under said act; that a grant to cities or towns existing July 7, 1846, should be presumed; that the decrees and patents issued by the tribunals under said act should be conclusive between the United States and the claimant; that the claims of the predecessors in interest of the Milling Company to its lands were duly presented to the board of land commissioners, and confirmed on January 8, 1873, and the patent of the United States was issued to them; and it is alleged that said patentee thereby became vested with the rights in fee simple to said lands and all the waters therein or riparian thereto. It is alleged that this patent is res judicata of the rights of the Milling Company; that under the act of March 3, 1851, the mayor and council of the city of Los Angeles presented to the said board of land commissioners a claim for 16 square leagues of land, known as the pueblo of Los Angeles, and for the water rights of the said Los Angeles river, for the use of the pueblo; that said claim was adjudged and affirmed to be valid to the extent of 4 square leagues, and held invalid as to the remainder thereof, and that a patent was issued by the United States to the city of Los Angeles on August 9, 1866, for 4 square leagues of land. The Milling Company sets up that this confirmation and patent in favor of the city is res judicata for 4 square leagues, and claims that the city is barred from setting up or claiming any title, ownership, or interest in or to the premises in controversy herein; that the sources and tributaries of the Los Angeles river are located on the public lands of the United States; that the legislature of California has passed certain acts, attempting to confer and grant to the city of Los Angeles paramount right to take and use all the waters of the Los Angeles river, which acts, it is con- \n\n[217 U.S. 217, 221]\n\u00a0\n tended, are null and void under the act of Congress admitting the state of California into the Union [9 Stat. at L. 452, chap. 50], and, under article 14 of the Constitution, preventing private property being taken for public use without just compensation therefor. The answer also sets up the statute of limitations.\n The case was submitted to the court of original jurisdiction upon a stipulation of facts, which shows that the pueblo of Los Angeles was established in 1781 under the government of Spain, containing 4 square leagues of land, embracing the lands afterwards patented to the city under the act of Congress of March 3, 1851; that the settlers and inhabitants of the pueblo used the water from the river by means of ditches for domestic and irrigation purposes until the time of the acquisition of the state of California by the United States, the amount of irrigable land being then about 1,500 acres, and it is stipulated:\n'Under the laws of the Kingdom of Spain, said pueblo, upon its foundation, by virtue of a grant under such laws, had the paramount right, claimed by the plaintiff in the complaint herein, to use all the water of the river, and such paramount right continued to exist under that government and under the Mexican government, until the acquisition of California by the United States.'\n\n It appears in the stipulation of facts that the pueblo of Los Angeles, in presenting its petition to the board of land commissioners, wherein it claimed the 16 square leagues, presented as a part thereof a copy of an ordinance of the King of Spain, wherein he provides for the establishment of the town of Pitic, in Sonora, and orders that the provisions relative thereto should be followed in the foundation of any new pueblos in the jurisdiction of the commanding general of the internal provinces of the West, of which California constituted a part, and attached to that petition was a copy of the plan of the town of Pitic, which contained, among things, this provision:\n'7th. The neighbors and natives shall likewise enjoy the \n\n[217 U.S. 217, 222]\n\u00a0\n use of the woods, water, and other benefits from the royal and vacant lands lying outside of the tract assigned to the new town, jointly with the residents and natives of the immediate and adjoining towns; which favor and right shall continue until by his Majesty the same shall be granted or alienated; in which case, regulations will be made according to the provisions for concessions in favor of new possessors or proprietors.'\n\n But there is nothing in the statement of facts affecting the force of the stipulation that the pueblo of Los Angeles had the paramount water right, as above stated, and as claimed in the complaint, until the acquisition of the state of California by the United States. It is further stipulated that no grant nor claim of the real property described in the complaint was presented for confirmation under the act of March 3, 1851, except in so far as the same may have been embraced in the claim of the mayor and common council of the city of Los Angeles, presented and confirmed in the manner described, which resulted in the confirmation and patent for 4 square leagues of land, and the rejection of the claim for the remaining portion of the premises described and claimed by the petitioners; that pursuant to that decree, the United States issued a patent for the 4 square leagues of land; that the city of Los Angeles was incorporated on April 4, 1850, by act of the legislature of California, with boundaries including the 4 square leagues, and the act provided that the city should succeed to all the rights, claims, and powers of the pueblo of Los Angeles in regard to property, and shall be subject to all the liabilities incurred and obligations created by the ayuntamiento of said pueblo. The decision of the commissioners was affirmed by the district court of the United States, and a patent was issued on August 9, 1866, in accordance therewith, for 4 square leagues. Afterwards, on August 4, 1875, another patent was issued by the United States for the 4 square leagues of land, in which latter patent no mention was made of the fact that the land \n\n[217 U.S. 217, 223]\n\u00a0\n for which confirmation was asked contained 16 square leagues, or that the claim of the city was founded on the Mexican grant to the petitioners made on August 25, 1844, as was stated in the earlier patent. The patent of August 4, 1875, contained a certificate of the United States surveyor general for California, that notice of the plat and survey had been advertised in two newspapers, and that the plat was a correct copy of the original, and had been approved August 4, 1875, by the Commissioner of the General Land Office.\n As to the land claimed and owned by the Milling Company, it is stipulated that it was contained in the Rancho Ex-Mission de San Fernando, which embraced the lands of the Milling Company, and was an imperfect or inchoate grant made by the Mexican government on June 14, 1846, and the claim thereto of the predecessors in interest to the Milling Company was presented to and confirmed by the board of land commissioners, under the act of March 3, 1851, and the patent of the United States was issued therefor on January 8, 1873; that said patent includes 121,619 acres of land, through a part of which the Los Angeles river and its tributaries flow; that said rancho is riparian to said river, and that the patent states that the United States of America granted the land therein embraced, with the appurtenances, without making any reservation or exception of any rights to said river, its tributaries or waters therein; that the value of the premises in controversy is over $400,000; that neither the city nor any of its predecessors have contested the grant, survey, or proceedings in connection with the confirmation of the claim of the predecessors in interest to the Milling Company to said rancho; that said rancho is situated on said river, some 10 miles above the city of Los Angeles, and above any of the points of diversion of water by said city; that after the acquisition of California by the United States, the pueblo of Los Angeles continued to exist and be managed by the pueblo authorities, and the water of said river continued to be used for domestic and irrigation purposes by its inhabitants until \n\n[217 U.S. 217, 224]\n\u00a0\n the incorporation of the city under the legislative act of April 4, 1850, and thereafter the use of water from said river for municipal, domestic, and irrigation purposes continued until about 1901, since which time all of said water has been needed and used for domestic purposes in said city, as enlarged from the patented area of 17,172 acres to 27,695 acres in 1898; that the surface stream of the river continues for a distance of several miles above the city, to points where it rises from beneath the surface of the ground, and, in seasons of heavy rainfall, it extends up to the mouths of the various canyons, from which surface streams, coming from public lands of the United States, and which are the sources and tributaries of the Los Angeles river, emerge and flow, until the approach of summer, when they sink into the sand at or near the mouths of such canyons; that all of the territory in which the surface stream of the Los Angeles river constantly flows, and all of the valleys through which the torrential surface stream of the river flows, in winter and spring, up to the mouths of said canyons, are embraced within Spanish and Mexican grants, confirmed and patented to parties other than the city, under the act of March 3, 1851; that the city has sold to private parties all the lands embraced in its patent from the United States, including the lands riparian to the river, excepting certain lots, on which are erected public city buildings, also certain parks and the river bed, 200 feet, more or less, in width, inside the patent boundary; that the allegations of the complaint, describing the Los Angeles river, and showing that the underground stream thereof extends throughout the whole of the lands of the Milling Company, described in the complaint, are true.\n Upon submission to the trial court, a judgment was rendered in favor of the city, ordering and adjudging that the city was the owner in fee simple of the paramount right to take and use the water of the Los Angeles river from its source to the southern boundary of the city of Los Angeles, so far as may be reasonably necessary, from time to time, to \n\n[217 U.S. 217, 225]\n\u00a0\n give an ample supply of water for the use of its inhabitants, and for all the municipal purposes and uses of the city, and the city was quieted in its title and right to the use of the water, as aforesaid.\n Upon appeal to the supreme court of California, the judgment of the lower court was affirmed (152 Cal. 645, 93 Pac. 869, 1135), and the case is brought here by writ of error to that court.\n A case can only be brought to this court from a supreme court of a state by writ of error under  709 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575), in order to determine Federal rights asserted under that section of the statutes which it is claimed have been denied by the decision and judgment of the supreme court of the state. It is therefore necessary to know just what is comprehended in the decision and judgment of that court. The supreme court of California, after reciting the proceedings and facts found in the court below, dealt with the contention of the plaintiff in error as to the proceedings under the act of March 3, 1851, which confirmed the title to the lands described, and held that, in confirming the title to the lands and awarding patents therefor, the riparian rights of the proprietors and patentees were left to be determined by the law of the country or state where the land is situated, and denied the contention of the Milling Company, that the city had only title to the 4 square leagues of land awarded to it by the proceedings and patents under the act of March 3, 1851, with no ownership in the use of the water above the limits of the land granted, and denied the further contention that, by the proceedings and patent to the Milling Company's predecessors, they were adjudged the riparian owners, with the use of the waters of the river running through the land as part and parcel of their estate. The court having reached this conclusion as to the effect of the act of March 3, 1851, held that the only question in the case was as to whether, under the Spanish and Mexican law, the old pueblo of Los Angeles and the city, as its successor, had, \n\n[217 U.S. 217, 226]\n\u00a0\n as against the Milling Company, the prior and paramount ownership of so much of the water of the Los Angeles river as is necessary for its inhabitants, and for general municipal purposes, and held that this question was answered in the affirmative in the prior decisions of the California supreme court. Lux v. Haggin, 69 Cal. 265, 10 Pac. 674; Vernon Irrig. Co. v. Los Angeles, 106 Cal. 237, 39 Pac. 762; Los Angeles v. Pomeroy, 124 Cal. 597, 57 Pac. 585 (same case in this court, \n188 U.S. 314\n, 47 L. ed. 487, 63 L.R.A. 471, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 395).\n These decisions the court held to be determinative of the prior and paramount right of the pueblo and its successor, under rights existing under the Spanish and Mexican laws, confirmed by the United States to the successors of the pueblo. The court declined to consider for what municipal purpose the water could be used as against a riparian owner, and held that the extent of the city's prior and paramount right was not involved in the case.\n It is thus apparent that the supreme court of California put the decision of the case upon the effect of the old Spanish or Mexican law as to the rights of the pueblo, succeeded to by the city, and confirmed by proceedings under the acts of Congress for the purpose of confirming such titles.\n We come, then, to consider what Federal questions are really presented in this record, and whether, in reaching the decision which we have stated, the supreme court of California directly, or necessarily, by reason of its decision, denied such rights asserted under  709 of the Revised Statutes. We may at once put aside, as not presenting Federal questions of serious import, the assignments of error to the effect that the decision of the supreme court of California denied to the plaintiff in error due process of law or the equal protection of the laws, secured by the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. We may treat in like manner the assignments involving the construction by the supreme court of the state statutes, and rulings as to the admissibility of evidence. Nor do we find any denial of Federal right worthy \n\n[217 U.S. 217, 227]\n\u00a0\n of consideration in the assertion that the statutes of California have undertaken to confer the water rights in controversy on the city of Los Angeles, and were given such effect, in violation of the Federal rights of the plaintiff in error. As we have seen, the rights of the city were not determined by the effect of those statutes, but upon the right and title secured by the Spanish or Mexican law, and the subsequent confirmation thereof under the statute of the United States.\n As to the assignment of error that the effect of the judgment is to interfere with the disposition of the public lands by the United States.\n The act of 1851 (9 Stat. at L. 631, chap. 41),  14, made provision for the presentation to the commission of the former right of pueblos, and the issue of patents to them upon confirmation. And further, the same section provided that the existence of a city, town, or village on July 7, 1846, being duly proved, should be prima facie evidence of a grant to such corporation.\n This court, speaking by Mr. Justice Miller, tersely disposes of the nature of such old Mexican titles in Adam v. Norris, \n103 \nU.S. 591, 593\n, 26 S. L. ed. 583, 584:\n'But the United States, in dealing with parties claiming under Mexican grants, lands within the territory ceded by the treaty of Mexico, never made pretense that it was the owner of them. When, therefore, guided by the action of the tribunals established to pass upon the validity of these alleged grants, the government issued a patent, it was in the nature of a quitclaim,-an admission that the rightful ownership had never been in the United States, but had passed at the time of the cession to the claimant, or to those under whom he claimed. This principle has been more than once clearly announced in this court. The leading cases are Beard v. Federy, 3 Wall. 478, 18 L. ed. 88; Henshaw v. Bissell, 18 Wall. 255, 21 L. ed. 835; Miller v. Dale, \n92 U.S. 473\n, 23 L. ed. 735.'\n\n It is perhaps more accurate to say that the action of the United States in such cases is a confirmation rather than a \n\n[217 U.S. 217, 228]\n\u00a0\n quitclaim. Boquillas Land & Cattle Co. v. Curtis, \n213 \nU.S. 339, 344\n, 53 S. L. ed. 822, 825, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 493.\n The assignments covering other Federal questions which should be noticed embrace the contention that the rights of the Milling Company were secured under the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo between the United States and Mexico [9 Stat. at L. 922], and under the act of Congress of March 3, 1851, for the confirmation of titles derived from the Spanish or Mexican governments. The contentions as to the supposed rights derived under that treaty and act have been before this court in a number of cases, in which it has been uniformly held that rights alleged to have arisen thereunder, in the manner claimed by the present plaintiff in error, are not rights of Federal origin which, when denied, lay the basis for the review and reversal of the judgment of the state court.\n In Townsend v. Greeley, 5 Wall. 326, 18 L. ed. 547, Mr. Justice Field, delivering the opinion of the court, held that the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo does not purport to devest the pueblo existing at the site of the city of San Francisco, of any rights of property, or to alter the character of interests it may have held in any lands under the former goverment; that the treaty provided for the protection of the inhabitants in their property, and that the same rights exist as to towns under the Mexican government; and dealing with both the treaty and the act of Congress of March 3, 1851, Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the court [in Beard v. Federy, 3 Wall. 491, 18 L. ed. 92], said:\n'In the first place, the patent is a deed of the United States. As a deed its operation is that of a quitclaim, or rather, a conveyance of such interest as the United States possessed in the land, and it takes effect by relation at the time when proceedings were instituted by the filing of the petition before the board of land commissioners.\n\n'In the second place, the patent is a record of the action of the government upon the title of the claimant as it existed upon the acquisition of the country. Such acquisition did \n\n[217 U.S. 217, 229]\n\u00a0\n not affect the rights of the inhabitants to their property. They retained all such rights, and were entitled by the law of nations to protection in them to the same extent as under the former government. The treaty of cession also stipulated for such protection. The obligation to which the United States thus succeeded was, of course, political in its character, and to be discharged in such manner, and on such terms, as they might judge expedient. By the act of March 3d, 1851, they have declared the manner and the terms on which they will discharge this obligation. They have there established a special tribunal, before which all claims to land are to be investigated; required evidence to be presented respecting the claims; appointed law officers to appear and contest them on behalf of the government; authorized appeals from the decisions of the tribunal, first to the district and then to the supreme court; and designated officers to survey and measure off the land when the validity of the claims is finally determined. When informed, by the action of its tribunals and officers, that a claim asserted is valid and entitled to recognition, the government acts, and issues its patent to the claimant. This instrument is, therefore, record evidence of the action of the government upon the title of the claimant. By it the government declares that the claim asserted was valid under the laws of Mexico; that it was entitled to recognition and protection by the stipulations of the treaty, and might have been located under the former government, and is correctly located now, so as to embrace the premises as they are surveyed and described.'\n\n In the later case of Hooker v. Los Angeles, \n188 U.S. 314\n, 47 L. ed. 487, 63 L.R.A. 471, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 395, practically the same contentions were made as in the case at bar concerning the effect of the act of 1851 and the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. In that case the lands of the plaintiffs in error were situated above the city of Los Angeles, and it was sought to appropriate them to the use of the city for the purpose of maintaining thereon the headworks of a system of water supply. In that case, as here, the city contended \n\n[217 U.S. 217, 230]\n\u00a0\n that the rights of the plaintiffs in error were subject to the paramount rights of the city of Los Angeles to take water for the use of its inhabitants, for all the public and municipal purposes of the city. Plaintiffs in error denied this contention, and set up their own rights as riparian owners of the lands, the confirmation of their rights by the board of land commissioners under the act of Congress of 1851, confirmed by the district court for the southern district of California, and patents duly issued in accordance therewith. The contention of the plaintiffs in error was that the state decided against their rights as riparian owners, and as to the ownership of the percolating waters, derived from patents of the United States as well as from Mexican grants, and under the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Delivering the opinion of the court, Mr. Chief Justice Fuller said:\n'Obviously, the question as to the title or right of plaintiffs in error in the land, and whatever appertained thereto, was one of state law and of general public law, on which the decision of the state court was final. San Francisco v. Scott, \n111 U.S. 768\n, 28 L. ed. 593, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 688; California Powder Works v. Davis, \n151 U.S. 389\n, 38 L. ed. 206, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 350. And the question of the existence of percolating water was merely a question of fact.\n\n'The patents were in the nature of a quitclaim, and, under the act of March 3, 1851, were 'conclusive between the United States and the said claimants only, and shall not affect the interests of third persons.' The validity of that act was not drawn in question in the state court, and as the right or title asserted by plaintiffs in error was derived under Mexican and Spanish grants, the decision of the state court on the claims asserted by plaintiffs in error to the waters of the river was not against any title or right claimed under the Constitution, or any treaty or statute of, or commission held, or authority exercised, under the Constitution. If the title of plaintiffs in error were protected by the treaty, still the suit did not arise thereunder, because the controversy in the state court did not involve the construction of the treaty, but the validity of the \n\n[217 U.S. 217, 231]\n\u00a0\n title of Mexican and Spanish grants prior to the treaty. New Orleans v. De Armas, 9 Pet. 224, 9 L. ed. 109; Iowa v. Rood, \n187 U.S. 87\n, 47 L. ed. 86, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 49; Phillips v. Mound City Land & Water Asso. \n124 U.S. 605\n, 31 L. ed. 588, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 657.'\n\n In California Powder Works v. Davis, supra, referred to by the chief justice in the Hooker Case, it was held, referring to the previous case of Phillips v. Mound City Land & Water Asso. supra, that the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo protected all existing property rights, but neither created nor defined the rights, and that a confirmation of such rights by a decree of the court did not determine rights which depended upon the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\n Similar questions came before this court in Devine v. Los Angeles, \n202 U.S. 313\n, 50 L. ed. 1046, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 652. In that case, 244 complainants, owners of lands situated in the county of Los Angeles and in the Ranchos San Rafael, Los Felis, and Providencia, and whose title was alleged to have been confirmed pursuant to the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, by the board of land commissioners created under the act of Congress of 1851, and to whom patents had been issued by the United States, brought suit against the city of Los Angeles to quiet their title as against the claims of the city of Los Angeles to the paramount use of the water of Los Angeles river. The bill is abstracted at length in the report of that case, and it was alleged there, as here, that the rights asserted by the city, and acts of the legislature and charters of the city, were in violation of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, and that the city of Los Angeles should have presented its claims to the waters of the river to the board of land commissioners, under the act of Congress of March 3, 1851, and that a decree should be granted declaring the acts of the legislature of California and the charters of the city of Los Angeles invalid in respect to conferring upon the city any rights in the waters of the Los Angeles river other than those which were ascertained and confirmed under the act of March 3, 1851\n\n\n An answer was filed by the city, fully seting up its rights and contentions, as the successor of the pueblo, to the owner- \n\n[217 U.S. 217, 232]\n\u00a0\n ship of the waters in the river and its tributaries, and admitting that it rested its claim to the Los Angeles river and the waters thereof, including the waters in the lands of the complainants, upon the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which protected the rights or pueblos as well as the rights of individuals, and in part upon the act of Congress of March 3, 1851, confirming the claims of pueblos and municipal corporations to lands granted by Spain and Mexico, and that the confirmation thereof had the effect of confirming the water rights contended for by the city; that said act did not require claims for property otherwise than for land to be presented for confirmation. The answer sets out a detailed history of the pueblo and city of Los Angeles, and certain prior adjudications which were claimed to conclude the plaintiffs in the suit.\n After the pleadings were filed, the city of Los Angeles moved the court to dismiss the case on the ground that there was no Federal jurisdiction thereof; the motion was sustained, and the case brought to this court upon a certificate. This court held that there was no jurisdiction of the case in the Federal court, quoting in the opinion from the previous cases to the effect that the rights of the complainant depended upon the Spanish and Mexican grants confirmed by the board of land commissioners (Hooker v. Los Angeles, supra), and again held that the extent of the riparian rights of the plaintiffs alleged to be derived from the patents of the United States and confirmed Mexican grants, did not present a right, title, privilege, or immunity arising under statutes or treaties of the United States. The court also cited Crystal Springs Land & Water Co. v. Los Angeles, \n177 U.S. 169\n, 44 L. ed. 720, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 573, in which this court affirmed the ruling of the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of California, holding that a controversy between parties claiming under Mexican grants, alleged to be confirmed and patented by the United States in accordance with the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, was only a controversy as to what rights were thus granted and confirmed, and could not lay the basis for a suit as one arising un- \n\n[217 U.S. 217, 233]\n\u00a0\n der the laws and treaties of the United States, and the decree of the circuit court, dismissing the bill for want of jurisdiction, was affirmed.\n It is insisted that the supreme court of California, in holding that the term 'land,' as embraced in the act of March 3, 1851, did not include the riparian rights of the patentee of the land, nor conclude the city from making claim of ownership of the water rights in controversy, and leaving to local law the determination of what riparian rights are embraced in the word 'land,' denied to the plaintiff in error the rights which had accrued to it because of the proceedings under the act of 1851, and the benefits of the limitations upon the rights conferred upon the city of Los Angeles by reason of the proceedings and determination of the commissioners. But as these alleged rights and limitations arise under the act of March 3, 1851, which this court has repeatedly held did not originate Federal rights or titles, but merely confirmed the old ones, we cannot review the judgment of the state court in this respect. In its opinion in the case at bar, the supreme court of California said that, in this respect, it was following Hardin v. Jordan, \n140 U.S. 371\n, 35 L. ed. 428, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 808, 838, and this court has frequently held that the extent of the right and title of a riparian owner under a patent is one of local law. See recent decision of Whitaker v. McBride, \n197 U.S. 510\n, 49 L. ed. 857, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 530, and cases therein cited.\n And whatever the rule may be as to patents conveying title to the lands of the United States, it has been distinctly held in this court that neither the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo nor patents under the act of March 3, 1851, are original sources of private titles, but are merely confirmatory of rights already accrued under a former sovereignty.\n Both parties claim under Spanish or Mexican titles, confirmed by proceedings under the act of March 3, 1851. The Federal rights alleged by the plaintiff in error to have been violated by the decision and judgment of the supreme court of California, so far as concerns this act, relate to the extent of the right and ownership in the use of the waters of the Los \n\n[217 U.S. 217, 234]\n\u00a0\n Angeles river by the one or the other of the parties to this suit. The plaintiff in error, as we have seen, contends that, by its grant, it became the owner of riparian rights in such waters without limitation by any supposed right in the city of Los Angeles to use the water of the river, and that the city of Los Angeles, by failing to present the claim it now makes for the use of the waters of the river to the commissioners under the act of 1851, and by the effect of the judgment of the commissioners upon the petition presented by the city, is forever adjudicated to have no such water rights in the river as the city now contends for, and as were awarded to it by the decision and judgment of the supreme court of California.\n The defect of these contentions, from the standpoint of Federal jurisdiction, is that this court has already determined, in the cases above cited, that the act of 1851 was a a confirmatory act; that by its terms it did not undertake to originate titles or make the patents to be issued in pursuance of the deicisions of the commission conclusive, except upon the United States; and that the extent of the riparian rights belonging to pueblos or persons receiving such patents is a matter of local or general or general law.\n In this view, the writ of error must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","102":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOUISVILLE & N R. CO. v. MELTON(1910)\nNo. 180\nArgued: Decided: May 31, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 36, 37]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Benjamin D. Warfield, Henry Lane Stone, Clifton J. Waddill, and Waddill & Dempsey for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 36, 41]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James W. Clay, William L. Gordon, William J. Cox, Maurice K. Gordon, and J. F. Clay for defendant in error\n\n\n[218 U.S. 36, 43]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n For personal injuries, Spencer Melton recovered a judgment against the plaintiff in error in the circuit court of Hopkins county, Kentucky. The court of appeals affirmed the judgment (127 Ky. 276, 105 S. W. 366, 110 S. W. 233, 112 S. W. 618), whereupon this writ of error was prosecuted.\n Melton, a carpenter, was injured on March company. He was one of a construction way company. He was one of a construction crew, composed of a foreman and six men, who usually did what is described as bridge carpentering. On the date mentioned the crew was engaged, alongside the track of the railway company at Howell, Indiana, in constructing the foundation of a coal tipple at which the engines might coal. A bent or frame of timber, composed of heavy pieces fastened together, and intended to be used as part of the foundation of the tipple, which was lying flat upon the ground, was being raised for the purpose of placing it in the foundation. The lifting was accomplished by means of a block and tackle. A pulley was fastened by an iron chain to an upright piece of timber, and through the pulley a rope passed, which was attached at one end to the bent, so that, on hauling on the rope at the other end, the bent or frame \n\n[218 U.S. 36, 44]\n\u00a0\n was slowly lifted up. Most of the men were engaged in hauling on the rope, while the foreman and Melton, under his orders, were standing beneath the bent, and were engaged in placing props under the bent to prevent its lowering, when the strain upon the rope passing through the pulley was relaxed. While Melton was in this position a link of the chain which held the pulley at the top of the upright post broke, and the bent fell to the ground with Melton underneath, inflicting upon him serious and permanent injuries. The chain which broke was furnished by the foreman of the gang, and had been put in position under his directions.\n Melton was a resident of Hopkins county, Kentucky, and he there commenced this action. The right to recover was based upon the charge that the injury was occasioned through the furnishing by the corporation of unsafe tools to do the work of raising the bent. Besides generally controverting the cause of the injuries, as alleged, the answer of the company set up the defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of the risk. Thereafter Melton was allowed to file an amendment to his petition. By the amendment it was substantially alleged that he was injured without any fault on his part, and solely owing to a defect in the condition of the works or tools connected with or in use in the business of the defendant, and that such defect was the result of negligence on the part of the foreman, who was the person intrusted with the duty of keeping such tools or works in a proper condition, and the accident was also charged to have been caused by the negligent orders of the foreman, to whose directions Melton was bound to conform. The sufficiency of the facts alleged to entitle to recovery was expressly based upon the provisions of the first and second subsections of  1 of an act of the legislature of Indiana of March 4, 1893, known as the employers' liability statute, reading as follows: \n\n[218 U.S. 36, 45]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 1. Be it enacted by the general assembly of the state of Indiana, that every railroad . . . operating in this state shall be liable in damages for personal injury suffered by any employee while in its service, the employee so injured being in the exercise of due care and diligence, in the following cases:\n'First. When such injury was suffered by reason of any defect in the condition of ways, works, plant, tools, and machinery connected with or in use in the business of such corporation, when such defect was the result of negligence on the part of the corporation, or some person intrusted by it with the duty of keeping such way, works, plant, tools, or machinery in proper condition.\n\n'Second. Where such injury resulted from the negligence of any person in the service of such corporation, to whose order or direction the injured employee at the time of the injury was bound to conform, and did conform.'\n\n The court, on the motion of the railway company, having required Melton to determine whether to rely upon the common law or the statute, he elected to base his right to recover on the statute. Thereupon the railway company answered the amended petition, and therein stated as follows:\n'Defendant says that the said Indiana statute pleaded connot and does not apply to the facts of this case, and plaintiff cannot rely thereon; and that under the law of Indiana, as to the character of the work then in hand, the plaintiff was a fellow servant with the said foreman of the construction crew, for whose negligence the defendant is not liable.'\n\n Before trial, permission being granted, the railway company, by an additional amendment, defended on the ground that the Indiana statute relied upon, if held applicable to the facts alleged, was repugnant to the Constitution of Indiana and to the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. The averments on this subject were \n\n[218 U.S. 36, 46]\n\u00a0\n lengthy, and concluded as follows: 'Defendant distinctly raises the Federal question that the said statute, in so far as made to apply to the facts in this case, is violative of said provision of the Constitution of the United States and void.' The provision referred to, as shown by the context, was the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.\n On the trial, counsel for the railway company offered as evidence of the common law of the state of Indiana on the subject of fellow servants the opinions of the supreme court of Indiana in the following cases: New Pittsburgh Coal & Coke Co. v. Peterson (filed October 31, 1893), 136 Ind. 398, 43 Am. St. Rep. 327, 35 N. E. 7; Southern Indiana R. Co. v. Harrell ( filed October 9, 1903), 161 Ind. 689, 63 L.R.A. 460, 68 N. E. 262; Indianapolis & G. Rapid Transit Co. v. Foreman (filed January 29, 1904), 162 Ind. 85, 102 Am. St. Rep. 185, 69 N. E. 669.\n At the close of the evidence for plaintiff, and also upon the conclusion of all the evidence, the railway company unsuccessfully moved the court to peremptorily instruct the jury to find in its favor for the following reasons:\n'1. There is no evidence of actionable negligence proven.\n\n'2. The Indiana statute upon which this action is based does not apply to the facts proven.\n\n'3. In so far as the terms of the Indiana statute apply to the facts proven, they are unconstitutional and void. They are discriminatory against defendant and deny it the equal protection of the law. They are violative of the Constitution of Indiana and of  1, article 14 of the Constitution of the United States, being  1 of the 14th Amendment thereto.\n\n'4. The said Indiana statutes were not intended to be enforced out of the state of Indiana, and are against the policy of the state of Kentucky, and not enforceable in a Kentucky forum.'\n\n The railway company, in its request for instructions, which were refused, and to which refusals it excepted, \n\n[218 U.S. 36, 47]\n\u00a0\n substantially asked that the general principles of the common law of Indiana as to fellow servant and assumtion of the risk, as exemplified by the Indiana decisions which it had offered in evidence, be applied to the case. The court, on the contrary, in the instructions which it gave, substantially applied the provisions of the Indiana statute, as by it construed. In the motion for a new trial fifteen reasons were stated, those which made reference to the statute or to the Constitution of the United States being the following:\n'14. The court erred in applying the Indiana statute to the facts of this case. The court erred in enforcing the Indiana statute in a Kentucky forum.\n\n'15. The court erred in upholding and applying the Indiana statute pleaded in this case, when same, in so far as applicable to the facts proven in this case, is unconstitutional and void. It is discriminatory against defendant, and denies it the equal protection of the law. It is violative of the Constitution of the state of Indiana and of  1 of article 14 of the Constitution of the United States, which guarantees to defendant the equal protection of the law.'\n\n The court below held that the supreme court of Indiana had construed the statute as applicable both to persons and corporations operating railroads. It further held that the statute embraced the case in hand because Melton came within the category of persons injured in the operation of a railroad, as 'the construction of a coal tipple is . . . essential to the operation of a railroad.' As thus construed, the repugnancy of the statute to the equal protection clause of the Constitution of the United States was considered. It was decided that, for the purpose of abrogating or modifying the common-law doctrine of fellow servant, it was competent for the lawmaking power of a state, without offending against the equal protection clause, to classify railroad employees ployees because of \n\n[218 U.S. 36, 48]\n\u00a0\n the hazard attached to their vocation, and that a statute doing this need not be confined to employees who were engaged in and about the mere movement of trains, but could also validly include other employees doing work essential to be done to enable the carrying on of railroad operations. Thus, referring to the alleged distinction between railroad operatives engaged in train movement and those who were not, the court said:\n'We are unable to see the force of this distinction. A railroad connot be run without bridges; bridges cannot be built without carpenters. The work of a bridge carpenter on a railroad is perhaps no less perilous than the work of an operative on one of its trains. Coal tipples are no less essential to the operating of a railroad than bridges, because the engines cannot be operated without coal. The construction of a coal tipple is therefore essential to the operating of a railroad. As has been well said, the legislature cannot well provide for all subjects in one act. Legislation must necessarily be done in detail, and an act regulating railroads violates no constitutional provision because it is made to apply only to railroads. Indianapolis Street R. Co. v. Kane, 169 Ind. 25, 80 N. E. 841, 81 N. E. 721; Schoolcraft v. Louisville & N. R. Co. (Louisville Safety Vault & T. Co. v. Louisville & N. R. Co.) 92 Ky. 233, 14 L.R.A. 579, 17 S. W. 567; Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Stahley, 11 C. C. A. 88, 27 U. S. App. 157, 62 Fed. 363; Callahan v. St. Louis Merchants' Bridge Terminal R. Co. 170 Mo. 473, 60 L.R.A. 249, 94 Am. St. Rep. 746, 71 S. W. 208, \n194 U.S. 628\n, 48 L. ed. 1157, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 857; Georgia R. Co. v. Ivey, 73 Ga. 504.'\n\n The railway company asked a rehearing for the sole purpose of a reconsideration of what was referred to as the very important Federal question involved, viz., 'the unconstitutionality of the Indiana statute, as applied to the facts of this case.' The court permitted the question whether a rehearing should be granted to be orally argued, and, after such argument, in a brief opinion denied the request. Two members of the court, however, dissented, on the ground that the statute as construed was repugnant to the equal protection clause of the 14th \n\n[218 U.S. 36, 49]\n\u00a0\n Amendment. This writ of error was then prosecuted, and the only reference to the Constitution of the United States made in the assignment of error filed with the application for the writ was that embraced in the contention that the Indiana statute could not be constitutionally applied to the facts without causing the statute to be repugnant to the 14th Amendment.\n We primarily dispose of a motion to dismiss, which is rested upon the ground that the Federal question relied upon has been so conclusively foreclosed by prior decisions of this court as to cause it to be frivolous, and therefore not adequate to confer jurisdiction. The contention may not prevail, even although it be admitted that a careful analysis of the previous cases will manifest that they are decisive of this. We say this because, for the purpose of the motion to dismiss, the issue is not whether the Federal question relied upon will be found, upon an examination of the merits, to be unsound, but whether it is apparent that such question has been so explicitly foreclosed as to leave no room for contention on the subject, and hence cause the question to be frivolous. That this is not the case here we think results from the following considerations: (a) because analysis and expounding are necessary in order to make clear the decisive effect of the prior decisions upon the issue here presented; (b) because the division in opinion of the lower court as to whether the statute as construed was repugnant to the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment suggests that the controversy on the subject here presented should not be treated as of such a frivolous character as not to afford ground for jurisdiction to review the action of the court below; and (c) because, while an examination of the opinions of state courts of last resort will show that there is unanimity as to the power, consistently with the equal protection of the law clause, to classify railroad employees actually engaged in the hazardous work of moving trains, \n\n[218 U.S. 36, 50]\n\u00a0\n such examination will also disclose that there is some conflict of view as to whether a statute on that subject as broad as is the statute under review, as construed below, is consistent with the clause, thus additionally serving to point to the necessity of analyzing and considering the subject anew instead of treating it as being so obviously foreclosed as not to permit an examination of the subject.\n Coming to the merits, we at once premise that we are not concerned with the construction affixed by the court below to the Indiana statute, unless it be that that construction offends against some Federal right properly asserted and open to our consideration. In the argument at bar in behalf of the railway company two rights of this character are insisted upon. First, it is said that the court below, in applying the statute, has caused it to embrace a class of employees which the statute did not include, and thereby gave it a wrongful construction, in violation of the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution of the United States. Second, that, in any event, the statute as construed is repugnant to the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. We separately dispose of these propositions.\n The full faith and credit clause. The contentions as to this proposition rest upon the assumption that it has been conclusively settled by the supreme court of Indiana that the statute only changed the general rule prevailing in that state in respect to the doctrine of fellow servant as to railroad employees actually engaged in the hazard of train service, and therefore did not include an employee engaged in the character of work which Melton was performing when injured, and that to give the statute a contrary meaning was to violate the full faith and credit clause. If, however, the premise upon which the proposition rests, and the legal deduction based upon that premise, be, for the sake of the argument, conceded, the contention is, nevertheless, without merit, because of the \n\n[218 U.S. 36, 51]\n\u00a0\n failure of the railway company to plead or in any adequate way call the attention of the court below to the fact that, in connection with the proper construction of the statute, the benefit of the due faith and credit clause of the Constitution of the United States was relied on. We say this because the statement which we have previously made of the case fails to show from first to last, even up to and including the application for rehearing, the assertion of any claim to the protection of the full faith and credit clause. Indeed, that statement not only shows a failure to make such claim, but discloses such direct and express action on the part of the railway company as justly to give rise to the inference that a reliance upon any claim of Federal right resulting from the full faith and credit clause was not thought to be involved in the case. We say this because the frequent and reiterated assertions of Federal right, based solely upon the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, sustain such conclusion.\n Further, even if, for the sake of the argument only, the failure to plead the full faith and credit clause, or to direct the attention of the court below to the fact that reliance was placed upon that clause, could be supplied upon the theory that, as the cause of action was based upon an Indiana statute, by implication the due faith and credit clause was necessarily involved, nevertheless the contention would be without merit. This follows because, as pointed out in Finney v. Guy, \n189 \nU.S. 335, 340\n, 47 S. L. ed. 839, 843, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 558, and Allen v. Allegheny Co. \n196 \nU.S. 458, 463\n, 49 S. L. ed. 551, 555, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 311, it is not true to say that necessarily in every case where the court of one state is called upon to determine the proper construction of a statute of another state, a question under the Constitution of the United States arises. Although the Indiana statute was at issue and its meaning was necessarily involved, the duty of construing it rested upon the court below. The general rule is that, in the absence \n\n[218 U.S. 36, 52]\n\u00a0\n of a statute to the contrary, if a settled construction by the court of last resort of a state enacting a statute is relied upon to control the judgment of the court of another state in interpreting the statute, such settled construction must be pleaded and proved. Eastern Bldg. & L. Asso. v. Ebaugh, \n185 U.S. 114\n, 46 L. ed. 830, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 566, and cases cited. As, however, it is not asserted that there was a statute of Kentucky controlling the courts of that state in construing the statutes of other states, and as there was no pleading or proof as to the existence of any such settled construction, it follows that there is nothing presented, which can be held to have deprived the court below of its power to exercise its independent judgment in interpreting the statute. Our duty, of course, is confined to determining whether error was committed by the court below as to the Federal questions involved; and as it is impossible to predicate error as to matters not pleaded or proved in the court below, which were essential to be pleaded and proved, it follows that the contention concerning the denial of the protection of the full faith and credit clause furnishes no ground for reversal. Johnson v. New York L. Ins. Co. \n187 \nU.S. 491, 495\n, 47 S. L. ed. 273, 274, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 194.\n The equal protection of the law clause. That the 14th Amendment was not intended to and does not strip the states of the power to exert their lawful police authority is settled, and requires no reference to authorities. And it is equally settled-as we shall hereafter take occasion to show-as the essential result of the elementary doctrine that the equal protection of the law clause does not restrain the normal exercise of governmental power, but only abuse in the exertion of such authority, therefore that clause is not offended against simply because, as the result of the exercise of the power to classify, some inequality may be occasioned. That is to say, as the power to classify is not taken away by the operation of the equal protection of the law clause, a wide \n\n[218 U.S. 36, 53]\n\u00a0\n scope of legislative discretion may be exerted in classifying without conflicting with the constitutional prohibition.\n It is beyond doubt foreclosed that the Indiana statute does not offend against the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, because it subjects railroad employees to a different rule as to the doctrine of fellow servant from that which prevails as to other employments in that state. Tullis v. Lake Erie & W. R. Co. \n175 U.S. 348\n, 44 L. ed. 192, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 136; Pittsburg, C. C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Ross, \n212 U.S. 560\n, 53 L. ed. 652, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 688. But while conceding this, the argument is that classification of railroad employees for the purpose of the doctrine of fellow servant can only, consistently with equality and uniformity, embrace such employees when exposed to dangers peculiarly resulting from the operation of a railroad, thus affording ground for distinguishing them for the purpose of classification from coemployees not subject to like hazards or employees engaged in other occupations. The argument is thus stated: 'Plaintiff in error does not question the right of the legislature of Indiana to classify railroads in order to impose liability upon them for injuries to their employees incident to railroad hazards, but it does insist that, to make this a constitutional exercise of legislative power, the liability of the railroads must be made to depend upon the character of the employment, and not upon the character of the employer.' Thus stated, the argument tends to confuse the question for decision, since there is no contention that the statute as construed bases any classification upon some supposed distinction in the person of the employer. The idea evidently intended to be expressed by the argument is, that although, speaking in a general sense, it be true that the hazards arising from the operation of railroads are such that a classification of railroad employees is justified, yet, as in operating railroads some employees are subject to risks peculiar to such operation, and others to risks which, \n\n[218 U.S. 36, 54]\n\u00a0\n however serious they may be, are not, in the proper sense, risks arising from the fact that the employees are engaged in railroad work, the legislative authority in classifying may not confound the two by considering in a generic sense the nature and character of the work performed by railroad employees collectively considered, but must consider and separately provide for the distinctions occasioned by the varying nature and character of the duties which railroad operatives may be called upon to discharge. In other words, reduced to its ultimate analysis the contention comes to this: that by the operation of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, the states are prohibited from exerting their legitimate police powers upon grounds of the generic distinction obtaining between persons and things, however apparent such distinction may be; but, on the contrary, must legislate upon the basis of a minute consideration of the distinctions which may arise from accidental circumstances as to the persons and things coming within the general class provided for. When the proposition is thus accurately fixed, it necessarily results that in effect it denies the existence of the power to classify, and hence must rest upon the assumption that the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment has a scope and effect upon the lawful authority of the states contrary to the doctrine maintained by this court without deviation. This follows, since the necessary consequence of the argument is to virtually challenge the legislative power to classify, and the numerous decisions upholding that authority. To this destructive end it is apparent the argument must come, since it assumes that however completely a classification may be justified by general considerations, such classification may not be made if inequalities be detected as to some persons embraced within the general class by a critical analysis of the relation of the persons or things otherwise embraced within the general class. A brief reference to some of the cases \n\n[218 U.S. 36, 55]\n\u00a0\n dealing with the power of a state to classify will make the error of the contention apparent.\n In Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Sav. Bank, \n170 U.S. 294\n, 42 L. ed. 1043, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 594, while declaring that the power of a state to distinguish, select, and classify objects of legislation was, of course, not without limitation, it was said 'necessarily this power must have a wide range of discretion.' After referring to various decisions of this court, it was observed:\n'There is therefore no precise application of the rule of reasonableness of classification, and the rule of equality permits many practical inequalities. And necessarily so. In a classification for governmental purposes there cannot be an exact exclusion or inclusion of persons and things.'\n\n Again considering the subject in Orient Ins. Co. v. Daggs, \n172 U.S. 557\n, 43 L. ed. 552, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 281, it was reiterated that the legislature of a state has necessarily a wide range of discretion in distinguishing, selecting, and classifying, and it was declared that it was sufficient to satisfy the demand of the Constitution if a classification was practical, and not palpably arbitrary.\n In Minnesota Iron Co. v. Kline, \n199 U.S. 593\n, 50 L. ed. 322, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 159, a statute of Minnesota, providing that the liability of railroad companies for damages to employees should not be diminished by reason of accident occurring through the negligence of fellow servants, was held not to discriminate against any class of railroads, or to deny the equal protection of the laws because of a proviso which excepted employees engaged in construction of new and unopened railroads. In the course of the opinion the court said (p. 598): 'The whole case is put on the proviso, and the argument with regard to that is merely one of the many attempts to impart an overmathematical nicety to the prohibitions of the 14th Amendment.' These principles were again applied in Martin v. Pittsburg & L. E. R. Co. \n203 U.S. 284\n, 51 L. ed. 184, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 100, 8 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 87, and the doctrines were also fully \n\n[218 U.S. 36, 56]\n\u00a0\n considered and reiterated at this term in Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, \n217 U.S. 114\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 496.\n And coming to consider the concrete application made of these general principles in the decisions of this court which have construed the statute here in question, and statutes of the same general character enacted in states other than Indiana, we think, when rightly analyzed, it will appear that they are decisive against the contention now made. It is true that in the Tullis Case, which came here on certificate, the nature and character of the work of the railroad employee who was injured was not stated, and that reference in the course of the opinion was made to some state cases, limiting the right to classify to employees engaged in the movement of trains. But that it was not the intention of the court to thereby intimate that a classification, if not so restricted, would be repugnant to the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, will be made clear by observing that the previous case of Chicago, K & W. R. Co. v. Pontius, \n157 U.S. 209\n, 39 L. ed. 675, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 585, was cited approvingly, in which, under a statute of Kansas classifying railroad employees, recovery was allowed to a bridge carpenter employed by the railroad company, who was injured while attempting to load timber on a car. And in the opinion in the Pontius case there was approvingly cited a decision of the court of appeals of the eighth circuit (Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Stahley, 11 C. C. A. 88, 27 U. S. App. 157, 62 Fed. 362), wherein it was held that, under the same statute, an employee injured in a roundhouse while engaged in lifting a driving rod for attachment to a new engine could recover by virtue of the statute. All this is made plainer by the ruling in St Louis Merchants' Bridge Terminal R. Co. v. Callahan, \n194 U.S. 628\n, 48 L. ed. 1157, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 857, where, upon the authority of the Tullis case, the court affirmed a judgment of the supreme court of Missouri, which held that recovery might be had by a section hand upon a railroad, who, while engaged in warning passersby in a street be- \n\n[218 U.S. 36, 57]\n\u00a0\n neath an overhead bridge, was struck by a tie thrown from the structure.\n While, as we have previously said, it is true there are state decisions dealing with statutes classifying railroad employees sustaining the restricted power to classify which is here insisted upon, we do not think it is necessary to review them or to notice those tending to the contrary. They are referred to in the opinions rendered in the court below. Nor do we think our duty in this respect is enlarged because, since the judgment below was rendered, the court of last resort in Indiana ( Indianapolis Traction Co. v. Kinney, 171 Ind. 612, -- L.R.A.(N.S.) --, 85 N. E. 954, and Cleveland, C. C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Foland, decided April 20, 1910, 91 N. E. 594) has, upon the theory that it was necessary to save the statute in question from being declared repugnant to the equality clause of the state Constitution and the 14th Amendment, unequivocally held that the statute must be construed as restricted to employees engaged in train service.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","103":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOUISVILLE & N.

TERRITORY OF HAWAII(1910)\nNo. 469\nArgued: Decided: January 24, 1910\n\n\n\n Mr. David L. Withington for appellants.[ Lowrey v. Territory of Hawaii \n215 U.S. 554\n (1910) ]\n\n\n[215 U.S. 554, 558]\n\u00a0\n Mr. C. R. Hemenway for appellee.\n\n\n[215 U.S. 554, 559]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is the second appeal in this case. The first appeal was from a judgment in favor of the territory, entered upon demurrer to the complaint, which judgment was reversed. \n206 U.S. 206\n, 51 L. ed. 1026, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 622. \n\n[215 U.S. 554, 560]\n\u00a0\n The action is for the sum of $15,000, which the Hawaiian government reserved the right to pay, instead of deeding back certain lands conveyed to her by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions in 1849. The facts as alleged in the complaint are set out with considerable fullness in the report of the case on the first appeal and need not be repeated. Upon the return of the case to the supreme court of the territory, an answer was filed, denying 'all and singular the matters, allegations, and things set forth,' and giving notice that the territory would 'rely in making its defense inter alia on the statute of frauds.' Subsequently the plaintiffs made a motion upon the record and 'upon the judgment in the Supreme Court of the United States' for judgment. The territory made a motion to amend its answer to set up the statute of limitations. The plaintiffs' motion was denied, that of the territory was granted, to which rulings plaintiffs excepted. Testimony was taken, which was directed principally to the question of the breach of the condition upon which the conveyance to the government was made. The court, in its opinion, says that, in addition to the 'large amount of documentary and other evidence,' it has 'also referred to proceedings of a public nature, of which it could ordinarily take judicial notice, and to documents from the public archives, when specially referred to in the exhibits on file.' Concluding from this and the other evidence that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover, it rendered judgment for the territory.\n The decision on the first appeal is an important factor in the determination of this, for upon that, as a guide, the supreme court of the territory accepted evidence and determined the meaning of the agreement by which the lands were conveyed.\n The American Board of Foreign Missions for many years prior to 1850 conducted a Protestant mission in the Hawaiian Islands, and, as an essential part of its work, carried on many schools. Its most notable work was centered in a school, established in 1831, at Lahainaluna, on the island of Maui, where \n\n[215 U.S. 554, 561]\n\u00a0\n it possessed a large tract of land. The purpose for which the conveyance of this school to the Hawaiian governent was made, and the course of instruction in it, before and after the conveyance, as explaining that purpose, make the controversy in this case. It is contended by appellants that the course of instruction in the institution comprised not only the usual topics belonging to secular learning, but included also direct religious teaching and training in the doctrine represented by the mission; that is, the doctrines of the Congregational and Presbyterian churches of the United States, and was expressed in a 'confession of faith,' which was attached to the agreement that transferred the property to the Hawaiian government. 'The central purpose of the agreement was,' counsel for appellants contended on the other appeal, 'to 'continue' an established institution, the keystone of a system with defined and well-known aims, the chief being the promotion of religion by instruction in definite religious truth.' The opposing contention was that the doctrine to be taught was not specialized, that there were no restrictions upon the course of instruction, except that it should not be, using the words of the agreement, 'contrary to those theretofore inculcated by the mission;' and, insisting that those words constituted the complete measure of the obligation of the government, resisted the attempt of the appellants to go outside of them to ascertain the purpose of the parties. These contentions were considered and the grounds of them accurately distinguished. The contention of the appellants was accepted. It is not necessary to repeat our reasoning at length. Our conclusion was that the Hawaiian government engaged to teach not only secular science, but the definite religious doctrine expressed in the confession of faith attached to the agreement. The latter, we said, was 'not in a formally executed paper,' but was found in a correspondence. 'And taking the whole of it,' it was said, 'there is very little aid from extrinsic evidence needed to demonstrate its meaning and purpose.' And after considering some parts of the correspondence, we concluded \n\n[215 U.S. 554, 562]\n\u00a0\n as follows: 'The correspondence concerned the transfer of a school established in 1835, the design of which was to perpetuate the Christian religion, and with an object described to be 'still more definite and of equal or greater importance,'-that is, 'to educate young men to be Christian ministers.' A religious instruction was prescribed. Of this the government was informed when the proposition was made to transfer the school to 'its fostering eare and patronage.' And the government accepted the grant, accepted as it was tendered, and necessarily for the purpose it was tendered.'\n The right to resort to extrinsic evidence, against the contention of the territory, was decided, but the amount of aid that the correspondence needed or received from such evidence we explicitly pointed out. We said that the 'justness' of the conclusion expressed in the paragraph quoted above was, without extrinsic evidence, 'almost indisputable,' and that it became 'indisputable if extrinsic evidence be considered.' In other words, it was decided that the probative force of the correspondence was sufficient, without other evidence, to establish the agreement in accordance with the contention of appellants. The supreme court of the territory underestimated this ruling, and entered into an extensive inquiry of circumstances, from which it decided the agreement to be what this court had decided it not to be.\n It may be that we could rest the case on the prior decision without considering the new evidence which was received, or, rather, the new facts which are expressed in the findings of the supreme court. But as that learned court based its decision upon them, and the territory earnestly urges them as taking this appeal out of the ruling on the former appeal, we have given consideration to them. We cannot, however, without extending this opinion to a great length, quote them in full, and will, therefore, only state their character and what they establish or tend to establish.\n The findings set forth the circumstances which preceded \n\n[215 U.S. 554, 563]\n\u00a0\n the transfer to the government, as exhibited in the observations of Commodore Wilkes in 1841, and the report of the principal of the school in 1848. Commodore Wilkes observed a defective and inefficient administration of the affairs of the school and its funds, which might have been 'avoided' by a full examination of the subject by 'practical men,' and a decadence in consequence from its 'meridian.' The principal report personified the school and made it conscious of the loss of admiration, but he said 'she stands at her post, and is contended to do good in a more humble way than when the friends and lovers of her youth stood by and praised her.' He said that during 1849 'studies at the institution were practically broken up by reason of various sicknesses which attacked the principal's family, and that, in consequence, 'school operations were suspended in February, and no new class entered pending the action of the general meeting of the mission,' and he 'thought it best' to await that meeting, for, as he said, 'the late unparalleled diminution of the population may also have some effect in modifying the views of the mission in regard to this school, and render it expedient in their minds to alter its operations or the number of its scholars.' If a new class was to be called, he said, he had 'a few considerations to present to the brethern to guide them in their selections.' And again: 'Many thousands of dollars have been wasted or unprofitably laid out upon young men sent there of only middling ability and low morals. It has been with regret that the teachers have had to select, with a few good ones, many young men of doubtful talents and worth to make up a class, when they felt there were enough in the nation that would do honor to their training at the seminary.'\n'Besides these conditions,' the findings of the court recite, 'and the emigration to the gold fields of Califormia, the general meeting had to face an embarrassing condition of the funds of the home board and the consequent curtailment of the allowance to the mission. (From the report of the committee, \n\n[215 U.S. 554, 564]\n\u00a0\n April 25, 1849.) It was under these circumstances that the offer of transfer to the Hawaiian government was made.'\n\n It may be well to comment on the facts as we go along, and we may say we see nothing in these declarations and reports that militates with the views of the agreement expressed in our former opinion. We see no intention in them or reason for abandoning the purpose for which the school was founded. Indeed, intention and reason for its better fulfilment by a transfer to the government. The school would receive more constant support under the government. The young men of 'doubtful ability and low morals' might not seek its instruction, could be more easily rejected if they did so, and those 'in the nation that would do honor to their training at the seminary' might be attracted by the sanction which would be given to their ability and morals. That this was the hope which induced the transfer is almost expressed in the correspondence which forms the agreement.\n This was in effect declared in the opinion on the first appeal, and the quotation from that becomes apposite. Stating a part of the correspondence which contained the offer to the government, we said:\n'The mission reminds the minister of public instruction that the seminary was established in 1831, 'to promote the diffusion of enlightened literature and Christianity throughout the islands,' and that it had been unceasingly watched over, cherished, and cared for by the mission, and that $77,000 had been expended for its benefit. It was stated that, in consequence of the debts incurred 'in the prosecution of its labors of benevolence and mercy,' the American Board of Commissioners of Foreign Missions was compelled to diminish its grants to each of the missions under its care, including the Hawaiian mission, and that the latter, for that reason, would be 'unable to carry forward its operations with the vigor to be desired in all of its departments of labor.' In view of these facts, it was stated and believed that, under the circumstances, the transfer of the institution 'to the fostering care and patronage of the \n\n[215 U.S. 554, 565]\n\u00a0\n government' would 'promote the highest interest of the Hawaiian people.' An offer was then made to transfer the seminary, with the conditions which we have referred to. A confession of faith was inclosed. The government modified the proposal by reserving the right to pay $15,000, as an alternative to the reversion of the property to the mission if the government should not fulfil the conditions of the grant. The modification was accepted, and in a subsequent communication a new confession of faith was substituted for that originally proposed.'\n\n And from this, it followed, we further said, as we have seen, that the school was established \"to perpetuate the Christian religion,\" and had purpose, still more definite and of equal or greater importance; that \"to educate young men to be Christian ministers.\" And this 'the government was informed of when the proposition was made to transfer the school to its 'fostering care and patronage.\"\n There are, however, other findings of fact. It is found that there was substituted for the first confession of faith, which was printed, a second confession of faith, which was written. In a letter which accompanied the latter, it stated that the first was 'not so distinctive as to present a barrier to the introduction there (in the school) of other and deleterious doctrines not specified in the said confession.' It is said by the supreme court of the territory that it was 'worthy of note' that it did not appear that the 'prudential committee' had been advised of the substitution. We think this unimportant. Even if it did not, therefore, become a part of the agreement, it certainly expressed the purpose of the agreement. It was, however, considered by the parties as a part of the agreement.\n The curriculum of the school from 1835 to 1863 is inserted in the findings, by which studies were arranged for a course of four years. This appears:\n'The laws of the high school were read, amended, and the different articles adopted as follows:\n\n\"Whereas in the good providences of God, the experiment \n\n[215 U.S. 554, 566]\n\u00a0\n of the high school established by the mission in 1831 having proved successful, and having accomplished all that could reasonably have been expected, and the necessity of such an institution still continuing, the directors now lay before the mission a more definite and enlarged plan of operations, such as they suppose from actual experiment to be practicable, and of the highest interests to the moral, social, literary, and spiritual condition of this people.\"\n\n The design of the high school is set forth in six chapters, which express provisions for teaching general literature and the sciences, and the following, being paragraphs one and four and paragraph five of chapter three:\n'To aid the mission in accomplishing the great work for which they were sent hither, that is, to introduce and perpetuate the religion of out Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, with all its accompanying blessings, civil, literary, and religious.\n\n'4. Another object still more definite and of equal or greater importance, is to educate young men of piety and promising talents, with a view to their becoming assistant teachers of religion or fellow laborers with us in disseminating the gospel of Jesus Christ to their dying fellowmen.\n\n'5. He shall also watch over the moral and spiritual interests of the scholars; he shall cause a portion of their weekly studies to be directed to the great truths of the Bible, that while they increase in science and literature, they may have the means of that knowledge which makes wise unto salvation.'\n\n It is found, however, that 'so far as the proposed curriculum contemplated the preparation of graduates of the school for immediate service in the ministry, it was never carried out, though frequently referred to by contemporaneous writers as the eventual design of the school.'\n It is further found that the main object of the school from 1835 to 1839 was the education of Hawaiian teachers for the common schools. The curriculums of other years are given, and it is found that, 'after the transfer to the government, the \n\n[215 U.S. 554, 567]\n\u00a0\n institution continued to be primarily for the education of teachers ( Report Minister Public Instruction, 1850, p. 26; Report President Board of Education, 1872, p. 4), from the middle classes of the Hawaiian people ( Report President Board of Education, 1886, p. 3). Education for the ministry is not referred to in any official report as one of the purposes of the school, but the most that could be said is the statement by Rufus Anderson, secretary of the A. B. C. F. M.: 'A year spent in theological study with a missionary is thought sufficient to prepara a pious graduate of Lahainaluna for the pastoral office.' Anderson, Hawaiian Islands, p. 189.\n And there are findings as to the events of 1863, 1864, and 1865, the principal of which was the opinion of the attorney general, and a dispute between the mission and the board of education as to the right of appointment of teachers.\n The opinion of the attorney general recognized that the school was received by the government and was held by it, under conditions which, if not performed, would require the government to reconvey the property or pay the mission $15,000.\n The dispute over the appointment of teachers arose in April, 1865. In a letter to the president of the board of education, the mission asserted the right to appoint, and suggested the names of certain persons. The board of education replied, asking for the grounds 'on which any such claim to interfere in the internal management of said school appear to you to be founded.' The mission replied, asserting the right of appointment as a means of accomplishing the purpose of the transfer. It was said that nothing was 'more evident than that the mission intended carefully to guard against the introduction into the institution of any doctrine, practice, or influence antagonistic to its own faith and practice and form of Christian worship.' And they asserted, further, that 'nothing could be clearer than that the missionaries contemplated still to have this a co- operating institution to aid them, as it had already done in times past, in the diffusion of \n\n[215 U.S. 554, 568]\n\u00a0\n solid science and Christianity as they understood it, as benevolent Congregationalists and Presbyterians of the United States, who had contributed to build and sustain the institution, understood and practised it.' And it was said that 'an object so dear to them would not have been given up without the intention of so guarding in the future as to have it continue to aid instead of defeat the purpose for which it was founded.' In further emphasis of this intention the writer of the letter said that he knew 'that the intention was to secure the continued co-operation of the seminary in the work which the American Board was prosecuting' there 'through its mission.' The board of education admitted that the institution was to be continued so as to 'aid instead of defeating the purpose for which it was founded,' and said 'nothing had been done to justify the intimation that the board' had 'any desire to defeat such purpose, or introduce any doctrine, practice, or influence antagonistic to the faith, practice, and forms of worship of the founders.' The board dissented from the view expressed by the mission, that the appointment of any man not acceptable to it to the post of teacher was a 'violation of the whole spirit of the agreement,' and said that a full compliance with the agreement consisted 'in appointing persons teaching in the doctrine and after the manner of the Congregational and Presbyterian churches of the United States.' The board concluded by saying that they were aware that if they did not see fit to carry on the institution according to the terms of the contract they had to reconvey it or to pay the sum of $15,000, and that, if the views expressed were not satisfactory, the board would think favorably of a proposition to reconvey it at once.\n It will be seen, therefore, that from the agreement, as gathered from the correspondence and from the extrinsic evidence which we have detailed, there can be no doubt that the school was transferred by the mission and accepted by the government upon the condition that definite Christian doctrines should be taught; namely, doctrines which constituted \n\n[215 U.S. 554, 569]\n\u00a0\n the belief of the Congregational and Presbyterian churches of the United States, and not merely some form of general, evangelical Christianity.\n Religious instruction, 'represented by the second or substituted confession of faith,' according to finding 23, was continued from 1865 to 1877\n\n\n In December, 1876, upon the recommendation of Dr. Bishop, a change was made from the Hawaiian to English as a medium of instruction, comment upon which will be presently made. We omit, as not important, the curriculum as to secular studies after 1877. The findings as to religious instruction must, however, be given in full:\n'There is no evidence that the substituted confession of faith was in use at Lahainaluna as a creed, doctrine, or standard of religious instruction at any period. There is no evidence of any formal creed as a standard to which the pupils were required or instructed to adhere.\n\n'(29) From 1877 until the present date the course of religious instruction has been substantially the same. This includes morning prayer, including occasional discussions of passages of the Scripture, compulsory attendance at Sunday school, with preparation of the international Sunday- school lessons furnished by the Hawaiian board itself, and compulsory attendance at Christian Endeavor exercises Sunday evenings, at which the pupils discuss biblical subjects based on the Christian Endeavor topic as given in the Christian Endeavor World. Nothing in this religious teaching is contrary to any religious tenet or doctrine expressed in the substituted confesson of faith. Mr. Macdonald, who had been principal since 1903, testifies that no creed had been taught during that time at the school, but that he had tried to make upright, truthful Christian men, and held Christ up as the best example to follow; that he had taught nothing about the Pope, or the doctrine of the trinity, or the doctrine of Adam's fall, or that the descendants of Adam were without holiness and alienated from God until their hearts were renewed with divine grace; that on \n\n[215 U.S. 554, 570]\n\u00a0\n Sunday there was a Sunday school and occasionally, in the morning, a service, in the evening a Christian Endeavor meeting; that the first year he was in Lahainaluna the boys were allowed to go to Lahaina to their own churches, but since then, with the exception of the day scholars, numbering ten or twelve, they were required to stay on the ground on Sunday and attend Sunday school and the evening exercises; that the chapel exercises on week-day mornings lasted about ten minutes and consisted of a hymn, a portion of the Scripture, and a repeating of the Lord's Prayer in unison, and occasionally incidental remarks by the principal regarding the passage of the Scripture; that there was no direct Christian instruction given in the class-room exercises during the week days other than moral instruction, as teaching the boys to do their work honestly; that the Sunday morning exercises consisted of a regular system of Bible instruction following the international Sunday-school lesson series purchased from the Hawaiian Board; that the Sunday-school lessons were assigned in advance; that in the Christian Endeavor meetings the Christian Endeavor topic in a modified form as given in the Christian Endeavor World was usually taken, and prayers sometimes offered by the boys and the teachers.\n\n'(30) There is no evidence of any protest with regard to Lahainaluna or the course of study there from the American Board or from the Hawaiian Evangelical Association as bodies, but first objection is from the plaintiffs who are trustees of certain property rights under deed from the American Board.'\n\n It is further found that 'technical and agricultural training have been prominent features of the school for over half of a century, and the emphasis laid on agricultural work in the past few years does not amount to a change in kind, but one in degree. There has been no change in the official designation of the school.'\n In 1903 there was a movement to obtain the Federal aid available for agricultural colleges, in connection with which the Deputy Attorney General gave an opinion as to the \n\n[215 U.S. 554, 571]\n\u00a0\n character of the school, the conditions upon which the government of Hawaii had received it, and the effect of the provisions of the organic act of the territory, that no 'public money be appropriated for the support or benefit of any sectarian, denominational, or private school.' [ 31 Stat. at L. 150, chap. 339,  55.] The opinion is quoted at length in the findings, but we are only concerned with parts of it. It recognizes that the school was received upon the condition of cultivating sound literature and solid science. This, it was said, was affirmative and could not be escaped. The provision for religious instruction, he declared, was negative and was satisfied by no religious teaching whatever. His conclusion was, and we quote his words: 'So long as the government maintains this school, it shall not teach any doctrine contrary to the confession of faith, but it is not compelled to teach any religious doctrine whatever; and therefore, in my opinion, cannot be held to be a sectarian institution.' And further, 'that the school is not a sectarian institution under the prohibition stated in  55 of the organic act.'\n As we have said, the supreme court of the territory gave especial prominence to the ruling on extrinsic evidence, and made it contradictory to the agreement as expressed in the correspondence. This result was worked out, as it seems to us, by giving too much effect to the curriculum of the school after 1877. That, indeed, might be considered as tending to show that the agreement had been abandoned or its conditions waived, but not that it did not exist. To this proposition of abandonment or waiver we then will address ourselves, and, as relevant to it, the views of the supreme court of the territory may be given. They are exhibited in the following paragraphs:\n'Under the decision of the United States Supreme Court we are to construe the condition of transfer in the light of the circumstances which preceded it and the immediate and long-continued practice under it. Confining ourselves for the present to the condition respecting religious instruction, reading, \n\n[215 U.S. 554, 572]\n\u00a0\n 'it shall not teach or allow to be taught any religious tenet or doctrine contrary to those heretofore inculcated by the mission which we represent, a summary of which will be found in the confession of faith herewith inclosed,' the following possible constructions of the language may be considered.\n\n'(1) That the condition is purely negative in character, and does not require the teaching of any religious doctrine. This construction is precluded by the decision of the United States Supreme Court.\n\n'(2) That the contents of the confession of faith should be taught as a formal doctrine or creed. There is no evidence that the parties ever acted upon this interpretation. No evidence has been presented that the substituted confession of faith was in use at Lahainaluna as a creed, doctrine, or standard of religious instruction at any period. Dr. Bishop, who was in the school from 1865 until 1877, testified that he had never seen it. (Transcript, p. 13.) In fact, there is no evidence of any formal creed as a standard to which the pupils were required or instructed to adhere.\n\n'(3) That religion should be taught, and that, as taught, it should not be contrary to the doctrines mentioned. Thus construed, it is obvious that it allows considerable latitude in the amount of religious instruction. If it means that theology shall form part of the curriculum of the school, the condition was broken as early as 1877, and any action thereon is long since barred by the statute of limitations applicable to claims against the government. Rev. Laws,  2004; Hartman v. United States, 35 Ct. Cl. 106. If, however, the acts and statements of the parties in 1865 are to be relied upon as contemporaneous construction, the same must be true of the acts of the parties in 1877, and from thence to the present day. The fact that the change from Hawaiian to English as a medium of instruction necessarily involved the discontinuance of abstract studies of a theological nature is obvious. The fact that this change was made upon the recommendation of Dr. Bishop and with the full acquiescence of all concerned \n\n[215 U.S. 554, 573]\n\u00a0\n from 1877 until 1903, is surely as potent as the actions of the parties during the preceding years. To the present day there has been no protest from the American Board or from the Hawaiian Evangelical Association as bodies, but the first objection is from the plaintiffs, who are trustees of certain property rights under deed from the American Board, the terms of which will be more fully considered later.\n\n'Unless the condition prescribes the amount and extent of religious instruction, it has not been broken. From 1877 until the present date the course of religious instruction has been substantially the same.' [19 Haw. 146.]\n\n The first proposition, the court said, was precluded by our first decision; of the other two, the court felt free to exercise its judgment. In this it committed error. We have shown how antagonistic the contentions of the parties were, and we tried to be clear in our decision of them. We did more than decide that the condition as to religion was not negative. We gave it more force than simple inhibition of teaching something which was not inconsistent with the religion of the mission. We gave it the force of a requirement to teach that religion, and more, to deucate young men to teach it. The supreme court, however, says that there is no evidence that the parties ever acted upon the interpretation 'that the contents of the confession of faith should be taught as a formal doctrine or creed.' Exactly what is meant by the words 'formal doctrine or creed' is not clear, but if they mean the religion of the mission, the conclusion was not open to the court to draw nor do the findings sustain it. Dr. Bishop testified, it is true, that he had never seen the confession of faith until it was shown in the present case but he also testified that 'the system of doctrine which was taught was substantially the old orthodox Congregational or Presbyterian doctrine.' As to the confession of faith, he said, 'that it very well represented the form of doctrine taught at Lahainaluna.' Nor do we draw the same conclusion from the change from Hawaiian to English as a medium of instruction that the \n\n[215 U.S. 554, 574]\n\u00a0\n supreme court drew. Dr. Bishop did recommend the change and he expressed a fear that the consequences might be an omission of studies of an abstract nature, in which he included 'evidences of Christianity;' but he suggested such instruction could be committed to the 'exceptionably' able Hawaiian teacher whom he mentioned. But there is nothing in that to show that a definite form of religion could not be taught. There might be difficulty in it, of course, but that such a difficulty could not be overcome would take all purpose or justification from missionary societies. Besides, because the school met difficulties, might have to yield temporarily to them for varying periods of time, cannot be considered as conclusive of the intention of the parties to abandon the purpose expressed in the agreement or to waive its obligations. And this is an answer to the other contentions of the territory. That the mission would encounter difficulties in its way was no doubt guessed when the school was founded. It was demonstrated by trial. For the better execution of the purpose of its foundation, the mission transferred it to the government. The government, too, met difficulties. Its duty was to strive against them, overcome them if possible, not to make them a reason to violate its contract. But it is said by the supreme court that if the condition be 'that theology shall form part of the curriculum of the school, the condition was broken as early as 1877, and any action thereon is long since barred by the statute of limitations applicable to claims against the government.' This might be if the obligation of the government had been to pay money simply. Its obligation was not that, as we have seen, but to perform a trust expressly assumed by it. In other words, it was the grantee of an estate upon condition, having the right, however, to elect to pay $15,000 as an alternative of the performance of the condition. We find no evidence of such election in what occurred in 1877, nor indeed long subsequently to that date. The circumstances must be kept in mind and the relation of the parties. The government had received a gift of vaulable property, the \n\n[215 U.S. 554, 575]\n\u00a0\n product of voluntary contributions. It was given and received for a special purpose,-the purpose for which the contributions were made. The government accepted it and pledged its faith for the execution of the purpose,-a faith, we may assume, which was as much relied on as the sanctions which accompanied it. It is not possible to believe that the government had so little sense of its obligations that, if it had intended to depart from its agreement, it would not have offered to reconvey the property or tender the execution of the alternative which it had reserved; and we certainly cannot hold that a mere change in the course of studies, which might have temporary excuse, instantly acted to make the grantors of the property claimants for money, against whom the statute of limitations would immediately begin to run. The government's right should not be overlooked in this connection. The following is the condition expressed in the proposal made to the government: 'That in case of the nonfulfilment or violation of the conditions upon which this transfer is made by the said government, the whole property hereby transferred, hereinbefore specified, together with any additions or improvements which may have been made upon the premises, and all the rights and privileges hereby conveyed or transferred to the Hawaiian government, by the said island mission, shall revert to the said mission, to have and to hold the same for and in behalf of the American Board of Commissioners of Foreign Missions.' The acceptance of the government was as follows: 'That, in case of nonfulfilment on the part of the government of the conditions specified, it shall be optional with this government to allow the institution, with all additions and improvements which may have been made upon the premises, and all rights and privileges connected therewith, to revert to the said mission, or pay the sum of $15,000.' The onus, therefore, was upon the government to act, not upon the mission. To avert the reversion of the property to the mission a way was provided, but it did not enter into the head of anybody that, by a \n\n[215 U.S. 554, 576]\n\u00a0\n failure to adopt it instantly upon a change of studies, the property passed back to the grantor. But such was the inevitable result if there was a breach of the conditions in 1877, and such was the result if there was a breach later than 1877. It might be contended that such result would not ensue without some action upon the part of the mission. But it was certainly optional with the mission to treat the breach, if there was a breach, as a forfeiture. It is said in Hubbard v. Hubbard, 97 Mass. 188, 93 Am. Dec. 75, that it is optional with the grantor of an estate upon condition, in case the breach of the condition occurs, whether he will avail himself of the same as a forfeiture of the estate. To do so, it is further said, requires action on his part, and, if he is not in possession, usually requires entry for breach of condition. Until such entry the grantee holds his estate liable only to be defeated, but it is not actually determined by the forfeiture.\n It is said in Carbon Block Coal Co. v. Murphy, 101 Ind. 115, 117, 118 : \"A condition may be waived by one who has a right to enforce it . . . but a mere silent acquiescence in, or parol assent to, an act which has constituted a breach of an express condition in a deed, would not amount to a waiver of a right of forfeiture for such breach.' Lindsey v. Lindsey, 45 Ind. 552, 567; 2 Washb. Real Prop. 16. A mere indulgence is never construed into a waiver of a breach of a condition. Gray v. Blanchard, 8 Pick. 284; Jackson ex dem. Bronck v. Crysler, 1 Johns. Cas. 125.'\n In Union College v. New York, 173 N. Y. 38, 93 Am. St. Rep. 569, 65 N. E. 853, a deed conveying land to Long Island City for the purpose of building a city hall contained the provision that, if the land should cease to be used for such or other similar buildings, the land should revert to the grantor as if the conveyance had not been made, was held to be a condition subsequent, and required the grantee to comply therewith within a reasonable time. It was further held that ten years was a reasonable time for compliance with the covenant, and that the fact that the grantor did not assert a right to re-enter for fifteen \n\n[215 U.S. 554, 577]\n\u00a0\n years after the breach did not operate as an estoppel, or preclude him from insisting upon a forfeiture and claiming possession. It was also held that a grantor was not compelled to demand performance before bringing action of ejectment. The court said:\n'The condition was the use and the continuing use of the land for the purpose of the grant. The long-continued silence of the plaintiff could not operate as an estoppel upon or preclude it from insisting upon a forfeiture and from claiming possession of the premises. The effect of an express condition in a deed cannot be destroyed by silent acquiescence. Jackson ex dem. Bronck v. Crysler, supra. The title to the property was vested in the grantee, and the plaintiff was entitled to assume that its grantee would comply with the condition of the grant. If it elected to await compliance as long as it did, that fact cannot be construed against its right to reclaim possession.'\n\n In Coleman v. Whitney, 62 Vt. 123, 9 L.R.A. 517, 20 Atl. 322, a mortgage deed was executed by a husband, the condition of which was a promise to support the wife of the grantor during her life. The condition was performed for a time and then violated. The wife brought suit to obtain a maintenance from the mortgaged premises. It was held that she was entitled to such relief, notwithstanding there had been successive conveyances of the property, and the successive owners had occupied the premises under their deeds, and had, in no way recognized her rights; and it was held further, that the obligation to support the wife was a continuing one, and that 'the lapse of fifteen years without receiving support, simply because she did not ask it, would be no bar.'\n It was said in Oliver v. Piatt, 3 How. 333, 411, 11 L. ed. 622, 657, that the mere lapse of time constitutes of itself no bar to the enforcement of a subsisting trust; and time begins to run against a trust only from the time when it is openly disavowed by the trustee, who insists upon an adverse right and interest, which is fully and unequivocally made known to the cestui que trust. \n\n[215 U.S. 554, 578]\n\u00a0\n In Tynan v. Warren, 53 N. J. Eq. 313, 321, 31 Atl. 596, Vice Chancellor Green, speaking for the court, said: 'I do not understand that mere delay in bringing a suit will deprive a party of his remedy, unless such neglect has so prejudiced the other party by loss of testimony or means of proof or changed relations that it would be unjust to now permit him to exercise his right.' It is certain that none of those conditions appear in the present case. A mere change of the curriculum was not, of itself, an unequivocal disavowal of the trust, or an assertion of adverse right or interest in the government, and we find nothing in the record tantamount to such disavowal and assertion until the governor of the territory and the superintendent of public instruction refused the demand of the plaintiffs' attorney to either pay the $15,000 or reconvey the property. The grounds of their refusal we are not informed of, but it was a disavowal of the trust and a denial of the alternative obligation to pay the money. The right of election in the territory then passed to the plaintiffs, appellants here, and the bringing of the action was a sufficient exercise of it.\n It is finally contended that the appellants cannot maintain this action. The supreme court of the territory sustained this contention, saying, however, that it based its 'decision upon the consideration of the substantial rights involved.' The right of the plaintiffs is derived from a deed executed July 25, 1903, by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions to the plaitiffs as 'trustees.' It recites that the grantor is desirous of contributing to the support and maintenance of the Board of Hawaiian Evangelical Association, an eleemosynary corporation organized and established 'in the great work of propagating Protestant Christianity, and for that purpose the land and property particularly described and referred to in trust, in order to assist said intended beneficiary to effectually carry out its corporate powers and purposes in said Hawaiian Islands.' The instrument revokes and annuls all powers of attorney and grants of authority theretofore given to any person or persons \n\n[215 U.S. 554, 579]\n\u00a0\n whomsoever, and gives, grants, bargains and sells, conveys and confirms, unto F. J. Lowrey, Henry Waterhous, and William O. Smith, certain lands described in the schedule annexed to the instrument, together with 'all other lands in the possession of or belonging to the said grantor, or to which said grantor has right, title, interest, claim, or demand whatsoever, at law or in equity, and whether held by it in fee simple, as lessee thereof, beneficiary therein, or otherwise, as fully and to all intent and purpose as though a particular description thereof was herein incorporated and included in said schedule . . .' to have and to hold the same 'in trust, nevertheless for the following uses and purposes, that is to say: First. To hold, manage, and control the same, and receive and take the rents, issues, profits, income, and proceeds of sales and authorized mortgages thereof, and hold such increment and realizations under the same trusts as the above granted trust property, using and applying the same, however, in the manner hereinafter provided. . . . Sixth. And generally to do and perform every act and thing, and exercise every power and authority whatsoever, not herein specifically denied or withheld from or herein directed to be otherwise done or exercised by said trustees, as fully and to every intent and purpose as though the said trustees were the absolute owners in fee in their own personal right of the property hereby conveyed. Seventh. Any and all moneys arising from or out of the property of the trust estate, whether by way of rents or other issues and income, or from sales or mortgages thereof, shall be received and held by said trustees;' and after the payment of taxes and other expenses, 'and until otherwise directed' by the grantor, shall be delivered 'to said beneficiary, from time to time, any balance or portion of the moneys, then remaining in their hands over and above what may, in their judgment, be required for the current expenses connected with the said trust, any unapplied balance to be placed on general deposit, or the said trustees may invest the same upon security, as they may approve.' \n\n[215 U.S. 554, 580]\n\u00a0\n And the grantor reserved 'the full right and authority, at any time or times, to direct any change or alteration in the disposition of the income and proceeds of the trust estate,' or to remove any trustee or fill any vacancy however occurring.\n It will be observed, therefore, that the instrument was designed to convey every interest in property that the grantor had. Considering its language and careful provisions, its purposes, and the control reserved to the grantor of the trust and the disposition of funds, it would be a narrow construction of it to hold that the interest of the grantor in the Lahainaluna school did not pass by it, whether such interest was a right to receive a conveyance of the school or of the $15,000 which was to be in lieu of such conveyance. In other words, to completely enforce the rights and interests of the mission in the school, and devote it or the proceeds from it to the purposes of the trusts which were created.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to enter judgment for appellants as prayed for.\n Mr. Justice Brewer took no part in the decision. \n\n\n\n","105":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLUDWIG v. WESTERN UNION TEL. CO.(1910)\nNo. 45\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. Hal. L. Norwood, William F. Kirby, Joseph M. Hill, and Otis T. Wingo for appellant.\n\n\n[216 U.S. 146, 149]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Rush Taggart, George B. Rose, and Henry D. Estabrook for appellee.\n\n\n[216 U.S. 146, 151]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion or the court:\n The Western Union Telegraph Company, a corporation of New York, doing business, both interstate and intrastate, in Arkansas, as it had done for many years, brought this suit against O. C. Ludwig, secretary of state of Arkansas, for the purpose of obtaining a decree that the statute of that state of May 13th, 1907, entitled, 'An Act to Permit Foreign Corpora- \n\n[216 U.S. 146, 152]\n\u00a0\n tions to Do business in Arkansas, and Fixing Fees to Be Paid by All Corporation,' Acts of Ark. 1907, p. 744, was unconstitutional, null, and void, and enjoining the defendant, in his official capacity, from attempting to revoke, or proclaiming through official newspaper publications that he had revoked, the authority of the plaintiff to do business in Arkansas, or that it had no right to continue doing business in that state. The plaintiff, in its bill, asked such other and further relief as the case might require and as might seem just.\n A temporary injunction was issued, and thereafter the defendant demurred and answered at the same time. The demurrer was on these grounds: That the court was without jurisdiction to hear and determine the case, 'the same being, in effect, a suit against the state' by a citizen of another state, to prevent the enforcement of one of its criminal or penal statutes; that the facts stated in the bill are not sufficient to constitute a cause of action nor to warrant the relief asked; and that the bill was wholly without equity. The answer denied all the material allegations of the bill.\n Subsequently, the plaintiff, by leave of the court, filed an amendment of its bill. To that amendment no answer was made, but, all parties being present, the cause was heard, without objection, on the demurrer to the bill. The demurrer was overruled, and the defendant having elected not to plead further, the injunction previously granted was made perpetual. From that order the present appeal was prosecuted.\n The above statute, known as the Wingo act, whose constitutionality is questioned by the plaintiff, is as follows (the italics being ours):\n' 1. Every company or corporation incorporated under the laws of any other state, territory, or country, including foreign railroad and foreign fire and life insurance companies, now or hereafter doing business in this state, shall file in the office of the secretary of state in this state a copy of its charter or articles of incorporation or association, or a copy of its certificate of incorporation, duly authenticated and certified by the \n\n[216 U.S. 146, 153]\n\u00a0\n proper authority, together with a statement of its assets and liabilities and the amount of its capital employed in this state, and shall also designate its general office or place of business in this state, and shall name an agent upon whom process may be served. Provided, before authority is granted to any foreign corporation to do business in this state, it must file with the secretary of state a resolution adopted by its board of directors, consenting that service of process upon any agent of such company in this state, or upon the secretary of state of this state, in any action brought or pending in this state, shall be a valid service upon said company; and, if process is served upon the secretary of state, it shall be his duty to at once send it by mail, addressed to the company at its principal office; and if any company shall, without the consent of the other party to any suit or proceeding brought by or against it in any court of this state, remove said suit or proceeding to any Federal court, or shall institute any suit or proceeding against any citizen of this state in any Federal court, it shall be the duty of the secretary of state to forthwith revoke all authority to such company and its agents to do business in this state, and to publish such revocation in some newspaper of general circulation published in this state; and if such corporation shall thereafter continue to do business in this state, it shall be subject to the penalty of this act for each day it shall continue to do business in this state after such revocation.\n\n' 2. Any foreign corporation which shall fail to comply with the provisions of this act, and shall do any business in this state, shall be subject to a fine of not less than $1,000, to be recovered before any court of competent jurisdiction, and all such fines so recovered shall be paid into the general revenue fund of the county in which the cause of action shall accrue; and it is hereby made the duty of the prosecuting attorneys to institute said suits in the name of the state, for the use and benefit of the county in which the suit is brought, and such prosecuting attorney shall receive as his compensation one fourth of the amount recovered, and as an additional penalty, any \n\n[216 U.S. 146, 154]\n\u00a0\n foreign corporation which shall fail or refuse to file its articles of incorporation or certificate as aforesaid, cannot make any contract in this state which can be enforced by it either in law or in equity; and the complying with the provisions of this act after suit is instituted shall in no way validate said contract.\n\n'3. That all corporations hereafter incorporated in this state, and all foreign corporations seeking to do business in this state, shall pay into the treasury of this state for the filing of said articles a fee of $ 25 where the capital stock is $50,000 or under; $75 where the capital stock is over $50,000, and not more than $100,000; and $25 additional for each $100,000 of capital stock.\n\n'Any foreign mutual corporation having no capital stock shall be required to pay to the secretary of state for filing its articles of incorporation the sum of $500. Provided, however, nothing in this section shall apply to fraternal orders that write insurance.\n\n' 4. That act 185, approved April 17, 1907, and entitled, 'An Act to Provide a Manner in Which Foreign Corporations May Become Domestic Corporations, and for Other Purposes,' and all laws and parts of laws in conflict herewith, be and the same are hereby repealed; and that this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage.' Acts of Ark. 1907, p. 744.\n\n As the case was decided on demurrer to the bill, the material facts properly alleged are to be taken as true on this hearing. The case made by the plaintiff in its bill is substantially as will be now outlined.\n The telegraph company was organized in 1851, and immediately thereafter began the work of constructing and operating telegraph lines. Its system extended throughout the United States and Canada, and connected with lines in Mexico and Central and South America by means of submarine cables, and with telegraph systems of foreign countries.\n Among the lines so constructed, and forming a component part of the company's system, and connecting with its main office in New York, are lines within Arkansas, most of which \n\n[216 U.S. 146, 155]\n\u00a0\n were constructed since 1867, in which year the company accepted the terms and conditions of the act of Congress of July 24th, 1866, entitled, 'An Act to Aid in the Construction of Telegraph Lines, and to Secure to the Government the Use of the Same for Postal, Military, and Other Purposes.' 14 Stat. at L. 221, chap. 230, Rev. Stat.  5263 to 5269, inclusive, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3579 to 3582\n\n\n It should be stated in this connection that the bill alleges that the company's lines within Arkansas are upon the public domain and upon the military and post roads of the United States, are part of the postal routes and postal establishment of the United States, and, as such, the complainant has, under the Constitution and laws of the United States, the power, and is under obligation, to transmit all messages for the government and for the public generally as much and as fully with respect to messages between points within the said state as interstate messages. The company's lines within Arkansas were constructed with the consent and permission of the state, certainly without objection on its part, and in accordance with its laws. The amount which the company, up to the bringing of this suit, had invested in lines within Arkansas, was $153,000, and continuously since their construction the telegraph company has used them 'for the transmission of telegraph messages for the government of the United States, and the several departments thereof, and for the public, as an instrumentality of the Postal Department and of commerce wholly within the state of Arkansas, and also for interstate commerce and commerce between points in said state and foreign countries, and thus said telegraph lines have been continuously employed in domestic, interstate, and foreign commerce since their construction.'\n The above act of 1907 requires that every foreign corporation doing or seeking to do business in the state should file in the office of the secretary of state a copy of its charter or articles of incorporation, duly authenticated, together with a statement of its assets and liabilities and the amount of its capital employed in the state, and designate its general office \n\n[216 U.S. 146, 156]\n\u00a0\n or place of business therein, and the name of an agent upon whom process in any action brought or pending in the state may be served. The company tendered to the secretary of state a duly authenticated copy of a resolution of the board of directors, assenting to the designation of an agent upon whom process against the company might be served; also, the above required statement; 'and offered to the secretary of state [who claimed to proceed under the above act of 1907] all reasonable fees for the filing and recording of the said papers.' But the secretary of state refused and still refuses to file the same unless the telegraph company pays to him a fee of $75 upon the first $100,000 of its capital stock, and $ 25 upon each additional $100,000 of stock. The capital stock of the telegraph company being $100,000,000, the sum which the secretary required to be paid as a condition of the company's right to have its articles of incorporation filed, and thereafter to continue doing business within Arkansas without incurring the penalties prescribed by the statute, was $ 25.050.\n We have seen that the act of 1907 provided that if any foreign corporation, without the consent of the other party to any suit brought by or against it in any state court, should remove such suit to the Federal court, or institute a suit against a citizen of Arkansas in the Federal court, it became the duty of the secretary of state to forthwith revoke all authority in the company and its agents to do business in Arkansas, and publish such revocation in some newspaper of general circulation in the state; and if, after such revocation, the company continued to do any business in Arkansas, it became subject to a fine of not less than $1,000 for each day it so continued, to be recovered by suits instituted by prosecuting attorneys in the name of the state, for the use and benefit of the county in which the suit was brought; so, if the company failed to comply with any of the provisions of the act, it became subject to a fine of $1,000; further, if a foreign corporation failed or refused to file its articles of incorporation, as required, it could not 'make any contract' in Arkansas 'which can be enforced \n\n[216 U.S. 146, 157]\n\u00a0\n by it either in law or in equity.' Before the bringing of this suit, the company had, in fact, instituted a suit in the United States circuit court to enjoin the prosecuting attorneys in the several districts of the state from proceeding against it to recover the penalties set forth in the act in question,-the suit of Western U. Teleg. v. Andrews, this day decided. [ \n216 U.S. 165\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 286.]\n It is alleged, and the demurrer admits, that the secretary of state has threatened to promulgate, and, unless restrained by order of court, will promulgate, a proclamation that the authority of the company to do business in Arkansas has been revoked, and publish the fact of such revocation in the newspapers, thereby making it appear that the company had become subject to the prescribed penalties to be recovered in suits brought by the state's prosecuting attorneys and incapacitated, if the statute be enforced against it, to make any contract in Arkansas, whatever its subject-matter, which is enforceable in law or equity.\n The special grounds upon which the statute in question is alleged to be unconstitutional and void may be thus summarized:\n\n 1. \nIt imposes upon the secretary of state the duty-in the event the company instituted a suit in the Federal court against a citizen of Arkansas, or removed to the Federal court, without the consent of the other party, any suit brought by or against it any court of the state-to forthwith revoke its authority to do business within Arkansas, and subjects the company to the penalty of $1,000 for each day's continuance of such business in the state after such revocation.\n\n 2. \nIf the company fails to file a copy of its articles of incorporation with the secretary of state, and does not pay, in advance of such filing, the required fee or tax, based on its capital stock, which represents its property and business everywhere, inside and outside of the state, it is made liable to a fine of $1,000 for continuing, after such failure, to do business in Arkansas.\n\n 3. \nAs the lines established by the company in Arkansas are \n\n[216 U.S. 146, 158]\n\u00a0\n practically of no value unless used as the same have been located and constructed, any provision that would prohibit their being used for the purposes and as the same were constructed and designed to be used would deny it the equal protection of the laws and deprive it of its property without due process of law.\n\n 4. \nThe state lays an unequal burden on the plaintiff as compared with corporations of Arkansas, in that domestic corporations, organized and existing at the time of the passage of the statute, are not required to pay into the treasury of the state any sum whatever upon their capital stock, but are allowed to continue their business without the payment of any sum; while corporations of other states, even those having lines within the state, under the protection thereof, are required to pay a large tax measured by their entire capital stock, wherever employed, for the privilege of continuing in Arkansas their established and existing business, whether the same be domestic or foreign commerce.\n\n 5. \nUpon the failure of the company to pay the required fee, based on its capital stock employed both within and without the state, the company is forbidden, or is not allowed, to make any contract within the state, which can be enforced either in law or equity, whether the same relates to domestic, interstate, or foreign commerce; whereby, it is alleged, the statute denies to the company the equal protection of the laws, and seeks to enforce an illegal exaction for the privilege of using its property for purposes of domestic, interstate, and foreign commerce.\n\n 6. \nAs the company originally-some thirty or forty years ago-entered the state of Arkansas, and constructed and has operated its lines of telegraph, with the consent of the state, and during that period has extended and operated its lines within its limits, with its consent; as the state, from time to time, through legislative enactments, has not only recognized the company's right to transact business within its limits, but regulated its business and affairs; and as, during the above \n\n[216 U.S. 146, 159]\n\u00a0\n period, with the knowledge and acquiescence of the state, and in reliance upon such license, consent, and acquiescence, the company has expended large sums of money for the purpose of transmitting messages between the people of Arkansas, the state cannot withdraw its license and expel the company from its limits, even with respect to local business, without impairing the obligation of the company's contract with the state.\n Such is the case as made by bill; and the relief asked is a decree declaring the statute unconstitutional, and restraining any attempt to collect said fee of $25,050, and from imposing any of the penalties prescribed by it or by any provision therein (except the one requiring the designation of an agent upon whom process may be served in any suit brought against the telegraph company), and enjoining the defendant from attempting to revoke, or from proclaiming that he has revoked, its authority to do business in Arkansas.\n The first contention of the appellant is that this action is one against the state within the meaning of the 11th Amendment of the Constitution, declaring that the judicial power of the United States shall not extend to any suit in law or equity against a state by a citizen of another state. This contention must be held untenable on the authority of Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Andrews, this day decided.\n But the vital question in the case is as to the constitutionality of the Arkansas statute. It is insisted by the plaintiff, among other grounds, that the provision in the statute requiring a foreign corporation seeking to do business in the state to pay a fee based upon the amount of its capital stock, for filing with the secretary of state its articles of incorporation or association, is a device which, in effect and by its necessary operation, under the guise of regulating intrastate business, imposes a tax on the interstate business of such corporation, as well as a tax on its property used and permanently located outside of the state. \n\n[216 U.S. 146, 160]\n\u00a0\n Interpreting it according to the ordinary acceptation of its words, the statute does not discriminate between corporations engaged in interstate commerce and corporations whose business is intrastate in its character, so to make it clear that the state has not assumed to regulate or burden interstate business. Its words are unqualified and are made applicable to 'every company or corporation incorporated under the laws of any other state, territory, or country, including foreign railroad and foreign fire and life insurance companies, now or hereafter doing business in this state.'  1. 'Any foreign corporation which shall fail to comply with the provisions of this act and shall do any business in this state,' etc.  2. 'All corporations hereafter incorporated in this state, and all foreign corporations seeking to do business in this state,' etc. According to the words of the statute, not unreasonably construed, every corporation of another state, seeking to do business in Arkansas, whether interstate or domestic, in order that it may do business of any kind in Arkansas, without coming into conflict with the statute, must file a copy of its authenticated charter with the secretary of state; and it seems that before that officer will file such copy, the corporation must pay to him a given amount based upon its capital stock, representing, necessarily, all its business, interstate and intrastate, as well as all its property everywhere, beyond as well as within the state. If the foreign corporation, without first paying those amounts, does business of any kind in the state, it will incur not only the penalty of $1,000 for so doing, but will forfeit its right to make any contract in the state, enforceable in law or equity,-whatever its subject-matter,-even if it be one relating to the business of the United States or to commerce among states. A statute of that kind would be palpably in conflict with the constitution, and especially an invasion of rights under that instrument of a corporation engaged in interstate commerce and seeking to do business in Arkansas.\n But it is said that the statute in question should not be so \n\n[216 U.S. 146, 161]\n\u00a0\n broadly construed. The reasons given for this contention are these: Before the statute here in question was passed, there was in force in Arkansas a statute (act of February 16th, 1899, as amended by the act of May 8th, 1899, Kirby's Dig., chap. 31) which was very similar, in many respects, to the act of 1907, now under examination. The state supreme court had occasion to determine the scope and effect of that act of 1899. Its decision was handed down March 18th, 1907, while the legislature of Arkansas was in session, and on the same day another decision was rendered, holding material parts of that act to be repealed. Western U. Teleg. Co. v. State, 82 Ark. 302, 101 S. W. 745; Western U. Teleg. Co. v. State, 82 Ark. 309, 101 S. W. 748, 12 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 82. These decisions, as counsel suggest, virtually left the state without any statute prescribing fees to be paid by foreign corporations. Thereafter, on May 16th, 1907, the legislature passed the statute here in question, known as the Wingo act, which, with slight exceptions not necessary to be mentioned, was substantially like the act of 1899. The supreme court of the state, in Western U. Teleg. Co. v. State, 82 Ark. 309, 314, 101 S. W. 748, 12 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 82, construing the above act of 1899, had held that it was its duty, unless otherwise compelled by the plain, ordinary meaning of the words of a statute, to reject any construction that would bring it into conflict with the Constitution of the United States (Grenada County v. Brogden [Grenada County v. Brown] \n112 U.S. 261\n, 28 L. ed. 704, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 125; Cooley, Const. Lim.  218; Atty. Gen. ex rel. Corporation Comrs. v. Electric Storage Battery Co. 188 Mass. 239, 74 N. E. 467, 3 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 631); that it was too well settled to admit of debate, that 'it is beyond the power of the state, under the guise either of a license tax or police regulation, to impose burdens upon interstate commerce, or to deny a foreign corporation the right to engage in such commerce in the state,-' citing Leloup v. Mobile, \n127 U.S. 640\n, 32 L. ed. 311, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 134, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1383; Crutcher v. Kentucky, \n141 U.S. 47\n, 35 L. ed. 649, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 851; and Brennan v. Titusville, \n153 U.S. 289\n, 38 L. ed. 719, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 658, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 829. Its conclusion in that case was that the act of 1899 'must be construed to have been intended only to impose terms upon the right of a foreign corporation to carry on intrastate business, and it was a valid statute.' Now, the \n\n[216 U.S. 146, 162]\n\u00a0\n argument at the bar was that when the Wingo act was passed, the legislature must be deemed to have had in mind the judicial construction given to the previous act of 1899, and that it must be assumed that the same court would adhere to its already-expressed views; so that, if a case ever came before it hereafter that involved the meaning and scope of the Wingo act, expressed substantially in the same words as the act of 1899, the court would construe the Wingo act, as it construed the act of 1899, as intended only to apply to intrastate business, and not as having been enacted for the purpose of burdening or imposing illegal terms for the transaction of interstate business by foreign corporations in Arkansas.\n But the acceptance of this view would not remove the difficulty which confronts the state in the present case. According to well-settled rules of statutory construction, the validity of a statute, whatever its language, must be determined by its effect or operation, as manifested by the natural and reasonable meaning of the words employed. Henderson v. New York (Henderson v. Wickham) \n92 \nU.S. 259, 268\n, 23 S. L. ed. 543, 547. If a statute, by its necessary operation, really and substantially burdens the interstate business of a foreign corporation seeking to do business in a state, or imposes a tax on its property outside of such state, then it is unconstitutional and void, although the state legislature may not have intended to enact an invalid statute. But even if we should assume that the state court would construe the statute of 1907 as intended not to apply to interstate commerce, but only to local or intrastate business, we are, nevertheless, informed by its decision in Western U. Teleg. Co. v. State, 82 Ark. 309, 318, 101 S. W. 748, 12 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 82, that, in the opinion of the state court, the statute so construed is valied, and therefore the telegraph company, in order that it may safely continue local business in Arkansas, must first pay into the treasury of the state certain amounts based on its entire capital stock for simply filing its articles of incorporation with the secretary of state; and if it does not pay the specified fees, based on its entire capital stock, and yet continues to do intrastate busi- \n\n[216 U.S. 146, 163]\n\u00a0\n ness in Arkansas, it will incur the prescribed penalty of one thousand dollars for continuing to do business in the state, and, in addition, lose its power or right to make any enforceable contract in the state. These are, in effect, conditions upon which the telegraph company, lawfully engaged in interstate business, and entitled to be in Arkansas for such business, is permitted to enter the state to do local business within its limits. And these conditions have been prescribed, notwithstanding the company has been permitted for many years, long before the act here in question was passed, to do local business in the state with its permission and acquiescence, and has invested there large sums of money in preparing to serve the public efficiently in that kind of business. The capital stock of the company represents, we repeat, all its business, property, and interests throughout the United States and foreign countries, and the requirement that the company, engaged in interstate commerce, to continue to do a local business in Arkansas, and escape the heavy penalties prescribed, must pay a given amount (in this case $25,050), based on all its capital stock, merely for filing its articles of incorporation with the secretary of state, is, in effect, a direct burden and tax on its interstate business, as well as on its property outside of the state.\n The case cannot be distinguished in principle from Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Kansas and Pullman Co. v. Kansas, recently decided [\n216 \nU.S. 1, 56\n, 54 S. L. ed.-, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 190, 232]. The difference in the wording of the Kansas and Arkansas statutes, cannot take the present case out of the ruling of the former cases. On the authority of the Kansas cases, and for the reasons stated in the opinions therein, we hold the statute in question to be unconstitutional and void, as illegally burdening interstate commerce and imposing a tax on property beyond the jurisdiction of the state.\n Whether the statute of Arkansas is, in any particular, violative of the constitutional guaranty securing the equal protection of the laws, or of the guaranty prohibiting the deprivation of property, except by due process of law, or of any \n\n[216 U.S. 146, 164]\n\u00a0\n other constitutional guaranty, it is not necessary now to consider. What has been said is sufficient for the determination of the present case, and we do not at this time go further than is indicated in this opinion. Suffice it to say that the defendant threatens to issue, in his official capacity, and publish, in the newspapers, a proclamation to the effect-no matter upon what specific grounds-that the telegraph company is not authorized, but is forbidden, under penalty, by the laws of Arkansas, from continuing to do local business in that state. Such a proclamation, the court, as well as everyone else, must know, would not only produce confusion in and irreparable damage to the company's business in Arkansas, but would, in effect, declare that the company is not only subject to a prescribed penalty of $1,000 for continuing to do local business in Arkansas, but is forbidden to make any contract whatever in that state that is enforceable in law or equity. In order to prevent the contemplated or threatened injury to the company, the court below properly made a decree perpetually enjoining the appellant, as secretary of state, his agents and attorneys, from making proclamation that the telegraph company has no authority to continue doing business in Arkansas.\n Mr. Justice Moody heard the argument of this case, participated in its decision, and concurs in this opinion.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice McKenna, and Mr. Justice Holmes dissent.\n The decree below must be affirmed.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","106":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLUTCHER & MOORE LUMBER CO. v. KNIGHT(1910)\nNo. 101\nArgued: January 24, 1910Decided: April 11, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 257, 258]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Arsene P. Pujo, George E. Holland, Pujo, Moss & Sugar, and Holland & Holland for petitioners.\n Messrs. M. J. Cunningham and M. J. Cunningham, Jr., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n On January 28, 1882, Dan R. Knight and John A. Lovett sold to William J. Knight several tracts of land situated in the state of Louisiana. The price stated in the act of sale was $15,000, $500 cash and the balance, $ 14,500, on credit, evidenced by a note of the purchaser. On February 5, 1887, W. J. Knight sold to Viola P. Knight, wife of Dan R. Knight, a one- half interest, and on February 7, 1887, he sold to J. C. Knight a one- fourth interest in the same lands. The remaining one-fourth interest was parted with by an act of sale dated April 13, 1889, wherein W. J. Knight joined with Viola P. Knight and John C. Knight in selling the entire land to Henry J. Lutcher and G. Bedell Moore. On April 3, 1901, Moore sold his undivided one-half interest to the Lutcher & Moore Lumber Company. All these acts of sale were duly recorded in the proper land conveyance records. \n\n[217 U.S. 257, 259]\n\u00a0\n In March, 1903, William. H. Knight, his brother and two sisters, one a married woman, whose husband joined in the suit as a merely technical party, commenced this action in the state district court of Vernon parish, Louisiana, against Henry J. Lutcher and the Lutcher & Moore Lumber Company, asking to be adjudged the owners of and to be entitled to the possession of an undivided half interest in the lands bought by William J. Knight in 1882 from D. R. Knight and John A. Lovett. The right of ownership was based upon the averment that the petitioners were children of William J. Knight; that the property bought by him was acquired during the marriage between their father and mother; that it formed a part of the community existing between them, and constituted an acquet of the community at the time of the death of the mother in August, 1885. The right of the father to sell, in 1887 and 1889, the onehalf interest belonging to their mother, as the result of her community estate, was denied, and it was charged that the defendants, who were in possession in virtue of the attempted sale made by the father, were mere trespassers. It was besides averred that William J. Knight, the father, married a second time, in June, 1886\n\n\n Because of diversity of citizenship the cause was removed into the circuit court of the United States for the western district of Louisiana. In that court the defendants answered. In addition to averring that the petition disclosed no cause of action, and denying generally all the allegations of the petition not expressly admitted, it was averred: That William J. Knight had never intermarried with the mother of the petitioners; that even if there had been such a marriage and a community resulting from it, the property sued for was not an acquet of such community, because it was the separate property of W. J. Knight, as no cash price was ever paid by him for the property and no note given, as recited in the notarial act of sale, and, although the transaction was put in the form of a sale, it was only ostensibly so, having been merely intended to be a donation to him of the property. It was, how- \n\n[217 U.S. 257, 260]\n\u00a0\n ever, moreover alleged that the property never formed part of a community existing between Knight and his alleged first wife, even if there was such community, because the property was conveyed to him under a secret agreement, for the benefit of his vendors, and that all the subsequent transfers were in pursuance of such agreement. It was further alleged that the sales to the defendants were executed in good faith, for valuable considerations, without notice or knowledge of the claims of plaintiffs, Knight being then married, and there being no evidence of record of a previous marriage or of the death of the alleged previous wife. In a further paragraph of the answer it was claimed 'that the pretended sale made July 28, 1882, to said William J. Knight, was a simulation and a fiction,' and that the seeming grantors made said pretended sale for the sole purpose of screening said property from the pursuit of their creditors; 'that the property never became community property, but always belonged to said Knight and Lovett, as William J. Knight and his alleged wife and all parties well knew, until the sale made April 13, 1889, by W. J. Knight, John C. Knight and Viola P. Knight to Henry J. Lutcher and G. Bedell Moore.' The respective interests of the defendants in the land were next averred, their vendors were called in warranty, and it was prayed that, in the event of eviction, defendants might recover of their warrantors the proportionate amount of the purchase price which they had received. An amendment to the answer was subsequently filed October 27, 1903, amplifying the claim that the sale in 1882 to William J. Knight was not bona fide, but was for the benefit of the grantors, and included both movable and immovable property belonging to said vendors, and averring that the $500 recited cash consideration was paid, but with money of the grantors, and that a note was executed, but with no intention to pay the same or to demand payment thereof, and that it was in fact redelivered to Knight without his making payment, and it was averred that the pretended sale constituted only a paper title to the property, 'and same never in fact nor in law became the \n\n[217 U.S. 257, 261]\n\u00a0\n property of the community between him and his so-called wife; and no interest whatever in said property vested in said community, and the said plaintiffs herein are without right or equity to any right, title, or interest in the said lands.' The prescriptions of one, two, four, five, and ten years were also pleaded.\n As expressly stated in the argument, both by counsel for the petitioners in error and by counsel for the respondents, and as appears from recitals contained in a petition for rehearing printed in the record, to which we shall hereafter more particularly refer, the defendants, who had removed this action to the circuit court in December, 1903, filed in that court their bill of complaint, in which they made the plaintiffs in this action defendants. The bill, after substantially reiterating the averments which we previously recited, and which were contained in the answer filed in this cause, prayed that the further prosecution of the action be perpetually enjoined. The right to prevent the further prosecution of the action at law was based on the assertion that the law action 'clouded your orators' title to the land in suit; that your orators' defenses are equitable, and that the pendency of said suit and the cloud cast on your orators' title works irreparable injury and damage to you orators, and that they have no adequate remedy at law.'\n The following demurrer was interposed to the bill of complaint:\n'First. Plaintiffs are estopped from attacking their own title.\n\n'Second. The deed under which the defendants claim has been adjudged a good and valid title.\n\n'Third. The complaint comes too late, the defendants having filed a suit in law, and the plaintiffs have answered to their demands, in which they set up a defense which, if sustained, will be adequate in law.\n\n'Fourth. That the allegations of plaintiffs' of their answer in suit No. 276 in the \n\n[217 U.S. 257, 262]\n\u00a0\n circuit court of the United States for the western district of Louisiana, at law, and that the allegations therein contained and set forth set up a plea of estopped in pais, and constitute a complete and adequate remedy at law.\n\n'Fifth. That the bill of complaint discloses no right or cause of action.\n\n'Finally. Defendants especially demur to the right of plaintiffs to bring their bill in equity, as neither the law nor the jurisprudence of this state authorizes or provides suits in equity, and especially is this so as to real estate situated in the state. Hence, defendants move that the injunction herein asked for be denied. That this branch of the case be dismissed to plaintiffs' cost, and suit No. 276 be proceeded with according to law.' After argument, and on February 16, 1904, a decree was entered in favor of the respondents, in which it was recited that 'the court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the suit at cost of complainants.' This action, which had in the meanwhile been pending in the circuit court, upon the issues made up as heretofore stated, was tried, and resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of the defendants. Error having been prosecuted from the circuit court of appeals, in that court, on April 4, 1905, the judgment was reversed and the cause remanded. The court did not pass upon the merits, because it found that the citizenship of the Lutcher & Moore Lumber Company, the corporation defendant, was not adequately averred in the petition for removal, and therefore the proper basis for jurisdiction in the court below had not been laid (69 C. C. A. 248, 136 Fed. 404), and a petition for rehearing was refused (71 C. C. A. 684, 139 Fed. 1007).\n\n In the circuit court, after the receipt of the mandate of the circuit court of appeals, plaintiffs objecting and excepting, the defendants, in accordance with leave granted, amended the averments of citizenship in the petition for removal so as to cause them to be in all respects adequate. Subsequently, upon grounds which it is not necessary to state, plaintiffs \n\n[217 U.S. 257, 263]\n\u00a0\n filed a paper styled a demurrer to portions of the answer of the defendants, and pleas of res judicata and estoppel. The case was tried the second time to a jury in October, 1906. During the progress of the trial the deposition of J. A. Lovett, one of the original vendors of Knight, was offered by the defendants. The testimony tended to show that the note for $ 14,500, described in the act of sale by which Knight had acquired the property as having been given as part of the purchase price, had not been paid by him prior to the death of his first wife, and that it had subsequently been paid out of the purchase price realized from the various sales which were assailed, and that the amount was therefore a debt of the community, and the plaintiffs, as heirs of their mother, could not attack the sales without tendering their share of the community debt, which had been paid as the result of the sales. This testimony was excluded by the court, because, among other reasons, it was held not to be competent under the defenses made in the answers. Thereupon the defendants requested to be allowed to amend on the ground that, on the former trial, the testimony had been admitted as within the issues arising from the answers, and that the defendants 'therefore took no steps to provide for the contingency of a change in the opinion of the court by amending their answers so as to clearly make such defenses admissible.' To the action of the court in refusing to allow this amendment an exception was taken. Differing from the first trial, there was a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, upon which judgment was entered. Various exceptions additional to those to which we have just referred were taken by the defendants. Without going into detail, it suffices to say that these exceptions were varied in character, embracing all the defenses made in the answers, and covered rulings of the court on the admission and rejection of evidence and the refusal to give requested instructions. On error the case again went to the circuit court of appeals for the fifth circuit, and as the result of the numerous exceptions taken below, the assign- \n\n[217 U.S. 257, 264]\n\u00a0\n ments of error in substance presented for decisions the many questions raised in the trial court.\n The circuit court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court, and the opinion delivered by it is as follows: 'By the court: After a thorough and attentive consideration of the questions raised on this writ, we are of opinion that the matters of defense relied upon by plaintiffs in error on the trial below, in so far as they were not given consideration, were of an equitable nature, not cognizable in a court of law. We therefore affirm the judgment of the circuit court.' [84 C. C. A. 679, 156 Fed. 1022.] A lengthy petition for rehearing was filed on December 26, 1907, and a few days thereafter there was also filed what was styled 'Motion by plaintiffs in error to withhold mandate, stay proceedings, and order trial of the equitable issues, with suggestions of res judicata and waiver.' Both in the petition and in the motion, counsel contended that, contrary to the ruling of the circuit court of appeals, the trial court held all the issues properly triable on the law side of the court, and that the plaintiffs in this action never at any time suggested that any of the matters of defense were equitable, and to dispose of the cause as the court had done would deprive the defendants of their rights, and entail great hardship upon them. The defendants also incorporated in the motion the bill of complaint filed in the equity cause heretofore referred to, and which was instituted by them to enjoin the prosecution of this action, as also the demurrer and the decree of dismissal. In connection therewith the suggestion was made that the decree in said cause ought, in conscience, to be treated as res judicata of the question of the nature of the defenses interposed in this action. Elaborate argument was advanced to sustain the contention that the defenses introduced amounted only to a denial of the case made by the plaintiffs, and that the evidence excluded by the trial court should have been received, and upon the undisputed record a verdict should have been directed for the defendants below. The appellate court was asked to allow an oral argument of the \n\n[217 U.S. 257, 265]\n\u00a0\n petition for rehearing: 'In view of the fact that the case has been disposed of on questions not raised by either party, and not considered when this cause was submitted, and in view of the attitude of the trial court with reference to the defenses being at law, and not in equity, and in view of the attitude plaintiffs in error have been placed in, because of this question having been determined adversely to their rights for the first time in this court.' The record does not show that any formal disposition was made of the petition for rehearing, and the motion to which we have referred, other than an entry, dated January 22, 1908, reading as follows: 'Ordered, that the issuance of mandate in this case be, and it is hereby, stayed for thirty days from this date.' The case thereupon came here in consequence of the allowance of a writ of certiorari.\n The record unquestionably establishes that the circuit court, with the acquiescence of all parties, treated the defenses interposed by the answer of the defendants as legal in their nature. Aside, however, from the strict record, both the respondents and the petitioners call our attention to the transcript containing the proceedings in the equity cause. Indeed, counsel for respondents particularly press upon our attention that the defendants below, plaintiffs in the equity cause, acquiesced in the decree entered against them in the circuit court in such cause by not appealing therefrom, and that 'it binds and estops them from now urging the same matters set up in that bill.' There is no denial, but, on the contrary, by necessary inplication, counsel for respondents admit the truth of the statement made in the petition for rehearing, filed in the circuit court of appeals, that the cause was disposed of by that court 'on questions not raised by either party, and not considered when this cause was submitted,' and contrary to the 'attitude of the trial court with reference to the defenses being at law, and not in equity.'\n It is a reasonable inference that when, after the removal of the cause, the defendants filed their bill of complaint, setting \n\n[217 U.S. 257, 266]\n\u00a0\n up the defenses which they had urged in their answer in this action, such course must have been suggested by the fact that the distinction between law and equity did not prevail in the courts of the state of Louisiana, and that therefore it was well for them, after they had removed the cause into a court of the United States, to seek to conform to the practice there prevailing, and, in any event, to pursue a course which would render it certain that, in the new forum, they would not be deprived, because of the form of pleading, of their right to have their defenses passed upon. The plaintiffs in the action at law (this action), who were the defendants in the equity cause, having, as a defense to that cause, insisted that the defenses were not cognizable in equity, and having prevailed in such contention, were certainly in conscience placed in a position where they could not, by a change of attitude, assert that the defenses were legal in their nature, and thus deprive the defendants of all memeans of defense in this action. Indeed, the record does not intimate that they sought to do so since it affirmatively establishes that the plaintiffs in this action, after having obtained as respondents the adjudication in their favor in the equity cause,-an adjudication which was as well binding upon them as upon the complainants,-acquiesced in the decree,-an acquiescence which was manifestly concurred in by the opposing parties and sanctioned by the trial court. The case is altogether unlike that which would be presented by an objection urged by the respondents to a bill in equity, against the power of the court to exert jurisdiction over a cause of action indisputably cognizable only in a court of law whereby a deprivation of the constitutional right of trial by jury would result. In this case, on the contrary, the question considered did not concern the inherent jurisdiction of the court over the subject-matter. The decision of the question before us is controlled by the case of Burbank v. Bigelow, \n154 U.S. 558\n, Appx., and 19 L. ed. 51, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1163. That was an action at law in which the plaintiff recovered judgment. In this court, for the first time, the objection was made by the unsuccessful \n\n[217 U.S. 257, 267]\n\u00a0\n party that the matter of the demand of plaintiff was one of equitable cognizance. The court, however, said (p. 559):\n'The objection that the matter of plaintiff's demand is one of equitable cognizance in the Federal courts cannot prevail. No such objection was raised in the court below at any stage of the proceedings, and it cannot be permitted to a defendant to go to trial before a jury on the facts of a case involving fraud, and let it proceed to judgment on the verdict without any attempt to assert the equitable character of the suit, and then raise that question for the first time in this court.'\n\n Applying this doctrine to the facts and circumstances which we have previously stated, we are of opinion that it inevitably results that the effect of the action of the circuit court of appeals was substantially to deny to the plaintiffs in error in that court, petitioners here, their day in court; in other words, was equivalent to condemning them without affording them an opportunity to be heard.\n It is undoubted that by the operation of the writ of certiorari, granted in accordance with the provisions of the judiciary act of 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 826, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 488], the entire record is before us, with power to decide the case as it was presented to the circuit court of appeals, by reason of the writ of error issued out of that court. Certain is it also that the judiciary act of 1891 contemplates that, as a general rule, where, under its provisions, a case comes to this court on certiorari to a circuit court of appeals, it will be disposed of so that the mandate of this court, to avoid circuity, will go directly to the circuit court. The great purpose of the act of 1891, however, to which all its provisions are subservient, is to distribute the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States, and thus to relieve the docket of this court by casting upon the circuit courts of appeal the duty of finally deciding the cases over which the jurisdiction of those courts is by the act made final. The power to issue certiorari in accordance with the act, in its essence, is only a means to the end that this imperative and responsible duty may be \n\n[217 U.S. 257, 268]\n\u00a0\n adequately performed. As it is patent from the statement we have made that the only ground upon which the power to issue certiorari could have been exerted was the failure of the court below to consider the case before it, we think this record presents an exception to the general rule of procedure above referred to. In other words, in a case like this we think the judgment of the circuit court of appeals must be reversed, and the case be remanded to that court, to the end that the duty to hear and decide it may be performed. To hold otherwise would be repugnant to the plain intent of the act of 1891, since it would recognize a practice by which the concededly essential purpose of the act of 1891 could be disregarded or be made practically of no avail.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","107":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMACON GROCERY CO. v. ATLANTIC COAST LINE R. CO.(1910)\nNo. 351\nArgued: Decided: January 17, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. William A. Wimbish and Edgar Watkins for appellants.\n Messrs. Henry L. Stone and Claudian B. Northrop for appellees. \n\n[215 U.S. 501, 502]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n This litigation was commenced on the equity side of the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of Georgia, by the filing on July 25, 1908, of a bill on behalf of the present appellants, all citizens of the state of Georgia, who are wholesale dealers in groceries and food products and like commodities. The defendants named in the bill are the appellees in this court, railroad corporations of states other than Georgia, viz., the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company, the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company, the Nashville, Chattanooga, & St. Louis Railway Company, the Southern Railway Company, and the Cincinnati, New Orleans, & Texas Pacific Railway Company.\n Briefly stated, the object of the bill was to restrain the putting into effect, by the interstate carriers just named, of proposed advances in rates on fresh meats, grain products, hay, and packing-house products within the territory of what is known as the Southeastern Freight Association. That territory, roughly described, embraces the states of South Carolina, Florida, Georgia, points in Tennessee, and that portion of Alabama east of a line drawn from Chattanooga through Birmingham, Selma, and Montgomery to Pensacola. It was averred that freight tariffs embodying the proposed advances in rates had been filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, that notice had been given that such tariffs would become effective on August 1, 1908, and that practically every interested line of railroad within the territory in question had joined in such tariffs as participating carriers. The advance in rates was averred to be an 'arbitrary and unlawful exaction,' and to be the direct outcome of understandings and agreements in suppression of competition and in unlawful combination in restraint of interstate trade, arrived at and made effective through the agency of the Southeastern Freight Association and other affiliated associations, and that the acts of such combinations in \n\n[215 U.S. 501, 503]\n\u00a0\n making the advance of rates complained of was the result of a conspiracy unlawful as well at common law as under the statutes of the United States. Averring that to permit the going into effect of the proposed unjust and unreasonable rates would entail irreparable loss and injury to complainants and others similarly situated, would operate to the prejudice of the public interest, and would bring about a multiplicity of suits for reparation, the bill prayed the allowance of an injunction pendente lite, restraining the putting into effect of the proposed advances, and that, upon a final hearing, a decree might be awarded perpetually enjoining such advances.\n Specially appearing for the purpose, the various defendants respectively filed a plea to the jurisdiction, each defendant asserting in substance an exemption from being sued in a district of which it was not an inhabitant. Demurrers to the pleas to the jurisdiction were sustained. Thereupon, without waiving the benefit of the pleas, defendants jointly demurred to the bill upon mumerous grounds. Without specifically passing on the demurrer, the court heard the application for an injunction upon affidavits and documents submitted on behalf of the complainants, and on August 1, 1908, announced its opinion sustaining the contention of the complainants, and directing the injunction prayed to issue upon the condition that complainants should, within ten days, present their complaint to the Interstate Commerce Commission for investigation and determination of the reasonableness of the rates involved. 163 Fed. 738. Two days afterwards an order was entered, in which among other statements, it was recited-- 'that the complainants, together with other persons in the cities of Atlanta, Columbus, Rome, and Athens, Georgia, have this day filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission their complaint, praying the Commission to investigate and determine the reasonableness of the rates involved, also to declare what are just and reasonable maximum rates.' \n\n[215 U.S. 501, 504]\n\u00a0\n The order decreed that the defendants to the action and each of them- 'be and they are hereby jointly and severally enjoined from enforcing collection of the advance in rates made effective August 1st, 1908, from Ohio and Mississippi river crossings, Nashville, Tennessee, and points with relation thereto, to all points within the state of Georgia, on classes B, C, D, and F, fresh meats, C, L, grain products, hay, and packing-house products; this injunction to continue and remain in force pending an investigation and determination of the reasonableness of the rates involved, by the Interstate Commerce Commission, or until further order of the court.'\n Thereupon an appeal was taken to the circuit court of appeals for the fifth circuit. It was there held that the case presented 'for necessary consideration the proper construction of the act to regulate commerce,' and that the jurisdiction of the court did not rest solely upon diversity of citizenship of the parties. The court, being of opinion 'that the sound construction of the different provisions of the act to regulate commerce, as amended and now in force, necessarily forbids the exercise of the jurisdiction attempted to be invoked by the bill' [166 Fed. 218, 2191], reversed the decree of the circuit court, and remanded the case to that court with instructions to dismiss the bill without prejudice.\n Assignments of error, eighteen in number, have been filed, wherein, in various forms of statements, appellants assail the action of the circuit court of appeals in adjudging that the circuit court was without jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the bill. The appellees also, in the argument at bar, press upon our notice, as they did below, the claims made in the special pleas to the jurisdiction filed in the circuit court. It is, of course, the duty of this court to see to it that the jurisdiction of the circuit court was not exceeded (Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Mottley, \n211 \nU.S. 149, 152\n, 53 S. L. ed. 126, 127, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 42, and cases cited), and we shall dispose of the case before us by considering and deciding the last-mentioned contention. The basis of the claim that the circuit court had not \n\n[215 U.S. 501, 505]\n\u00a0\n acquired jurisdiction over the person of the defendants was that none of the defendants was an inhabitant of the district in which the suit was brought, and that the suit being one 'wherein the jurisdiction is not founded only on the fact that the action is between citizens of different states, but is based also upon acts of Congress of the United States relating to interstate commerce, and alleged causes of action arising thereunder,' the defendant could not be sued outside of the district of which it was an inhabitant. As cause of demurrer to the pleas, the complainants stated 'that the controversy presented by the bill is wholly between citizens of different states, and is solely founded upon diversity of citizenship.' While sustaining the demurrer, the circuit court yet declared:\n'It is true that, it this case, the illegality of the alleged increase in rates must necessarily, in large measure, be determined by the Federal law. The legality or illegality of the alleged combination in restraint of trade must be determined by the same law, and it seems to be conceded that, generally speaking, this court would not have jurisdiction of these questions finally except under conditions which do not exist here. That is to say, the court can only, for final determination, entertain the Federal question in the district of which the defendants are inhabitants.' [ 163 Fed. 736.]\n\n Despite these views, however, as the court considered, if the averments of the bill were taken as true, there was 'a threatened and immediate, violation of the Federal law of the gravest character to a large number of people,' irreparable injury would be occasioned if the increase in rates were allowed to go into effect, and as there was not time for those affected to have protection or seek recourse elsewhere, jurisdiction was entertained for the purpose of giving temporary relief.\n The pertinent section of the statute regulating the original jurisdiction of circuit courts of the United States is the first section of the act of March 3, 1875, chap. 137, 18 Stat. at L. 470, as \n\n[215 U.S. 501, 506]\n\u00a0\n amended by the act of March 3, 1887, chap. 373, 24 Stat. at L. 552, as corrected by the act of August 13, 1888, chap. 866, 25 Stat. at L. 433, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508, reading as follows:\n'That the circuit courts of the United States shall have original cognizance, concurrent with the court of the several states, of all suits of a civil nature, at common law or in equity, where the matter in dispute exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of two thousand dollars, and arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States . . . or in which there shall be a controversy between citizens of different states, in which the matter in dispute exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value aforesaid. . . . But . . . no civil suit shall be brought before either of said courts against any person by any original process or proceeding in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant; but where the jurisdiction is founded only on the fact that the action is between citizens of different states, suit shall be brought only in the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant.'\n\n In Patton v. Brady, \n184 U.S. 608\n, 46 L. ed. 713, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 493, discussing the question as to when a case may be said to arise under the Constitution of the United States, the court observed:\n'It is said by Chief Justice Marshall that 'a case in law or equity consists of the right of the one party, as well as of the other, and may truly be said to arise under the Constitution or a law of the United States whenever its correct decision depends on the construction of either' (Cohen v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 379, 5 L. ed. 257, 285); and again, when 'the title or right set up by the party may be defeated by one construction of the Constitution or law of the United States, and sustained by the opposite construction.' Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 822, 6 L. ed. 204, 224. See also Little York Gold-Washing & Water Co. v. Keyes, \n96 \nU.S. 199, 201\n, 24 S. L. ed. 656, 658; Tennessee v. Davis, \n100 U.S. 257\n, 25 L. ed. 648; White v. Greenhow, \n114 U.S. 307\n, 29 L. ed. 199, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 923, 962; New Orleans, M. & T. R. Co. v. Mississippi, \n102 \nU.S. 135, 139\n, 26 S. L. ed. 96, 97.' \n\n[215 U.S. 501, 507]\n\u00a0\n In Tennessee v. Davis, supra, the court said:\n\n'What constitutes a case, thus arising [under the laws of the United States] was early defined in the case cited from 6 Wheat. [Cohen v. Virginia]. It is not merely where a party comes into court to demand something conferred upon him by the Constitution or by a law or treaty. A case consists of the right of one party as well as the other, and may truly be said to arise under the Constitution or a law or a treaty of the United States whenever its correct decision depends upon the construction of either. Cases arising under the laws of the United States are such as grow out of the legislation of Congress, whether they constitute the right or privilege or claim, the protection or defense of the party, in whole or in part, by whom they are asserted. Story, Const.  1647; Cohen v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 379, 5 L. ed. 285. It was said in Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 6 L. ed. 204, 'when a question to which the judicial power of the Union is extended by the Constitution forms an ingredient of the original cause, it is in the power of Congress to give the circuit courts jurisdiction of that cause, although other questions of fact or of law may be involved in it.' And a case arises under the laws of the United States when it arises out of the implication of the law.'\n\n In cases of the character of the one at bar, the rulings of the lower Federal courts have uniformly been to the effect that they arose under the Constitution and laws of the United States. Tift v. Southern R. Co. 123 Fed. 789, 793; Northern P. R. Co. v. Pacific Coast Lumber Mfrs. Asso. 91 C. C. A. 39, 165 Fed. 1, 9; Memphis Cotton Oil Co. v. Illinois C. R.

R. Co. 156 Fed. 160. We are of opinion that the case before us may properly be said to be one arising under a law or laws of the United States. As said by Taft, Circuit Judge, in Toledo, A. A. & N. M. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania Co. 19 L.R.A. 387, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 522, 54 Fed. 730:\n'It is immaterial what rights the complainant would have \n\n[215 U.S. 501, 508]\n\u00a0\n had before the passage of the interstate commerce law. It is sufficient that Congress, in the constitutional exercise of power, has given the positive sanction of Federal law to the rights secured in the statute, and any case involving the enforcement of those rights is a case arising under the laws of the United States.'\n\n The object of the bill was to enjoin alleged unreasonable rates, threatened to be exacted by carriers subject to the act to regulate commerce. The right to be exempt from such unlawful exactions is one protected by the act in question, and the purpose to avail of the benefit of that act, as well as of the anti-trust act, is plainly indicated by the averments of the bill. Of necessity, in determining the right to the relief prayed for, a construction of the act to regulate commerce was essentially involved.\n The jurisdiction of the circuit court not being invoked solely upon the ground of diversity of citizenship, it inevitably follows that, as there was no waiver of the exemption from being sued in the court below, that court was without jurisdiction of the persons of the defendants. Re Keasbey & M. Co. \n160 U.S. 222\n, 40 L. ed. 402, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 273; Re Moore, \n209 U.S. 490\n, 52 L. ed. 904, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 585, 706; Western Loan & Sav. Co. v. Butte & B. Consol. Min. Co. \n210 U.S. 368\n, 52 L. ed. 1101, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 720. In the first case, the question involved was as to the jurisdiction of the United States circuit court for the southern district of New York over an action brought in that court by a corporation of Pennsylvania against a corporation of Massachusetts, having its principal place of business in New York city, for infringement of a trademark. In the course of the opinion it was said (pp. 228, 229, 230):\n'But when this suit was brought, the first section of the judiciary act of 1875 had been amended by the act of March 3, 1887, chap. 373, as corrected by the act of August 13, 1888, chap. 866, in the parts above quoted, by substituting for the jurisdictional amount of $500, exclusive of costs, the amount of $2,000, exclusive of interest and costs; and by striking out, after the clause, 'and no civil suit shall be brought before \n\n[215 U.S. 501, 509]\n\u00a0\n either of said courts against any person by any original process or proceeding in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant,' the alternative, 'or in which he shall be found at the time of serving such process or commencing such proceeding,' and by adding, 'but where the jurisdiction is founded only on the fact that the action is between citizens of different states, suit shall be brought only in the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant.' 24 Stat. at L. 552; 25 Stat. at L. 433.\n\n'The last clause is added by way of proviso to the next preceding clause, which, in its present form, forbids any suit to be brought in any other district than that of which the defendant is an inhabitant; and the effect is that, in every suit between citizens of the United States, when the jurisdiction is founded upon any of the grounds mentioned in this section, other than the citizenship of the parties, it must be brought in the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant; but when the jurisdiction is founded only on the fact that the parties are citizens of different states, the suit shall be brought in the district of which either party is an inhabitant. And it is established by the decisions of this court that, within the meaning of this act, a corporation cannot be considered a citizen, an inhabitant, or a resident of a state in which it has not been incorporated; and, consequently, that a corporation incorporated in a state of the Union cannot be compelled to answer to a civil suit, at law, or in equity, in a circuit court of the United States, held in another state, even if the corporation has a usual place of business in that state. McCormick Harvesting Mach. Co. v. Walthers, \n134 \nU.S. 41, 43\n, 33 S. L. ed. 833, 834, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 485; Shaw v. Quincy Min. Co. \n145 U.S. 444\n, 36 L. ed. 768, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 935; Southern P. Co. v. Denton, \n146 U.S. 202\n, 36 L. ed. 942, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 44. Those cases, it is true, were of the class in which the jurisdiction is founded only upon the fact that the parties are citizens or corporations of different states. But the reasoning on which they proceeded is equally applicable to the other class, mentioned in the same section, of suits arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United \n\n[215 U.S. 501, 510]\n\u00a0\n States; and the only difference is that, by the very terms of the statute, a suit of this class is to be brought in the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant, and cannot, without the consent of the defendant, be brought in any other district, even in one of which the plaintiff is an inhabitant.\n\n ... * *\n'This suit, then, assuming it to be maintainable under the act of 1881 [21 Stat. at L. 502, chap. 138, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3401], is one of which the courts of the United States have jurisdiction concurrently with the courts of the several states. The only existing act of Congress which enables it to be brought in the circuit court of the United States is the act of 1888. The suit comes within the terms of that act, both as arising under a law of the United States and as being between citizens of different states. In either aspect, by the provisions of the same act, the defendant cannot be compelled to answer in a district of which neither the defendant nor the plaintiff is an inhabitant. The objection, having been seasonably taken by the defendant corporation, appearing specially for the purpose, was rightly sustained by the circuit court.'\n\n We are of opinion that the jurisdictional statute of 1888 is applicable, even upon the assumption that the cause of action was alone cognizable in a court of the United States, as the particular venue of the action was not provided for elsewhere than in that statute.\n The pleas to the jurisdiction of the circuit court, having been seasonably made, should have been sustained and the bill dismissed without prejudice, for want of jurisdiction over the persons of the defendants. As, however, practically the same result will be reached by the decree entered in the circuit court of appeals, which ordered the reversal of the decree of the circuit court, and remanded the cause, with instructions to dismiss the bill without prejudice, we affirm that decree without expressing an opinion as to the merits of the reasoning upon which it was based.\n Affirmed. \n\n[215 U.S. 501, 511]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting:\n I cannot agree to the opinion in this case, and will briefly state the reasons for my dissenting.\n The plaintiffs in error, citizens of Georgia, brought this suit in equity in the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of Georgia, against the defendants in error, corporations of several different states other than Georgia. The relief sought was a decree enjoining those corporations from putting in force and maintaining in Georgia certain rates established by agreement among themselves. It seems to me that this case could have been disposed of upon the authority of Baltimore & O. R. Co. v. United States, recently decided [\n215 U.S. 481\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 164], in which the court held, in substance, that shippers who complain of rates adopted by interstate carriers cannot obtain relief by an original suit brought in any court, Federal or state, but must make application, at the outset, to the Interstate Commerce Commission. This, I think, is all that need have been said; for, whatever interpretation was given to the judiciary act of 1888 [25 Stat. at L. 433, chap. 866, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508], the circuit court would have been required, under the case just cited, to decline jurisdiction. But the court, in its wisdom, does not refer to this view of the case, and deems it necessary to determine whether the plaintiffs, citizens of Georgia, may, under the judiciary act of 1888, considered alone, invoke the jurisdiction of the circuit court, held in that state, against the defendant corporations of other states.\n If I correctly interpret the opinion of the court, it proceeds on the theory that if the action had been founded alone on diversity of citizenship, the suit-although the defendants were corporations of other states-could have been maintained in the United States circuit court sitting in Georgia, that being the state of the residence of the plaintiffs. But as the plaintiffs were so unfortunate as to possess, and, in their pleadings, to assert, in addition to diversity of citizenship, a Federal right, and to seek to have that right protected by the \n\n[215 U.S. 501, 512]\n\u00a0\n Federal court against the illegal acts of the defendant corporations, they must now either go into a state court of Georgia, in order to obtain the desired relief, or go to the respective states, however distant, which incorporated the defendants, and sue there. Certain cases are referred to as requiring this construction of the act of 1888,-McCormick Harvesting Mach. Co. v. Walthers, \n134 U.S. 41\n, 33 L. ed. 833, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 485; Shaw v. Quincy Min. Co. \n145 U.S. 444\n, 36 L. ed. 768, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 935; and Re Keasbey & M. Co. \n160 U.S. 221\n, 40 L. ed. 402, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 273. But I cannot perceive that there was in either of those cases such a question as the one just stated. Neither of them actually involved or decided any such question. The McCormick Case was a suit in the circuit court of Nebraska, by a citizen of that state, against an Illinois corporation, having an agent in Nebraska. The defendant pleaded that, as it was not an inhabitant of Nebraska, it could not, under the act of 1888, be sued in that state. But this plea was overruled by the court below, and this court held that the McCormick Company, although not an inhabitant of Nebraska, was liable to be sued in the Federal court held in the state of the plaintiff's residence. Nothing more was involved or decided in that case. The Shaw Case was a civil suit brought in the Federal court sitting in New York, by a citizen of Massachusetts against a citizen of Michigan. But although the parties were citizens of different states, neither the plaintiff nor the defendant resided in or was a citizen of the state in which the suit was brought. What was really involved in that case, and what was decided, appears from the last paragraph of the opinion of this court, as follows: 'All that is now decided is that, under the existing act of Congress, a corporation incorporated in one state only cannot be compelled to answer in a circuit court of the United States held in another state, in which it has a usual place of business, to a civil suit, at law or in equity, brought by a citizen of a different state.' In the Keasbey-Mattison Case it appears that the suit was brought in the Federal court of New York by a Pennsylvania corporation against a Massachusetts corporation. What \n\n[215 U.S. 501, 513]\n\u00a0\n the court said leaves no doubt as to what was intended to be decided. It said: 'This suit, then, assuming it to be maintainable under the act of 1881 [21 Stat. at L. 502, chap. 138, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3401], is one of which the courts of the United States have jurisdiction concurrently with the courts of the several states. The only existing act of Congress, which enables it to be brought in the circuit court of the United States, is the act of 1888. This suit comes within the terms of that act, both as arising under a law of the United States and as being between citizens of different states. In either aspect, by the provisions of the same act, the defendant cannot be compelled to answer in a district of which neither the defendant nor the plaintiff is an inhabitant.' Whatever general expressions are to be found in the opinions in the cases cited, neither of those cases is an authority for the broad, unqualified statement that the United States circuit court held in a state of which the plaintiff is a citizen may not take cognizance of a suit brought by him in a Federal court against a corporation of another state, where such suit presents a controversy between citizens of different states and, in addition, discloses the fact that the plaintiff claims a Federal right which needs to be protected against the wrongful or illegal acts of the defendant corporation. This proposition is, of course, subject to the condition that the foreign corporation, by having an agency in Georgia or otherwise, can be reached by some process and brought into the Federal court sitting in Georgia. It is inconceivable, I think, that Congress intended to deprive the Federal court sitting in the state of the plaintiff's residence of jurisdiction to protect his Federal right, simply because it appears from the record that the defendant and the alleged wrongdoer are citizens of different states. It necessarily follows from the opinion of the court in this case that where a citizen of another state is sued in a state court, and the suit involves a Federal right claimed by the plaintiff, the defendant cannot remove the case to the Federal court, but must remain in the state court of original jurisdiction, and there defend his asserted Federal right. The state court might well say, under \n\n[215 U.S. 501, 514]\n\u00a0\n the opinion just delivered, that although the controversy between the parties involves Federal rights, and presents a controversy between citizens of different states, as well as one arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, it is a suit of which the Federal court could not take cognizance by removal. We so say because such a case could not, under the court's present view of the act of 1888, have been originally brought in that court, and because, according to the settled doctrines of this court, no case can be removed from a state court to a Federal court which could not have been originally brought in the latter court. Tennessee v. Union & P. Bank, \n152 U.S. 454\n, 38 L. ed. 511, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 654; Arkansas v. Kansas & T. Coal Co. \n183 U.S. 185\n, 46 L. ed. 144, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 47; Joy v. St. Louis, \n201 \nU.S. 340, 341\n, 50 S. L. ed. 780, 781, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 478.\n I recognize the fact that the act of 1888 was not drawn with precision. But I am of opinion that, as the act gives the circuit court original jurisdiction, concurrent with the courts of the several states, 'of all suits of a civil nature, at common law or in equity, where the matter in dispute exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of $2,000 . . . in which there shall be a controversy between citizens of different states,' the intention of Congress would be best effectuated by holding that the jurisdiction of the circuit court is not excluded, in a controversy between citizens of different states, simply because the plaintiff, who sued in the Federal court held in the state of his residence, asserts a Federal right and seeks to have it protected against the illegal acts of the defendant, a citizen of another state; provided, always, that the defendant, if a corporation of another state, may, through agents conducting its business in the state where the suit is brought, be reached by the process of the court, and subjected to its authority. The presence in the case of a Federal right asserted by the plaintiff ought not to prejudice him, and does not, I think, alter the fact that the controversy is one of which a circuit court may take cognizance, because it is a controversy between citizens of different states. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 92 C.

The facts are: The Mankin Construction Company on February 27, 1905, entered into a contract with the Secretary of the Treasury for the \n\n[215 U.S. 533, 536]\n\u00a0\n construction of a certain postoffice building in the city of Natchez, Mississippi, and gave bond under the act of February 24, 1905 (33 Stat. at L. 811, chap. 778, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 948), amending the act of August 13, 1894 (28 Stat. at L. 278, chap. 280, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2523). This bond was conditioned that the Mankin Construction Company should 'promptly make payment to all persons supplying them labor or materials in the prosecution of the work contemplated by said contract.' Upon this bond the Title, Guaranty, & Trust Company of Scranton, Pennsylvania, was surety.\n The Mankin Construction Company, on April 29, 1905, entered into a written contract with one W. E. Smythe, as subcontractor, by the terms of which Smythe agreed to furnish certain plumbing, gasfitting, sheetmetal, tile roofing, etc., to be used in the construction and erection of the postoffice building. The building was completed about July 12, 1906, was accepted by the government, and payment therefor was made to the Mankin Construction Company, in accordance with the terms of the contract.\n The defendants in error, the Ludowici-Celadon Company, the Nelson Manufacturing Company, and the J. L. Mott Iron Works, respectively, sold and delivered to Smythe, the subcontractor, certain materials which he used in the construction of the postoffice building, as required by the original contract. Smythe failed to make full payment on account of such purchases, and no suit having been brought by the United States under the act of Congress (33 Stat. at L. 811, chap. 778, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 948) within six months, affidavit was made by the Ludowici- Celadon Company that it had supplied labor and material for the prosecution of the work of constructing the postoffice building; and it was furnished with a copy of the contract and bond, as required quired by the act, and thereupon instituted suit in the name of the United States in the United States circuit court for the southern district of Mississippi against the Mankin Construction Company and its surety.\n The Nelson Manufacturing Company and the J. L. Mott Iron Works intervened in the action, and claimed the right \n\n[215 U.S. 533, 537]\n\u00a0\n also to recover on account of the materials furnished by them respectively. There was a judgment upon the bond in favor of the claimants. It also appears that the Mankin Construction Company had paid Smythe, the subcontractor, the amount due him under the contract, less $644.57, before receiving any notice from either of the claimants of their respective claims against Smythe. The judgment upon the bond was in favor of the United States for the use of the Ludowici-Celadon Company in the sum of $1, 217.78, for the use of the Mott Iron Works in the sum of $709.97, for the use of the Nelson Manufacturing Company in the sum of $2,129.47. The amount due upon the accounts not being disputed, the court instructed the jury to find for the claimants.\n Upon writ of error to the circuit court of appeals for the fifth circuit, that court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court upon the authority of United States ex rel.

In the Hill Case, this court held that one who furnished labor or materials in the carrying out of a contract for public works, although such materials were furnished to a subcontractor, to whom a part of the work had been let, could recover upon a bond given under the act of August 13, 1894 (28 Stat. at L. 278, chap. 280, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2523). In the Hill Case it was held that, construing the bond in the light of the statute, and the purpose of Congress to provide security for payment for labor and material going into the construction of a public building, it was intended thereby to provide indemnity for a person or persons who furnished labor or materials to the subcontractor, thereby enabling the contractor to meet his engagement to supply the material and labor necessary to the construction of a public building.\n The present action accrued after the passage of the statute of February 24, 1905, amending the act of August 13, 1894, in which original act a right of action was given in the name of the United States for the use and benefit of the persons supplying the labor or materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in the contract, and requiring a bond for the benefit \n\n[215 U.S. 533, 538]\n\u00a0\n of such persons. In that act there was no limitation upon the number of actions which might be brought, nor was there any preference given to the United States in a recovery upon the bond. In the amended act a single action was provided for, and priority was given to the claim and judgment of the United States. In such suit any person or company who had furnished labor or material used in the construction or repair of any public building was allowed to intervene in the suit by the United States on the bond, and to have their rights and claims adjudicated; and it was further provided that, if no suit should be brought by the United States within six months of the completion and final settlement of the contract, then the person or persons supplying the labor or materials should, upon filing an affidavit in the department under the direction of which the work had been done, or the materials furnished, be furnished with a certified copy of the contract and bond, and might thereupon bring an action in the name of the United States in the circuit court of the United States in the district where the contract was performed and executed. There are other provisions looking to the distribution of the recovery upon the bond, and providing for bringing all creditors into the single suit which is authorized to be instituted.\n In respect to the condition of the bond required to be given, the language of the amended act is precisely the same as that contained in the act of August 13, 1894, and the condition is that 'such contractor or contractors shall promptly make payments to all persons supplying him or them with labor and materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in such contract.'\n It is the contention of the plaintiffs in error that the act of February 24, 1905, differs from the act of August 13, 1894, in that a copy of the contract and bond is to be furnished for the purpose of suit to the 'person or persons supplying the contractor with labor and materials,' and upon furnishing an affidavit to the Department under whose direction the work has been prosecuted, that the labor and materials for the \n\n[215 U.S. 533, 539]\n\u00a0\n prosecution of said work have been supplied, but payment for which has not been made; whereas, in the act of August 13, 1894, it is provided that any person or persons making an application therefor, and furnishing an affidavit to the Department that the labor and materials for the prosecution of such work had been supplied by him or them, payment for which had not been made, shall have a certified copy of the contract and bond for the purpose of bringing suit thereon.\n In both statutes a copy of the contract and bond is to be furnished upon an affidavit that labor and materials for the prosecution of the work have been supplied by the persons applying for such copy. In the amended statute it is provided that, if the action is not instituted by the United States within six months, then the person or persons supplying the contractor with labor and materials, and furnishing the affidavit that the same were supplied for the prosecution of such work, shall have a certified copy of the contract and bond for the purposes of the suit. The additional phrase used in this connection, 'the person or persons supplying the contractor with labor and materials,' it is contended, shows that only those who furnish labor and materials directly to the contractor come within the benefit of the act. We cannot agree with this contention. The phrase, 'person or persons supplying the contractor with labor and materials,' are the words embodied in both statutes alike in the requirement of a bond for their benefit. In the Hill Case it was distinctly held that 'persons supplying the contractor with labor and materials' included not only the subcontractor, but anyone who furnished labor and materials to the subcontractor for carrying out the work contracted for. There is nothing in the provision as to who shall have a copy of the bond for the purpose of suit which changes or limits the obligation of the bond under identical requirements in both statutes, alike embracing, as construed in the Hill Case, persons furnishing labor and materials to a subcontractor.\n As to the other point, that the Mankin Construction- \n\n[215 U.S. 533, 540]\n\u00a0\n Company had paid to Smythe, the subcontractor, the amount due him, except the sum of $644.57, before receiving notice of the claims of the outstanding debts recovered in this case, there is no provision in the statute that notice shall be given to the contractor of claims against the subcontractor, and limiting the recovery to the amount unpaid at the time of such notice. Such provision is found in some of the state statutes, and is made a condition of recovery in some of the mechanies' lien acts; but this case is controlled by the Federal act under consideration and the obligation of the bond, which requires payment to all persons supplying labor and material in the prosecution of the work contemplated by the contract.\n As was said in the Hill Case, the contractor can protect himself by requiring a bond securing him against liability on account of engagements of the subcontractor with persons who furnish labor and material upon his order. Indeed, the present contract contained, as the record shows, a provision that the general contractor reserved the right to require a full release from all claims for which he had become liable for materials furnished to, or work done for, the subcontractor, on account of materials and work required by the contract, with the right to withhold any amount due to the subcontractor until such release should be furnished.\n We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that this case is ruled by the decision made in United States ex rel. Hill v. American Surety Co. supra. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, affirming the judgment of the Circuit Court, is therefore affirmed. \n\n\n\n","110":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMAYTIN v. VELA(1910)\nNo. 90\nArgued: Decided: March 21, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 598, 599]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. N. B. K. Pettingill and Robert H. Todd for appellants in No. 90 and appellees in No. 245.\n Mr. Willis Sweet for appellees in No. 90, and appellant in No. 245.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n These are cross appeals in a proceeding brought by Monserrate and Dominga Garcia, two sisters of Manuel Garcia Maytin, and by another plaintiff now dropped out, to establish their rights in property descended from the said Manuel Garcia. The claim is founded upon article 811 of the former Civil Code, of which the following is the War Department translation: 'The ascendant who inherits property from his descendant, acquired by the latter for a good consideration from another descendant [ ascendant] or from a brother or sister, is obliged to reserve the property he may have acquired by force of law in favor of the relatives within the third degree belonging to the line from which such property originated.'\n The following is the course of the property concerned:\n\n 1. \nComplainants' brother, Manuel Garcia Maytin. Died intestate in 1886, succeeded by\n\n 2. \nHis daughter, Mrs. Beatriz Garcia de Ibarra, as sole heir. Died intestate and without descendants 1891, succeeded by\n\n 3. \nHer mother, Mrs. Beatriz Alos, widow of Manuel Garcia Maytin, as sole heir. Died, 1904, leaving a will, devising to \n\n[216 U.S. 598, 600]\n\u00a0\n 4. Her mother, Beatriz de los Angeles, and nephews and nieces, who, with Vela, the executor of the will, and with purchasers from Mrs. Beatriz Alos, are the defendants.\n It will be seen that (3) Mrs. Beatriz Alos was an ascendant who inherited from her descendant (2), Mrs. Beatriz Garcia, property acquired by the latter from the ascendant (1) her father. Therefore the devisees of Mrs. Beatriz Alos would be postponed by the law just quoted in favor of the relatives within the third degree, who are the two sisters bringing this complaint.\n The supreme court of Porto Rico, in a very lucid and persuasive opinion, established the position of the plaintiffs and answered the objections urged by the defense. It was shown that as Mrs. Beatriz Alos (3) inherited all the property of her daughter (2) as sole heir, notwithstanding the fact that the husband of the latter had the usufruct of one third for life, the obligation extended to all the property so inherited, being the same property that the daughter had inherited from her father, she not appearing to have had any other estates with insignificant exceptions. It was shown further that the obligation of Mrs. Beatriz Alos and Mrs. Beatriz de los Angeles was not affected by the failure of the plaintiffs and others to make it appear in the registry that the property was subject to be reserved. Mortgage law, art. 199. That section was not the source of the plaintiffs' rights, but only a means of securing them against bona fide purchasers. It did not extinguish their rights as against the relatives under art. 811 of the Civil Code, in case of neglect. Finally, a satisfactory answer was given to the argument that the plaintiffs were barred by prescription, under an order of the military government of Porto Rico, published on April 4, 1899, by which the Civil Code, art. 1957, was amended so that ownership should prescribe by possession for six years with good faith and a proper title. The daughter died in 1891 and her mother recorded her title in the registry and held from 1891 to her death, in 1904. But it was replied that, \n\n[216 U.S. 598, 601]\n\u00a0\n in the first place, prescription had not been pleaded, and was not open, and, secondly, that art. 1957, and therefore the amendment, referring to prescription to acquire ownership, coexists with art. 1963, which fixes a term of thirty years for the prescription by which ownership of real property is lost through a failure to bring a real action, and that in this case the prescription relied upon (and, we may add, probably the only one that could have been relied upon) was that resulting from the plaintiffs not having sued.\n For these reasons the supreme court affirmed a judgment of the district court, condemning the defendants to deliver to the plaintiffs certain specified land, or, where the same had been sold, the value of the same, to be ascertained by appraisement, with the costs in the district court. The defendant, Mrs. Beatriz de los Angeles, appealed, her appeal being number 245 in this court, but, as the other defendants did not join in the appeal, and there was no summons and severance, not to speak of other possible objections, the appeal must be dismissed. Hardee v. Wilson, \n146 U.S. 179\n, 36 L. ed. 933, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 39. We therefore go no farther on this part of the case than to give the foregoing brief summary of an argument from which we see no reason to dissent.\n The plaintiffs also appeal, and this makes it necessary to mention one or two facts not noticed thus far. On the death of Manuel Garcia, his widow, in the course of proceedings for the settlement of his estate, filed what seems to have been called a petition for partition, admitting, however, that there were no properties belonging to the conjugal partnership. An auditor was appointed and he prepared schedules of assets and liabilities, of the portion of assets distributed to the widow for the payment of such liabilities, and of the remainder awarded to the daughter and sole heir; this last consisting of two parcels of land and some personalty of small value. Thereupon the partition was closed. The judgment appealed from gave the plaintiffs only the land inherited by the mother from the daughter and included in the last- \n\n[216 U.S. 598, 602]\n\u00a0\n mentioned schedule. The plaintiffs set up that the partition proceedings were void upon their face for several reasons, and that they therefore are entitled to all the property that Manuel Garcia left.\n The local courts answered this claim by saying that if there were otherwise any foundation for it, it is barred by the limitation of four years set to rescissory actions and actions for nullity by arts. 1076 and 1301 of the Civil Code. For, in the first place, neither the daughter nor her husband, Mr. Ibarra, ever took any steps to set the partition aside, and it is plausible to say that the plaintiffs claim by inheritance from her, since, if she had left descendants, the property would have gone from her to them. Hence, notwithstanding the daughter's inability to cut the plaintiffs off in the event that happened, it is questionable, at least, whether they are not barred by what barred her. In the next place, the plaintiffs took no steps after the daughter's death, during the whole lifetime and occupation of her mother, from 1891 to 1904. Even if, as the plaintiffs say, their right would have been devested by their death during the life of the mother, Mrs. Beatriz Alos (3), it seems to have vested at the death of the daughter, Mrs. Beatriz Garcia (2). We are not prepared to overthrow the assumption made by the court, whose experience in such questions is entitled to much consideration (Armijo v. Armijo, \n181 \nU.S. 558, 561\n, 45 S. L. ed. 1000, 1002, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 707; Albright v. Sandoval, Feb. 21, 1910 [\n216 U.S. 331\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 318], that the plaintiffs had a sufficient interest to entitle them to bring an action to set aside the socalled partition on the daughter's death, and that, on their failing to do so, the right to dispute the same was barred by lapse of time.\n If the partition stands, the other questions argued, as to purchasers from the mother, Mrs. Beatriz Alos, etc., need no further answer. We deem it proper to add one remark. Article 811 created the right by which the plaintiffs recover. It did not go into effect until after the death of Manuel Garcia, so that it would seem to have been open to argument that \n\n[216 U.S. 598, 603]\n\u00a0\n his daughter inhorited his property by an absolute title which that law should not be construed to have disturbed. But, as it did go into effect before the daughter's death, and as it has been assumed on all hands that that moment was the decisive one, we have made the same assumption under the circumstances and for the purposes of this case. It seems to us, however, that the plaintiffs have reason to be satisfied with retaining what they got by the judgment below. \n No. 90.\n Judgment affirmed. No. 245. Appeal dismissed. \n\n\n\n","111":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCCLELLAN v. CARLAND(1910)\nNo. 630\nArgued: Decided: April 11, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 268, 269]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Melvin Grigsby and Grigsby & Grigsby for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 268, 271]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frederic D. McKenney, S. W. Clark, and U. S. G. Cherry for respondent.\n\n\n[217 U.S. 268, 274]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case comes here upon a writ of certiorari to the circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit. In that court McClellan and others, petitioners, filed a petition for a writ of mandamus against the United States district judge for the district of South Dakota, praying a writ of mandamus to said judge, sitting as a judge of the circuit court of said district, commanding him to set aside and vacate certain orders staying proceedings in an action pending in the \n\n[217 U.S. 268, 275]\n\u00a0\n circuit court, and to proceed to try and determine the suit in the usual course of procedure, without regard to the pendency of certain proceedings, to be hereinafter referred to, in the courts of the state of South Dakota. The circuit court of appeals, upon the petition for a writ of mandamus being presented to it, denied the prayer thereof and dismissed it. Thereafter this court granted the writ of certiorari.\n From the transcript of the record of the case in the circuit court of appeals it appears that petitioners and others, on the 8th day of September, 1908, commenced suit against George T. Blackman, special administrator of the estate of John C. McClellan, deceased, and others, in the circuit court of the United States for the district of South Dakota, in which suit complainants were citizens of states other than South Dakota, and respondent, George T. Blackman, a citizen of South Dakota, was sued as special administrator of the estate of John C. McClellan, deceased. The bill set up that complainants were the sole surviving heirs at law and next of kin of John C. McClellan, deceased, who died on or about the 31st of August, 1899, intestate, in the city of Sioux Falls, county of Minnehaha, South Dakota, leaving an estate of real and personal property of the value of about $33,000. The bill sets out the issuing of letters of administration to one William Van Eps, who held possession of the estate until July 12, 1906, when he died; that subsequently thereto special letters of administration were issued to George T. Blackman, the respondent. The bill further avers that there were in possession of said Blackman, as said special administrator, belonging to said estate, assets in excess of the sum of $35,000, consisting of real estate, cash on hand, etc. The bill avers that ther were no claims against the estate, and that all the creditors of John C. McClellan had been paid, and that the estate was ready for distribution according to the laws of South Dakota. The bill further prayed that the complainants might be adjudicated the sole heirs at law and next of kin of said decedent, and entitled to \n\n[217 U.S. 268, 276]\n\u00a0\n inherit the estate, real and personal, and that the said Blackman render a just and true account of the property in his hands belonging to said estate, and, after deducting his lawful fees and expenses, be required to distribute the same in certain proportions to the complainants, as heirs at law of the decedent. The defendant Blackman appeared and answered the bill, admitting certain allegations thereof, and denying others, and demanding proof thereof, and stating that he held the property described in the bill of complaint subject to the order of the court. A general replication was filed to the answer, and thereupon it appears that the state of South Dakota came, by its attorney general and its attorney for the county of Minnehaha, and special counsel, and asked leave to intervene in the case, and, upon hearing, the circuit court of the United States overruled the motion, and ordered that the further prosecution of the action then pending before it be stayed for the period of ninety days, for the purpose of allowing the state of South Dakota to commence a proper action or proceeding to establish its title and interest in and to the property in the estate of the decedent, and that, in the event that such action be commenced within that time, then the pending action to be stayed until the determination of such action brought by the state of South Dakota. Afterwards the complainants filed an application for the vacation of the orders staying the prosecution of their suit until the determination of the suit in the state court, but the same was denied, and thereafter the petition for mandamus in the circuit court of appeals was filed, with the result already stated.\n The matters we have stated constitute the entire record before the circuit court of appeals. Upon that record it appears that the circuit court of the United States, having an action before it to determine the interest of the complainants in the estate of John C. McClellan, upon which issue had been joined, upon application of the state of South Dakota refused to permit it to intervene in the case to set \n\n[217 U.S. 268, 277]\n\u00a0\n up its right and title to the property in the estate of the decedent, upon the claim that he died without legal heirs, and stayed the proceedings in the case before it until the state of South Dakota could bring an action in the state court for the purpose of determining such rights; and afterwards, it appearing that the state had commenced such action against all persons having or claiming a right, title, or interest therein, stayed the pending action until the determination of the action in the state court.\n It is first objected on behalf of the respondent herein that this is not a case in which this court has the authority to issue the writ of certiorari. It is contended that the application for the writ in this case was under the act of March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. at L. 826, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 488), and that the right to grant writs of certiorari to the circuit court of appeals is limited by the act to certain cases made final in the circuit court of appeals, and that by  10 of the court of appeals act it is declared that whenever on appeal, writ of error, or otherwise, a case coming from the circuit court of appeals shall be reviewed and determined in the Supreme Court, it shall be remanded to the proper district or circuit court for further proceedings in pursuance of such determination.\n These provisions, it is contended, show that a writ of certiorari is not warranted in this case, it being an original application in mandamus in the court of appeals, and the jurisdiction in the circuit court not depending upon the opposite parties to the suit being citizens of different states, and, therefore, the judgment not final in the circuit court of appeals, nor could the case be remanded to the proper district or circuit court, as it was an original proceeding in mandamus in the circuit court of appeals. But the power of this court to issue writs of certiorari is not limited to the court of appeals act. Section 716 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 580) provides:\n'The Supreme Court and the circuit and district courts shall have power to issue writs of scire facias. They shall \n\n[217 U.S. 268, 278]\n\u00a0\n also have power to issue all writs not specifically provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.'\n\n Of this section it was said in Re Chetwood, \n165 \nU.S. 443, 461\n, 41 S. L. ed. 782, 788, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 385, 392:\n'By  14 of the judiciary act of September 24, 1789 (1 Stat. at L. 81, chap. 20, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 580), carried forward as  716 of the Revised Statutes, this court and the circuit and district courts of the United States were empowered by Congress to issue all writs, not specifically provided for by statute, which may be agreeable to the usages and principles of law; and, under this provision, we can undoubtedly issue writs of certiorari in all proper cases. American Constr. Co. v. Jacksonville, T. & K. W. R. Co. \n148 \nU.S. 372, 380\n, 37 S. L. ed. 486, 489, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 758. And although, as observed in that case, this writ has not been issued as freely by this court as by the court of Queen's bench, in England, and, prior to the act of March 3, 1891 (chap. 517, 26 Stat. at L. 826, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 488), had been ordinarily used as an auxiliary process merely, yet, whenever the circumstances imperatively demand that form of interposition, the writ may be allowed, as at common law, to correct excesses of jurisdiction, and in furtherance of justice. Tidd, Pr. 398; Bacon, Abr. 'Certiorari.\"\n\n In Whitney v. Dick, \n202 U.S. 132\n, 50 L. ed. 963, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 584, a writ of certiorari was granted to the circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit to review the judgment of that court where an original application had been made for the writ of habeas corpus and a writ of certiorari in that court. This court held, upon the question of jurisdiction, that there could be no appeal from the circuit court of appeals in such a case, but that a writ of certiorari might issue to bring the case here from the circuit court of appeals, upon the authority of Re Chetwood, supra. The case at bar being a petition for mandamus, there is no amount in controversy, and consequently there could be no appeal to this court; and, as in Whitney v. Dick, supra, the judgment of the circuit court of appeals was not final because \n\n[217 U.S. 268, 279]\n\u00a0\n of the diversity of citizenship in the court below, and, consequently, certiorari would not issue under the act of 1891. In Whitney v. Dick the case was remanded to the circuit court of appeals, with instructions to quash the writ of certiorari issued by that court, and to dismiss the petition for habeas corpus.\n In the present case we have no doubt of the authority of this court to issue the writ of certiorari, under  716 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, as construed and applied in the cases just cited,-Re Chetwood and Whitney v. Dick, supra. The suggestion, therefore, that this case should be dismissed for want of power in this court to grant the writ of certiorari, cannot be entertained. While the power to grant this writ will be sparingly used, as has been frequently declared by this court, we should be slow to reach a conclusion which would deprive the court of the power to issue the writ in proper cases to review the action of the Federal courts inferior in jurisdiction to this court.\n It is further objected that the circuit court of appeals had no jurisdiction to issue the writ of mandamus, as that writ can only be issued in aid of the appellate jurisdiction of the circuit court of appeals; and, it is contended, as that court had no jurisdiction of the suit when the application for mandamus was filed, it ought to have been dismissed. Section 12 of the court of appeals act declares that the circuit court of appeals shall have the powers specified in  716 of the Revised Statutes of the United States. That section we have already had occasion to quote, and when read in connection with  12 of the court of appeals act, it gives to the circuit court of appeals the authority, as this court has, to issue writs of scire facias, and all writs not specially provided for by statute, and necessary for the exercise of the court's jurisdiction, and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\n In this case it appears that the original action commenced in the circuit court of the United States might have been taken on appeal to the circuit court of appeals. The suit involved over $2,000 in amount, and was between citizens of \n\n[217 U.S. 268, 280]\n\u00a0\n different states. There are not wanting decisions in the Federal courts, holding different views as to the right to issue such writs as are involved in this case, before the appellate court has actually obtained jurisdiction of the case. There are expressions in opinions of this court to the effect that such writs issue in aid of a jurisdiction actually acquired. But we think it the true rule that where a case is within the appellate jurisdiction of the higher court, a writ of mandamus may issue in aid of the appellate jurisdiction which might otherwise be defeated by the unauthorized action of the court below. This rule was distinctly stated and the previous cases referred to in Knickerbocker Ins. Co. v. Comstock, 16 Wall. 258, 270, 21 L. ed. 493, 498. In that case the rule was recognized that this court had the power to issue the writ of mandamus to compel the circuit courts to proceed to final judgment in order that this court may exercise the jurisdiction of review given by law. In that case the court said:\n'Repeated decisions of this court have established the rule that this court has power to issue a mandamus, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, and that the writ will lie in a proper case to direct a subordinate Federal court to decide a pending cause.'\n\n In Ex parte Bradstreet, 7 Pet. 647, 8 L. ed. 815, the same rule was laid down by Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the court, requiring a Federal court of inferior jurisdiction to reinstate a case, and to proceed to try and adjudicate the same. And see Re Pennsylvania Co. \n137 \nU.S. 451, 452\n, 34 S. L. ed. 738, 739, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 141; Virginia v. Rives, \n100 U.S. 313\n, 25 L. ed. 667; Re United States, \n194 U.S. 194\n, 48 L. ed. 931, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 629; Barber Asphalt Paving Co. v. Morris, 67 L.R.A. 761, 66 C. C. A. 55, 132 Fed. 945.\n Inasmuch as the order of the circuit court, staying the proceeding until after final judgment in the state court, might prevent the adjudication of the questions involved, and thereby prevent a review thereof in the circuit court of appeals, which had jurisdiction for that purpose, we think that court had power to issue the writ of mandamus to require the circuit court to proceed with and determine the action pending before it. \n\n[217 U.S. 268, 281]\n\u00a0\n The question then arises, Was the circuit court justified in staying the proceedings in the case, and withholding further action until the case involving the same question might be brought and determined in the state court? We think that there can be but one answer to this question. The case made upon the bill was within the original jurisdiction of the circuit court of the United States. The right of the circuit court to maintain such actions, notwithstanding the legislation of the state creating probate courts, has been so recently before this court as to require no further consideration now. Waterman v. Canal-Louisiana Bank & T. Co. \n215 U.S. 33\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 10. In that case, following previous decisions of this court, it was held that the chancerty jurisdiction of the Federal courts to entertain suits between citizens of different states to determine interests in estates, and to have the same fixed and declared, having existed from the beginning of the Federal government, and created by the grant of equity jurisdiction to such courts as it existed in the chancery courts of England, could not be impaired by subsequent state legislation creating courts of probate. The action was therefore within the jurisdiction of the circuit court of the United States.\n So far as the record presented to the circuit court of appeals shows, the only ground upon which the circuit court acted in postponing the suit was because the state of South Dakota, which had applied to be made a party, and which application was denied, was about to begin a suit in the state court to determine an escheat of the estate of John C. McClellan; therefore the action was stayed, first, until the beginning of such suit, and then until it was determined. It therefore appeared upon the record presented to the circuit court of appeals that the circuit court had practically abandoned its jurisdiction over a case of which it had cognizance, and turned the matter over for adjudication to the state court. This it has been steadily held, a Federal court may not do. Chicot County v. Sherwood, \n148 \nU.S. 529, 534\n, 37 S. L. ed. 546, 548, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 695.\n It cannot be denied that a circuit court of the United \n\n[217 U.S. 268, 282]\n\u00a0\n States, like other courts, had power to postpone the trial of cases for good reasons, but, by the orders made in this case, the Federal court withheld the further exercise of its authority until the state court, by its action in a case involving all the parties, might render a judgment which would be res judicata, and thus prevent further proceedings in the Federal court.\n The rule is well recognized that the pendency of an action in the state court is no bar to proceedings concerning the same matter in the Federal court having jurisdiction, for both the state and Federal courts have certain concurrent jurisdiction over such controversies, and when they arise between citizens of different states the Federal jurisdiction may be invoked, and the cause carried to judgment, notwithstanding a state court may also have taken jurisdiction of the same case. In the present case, so far as the record before the circuit court of appeals discloses, the circuit court of the United States had acquired jurisdiction, the issues were made up, and when the state intervened, the Federal court practically turned the case over for determination to the state court. We think it had no authority to do this, and that the circuit court of appeals, upon the record before it, should have issued the writ of mandamus to require the judge of the circuit court of the United States to show cause why he did not proceed to hear and determine the case.\n Whether the state ought to have been allowed to intervene in the Federal court is not a question now before us; but, if not made a party to the suit, its rights would not have been concluded by any adjudication made therein. Tindal v. Wesley, \n167 \nU.S. 204, 223\n, 42 S. L. ed. 137, 143, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 770.\n We have thus far considered the case upon the record made in the circuit court of appeals, and certified here upon the writ of certiorari. In this court the honorable judge of the district court enters special appearance, and filed an affidavit as to the proceedings before him, in which much appears which is not in the record presented to the circuit court of appeals. In that appearance and affidavit the petition in intervention, \n\n[217 U.S. 268, 283]\n\u00a0\n filed in the circuit court of the United States, is set forth in full, as well as certain affidavits which were filed. We papers, because they are not in the record, papers, because they are not in the record, as the same has been certified to us from the circuit court of appeals as the one upon which it acted, and declined to issue the writ of mandamus. They set forth at length certain proceedings in the state courts of South Dakota, in which it is alleged that the issue of the right of the complainants in the equity suit to take the estate of John C. McClellan, as his heirs at law, was determined adversely to them, and that such proceedings were had as showed that further proceedings in reference to the escheat of the estate of McClellan for want of legal heirs ought to be determined by proceedings in the state court. In making his appearance in this court, and in presenting these papers, it is evident that the district judge was much influenced in ordering the stay of proceedings, and withholding judgment until the state court had rendered its judgment, by the proceedings already had in the state courts of South Dakota.\n As we have said, we do not pass upon the sufficiency of those proceedings to authorize the orders in question. We must take the case as it is presented here upon the stipulated return to the writ of certiorari on the record as presented to the circuit court of appeals. Upon that record, we think, the circuit court of appeals should not have dismissed the writ of mandamus, but should have ordered the alternative writ, or an order to show cause, to issue, in order that the district judge might have been fully heard before the question was determined as to whether mandamus should issue or not.\n We shall therefore reverse the judgment of the circuit court of appeals, and remand the case to that court, with directions to issue the alternative writ, or an order to show cause. All we decide is, that upon the petition and record made in the circuit court of appeals, and as now presented by the transcript filed in this court, such alternative writ or order to show cause ought to have issued. The judgment dismissing \n\n[217 U.S. 268, 284]\n\u00a0\n the petition is reversed and the case is remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals for further proceedings, as herein indicated.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","112":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMECHANICAL APPLIANCE CO. v. CASTLEMAN(1910)\nNo. 48\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. \n\n[215 U.S. 437, 438]\n\u00a0\n Lee W. Grant and P. B. Kennedy for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Benjamin T. Castleman, in propria persona, and Messrs. Rassieur, Schnurmacher, & Rassieur for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case comes here under  5 of the court of appeals act (26 Stat. at L. 827, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549), upon a certificate from the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Missouri, presenting a question of the jurisdiction of that court to entertain a suit brought by Benjamin T. Castleman, defendant in error, against the Mechanical Appliance Company, plaintiff in error, to recover for the breach of a certain alleged contract concerning the making and delivery of massage motors.\n The action was originally brought in the circuit court of the city of St. Louis, in the state of Missouri, and the \n\n[215 U.S. 437, 439]\n\u00a0\n Mechanical Appliance Company, a foreign corporation, then defendant, removed the case to the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Missouri upon the ground of diverse citizenship. After the case reached the United States circuit court, the bill of exceptions shows that a motion to quash the summons and certain affidavits were withdrawn, and a plea to the jurisdiction was filed.\n The original service of summons in the state court had been made by the sheriff, who returned the summons as follows:\n'Served this writ at the city of St. Louis, Missouri, on the within named defendant the Mechanical Appliance Company (a corporation), this 29th day of December, 1906, by delivering a copy of the writ and petition furnished by the clerk to Dudley Shaw, agent of the said defendant corporation, he being in said defendant's usual business office and in charge thereof. The president or other chief officer of said defendant could not be found in the city of St. Louis at the time of service.'\n\n In the plea to the jurisdiction, in the circuit court of the United States, the plaintiff in error set up:\n'1. That it is a corporation, organized under the laws of the state of Wisconsin; that it has never taken out a license to do business in the state of Missouri; and that at the time of the alleged service of the writ of summons herein as set out in the return of the sheriff, to wit, 29th day of December, 1906, the defendant did not have any agent, office, or place of business in the city of St. Louis or in the state of Missouri.\n\n'2. That the person upon whom service was attempted to be had by the sheriff, and to whom a copy of the summons and petition was delivered, to wit, Dudley Shaw, was not and had not been for some time prior thereto an officer, agent, or employee of this defendant. That said Dudley Shaw was not, at the time of the delivery of the summons herein to him by the sheriff, in charge of defendant's usual business office, or in defendant's usual business office in the city of St. Louis, for the reason that this defendant had, at said time, no \n\n[215 U.S. 437, 440]\n\u00a0\n business office nor any other office in the city of St. Louis, state of Missouri.'\n\n Certain affidavits are set out in the bill of exceptions, and it is therein stated that they were filed. Two affidavits appear to have been filed in support of the plea to the jurisdiction, and one, by the plaintiff, in opposition thereto. In the certificate the learned circuit judge states:\n'I hereby certify that in this cause the following question of jurisdiction arose; the defendant filed a plea to the jurisdiction of the court on the ground that it was a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Wisconsin, that it has no office, place of business, or agent in, and was not doing business in, the state of Missouri at the time of the service of summons herein, and that the person served with the process herein was not the agent of the defendant at the time of said service. Defendant filed affidavit in support of the plea. I overruled the plea on the ground that the facts stated in the return of the sheriff to the summons were conclusive on the defendant and could not be controverted by it. When the cause was called for trial, the same objection was made by the defendant, and overruled for the same reason. The question only of jurisdiction of the court is, therefore, hereby certified to the Supreme Court of the United States for its decision thereon.'\n\n It is settled that a question of this character involves the jurisdiction of the circuit court as a Federal court, and may be brought here by writ of error under  5 of the court of appeals act of 1891. Remington v. Central P. R. Co. \n198 U.S. 95\n, 49 L. ed. 959, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 577.\n It is contended by the defendant in error that the plea to the jurisdiction did not definitely state that the corporation defendant was not doing business in the state of Missouri at the time of the attempted service; and, furthermore, that the affidavits were not shown to have been offered in evidence, although the bill of exceptions states that the same were filed. The certificate of the judge, which is required by statute in \n\n[215 U.S. 437, 441]\n\u00a0\n order to bring the case to this court, states that the defendant raised, by plea to the jurisdiction, the grounds of objection that it was a foreign corporation, having no office, place of business, or agent in, and was not doing business in, the state of Missouri at the time of the service of summons, and that the person served with the process was not the agent of the defendant at the time of said service.\n The certificate shows that the court did not consider the affidavits, and overruled the plea on the sole ground that the facts stated in the return of the sheriff to the summons were conclusive, and could not be controverted by the defendant. It is also stated in the certificate that, when the case was called for trial, the same objection was made and overruled for the same reason. In the light of this certificate and the statements of the bill of exceptions, we think it must be regarded that the question was fairly before the court, notwithstanding the somewhat meager allegations of the plea in this respect, and presented the question, which it is certified was decided, upon plea and objections attacking the jurisdiction of the court, because the corporation was not doing business in the state of Missouri, and the person attempted to be served was not its agent at that time.\n In a memorandum opinion it is indicated that the learned judge in the court below followed a previous ruling in the same court; and it is stated that it is the law of Missouri, as held by its highest court, that, in a case of this kind, a return of this character is conclusive upon the parties. But it is well settled that, after removal from the state to the Federal court, the moving party has a right to the opinion of the Federal court, not only upon the question of the merits of the case, but as to the validity of the service of process. Wabash Western R. Co. v. Brow, \n164 \nU.S. 271, 278\n, 41 S. L. ed. 431, 434, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 126.\n It is equally well settled in the Federal jurisdiction that a foreign corporation can be served with process within the state only when it is doing business therein, and that such service must be upon an agent who represents the corporation \n\n[215 U.S. 437, 442]\n\u00a0\n in its business. This subject underwent extensive consideration in the case of Goldey v. Morning News, \n156 U.S. 518\n, 39 L. ed. 517, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 559, and the rule is there stated by Mr. Justice Gray, speaking for the court, as follows:\n'Service of mesne process from a court of a state, not made upon the defendant or his authorized agent within the state, although there made in some other manner recognized as valid by its legislative acts and judicial decisions, can be allowed no validity in the circuit court of the United States after the removal of the case into that court, pursuant to the acts of Congress, unless the defendant can be held, by virtue of a general appearance or otherwise, to have waived the defect in the service, and to have submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the court.'\n\n In view of the principles thus determined, we think the return of the sheriff of the state court was not conclusive upon the question of service. For when the question was raised in the circuit court of the United States, the jurisdiction of the court would fail if it appeared that the corporation attempted to be served was not doing business in the state of Missouri, and the attempted service was not upon one of its agent. Conley v. Mathieson Alkali Works, \n190 U.S. 406\n, 47 L. ed. 1113, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 728; St. Clair v. Cox, \n106 U.S. 350\n, 27 L. ed. 222, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 354; Peterson v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. \n205 U.S. 364\n, 51 L. ed. 841, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 513; Green v. Chicago B. & Q. R. Co. \n205 U.S. 530\n, 51 L. ed. 916, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 595.\n Defendant in error cites the case of Smoot v. Judd, 184 Mo. 508, 83 S. W. 481, in which it was held that where a sheriff's return recited a personal service of process which was false, the remedy of the unserved defendant aginst whom judgment by default had been taken, in the absence of fraud on the part of the plaintiff in the suit, was in an action on the sheriff's bond for damages for the false return, and not by a suit to set aside the sheriff's sale and deed made in pursuance of the default judgment. It is to be noted, in this connection, that the attack upon the service in that case was made after judgment, and not, as in the present case, by a motion to set aside the \n\n[215 U.S. 437, 443]\n\u00a0\n service of summons, or a plea to the jurisdiction over the person. Moreover, in cases which concern the jurisdiction of the Federal courts, notwithstanding the so-called conformity act (Revised Stat.  914, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 684), neither the statutes of the state nor the decisions of its courts are conclusive upon the Federal courts. The ultimate determination of such questions of jurisdiction is for this court alone. Western Loan & Sav. Co. v. Butte & B. Consol. Min. Co. \n210 U.S. 368\n, 369; 52 L. ed. 1101, 1102, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 720; Mexican C. R. Co. v. Pinknev, \n149 U.S. 194\n, 37 L. ed. 699, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 859.\n Defendant in error also relies upon the cases of Walker v. Robbins, 14 How, 584, 14 L. ed. 552, and Knox County v. Harshman, \n133 U.S. 152\n, 33 L. ed. 586, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 257. Neither of these cases controls the one under consideration. In Walker v. Robbns a bill in equity was filed to enjoin enforcement of a judgment at law, entered upon a false return of a marshal in the circuit court of the Mississippi district. This court held that a bill in equity would not lie for such purpose, and further, that the return was not false, and, if it were, the defendant Walker waived the want of service by pleading to the merits of the action. It was there said by Mr. Justice Catron, delivering the opinion of the court: 'In cases of false returns affecting the defendant, where the plaintiff at law is not at fault, redress can only be had in the court of law where the record was made; and, if relief cannot be had there, the party injured must seek his remedy against the marshal.'\n The case was decided upon the grounds which we have stated, and the language quoted and relied upon by the defendant in error is very far from indicating that a party might not appear specially and object to service of summons, and move to set aside the same, and to dismiss the action upon the grounds which are involved in the case at bar.\n In Knox County v. Harshman, a bill in equity was filed for an injunction against the prosecution of a writ of mandamus to enforce the levy of a certain tax against the county. The bill alleged that neither the county court nor any of the judges thereof had any notice of the suit until after the end of the \n\n[215 U.S. 437, 444]\n\u00a0\n term at which judgment was rendered, and that no service of summons was made upon Frank P. Hall, the county clerk, as was stated in the marshal's return. This court, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Gray, held that a court of equity would not interfere with the judgment, under the circumstances shown, and as to the officer's return of service of copy of the summons on the clerk, if false, no fraud having been charged or proved against the petitioner, redress must be sought in an action at law, and not by a bill in equity; and that, if the questions of fact could be considered as open in the case, the proof at the hearing showed that service had, in fact, been made.\n Neither of these cases involved the right of the defendant to appear upon attempted service in an action at law, and by motion, or plea for that purpose, raise the question of jurisdiction over his person. The case of Wabash Western R. Co. v. Brow, \n164 U.S. 271\n, 41 L. ed. 431, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 126, is much closer in its analogy to the case at bar. In that case suit was commenced in the state court, in Michigan, against the Wabash Western Railway Company, to recover in an action for damages. The service of summons and copy of the declaration was made upon one Hill, as agent of the company. The case was removed to the Federal court for the eastern district of Michigan. The railroad company thereupon appeared and moved to set aside the declaration and rule to plead, upon the ground of want of jurisdiction, and filed an affidavit showing that Hill, upon whom the service had been attempted, was the freight agent of the Wabash Railroad Company, a corporation which owned and operated a railroad from Detroit to the Michigan state line, and was not an agent of the Wabash Western Railway Company, the defendant in the suit; and, at the time of the attempted service, the defendant did not own, operate, and control any railroad in the state of Michigan, had no place of business therein, and was not doing business within the state. The action was overruled by the circuit court, the objection to the jurisdiction was renewed when the defendant filed its \n\n[215 U.S. 437, 445]\n\u00a0\n plea and before trial in the case, which resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of Brow.\n The court of appeals for the sixth circuit held that the filing of the petition for removal, in general terms, had effected the appearance of the Wabash Western Railway Company to the action. This court, in an opinion by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, held that the record disclosed that the corporation, at the time of the attempted service, was neither incorporated nor doing business, nor had any agent nor property, within the state of Michigan, and that the individual upon whom service had been attempted was not the agent or an officer of the corporation, and therefore no jurisdiction was acquired over the person of the defendant by the attempted service; and, further, that the petition for removal did not effect an appearance in the case, consequently reversing the judgment of the circuit court of appeals, and remanding the case to the circuit court, with directions to grant a new trial, and to sustain the motion to set aside the service and dismiss the action.\n The circuit court should have considered the question upon the issues of fact raised, as to the presence of the corporation in Missouri and the authority of the agent upon whom service had been attempted. It is true, as suggested by the defendant in error, that the affidavits appearing in the bill of exceptions are stated to have been filed, and there is no definite statement that they were offered to be read in evidence, but we think it is apparent that they were filed for that purpose. No objection appears in the record to the filing of the affidavits; on the other hand, it appears that the plaintiff below also filed an affidavit. These affidavits are made part of the record by a bill of exceptions and we think they should have been considered upon the question of jurisdiction.\n As we have already indicated, the learned circuit court was in error in holding that the return of the sheriff in the state court concluded the parties, and had it considered the affidavits exhibited in the bill of exceptions, as, in our view, it should have done, the conclusion would have been reached that the \n\n[215 U.S. 437, 446]\n\u00a0\n weight of the testimony disclosed that the defendant corporation was not doing business in the state of Missouri at the time of the attempted service of process, and that the person named in the return of the sheriff was not at that time the duly authorized agent of the defendant corporation.\n Holding these views, the judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed, and the cause remanded to that court with directions to dismiss the case for want of jurisdiction.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","113":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMISSOURI PAC. RY. CO. v. STATE OF KANSAS EX REL. TAYLOR(1910)\nNo. 38\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 262, 263]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Balie P. Waggener for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 262, 266]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Fred S. Jackson and G. F. Grattan for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a writ of error to a judgment of the supreme court of Kansas ordering a peremptory mandamus commanding the Missouri Pacific Railway Company to obey an order of the state board of railroad commissioners. The order directed the putting in operation of a passenger train service between Madison, Kansas, and the Missouri-Kansas state line, on what is known as the Madison branch of the Missouri Pacific Railway Company.\n The branch road in question lies between Madison, Kansas, and Monteith Junction, Missouri. From Madison to the state line is 89 miles, and from the state line to Monteith Junction is 19 miles, the total distance between the two terminal points being 108 miles. At Monteith Junction the Madison branch intersects with the Joplin line of the Missouri Pacific, by means of which connection is made with Kansas City and other points. There being no terminal facilities at Monteith Junction, the trains operated on the Madison branch do not remain over at the junction, but run as far as Butler station, 3 miles distant on the Joplin line, where terminal facilities exist.\n There are no large towns on the Madison branch, either in Kansas or Missouri, and the country which that branch serves is largely agricultural, Kansas City being the nearest and \n\n[216 U.S. 262, 267]\n\u00a0\n most natural market for the products of the territory. The greater volume of the passenger travel, however, originating on the Madison branch, does not move to Kansas City by going to Monteith Junction, but leaves the branch at various points between Madison and the state line, at which points the branch crosses various roads, which, generally speaking, run in a northerly or northeasterly direction, affording a means of reaching Kansas City more directly than by going to Moneteith and thence via the Joplin line to that city. Three of these intersecting roads are operated by the Atchison & Topeka, two by the Missouri, Kansas & Texas, one by the St. Louis & San Francisco, one by the Kansas & Colorado Pacific, and one by the Missouri Pacific. Pleasanton is the last station on the branch in Kansas, and is six miles distant from the state line.\n Without clearing up some confusion in the record upon the subject, we take the fact to be as stated by the court below, that the branch between Madison and Monteith Junction, at least, so far as it was constructed within the state of Kansas, was built by a Kansas corporation chartered in 1885, known as the Interstate Railroad Company, and that to aid in the building of the road within the state of Kansas about $200,000 was contributed by counties through which the road passed. A construction company did the work, at the contract cost of $1,095,000, and this sum was paid by the railway company by delivering to the contractors an issue of $ 1,622,000 of 6 per cent mortgage bonds. The Interstate Railroad Company, in July, 1890, consolidated with another Kansas corporation known as the St. Louis & Emporia Railroad Company, the consolidated company being designated as the Interstate Railway Company. Subsequently, in December, 1890, by authority of a statute of Kansas, the Interstate Railway Company and eleven other Kansas railway corporations were consolidated, the consolidated company being designated as the Kansas & Colorado Pacific Railway Company. \n\n[216 U.S. 262, 268]\n\u00a0\n The Missouri Pacific Railway Company is a corporation chartered in Missouri, Kansas, and Nebraska. It owns virtually all the mortgage bonds issued by the Interstate Railroad Company for the construction of the Madison branch and a majority of the stock of that company. Indeed, it is the owner of a majority of the stock and mortgage bonds of all the constituent companies which united in forming the consolidated company known as the Kansas & Colorado Pacific Railway Company, and, as the lessee of the latter company, operates its lines of road, including, of course, the Madison branch. It is not questioned that substantially all the equipment used in operating the roads covered by the leases is owned by the Missouri Pacific Railway Company.\n In September, 1905, residents along the Madison branch within the state of Kansas filed a petition with the board of railroad commissioners, alleging, in substance, that only a mixed train was furnished for passenger service on the branch, that such service subjected the public to great inconvenience, prevented anything like a regular and timely passenger service, and, besides, was dangerous to those traveling over the road. An order was prayed requiring the Missouri Pacific to operate a regular passenger train over the branch road between Madison and the state line. The evidence introduced before the board is not in the record. After a hearing, the following finding and order were made:\n'Now, on this 7th day of December, 1905, after hearing the evidence and argument of counsel, in the above-entitled action, the board finds that during the years 1902 and 1903, when the respondent railway company operated a passenger train on the Madison branch of its line, that the said passenger train was operated at a loss, and there was no testimony introduced at this hearing that the train, if put on as asked for by the petitioners, could be operated at a profit to the respondent company. The board belives that the people along the line of the Madison branch of said company are entitled to better passenger train service than they are \n\n[216 U.S. 262, 269]\n\u00a0\n now receiving, and it has been represented to the board of officers of said company that the respondent is constructing motor cars for establishment on its branch lines, that can be operated at a much less expense than steam service.\n\n'It is therefore ordered by the board that on or before the first day of May, 1906, a motor passenger car service be put on and operated on said Madison branch, from Madison, Kansas, to the Kansas and Missouri state line, and in the event said railroad company is unable at that time to put on a motor car passenger service, a regular steam passenger train service be forthwith put on and operated.'\n\n The road not having obeyed, this proceeding by mandamus was commenced to compel compliance.\n Three special defenses were set up in the return to the alternative writ. In the first it was insisted that the branch road was an interstate road and could only be operated as such, and therefore was not subject to the jurisdiction of the railroad commission or the courts of the state of Kansas, and in the second it was claimed that the burden which would be occasioned by compelling the operation of a passenger train service would be confiscatory and in violation of rights protected by the 14th Amendment. The court below, in its opinion, thus, we think, accurately summarized the elaborate averments relating to the two defenses just referred to:\n'To the alternative writ an answer was filed which denies that the company operated the Madison branch as a line of road wholly within the state of Kansas, and alleges that said branch is a part of the Missouri Pacific general system; that defendant maintains terminal facilities for the branch at Butler, Missouri, 20 miles east of the Kansas state line, where the branch connects with the main line of defendant's railroad; that the company has no terminal facilities near the state line within the state of Kansas, and that the branch road cannot be operated as a road within the state of Kansas without such terminal facilities, to maintain which would \n\n[216 U.S. 262, 270]\n\u00a0\n involve the company in ruinous expense. It also alleges that the order is unreasonable and confiscatory, and that the company cannot comply with it without great financial loss; that the entire revenue of the road within the state of Kansas, including passenger and freight business, is insufficient to meet the expense and cost of operating the road within the state; that from July 1, 1903, to April, 30, 1905, it maintained separate passenger train service upon this branch, but was obliged to abandon the same and return to the mixed passenger and freight service because the total receipts of passenger and freight business during that period proved wholly insufficient to meet the expenses of operation. It further alleges that compliance with the order of the board would compel defendant to divert its revenues from other lines and parts of its system outside the state of Kansas to the maintenance of separate passenger train service in the state, and that the extent of such additional cost would amount to a confiscation of its property.'\n\n The third defense set up that the company was diligently endeavoring to perfect a motor car for experimental purposes, that the practical utility of such service on railway tracks was problematical, and that it was the design of the company 'to test the practicability of said character of service on its said Madison branch line as soon as the same can be done, and is also its design to furnish said motor car service for separate passenger traffic if the cost of said service can be brought within the passenger service cost of the mixed train service, which it now furnishes, and if said motor car service can be successfully operated from the standpoints of utility and safety and other considerations necessary to be taken into account.'\n By stipulation a referee was appointed to take evidence and report findings of fact and conclusions of law. The referee transmitted the evidence taken and made lengthy findings of fact, upon which his conclusions of law were stated. Those conclusions briefly were that although it might be unreasonable \n\n[216 U.S. 262, 271]\n\u00a0\n to order a separate passenger train service to be operated on the branch line, viewed as an absolutely independent line, it was not unreasonable to compel the furnishing of such service, viewing the line as a part of the system of the Missouri Pacific road, and taking into account the possible benefits which might arise to that system. It was, however, concluded that as the branch road was an interstate road, and could only be operated as such, the state was without power to compel the putting in operation of the passenger train service between Madison and the state line, and that the relief prayed for should therefore be refused.\n It was recognized by the supreme court of Kansas when it came to consider the report of the referee that the authority which the commission had exerted in making the order took its source in a section of the act of the legislature of Kansas enacted in 1901, and now found in  5970, General Statutes of Kansas of 1901, the section being as follows:\n'Whenever, in the judgment of the railroad commissioners, it shall appear that any railroad corporation or other transportation company fails in any respect or particular to comply with the terms of its charter or the laws of the state, or whenever in their judgment any repairs are necessary upon its road, or any addition to its rolling stock, or any addition to or change of its stations or station houses, or any change in its rates for transporting freight, or any change in the mode of operating its road and conducting its business, is reasonable and expedient in order to promote the security, convenience, and accommodation of the public, said commissioners shall inform such corporation of the improvement and changes which they adjudge to be proper, by a notice thereof in writing, to be served by leaving a copy thereof, certified by the commissioner's secretary, with any station agent, clerk, treasurer, or any director of said corporation; and if such orders are not complied with, the said commissioners, upon complaint, shall proceed to enforce the same in accordance with the provisions of this act, as in other cases.' \n\n[216 U.S. 262, 272]\n\u00a0\n Reviewing the findings and conclusions of the referee, the court held that the referee was wrong in holding that there was a want of power in the commission to make the order, and it was therefore decided that the order was valid and that the duty of the railroad company was to obey it. 76 Kan. 467, 92 Pac. 606.\n\n A brief summary of the questions passed on by the court will serve to an understanding of the assignments of error which we are called upon to consider:\n a. The court disposed of certain contentions which would seem to have been raised at the argument concerning the repugnancy to the state Constitution of the law creating the commission and conferring authority upon that body, and held the objections untenable. As these involved matters of purely state concern, we shall not further refer to them.\n b. The court also adversely disposed of a contention based upon the assumption that the railway company had, by its charter, a contract right to regulate the time and manner of operating its trains, and hence was not subject to the order which the commission had made. Although such contention did not deny that the charter right relied on was subject to repeal or amendment by the legislature, it was urged that, as the legislature had not expressly amended or repealed the right, such a result should not be made to flow from the section conferring powers upon the commission, as repeals by implication were not favored.\n Having thus cleared the way for the graver questions which the case involved, the court came to consider, first, the reasonableness on its face of the order of the commission, viewed in the light of the findings of that body; second, the reasonableness of the order, tested by the findings of the referee and the evidence upon which such findings were based; and third, the validity of the order in view of the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, as applied to the nature and character of the road to which the order of the commission was made applicable. \n\n[216 U.S. 262, 273]\n\u00a0\n As to the first, although the duty of the company under its charter was referred to and authorities were cited, with evident approval, holding that the obligation to operate a separate passenger train service rested upon a railroad company in the fulfilment of the law of its being, the court did not expressly pass upon that aspect of the case, but held that, as it did not plainly and obviously result upon the face of the findings and order made by the commission, that the service required would be rendered at a pecuniary loss, it could not, in any event, be said that the order was unreasonable on its face. As to the second, considering the inherent and prima facie reasonable nature of the service, the performance of which the order commanded, along with the findings of the referee and the evidence, it was held that the unreasonableness of the order had not been established, since, taking all the foregoing into account, it had not been affirmatively proven that any material pecuniary loss would be sustained from rendering the service in question. In reaching this conclusion it was pointed out that, as a result of the state statute, a prima facie presumption of reasonableness attached to the order of the commission, and therefore the burden was on the railroad company to overcome this presumption. As to the third contention, it was held that the exertion by the state of its authority to regulate the operation within the state of the road chartered by the state was but the exercise of a lawful state police power which did not impose any direct burden upon interstate commerce, and hence did not conflict with the Constitution of the United States.\n The grievances which the railroad company deems it may endure by the enforcement of the order of the commission as commanded by the court are expressed in many assignments of error. To consider them in detail is not essential, as all the complaints which they embrace were embodied in the argument at bar by the counsel for the railway company in the following propositions:\n'First. The order of the board and the mandate of the \n\n[216 U.S. 262, 274]\n\u00a0\n state court were, in substance and effect, a regulation of commerce among the states, and the court was without power or jurisdiction in the premises.\n\n'Second. The order of the board, on its face, is manifestly unreasonable, and, in the light of the findings of fact, arbitrary, and without the first element of due process of law, and a denial of the equal protection of the law, guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.\n\n'Third. The order and judgment of the state court, on the evidence and facts found, deprived the railroad company of its property without due process of law, and without compensation, and denied to it the equal protection of the law.\n\n'Fourth. The order of the board of railroad commissioners was an usurpation of power by the board, and the construction placed upon the law by the state court impaired the obligation of the contract between the state and the railway company, in violation of the Constitution of the United States, and deprived it of its property without due process of law and without compensation, and denied to it the equal protection of the law.'\n\n While it may be that, in some of their aspects, each of the first three propositions involve considerations apparently distinct from the others, as, in substance, the ultimate reasons by which all three are controlled are identical, we consider them together. Before doing so, however, we dispose of the question concerning the alleged impairment of a contract right, protected by the Constitution of the United States, which is formulated in the fourth proposition, by pointing out the twofold contradiction upon which the proposition is based. As it is not denied that the asserted charter right was held subject to the power of the state to repeal, alter, or amend, it follows that the proposition amounts simply to saying that an irrepealable contract right arose from a contract which was repealable. Hammond Packing Co. v. Arkansas, \n212 \nU.S. 322, 345\n, 53 S. L. ed. 530, 542, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 370. Stating the contention in a different form, the same contradiction becomes apparent. As \n\n[216 U.S. 262, 275]\n\u00a0\n the argument concedes the existence of the legislative power to repeal, alter, or amend, and as it is impossible to assume that a legislative act has impaired a contract without, by the same token, declaring that such act has either repealed, altered, or amended, hence the proposition relied upon really contends that the contract has been unlawfully impaired by the exercise of a power which it is conceded could lawfully repeal the contract. And, of course, this reason is controlling, irrespective of the scope of the alleged charter right, since, whatever be the extent of the right conferred, it was subject to the reserve power.\n The court in Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. North Carolina Corp. Commission, \n206 U.S. 1\n, 51 L. ed. 933, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 585, 11 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 398, reiterating a doctrine expounded in preceding cases, said ( p. 19):\n'The elementary proposition that railroads, from the public nature of the business by them carried on, and the interest which the public have in their operation, are subject, as to their state business, to state regulation, which may be exerted either directly, by the legislative authority, or by administrative bodies endowed with power to that end, is not and could not be successfully questioned, in view of the long line of authorities sustaining that doctrine.'\n\n Also in the same case, restating a principle previously often announced, it was held (p. 20) that railway property was susceptible of private ownership, and that rights in and to such property securely rested under the constitutional guaranties by which all private property was protected. Pointing out that there was no incompatibility between the two, the truism was reannounced that the right of private ownership was not abridged by subjecting the enjoyment of that right to the power of reasonable regulation, and that such governmental power could not in truth be said to be curtailed because it could not be exerted arbitrarily and unreasonably without impinging on the enduring guaranties by which the Constitution protected property rights.\n The Coast Line Case was concerned with the exertion of \n\n[216 U.S. 262, 276]\n\u00a0\n state power over a matter of state concern. But the same doctrines had been often previously expounded in reference to the power of the United States in dealing with a matter subject to the control of that government. Moreover, in the cases referred to, as the power of the two governments operated in different orbits, it was always recognized that there was no conflict between them, although it was constantly to be observed that, resulting from the paramount operation of the Constitution of the United States, even the lawful powers of a state could not be exerted so as to directly burden interstate commerce.\n Coming to apply the principles just stated to the order in question, and considering it generically, it is obvious that it exerted a lawful state power. Its commands were directed to a railroad corporation which, although chartered by other states, was also chartered by Kansas, and concerned the movement of a train on a branch road wholly within the state, which had been built under the authority of a Kansas charter, although the road was being operated by the Missouri Pacific under lease. The act commanded to be done was simply that a passenger train service be operated over the branch line within the state of Kansas. Unless, then, for some reason, not manifested in the order, intrinsically considered, it must be treated as such an arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of power as to cause it to be, in effect, not a regulation, but an infringement upon the right of ownership, or, considering the surrounding circumstances, as operating a direct burden upon interstate commerce, it is clear that, within the doctrine previously stated, no error was committed in directing compliance with the order. And this brings us to consider the several reasons relied upon to establish, first, that the order made by the railroad commission was so arbitrary and unreasonable as to cause it to be void for want of power; or, second, that the order was void because its necessary operation was to place a direct burden upon interstate commerce. \n\n[216 U.S. 262, 277]\n\u00a0\n 1. The alleged arbitrary and unreasonable character of the order.\n In its principal aspect, this contention is based on the insistence that the order and findings of the commission and the findings of the referee, when elucidated by the proper inferences of fact to be drawn from the evidence, show the service which the order commanded could not be rendered without a pecuniary loss. And this, it is insisted, is the case, not only because of the proof that pecuniary loss would be occasioned by performing the particular service ordered, considering alone the cost of that service and the return from its performance, but also because it is asserted the proof establishes that the earnings from all sources, not only of the branch road, but of all the roads operated by the Missouri Pacific in Kansas, produced no net revenue and left a deficit. It is at once evident that this contention challenges the correctness of the inferences of fact drawn by the court below. They therefore assume that we are not bound by the facts as found by the court below, but must give to the evidence an independent examination for the purpose of passing on the constitutional question presented for decision. But we do not think that the case here presented requires us to consider the issues of fact relied upon, even if it be conceded, for the sake of argument only, that, on a writ of error to a state court, where a particular exertion of state power is assailed as confiscatory, because ordering a service to be rendered for an inadequate return, the proof upon which the claim of confiscation depends would be open for our original consideration, as the essential and only means for properly performing our duty of independently ascertaining whether there had been, as alleged, a violation of the Constitution. We say this because, when the controversy here presented is properly analyzed, the first and pivotal question arising is whether the order complained of did anything more than command the railroad company to perform a service which it was incumbent upon it to perform as the necessary result of the possession and \n\n[216 U.S. 262, 278]\n\u00a0\n enjoyment of its charter powers, and which it could not refuse to perform as long as the charter powers remained and the obligation which arose from their enjoyment continued to exist. The difference between the exertion of the legislative power to establish rates in such a manner as to confiscate the property of the corporation by fixing them below a proper remunerative standard, and an order compelling a corporation to render a service which it was essentially its duty to perform, was pointed out in Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. North Carolina Corp. Commission, supra. In that case the order to operate a train for the purpose of making a local connection necessary for the public convenience was upheld, despite the fact that it was conceded that the return from the operation of such train would not be remunerative. Speaking of the distinction between the two, it was said (p. 26):\n'This is so [the distinction] because, as the primal duty of a carrier is to furnish adequate facilities to the public, that duty may well be compelled, although by doing so, as an incident, some pecuniary loss from rendering such service may result. It follows, therefore, that the mere incurring of a loss from the performance of such a duty does not, in and of itself, necessarily give rise to the conclusion of unreasonableness, as would be the case where the whole scheme of rates was unreasonable under the doctrine of Smyth v. Ames, \n169 U.S. 526\n, 42 L. ed. 842, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 418.\n\n ... * *\n'Of course, the fact that the furnishing of a necessary facility ordered may occasion an incidental pecuniary loss is an important criteria to be taken into view in determining the reasonableness of the order, but it is not the only one. As the duty to furnish necessary facilities is coterminous with the powers of the corporation, the obligation to discharge that duty must be considered in connection with the nature and productiveness of the corporate business as a whole, the character of the services required, and the public need for its performance.'\n\n Indeed, the principle which was thus applied in the Atlantic \n\n[216 U.S. 262, 279]\n\u00a0\n Coast Line Case had previously, as pointed out in that case, been made the basis of the ruling in Wisconsin, M. & P. R. Co. v. Jacobson, \n179 U.S. 287\n, 45 L. ed. 194, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 115. The fact that the performance of the duty commanded by the order which is here in question may, as we have conceded for the purpose of the argument, entail a pecuniary loss, is, of course, as declared in the Atlantic Coast Line Case, as a general rule, a circumstance to be considered in determining its reasonableness, as are the other criteria indicated in the opinion in that case. But where a duty which a corporation is obliged to render is a necessary consequence of the acceptance and continued enjoyment of its corporate rights, those rights not having been surrendered by the corporation, other considerations are, in the nature of things, paramount, since it cannot be said that an order compelling the performance of such a duty at a pecuniary loss is unreasonable. To conclude to the contrary would be but to declare that a corporate charter was purely unilateral; that is, was binding in favor of the corporation as to all rights conferred upon it, and was devoid of obligation as to duties imposed, even although such duties were the absolute correlative of the rights conferred. Was the duty which the order here commanded one which the corporation was under the absolute obligation to perform as the result of the acceptance of the charter to operate the road is then the question to be considered.\n It may not be doubted that the road, by virtue of the charter under which the branch was built, was obliged to carry passengers and freight, and therefore, as long as it enjoyed its charter rights, was under the inherent obligation to afford a service for the carrying of passengers. In substance, this was all the order commanded, since it was confined to directing that the road put on a train for passenger service. True it is that the road was carrying passengers in a mixed train, that is, by attaching a passenger coach to one of its freight trains. Testing the alleged unreasonableness of the order in the light of the inherent duty resting upon the corporation, it follow \n\n[216 U.S. 262, 280]\n\u00a0\n that the contention must rest upon the assumption that the discharge of the corporate duty to carry passengers was so completely performed by carrying them on a mixed train as to cause an order directing the running of a passenger train to be so arbitrary and unreasonable as to deprive of rights protected by the Constitution of the United States. But when the necessary result of the contention is thus defined, its want of merit is, we think, self-evident, unless it can be said as a matter of law that there is such an identity as to public convenience, comfort, and safety between travel on a passenger service train and travel on a mixed train,- that is, a train composed of freight cars with a passenger car attached,- as to cause any exertion of legislative authority for the public welfare, based on a distinction between the two, to be repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. The demonstration as to the want of foundation for such a contention might well be left to the consensus of opinion of mankind to the contrary. The unsoundness of the proposition was clearly pointed out by the supreme court of Illinois in People ex rel. Cantrell v. St. Louis, A. & T. H. R. Co. 176 Ill. 512, 35 L. R. A. 656, 52 N. E. 292, where it was said:\n'Independently of the provisions of the lease, which was a contract between the lessor and the lessee companies, the right of the people to insist upon the running of a separate passenger train is implied from the charter obligation to equip and operate the road. Inasmuch as a railroad company is bound to carry both passengers and freight, the obligation of the appellee required it to furnish all necessary rolling stock and equipment for the suitable and proper operation of the railroad as a carrier of passengers, no less than as a carrier of freight. It cannot be said that the carrier of passengers in a car attached to a freight train is a suitable and proper operation of a railroad, so far as the carriage of passengers is concerned. The transportation of passengers on a freight train, or on a mixed train, is subordinate to the transportation of freight,-a mere incident to the business of carry- \n\n[216 U.S. 262, 281]\n\u00a0\n ing freight. To furnish such cars as are necessary for the suitable and proper carriage of passengers involves the necessity of adopting that mode of carrying passengers which is best adapted to secure their safety and convenience. This can be accomplished better by operating a separate passenger train than by operating a mixed train; that is to say, the duty of furnishing all necessary rolling stock and equipment for the suitable and proper operation of a railroad carrying passengers involves and implies the duty of furnishing a train which shall be run for the purpose of transporting passengers only, and not freight and passengers together.'\n\n Even, however, if it be conceded that the reasoning of the case just cited may not be universally applicable, because conditions might exist which, in some cases, might cause a different rule to apply, there is no room for such view in this case. This is so because, as was pointed out by the court below, the statutes of Kansas in force at the time the branch road was incorporated lend cogency to the conclusion that the effect of the acceptance of the charter was to bring the road under the obligation of furnishing passenger service,-a duty which could not be escaped by giving the service only on a mixed train, and thus subjecting passengers to the resulting dangers and inconveniences. Nor do we think there is any force in the argument elaborately pressed, that chapter 274, Kansas Laws of 1907, as amended by chapter 190, Laws of 1909 (which is in the margin), shows that the law \n Part of Chapter 274, Kansas Laws of 1907, as Amended by Chapter 190, Laws of 1909\n\n\n That all freight trains to which caboose is attached shall be obliged to transport, upon the same terms and conditions as passenger trains, all passengers who desire to travel thereon, and who are above the age of fifteen years, and who, if under fifteen years, are accompanied by a parent or guardian, or other competent person, but no freight train shall be required to stop to receive or discharge any passenger at any other point other than where such freight train may stop; nor shall it be necessary to stop the caboose of such trains at the depot to receive and discharge passengers; provided, that on such trains the railroad companies shall only be liable for their gross negligence; and provided further, that this act shall not be construed to apply to freight trains on main lines, the most of which trains shall be composed of cars loaded with live stock.\n Any officer or employee of such railroad company, who shall violate any of the provisions or conditions of  1 of this act, shall, upon conviction, be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be fined in any sum not less than ten nor more than one hundred dollars, or by imprisonment in the county jail for not less than five nor more than thirty days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. \n\n[216 U.S. 262, 282]\n\u00a0\n of Kansas proceeds on the conception that there is no distinction between a passenger train service and the carriage of passengers on a mixed or freight train. On the contrary, we think the statute referred to sustains the opposite inference, since it recognizes that persons who avail of the right conferred to travel in the caboose of a freight train are not entitled to ordinary passenger facilities or to the legal protection ordinarily surrounding passenger traffic. The first, because the statute provides that persons must get on or off the caboose where the company finds it convenient to place that car, and second, because persons riding in the caboose are afforded redress for injury only where the company is guilty of gross negligence.\n The contention that the order is unreasonable in and of itself, irrespective of whether there is profit in the operation of the train service which the order commands to be operated, because it directs the movement of the passenger train directed to be run to the state line, where, it is said, there are no terminal facilities, and no occasion for the termination of the transit, is disposed of by the considerations previously stated. We say this because its unsoundness is demonstrated by the reasoning which has led us to conclude that there was no merit in the contention that the fact of pecuniary loss was of itself alone adequate to show the unreasonableness of the order. This follows from the principle which we have previously expounded, to the effect that the criterion to apply in a case like this is the nature and character of the duty ordered, \n\n[216 U.S. 262, 283]\n\u00a0\n and not the mere burden which may result from its performance.\n\n 2. \nThat the order was void because it operates a direct burden upon interstate commerce.\n To support this proposition it is urged that the charter of the Interstate Railroad Company, the builder of the branch, provided for a road not only in Kansas, but to extend into Texas and Missouri, and therefore for an interstate railroad. This being its character, the argument proceeds to assert that the regulation of traffic on the road, whatever be the nature of the traffic, was interstate commerce, and beyond the control of the state of Kansas. But this simply confounds the distinction between state control over local traffic and Federal control over interstate traffic. To sustain the proposition would require it to be held that the local traffic of the road was free from all governmental regulation, unless, at the same time, it were held that the incorporation of the road had operated to extend the powers of the government of the United States to subjects which could not come within the authority of that government consistently with the Constitution of the United States. Manifestly, the mere fact that the charter of the road contemplated that it should be projected into several states did not change the nature and character of our constitutional system, and therefore did not destroy the power of Kansas over its domestic commerce, or operate to bring under the sway of the United States matters of local concern, and of course could not project the authority of Kansas beyond its own jurisdiction. The charter therefore left the road for which it provided subject, as to its purely local or state business, to the authority of the respective states into which it was contemplated the road should go, and submitted the road as an entirety, so far as its interstate commerce business was concerned, to the controlling power conferred by the Constitution upon the government of the United States.\n The contention that a burden was imposed upon interstate \n\n[216 U.S. 262, 284]\n\u00a0\n commerce by causing the train to stop at the state line, where there were no terminal facilities, but in a disguised from reiterates the complaint which we have already disposed of, that the order, because of the direction to stop at the state line, was so arbitrary and unreasonable as to be void. The order cannot be said to be an unreasonable exertion of authority, because the power manifested was made operative to the limit of the right to do so. Besides, the proposition erroneously assumes that the effect of the order is to direct the stoppage at the state line of an interstate train, when, in fact, the order does not deal with an interstate train, or put any burden upon such train, but simply requires the operating within the state of a local train, the duty to operate which arises from a charter obligation. It is said that, as the state line may be but a mere cornfield, and great expense must result to the railway from establishing necessary terminal facilities in such a place, it must follow that the road, in order to avoid the useless expense, must operate the passenger service directed by the order, not only to the state line, but 20 miles beyond, to Butler, on the Joplin line, where terminal facilities exist. From these assumptions, it is insisted, that the order must be construed according to its necessary effect, and therefore must be treated as imposing a direct burden upon interstate commerce by compelling the operation of the passenger train, not only within the state of Kansas, but beyond its borders. But under the hypothesis upon which the contention rests, the operation of the train to Butler would be at the mere election of the corporation, and, besides, even if the performance of the duty of furnishing adequate local facilities in some respects affected interstate commerce, it does not necessarily result that thereby a direct burden on interstate commerce would be imposed.

The first is brought by the state to recover a fine of $500 imposed by the law for failure to obey its command; the second is brought at the relation of the party concerned, to compel obedience to the same command by mandamus. The statute in question provides that 'every railroad company or corporation operating a railroad in the state of Nebraska shall afford equal facilities to all persons or associations who desire to erect or operate, or who are engaged in operating, grain elevators, or in handling or shipping grain at or contiguous to any station of its road, and where an application has been made in writing for a location or site for the building or construction of an elevator or elevators on the railroad right of way, and the same not having been granted within a limit of sixty days, the said railroad company to whom application has been made shall erect, equip, and maintain a side track or switch of suitable length to approach as near as 4 feet of the outer edge of their right of way when necessary, and in all cases to approach as near as necessary to approach an elevator that may be erected by the applicant or applicants, adjacent to their right of way, for the purpose of loading grain into cars from said elevator, and for handling and shipping grain to all persons or associations so erecting or operating such elevators, or handling and shipping grain, without favoritism or discrimination in any respect whatever. Provided, however, that any elevator hereafter constructed, in order to receive the benefits of this act, must have a capacity \n\n[217 U.S. 196, 205]\n\u00a0\n of not less than 15,000 bushels.' Then follows a section making railroads liable for damages in case of wilful violation of the act (which contains other provisions beside the above), and imposes the above-mentioned fine for each offense. Session Laws of 1905, chap. 105,  1, 6; 2 Cobbey's Supp.  10,007, p. 410.\n Under this act the Manley Co-operative Grain Association, a corporation, applied in writing for a site for an elevator on the right of way of the plaintiff in error, in Manley, Nebraska, but the application was refused. Then notice was sent that the corporation intended to build near the end of a side track at the railroad station at Manley, and would expect an extension of the side track. The railroad company replied that it would give no trackage privilege. The elevator was built and a demand was made for a side track, repeating a previous offer to bear a fair share of the expense of the extension. This also was refused, and thereupon the first-mentioned suit was brought for the penalty imposed by the act. The other suit is a petition for mandamus at the relation of the Farmers' Elevator Company of Strausville, Nebraska, another elevator corporation, and the facts are so like the foregoing that they do not need special statement. In both cases the railroad company set up that the statute was an attempt to regulate commerce among the states, and also was void under the 14th Amendment. After trials, the fine was imposed and the peremptory writ of mandamus was ordered, and both judgments were affirmed by the supreme court of the state. 81 Neb. 15, 174, 115 N. W. 614, 757.\n It will have been noticed that there is no provision in the statute for compensation to the railroad for its outlay in building and maintaining the side tracks required. In the present cases, the initial cost is said to be $450 in one and $1,732 in the other, and to require the company to incur this expense unquestionably does take its property, whatever may be the speculations as to the ultimate return for the outlay. Woodward v. Central Vermont Ry. Co. 180 Mass. 599, \n\n[217 U.S. 196, 206]\n\u00a0\n 602, 603, 62 N. E. 1051. Moreover, a part of the company's roadbed is appropriated mainly to a special use, even if it be supposed that the side track would be available incidentally for other things than to run cars to and from the elevator. Now it is true that railroads can be required to fulfil the purposes for which they are chartered and to do what is reasonably necessary to serve the public in the way in which they undertake to serve it, without compensation for the performance of some part of their duties that does not pay. Missouri P. R. Co. v. Kansas, Feb. 21, 1910. [\n216 U.S. 262\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 330.] It also is true that the states have power to modify and cut down property rights to a certain limited extent without compensation, for public purposes, as a necessary incident of government,-the power commonly called the police power. But railroads, after all, are property protected by the Constitution, and there are constitutional limits to what can be required of their owners under either the police power or any other ostensible justification for taking such property away.\n Thus, it is at least open to question whether a railroad company could be required to deliver cattle at another than its own stock yard at the end of the transit, or cars elsewhere than at its own terminus, without extra charge, if it furnished reasonable accommodations. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Central Stock Yards Co. \n212 \nU.S. 132, 144\n, 53 S. L. ed. 441, 446, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 246; Central Stock Yards Co. v. Louisville & N. R. Co. \n192 \nU.S. 568, 570\n, 48 S. L. ed. 565, 569, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 339; Covington Stock Yard Co. v. Keith, \n139 U.S. 128\n, 35 L. ed. 73, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 469. So far as we see, a grain elevator stands in no stronger position than a stock yard. If, as intimated, the elevators with which the Missouri Pacific connects charge too much and wrong the farmers, there may be other remedies; but manifestly the apprehenson expressed by the supreme court of Nebraska, that the company, unless checked, will have power to establish a monopoly, is not to be met merely by building another elevator,- the physical limits of that kind of competition are too easily reached. But if we assume that circumstances might make it reasonable to compel a railroad to deliver and receive \n\n[217 U.S. 196, 207]\n\u00a0\n grain elsewhere than at its own elevators, or those that it had made its own by contract, the circumstances must be exceptional when it would be constitutional to throw the extra charge of reduplicating already physically adequate accommodations upon the road.\n This statute has no reference to special circumstances. It is universal in terms. If we were to take it literally, it makes the demand of the elevator company conclusive, without regard to special needs, and, possibly, without regard to place. It is true that in the first of the present cases the supreme court of Nebraska discussed the circumstances, and expressed the opinion that the demand was reasonable, and that building the side track would not cast an undue burden upon the road; and, in the second, it somewhat less definitely indicated a similar opinion. So it may be, although it hardly seems possible, that the sweeping words of the statute would be construed as, by implication, confining their requirements to reasonable demands. On the face of it, the statute seems to require the railroad to pay for side tracks, whether reasonable or not,- or, if another form of expression be preferred, to declare that a demand for a side track to an elevator anywhere is reasonable, and that the railroads must pay. Clearly, no such obligation is incident to their public duty, and to impose it goes beyond the limit of the police power.\n But if the statute is to be stretched, or rather shrunk, to such demands as ultimately may be held reasonable by the state court, still it requires too much. Why should the railroads pay for what, after all, are private connections? We see no reason. And, moreover, even on this strained construction, they refrain from paying at the peril of a fine, if they turn out wrong in their guess that, in the particular case, the court will hold the demand not authorized by the act. If the statute makes the mere demand conclusive, it plainly cannot be upheld. If it requires a side track only when the demand is reasonable, then the railroad ought, at least, to be allowed a hearing in advance to decide whether the demand is within the \n\n[217 U.S. 196, 208]\n\u00a0\n act. Sometimes when summary action is necessary, the property owner's rights are preserved by leaving all questions open in a subsequent suit. North American Cold Storage Co. v. Chicago, \n211 U.S. 306\n, 53 L. ed. 195, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 101. But in such cases the risk is thrown on the destroyer of property. In this case, there is no emergency, yet, at the best, the owner of the property, if it has any remedy at all, acts at its risk, not merely of being compelled to pay both the expense of building and the costs of suit, but also of incurring a fine of at least $500 for its offense in awaiting the result of a hearing. See Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. v. Minnesota, \n134 U.S. 418\n, 33 L. ed. 970, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 209, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 462, 702. An earlier statute authorizing the state board of transportation, after hearing, to require the railroad to permit the erection of an elevator upon its roadbed, already has been held bad. Missouri P. R. Co. v. Nebraska, \n164 U.S. 403\n, 41 L. ed. 489, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 130. See also Hartford F. Ins. Co. v. Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. \n175 \nU.S. 91, 99\n, 44 S. L. ed. 84, 88, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 33. We are of opinion that this statute is unconstitutional in its application to the present cases, because it does not provide indemnity for what it requires. We leave other questions on one side, and do not intend by anything that we have said to prejudice a later amendment providing for a preliminary hearing and compensation, which is said to have been passed in 1907.

There was a judgment for the plaintiff in a circuit court of the state of Mississippi, which was affirmed by the supreme court of the state.\n The Federal questions asserted, which are supposed to give this court jurisdiction to review the judgment of the supreme court of the state, arise out of the alleged repugnancy of  3559 and 1985 of the Mississippi Code to that clause of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution which guarantees to every person the equal protection of the laws. \n\n[219 U.S. 35, 40]\n\u00a0\n Section 3559 of the Mississippi Code of 1892, being a rescript of  193 of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890, abrogates, substantially, the common-law fellow-servant rule as to 'every employee of a railroad corporation.' It is urged that this legislation, applicable only to employees of a railroad company, is arbitrary, and a denial of the equal protection of law, unless it be limited in its effect to employees imperiled by the hazardous business of operating railroad trains or engines, and that the Mississippi supreme court had, in prior cases, so defined and construed this legislation. Ballard v. Mississippi Cotton Oil Co. 81 Miss. 532, 62 L.R.A. 407, 95 Am. St. Rep. 476, 34 So. 533; Bradford Constr. Co. v. Heflin, 88 Miss. 314, 12 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1040, 42 So. 174, 8 A . & E. Ann. Cas. 1077\n\n\n It is now contended that the provision has been construed in the present case as applicable to an employee not subject to any danger or peril peculiar to the operation of railway trains, and that therefore the reason for such special classification fails, and the provision, so construed and applied, is invalid as a denial of the equal protection of the law.\n This contention, shortly stated, comes to this: that although a classification of railway employees may be justified from general considerations based upon the hazardous character of the occupation, such classification becomes arbitrary and a denial of the equal protection of the law the moment it is found to embrace employees not exposed to hazards peculiar to railway operation.\n But this court has never so construed the limitation imposed by the 14th Amendment upon the power of the state to legislate with reference to particular employments as to render ineffectual a general classification resting upon obvious principles of public policy, because it may happen that the classification includes persons not subject to a uniform degree of danger. The insistence, therefore, that legislation in respect of railway employees generally is repugnant to the clause of the Constitution \n\n[219 U.S. 35, 41]\n\u00a0\n guaranteeing the equal protection of the law, merely because it is not limited to those engaged in the actual operation of trains, is without merit.\n The intestate of the defendant in error was not engaged in the actual operation of trains. But he was nevertheless engaged in a service which subjected him to dangers from the operation of trains, and brought him plainly within the general legislative purpose. The case in hand illustrates the fact that such employees, though not directly engaged in the management of trains, are nevertheless within the general line of hazard inherent in the railway business. The deceased was the foreman of a section crew. His business was to keep the track in repair. He stood by the side of the track to let a train pass by; a derailment occurred, and a car fell upon him and crushed out his life.\n In the late case of Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Melton, \n218 U.S. 36\n, 54 L. ed. 921, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 676, an Indiana fellow-servant act was held applicable to a member of a railway construction crew who was injured while engaged in the construction of a coal tipple alongside of the railway track. This whole matter of classification was there considered. Nothing more need be said upon the subject, for the case upon this point is fully covered by the decision referred to.\n The next error arises upon the constitutionality of  1985 of the Mississippi Code of 1906. That section reads as follows:\n'Injury to persons or property by railroads prima facie evidence of want of skill, etc.-In all actions against railroad companies for damages done to persons or property, proof of injury inflicted by the running of the locomotives or cars of such company shall be prima facie evidence of the want of reasonable skill and care on the part of the servants of the company in reference to such injury. This section shall also apply to passengers and employees of railroad companies.'\n\n The objection made to this statute is that the railroad \n\n[219 U.S. 35, 42]\n\u00a0\n companies are thereby put into a class to themselves, and deprived of the benefit of the general rule of law which places upon one who sues in tort the burden of not only proving an injury, but also that the injury was the consequence of some negligence in respect of a duty owed to the plaintiff.\n It is to be primarily observed that the statute is not made applicable to all actions against such companies. Its operation is plainly limited, first, to injuries sustained by passengers or employees of such companies; second, to injuries arising from the actual operation of railway trains or engines; and third, the effect of evidence showing an injury due to the operation of trains or engines is only 'prima facie evidence of the want of reasonable skill and care on the part of the servants of the company in reference to such injury.'\n The law of evidence is full of presumptions either of fact or law. The former are, of course, disputable, and the strength of any inference of one fact from proof of another depends upon the generality of the experience upon which it is founded. For a discussion of some common-law aspects of the subject, see Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co. v. South Fork Coal Co. 1 L.R.A.(N.S.) 533, 71 C. C. A. 316, 139 Fed. 528 et seq.\n Legislation providing that proof of one fact shall constitute prima facie evidence of the main fact in issue is but to enact a rule of evidence, and quite within the general power of government. Statutes, national and state, dealing with such methods of proof in both civil and criminal cases, abound, and the decisions upholding them are numerous. A few of the leading ones are Adams v. New York, \n192 U.S. 585\n, 48 L. ed. 575, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 372; People v. Cannon, 139 N. Y. 32, 36 Am. St. Rep. 668, 34 N. E. 759; Horne v. Memphis & O. R. Co. 1 Coldw. 72; Meadowcroft v. People, 163 Ill. 56, 35 L.R.A. 176, 54 Am. St. Rep. 447, 45 N. E. 303; Com. v. Williams, 6 Gray, 1; State v. Thomas, 144 Ala. 77, 2 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1011, 113 Am. St. Rep. 17, 40 So. 271, 6 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 744.\n We are not impressed with the argument that the supreme court of Mississippi, in construing the act, has declared \n\n[219 U.S. 35, 43]\n\u00a0\n that the effect of the statute is to create a presumption of liability, giving to it, thereby, an effect in excess of a mere temporary inference of fact. The statutory effect of the rule is to provide that evidence of an injury arising from the actual operation of trains shall create an inference of negligence, which is the main fact in issue. The only legal effect of this inference is to cast upon the railroad company the duty of producing some evidence to the contrary. When that is done the inference is at an end, and the question of negligence is one for the jury, upon all of the evidence. In default of such evidence, the defendant, in a civil case, must lose, for the prima facie case is enough as matter of law.\n The statute does not, therefore, deny the equal protection of the law, or otherwise fail in due process of law, because it creates a presumption of liability, since its operation is only to supply an inference of liability in the absence of other evidence contradicting such inference.\n That a legislative presumption of one fact from evidence of another may not constitute a denial of due process of law or a denial of the equal protection of the law, it is only essential that there shall be some rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed, and that the inference of one fact from proof of another shall not be so unreasonable as to be a purely arbitrary mandate. So, also, it must not, under guise of regulating the presentation of evidence, operate to preclude the party from the right to present his defense to the main fact thus presumed.\n If a legislative provision not unreasonable in itself, prescribing a rule of evidence, in either criminal or civil cases, does not shut out from the party affected a reasonable opportunity to submit to the jury in his defense all of the facts bearing upon the issue, there is no ground for holding that due process of law has been denied him.\n Tested by these principles, the statute as construed and \n\n[219 U.S. 35, 44]\n\u00a0\n applied by the Mississippi court in this case is unobjectionable. It is not an unreasonable inference that a derailment of railway cars is due to some negligence, either in construction or maintenance of the track or trains, or some carelessness in operation.\n From the foregoing considerations it must be obvious that the application of the act to injuries resulting from 'the running of locomotives and cars' is not an arbitrary classification, but one resting upon considerations of public policy, arising out of the character of the business.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","117":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMOFFITT v. KELLY(1910)\nNo. 37\nArgued: November 4, 1910Decided: November 28, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 400, 401]\n\u00a0\n James Moffitt was married in California in the year 1863, and there resided with his wife until his death, on October 25, 1906. He left a large amount of property, all of which formed part of the community which existed between himself and his wife. By a will, duly admitted to probate, Moffitt disposed of all his estate to his wife and children in the same proportions as if he had died intestate.\n The probate court held that 'the interest of the widow in the community property of herself and her deceased husband' was subject to be taxed under a law of California of 1905, which taxed all property passing by will or in case of intestacy from any person who may die seised or possessed of the same. A tax of $26,684.57 was thereupon assessed as against Mrs. Moffitt's one half interest in the estate, and an order was entered directing payment of the tax by the executors. An appeal was taken to the supreme court of California. The single \n\n[218 U.S. 400, 402]\n\u00a0\n question presented by the appeal, as stated in the opinion of the supreme court, was 'whether the surviving wife's share of the community property is subject to this inheritance tax.' The question was answered in the affirmative. In an opinion denying an application for a rehearing, the court also adversely disposed of the contention that the enforcement of the tax would violate the contract clause or the equal protection and due process clauses of the Constitution of the United States. 153 Cal. 359, 20 L.R.A. (N.S.) 207, 95 Pac. 653, 1025. The case was then brought to this court.\n Mr. Warren Olney for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Robert A. Waring, U. S. Webb, and Snook & Church for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice White:\n\n Mr. Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n While the plaintiffs in error rely on both the contract clause and the equal protection clause of the Constitution, the latter contention is in substance but an incident, and the former is the fundamental proposition counted on to procure a reversal. We come, however, separately to consider the two contentions.\n\n 1. \nThe alleged violation of the contract clause.-Considered merely subjectively, the contention is that the rights vested in the wife as a partner in the community existing by virtue of the constitution and laws of the state of California governing at the time of the marriage were contractual rights of such a character that they could not be essentially changed or modified by subsequent legislation without impairing the obligations of the contract, and thereby violating the Constitution of the United States. \n\n[218 U.S. 400, 403]\n\u00a0\n But even although this theoretical proposition be fully conceded, for the sake of the argument, it is apparent that it is here a mere abstraction, and is therefore irrelevant to the case to be decided. We say this because there is no assertion of the giving effect to any law enacted subsequent to the contracting of the marriage which purports to essentially modify the rights of the wife in and to the community, as those rights existed at the time the marriage was celebrated. This is so because the state law the enforcement of which it is asserted will impair the obligation of the contract is merely a law imposing a tax. It is evident, therefore, when the contention is concretely considered, it involves but a single proposition; that is, that the state of California could not, without violating the Constitution of the United States, impose a tax on the share of the wife in the community property on the occasion of the cessation by the death of the husband of his dominion and control over the common property, and the consequent complete vesting in enjoyment of such share in the wife. But, in every conceivable aspect, this proposition must rest upon one or both of two theories: either that the nature and character of the right or interest were such that the state could not tax it without violating the Constitution of the United States, or that, if it could be generically taxed without violating that instrument, for some particular reason the otherwise valid state power of taxation could not be exerted without violating the Constitution of the United States. The first conception is at once disposed of by saying that it is elementary that the Constitution of the United States does not, generally speaking, control the power of the states to select and classify subjects of taxation, and hence, even although the wife's right in the community property was a vested right which could not be impaired by subsequent legislation, it was nevertheless within the power of the state, without violating the Constitution of the \n\n[218 U.S. 400, 404]\n\u00a0\n United States, in selecting objects of taxation, to select the vesting in complete possession and enjoyment by wives of their shares in community property, consequent upon the death of their husbands, and the resulting cessation of their power to control the same and enjoy the fruits thereof. And this also disposes of the second conception, since, if the state had the power, so far as the Constitution of the United States was concerned, to select the vesting of such right to possession and enjoyment as a subject of taxation, clearly the mere fact that the wife had a pre existing right to the property created no exemption from taxation if the selection for taxation would be otherwise legal. It follows, therefore, that the mere statement of the contention demonstrates the mistaken conception upon which, in the nature of things, it rests.\n It is said, however, that the reasoning just stated, while it may be abstractly sound, is here inapplicable, because the thing complained of in this case is that the state of California has imposed an inheritance tax upon the share of the wife in the community, and thereby taxed her as an heir of her husband, when, if the laws existing at the time of the celebration of the marriage be properly construed, and be held to be contractual, she took her share of the property on her husband's death, not as an heir to property of which he was the owner, but by virtue of a right of ownership vested in her prior to the death of the husband, although the right to possess and enjoy such property was deferred, and arose only on his death. But, for the purpose of enforcing the Constitution of the United States, we are not concerned with the mere designation affixed to the tax which the court below upheld, or whether the thing or subject taxed may or may not have been mistakenly brought within the state taxing law. We say so because, in determining whether the imposition of the tax complained of violated the Constitution of the \n\n[218 U.S. 400, 405]\n\u00a0\n United States, we are solely confined to considering whether the state had the lawful power, without violating the Constitution of the United States, to levy a tax upon the subject or thing taxed. This being true, as it clearly results from what we have said that the vesting of the wife's right of possession and enjoyment, arising upon the death of her husband, was subject to be taxed by the state, so far as the Constitution of the United States was concerned, it follows that whether the tax imposed was designated or levied as an inheritance tax or any other is a matter with which we have no concern. To make this, if possible, clearer by an illustration, we say that our view just expressed as to the operation and effect of the Constitution of the United States upon the tax in question would not be in the slightest degree changed, although it were to be hypothetically conceded that, on an analysis of the Constitution and laws of California concerning the community between husband and wife, in force at the time of the marriage of the Moffitts, we should conclude that the nature and character of the rights of the wife in the community property, if correctly interpreted, were such that, on the death of the husband, the share coming to the wife would not be liable to taxation under a taxing law like the one under consideration. This would be the case, because, as there was state power to tax, so far as the Constitution of the United States was concerned, the question whether or not the wife's interest under the circumstances was correctly subjected to the tax was a purely state question, not involving any violation of the Constitution of the United States, and which therefore we have no right to review. The controlling effect of the reasoning which we have just stated was pointed out, and the mistaken conception upon which the contentions of the plaintiffs in error rest was indicated, in Castillo v. McConnico, \n168 \nU.S. 674, 683\n, 42 S. L. ed. 622, 625, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 229.\n\n 2. \nThe contention pressed in argument as to the equal \n\n[218 U.S. 400, 406]\n\u00a0\n protection of the law clause substantially denies the right of the state to impose any tax on the share of the wife in the community property, resulting from the termination of the community by the death of the husband, or in substance assumes that we have the right to review the action of the state court in deciding that the tax law which it enforced was applicable. We say this because the entire argument proceeds upon the contention that, as the share of the wife in the community property was a vested interest during the life of the husband, it could not, on the death of the husband, be taxed differently from any other property,-vis., according to value,-without violating the Constitution of California, and creating an inequality repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. But this merely rests upon the mistaken conception previously disposed of, since the nature and character of the right of the wife in the community for the purpose of taxation was peculiarly a local question, which we have no power to review.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","118":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMONONGAHELA BRIDGE v.

S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3545. \n\n[216 U.S. 177, 187]\n\u00a0\n The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and a motion in arrest of judgment was made upon various grounds, the principal one being that the section of the above act of 1899 was unconstitutional, null, and void. That motion was denied, and a motion for new trial having been overruled, the defendant was adjudged to pay to the United States a fine of $1,000 and the costs of prosecution. From that judgment the case comes directly to this court under the authority of the proviso in the above act.  18.\n It is essential to a clear understanding of the questions raised by the bridge company that we state certain facts disclosed by the record.\n The bridge company was incorporated under an act passed by the general assembly of Pennsylvania in 1830; and in 1833, by authority of that commonwealth, it constructed the bridge in question over the Monongahela river. The structure is known as the Brownsville bridge, between the towns of West Brownsville and Bridgeport. The charter of the company provided, among other things, that 'the erection of said bridge shall not obstruct the navigation of said river so as to endanger the passage of rafts, steamboats, or other water craft.' Pa. Laws, 1829-30, p. 105.\n On the 29th of April, 1903, the Secretary of War, Mr. Root, was petitioned by numerous companies and individuals to have an investigation made of the bridge 'as to its obstruction of navigation,' and if it was found to be an obstruction of that character, 'to have the means provided to compel it to be raised or equipped in such a way to relieve river people from the obstruction, making the height necessary to allow free navigation.' The petition proceeded: 'The coal in pools, one, two, three and four below Brownsville has been practically exhausted, and the Pittsburg district will, at no distant date, be forced to get its supply above Brownsville, in the fifth pool. The petitioners recognize how impossible it will be to build or improve lock No. 3 unless the elevation of the Brownsville bridge be made at once.' This petition was \n\n[216 U.S. 177, 188]\n\u00a0\n referred by the Chief of Engineers to Major Sibert of the Corps of Engineers, for investigation and report. The latter officer reported, amoung other facts, that '. . . 4. The height of this bridge is such that the average of the boats engaged in interstate commerce between the states referred to above [Pennsylvania and West Virginia] are prevented from passing under the bridge at a stage of water materially less than that which floods the walls of the locks of the Monongahela river. 5. A bridge that prevents the use of the locks owned by the government of the United States until the same are placed out of service by means of high water is, in the opinion of this office, an unreasonable obstruction to navigation . . . . 7. This bridge is an old, covered, wooden bridge, constructed some time between 1830 and 1840. 8. In the opinion of this office, this bridge is one that certainly requires action under  18, river and harbor act of March 3, 1899. 9. It is therefore respectfully recommended that it be proceeded against in the manner specified under the law referred to above, both on account of insufficient height and length of span, and that, in the notice for a hearing in the case of this bridge, the changes proposed be such as to give a least clearance 52 feet under a channel span of 400 feet wide; the length of side spans to be determined from the developments at the hearing. It is considered that one and one-half years is a reasonable time in which to make the necessary changes in this bridge.' The Chief of Engineers indorsed that report and recommended that the papers be returned to Major Sibert, with instructions to hold a public hearing, after due notice to interested parties, as required by the law and the orders of the War Department.\n Under date of May 23d, 1904, Major Sibert made a report to the Chief of Engineers, from which it appears that the parties interested were given a hearing, all parties being present. That report stated: '3. These hearings, as this office understands it, were held for the purpose of securing and forwarding such information as would enable the Secretary of War to decide whether or not there is good reason to believe that the \n\n[216 U.S. 177, 189]\n\u00a0\n bridge in question is an unreasonable obstruction to navigation. 4. Stripped of all unnecessary verbiage the question for determination is: Is there good reason to believe that a bridge that prevents the better class of towboats actually navigating the Monongahela river, the commerce of which stream is about 10,000,000 tons annually, from passing under it for 17.7 days per year, and prevents the packets actually navigating said stream from passing under it for 52.1 days per year, all as determined by the official records kept by the United States, an unreasonable obstruction to navigation? The above days are days that the boats in question cannot pass under the bridge, but can pass through the locks that the government of the United States has provided for their use. Would a railroad company consider that there was good reason to believe that its traffic was unreasonably obstructed by another highway if its passenger and express business were absolutely stopped for 52.1 days per year and its freight business so stopped for 17.7 days per year, when the same could be overcome at a reasonable cost to the obstructing highway, which latter highway was the last built? . . . This office is of the opinion that the following should constitute the grounds upon which a conclusion should be reached as to whether or not any particular bridge unreasonably obstructs navigation: 1st. Every bridge should be so constructed as to permit the passage under it or through it, with reasonable safety, of the average-sized boat actually navigating the stream, at all practical stages of water. 2d. Any bridge that does not permit the passage of such boat at such stages of water needlessly obstructs the use of the river highway, and exists under conditions that are not reasonable, since it is impracticable to raise or lower a stream, and it is always practicable to either build a bridge high enough and of sufficient width of span to allow the passage of such boats at such times as mentioned above, or to place a draw in the bridge. 3d. Where the topographical conditions are such that bridges can be made of such heights, without prohibitive cost, as to permit, at all navigable stages of \n\n[216 U.S. 177, 190]\n\u00a0\n water, the passage of boats best suited to the river commerce, it is for the best interest of both the land traffic and the river traffic that bridges be so constructed. . . . Based upon the foregoing, the essential features of which are the facts that towboat navigation with the better class of boats actually in use is prevented for 17.7 days of the year from passing under this bridge when the same could pass through the locks Congress has provided for such navigation, and that the packets actually navigating this stream are prevented from passing under this bridge at such time for 52.1 days in the year, and from the fact that Congress has specified in the two acts passed in the present year that a least clearance of 54 feet is needed for the navigation of this pool, whereas the bridge in question has only 40.2 feet, this office is of the opinion that there is good reason to believe that the bridge owned by the Monongahela Bridge Company, at Brownsville, Pennsylvania, is an unreasonable obstruction to navigation, and therefore respectfully recommends that the Monongahela Bridge Company (George W. Lenhart, president, Brownsville, Pennsylvania, be given notice to make the following changes in its bridge crossing the Monongahela river at Brownsville, Pennsylvania, on or before August 1, 1905, to wit: That the bridge be so altered as to give a channel span of not less than 390 feet in length between the face of the right abutment, as now located, and the center of the pier; and that the said channel span shall give a clearance height at the left, or pier, end, of not less than 52 feet, and at the right, or abutment, end of not less than 54 feet above the fourth pool of the Monongahela river. This will permit of the construction of the bridge in accordance with plan as shown in sheet 3, exhibit B, submitted by the bridge company.'\n The Chief of Engineers concurred in the views expressed and conclusions reached by Major Sibert, and recommended that notice be served accordingly.\n Subsequently, August 10th, 1904, the Secretary of War, Mr. Taft, issued the following official notice, addressed to the bridge company: \n\n[216 U.S. 177, 191]\n\u00a0\n 'Whereas, the Secretary of War has good reason to believe that the bridge of the Monongahela Bridge Company across the Monongahela river, at Bridge street, in the borough of Bridgeport, Pennsylvania, and commonly known as the Brownsville bridge, is an unreasonable obstruction to the free navigation of the said Monongahela river (which is one of the navigable water ways of the United States), on account of insufficient height and length of span; and whereas, the following alterations, which have been recommended by the Chief of Engineers, are required to render navigation under it reasonably free, easy, and unobstructed, to wit: so alter said bridge as to give a channel span of not less than 390 feet in length between the face of the right abutment, as now located, and the center of the pier; and that the said channel span shall give a clearance height of not less than 52 feet above the fourth pool of the Monongahela river; and whereas, to August 1, 1905, is a reasonable time in which to alter the said bridge, as described above: Now, therefore, in obedience to, and by virtue of,  18 of an act of Congress of the United States, entitled, 'An Act Making Appropriations for the Construction, Repair, and Preservation of Certain Public Works on Rivers and Harbors, and for Other Purposes,' approved March 3, 1899, I, William H. Taft, Secretary of War, do hereby notify the said Monongahela Bridge Company to alter the said bridge as described above, and prescribe that said alterations shall be made and completed on or before August 1, 1905.' This notice was duly served August 15th, 1904, on the bridge company, and the company failed to comply with the direction given by the Secretary of War.\n Thereupon the present information was filed, charging the bridge company with having wilfully failed, refused, and neglected to comply with the above order of the Secretary of War.\n In view of this statement, an extended examination of the authorities would seem to be unnecessary; for substantially \n\n[216 U.S. 177, 192]\n\u00a0\n all the material questions raised on this writ of error are, we think, concluded by former decisions cited in the margin. \n This court has heretofore held, upon full consideration and after an examination of the adjudged cases:\n\n 1. \nThat the 18th section of the river and harbor act of March 3d, 1899, could not reasonably be taken as a delegation of legislative and judicial power to an executive department of the government; that the statute did not, in any real, constitutional sense, delegate to the Secretary of War any power that must, under our system of government, be exclusively exercised either by the legislative or judicial branch of the government; that, under its paramount power to regulate commerce on and over the navigable waters of the United States, Congress could require that such waters be freed from unreasonable obstructions to navigation; that the statute in effect prescribed the general rule, applicable to all navigable waters, that free navigation should not be hampered by unreasonable obstructions arising from bridges of insufficient height, width of span, or other defects; that instead of exerting its power by direct legislation in each case of a bridge alleged to constitute an unreasonable obstruction to navigation, Congress charged the Secretary of War with the duty of ascertaining, in each case, upon notice to the parties concerned, whether the particular\n Union Bridge Co. v.

We are asked to consider whether the opinion in Union Bridge Co. v. United States, \n204 U.S. 364\n, 51 L. ed. 523, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 367,-the case upon which the government mainly relies,-should not be modified. We perceive no reason for so doing. We adhere to what was said in that case.\n It is urgently insisted that the defendant did not have such a hearing as it was entitled to have under the law on the question whether the bridge was in fact an unreasonable obstruction to navigation. This is a mistake. The bridge company had full notice of the action of the Engineer officer, who, under the order of the Secretary of War, made a tentative examination of the facts, and it appeared at the regular, final hearing before that officer, with liberty to contest the facts and introduce any evidence pertinent to the case. It does not appear that it offered any evidence that was rejected. It was not subjected to any mode of procedure that interfered in any degree with a full and fair disclosure of the material facts. The Engineer officer, after the hearing before him,- the bridge company being represented at the hearing,-found that the bridge was an unreasonable obstruction to navigation. He reported to the Secretary of War all the facts that were adduced before him, and which constituted the basis of his conclusion. And the decision of the Secretary was based on \n\n[216 U.S. 177, 195]\n\u00a0\n the facts so reported to him. That, it must be assumed on this record. It does not appear that the Secretary disregarded the facts, or that he acted in an arbitrary manner, or that he pursued any method not contemplated by Congress. It was not for the jury to weigh the evidence and determine, according to their judgment, as to what the necessities of navigation required, or whether the bridge was an unreasonable obstruction. The jury might have differed from the Secretary. That was immaterial; for Congress intended by its legislation to give the same force and effect to the decision of the Secretary of War that would have been accorded to direct action by it on the subject. It is for Congress, under the Constitution, to regulate the right of navigation by all appropriate means, to declare what is necessary to be done in order to free navigation from obstruction, and to prescribe the way in which the question of obstruction shall be determined. Its action in the premises cannot be revised or ignored by the courts or by juries, except that when it provides for an investigation of the facts, upon notice and after hearing, before final action is taken, the courts can see to it that executive officers conform their action to the mode prescribed by Congress. Learned counsel for the defendant suggests some extreme cases, showing how reckless and arbitrary might be the action of executive officers proceeding under an act of Congress, the enforcement of which affects the enjoyment or value of private property. It will be time enough to deal with such cases as and when they arise. Suffice it to say that the courts have rarely, if ever, felt themselves so restrained by technical rules that they could not find some remedy, consistant with the law, for acts, whether done by government or by individual persons, that violated natural justice or were hostile to the fundamental principles devised for the protection of the essential rights of property.\n We find no error of law in the record, and the judgment must be affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice Brewer dissents. \n\n\n\n","119":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMONTEZUMA CANAL CO. v. SMITHVILLE CANAL CO.(1910)\nNo. 505\nArgued: Decided: November 28, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 371, 372]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John J. Hawkins, Thomas Armstrong, Jr., and C. L. Rawlins for appellant on original submission.\n Mr. Thomas Armstrong, Jr., for appellant on oral argument.\n Mr. Walter Bennett for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice White, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The decree of the supreme court of the territory of Arizona (11 Ariz. 99, 89 Pac. 512), which is appealed from, affirmed a decree of a district court of the territory, determining the rights of appropriators within the county of Graham to the waters of the Gila river.\n In the brief of counsel for the appellee it is suggested that the appeal should be dismissed because the matter in dispute does not exceed the sum of $5,000, and because the appellant has no substantial financial interest in the cause. We think, however, that the record sufficiently shows that the jurisdictional amount is involved, and that the appellant has such interest as entitles it to prosecute the appeal. We shall, therefore, consider the case upon the merits.\n The issues below were made up by an amended complaint, in which the Smithville Canal Company and the Central Canal Company and the water users under these canals were plaintiffs, and the Montezuma Canal Company and other canal companies, as also the water users under such canals, were defendants. The general nature of the controversy is indicated by the character of the \n\n[218 U.S. 371, 373]\n\u00a0\n decree entered in the district court, just stated. Incorporated in the answer of the Montezuma Canal Company and its water users were averments in the nature of a cross bill against the San Jose Irrigating Company and the San Jose Extension Canal Company and various other defendants, setting up a former judgment recovered in the district court of Graham county by the Montezuma Canal Company, as settling between the Montezuma Company and said codefendants rights in the water of the river. The San Jose Irrigating Company, it is to be remarked, was incorporated in 1892, and in 1904 the San Jose Extension Canal Company was incorporated, and undertook the management, repair, and operation of a part of the canal previously under the control of the San Jose Irrigating Company.\n The trial court made findings of fact and stated conclusion of law thereon, but certified no rulings in respect to the admission or rejection of evidence. The supreme court of the territory made no express findings of fact, but entered a general judgment of affirmance, manifestly based upon the correctness of the findings of the trial court. Under such circumstances the findings of the district court furnish a sufficient statement of the facts for the purposes of this appeal. Stringfellow v. Cain, \n99 U.S. 610\n, 25 L. ed. 421. The question for decision, therefore, is whether such findings are sufficient to support the decree. Ibid.\n We are concerned, however, only with the error assigned by the Montezuma Canal Company, as that company alone appealed to the supreme court of the territory, and it is the only party to the record now seeking a reversal of the judgment of affirmance entered by the appellate tribunal.\n The contentions urged by the Montezuma company are twofold: First, that due effect was not given to the prior judgment which it pleaded, and which determined its rights in the water of the Gila river as against the \n\n[218 U.S. 371, 374]\n\u00a0\n appropriators of waters from that river at points above the head of its canal; and, second, that error was committed in the appointment of a so- called water commissioner, charged with the duty of distributing the water among the different canals, according to the adjudged priorities. There being, then, no controversy in respect to the rights to water decreed in favor of the canals situated below the head of the Montezuma Canal Company, the findings in respect to those canals need not be particularly referred to.\n Before stating the contents of the decree which was entered in the trial court, we make a condensed statement of the facts embodied in the findings upon which the decree was based, in order to a comprehension of the controversey arising for determination.\n There are 23,728 acres of land in the county of Graham, territory of Arizona, which are irrigated by water diverted from the Gila river by means of twenty-five ditches or canals. These canals extend from a point in section 29, township 6 south, range 28 east, at first in a southwestwardly and then in a northwestwardly direction, to a point 41 miles distant at the northeast corner of the southeast quarter of section 35, township 4 south, range 23 east. Commencing with the head of this irrigation system the canals in question, in their order as respects the flow of the waters of the river and the number of acres irrigated by each canal, are as follows: Brown, 100 acres; Sanchez, 400 acres; Mejia, 320 acres; Fourness, 260 acres; San Jose, 3,000 acres; Michelena, 450 acres; Montezuma, 3,750 acres; Union, 2,900 acres; Sunflower, 400 acres; Graham, 962 acres; Central, 2,675 acres; Oregon, 1,100 acres; Smithville, 1,760 acres; Bryce, 515 acres; Dodge, 450 acres; Nevada, 800 acres; Curtis, 800 acres; Kempton, 850 acres; Reid, 100 acres; Ft. Thomas, 960 acres; Thompson, 240 acres; Military, 400 acres; Saline, 46 acres; Zeckendorf, 50 acres. The Montezuma canal was first constructed. The six canals situated above the head of that canal were constructed as follows: The San Jose and the Michelena in 1874, the Mejia in 1877, the Sanchez in 1883, the Fourness in 1891, and the Brown in 1896. The first canal below the Montezuma is called the Union, and \n\n[218 U.S. 371, 375]\n\u00a0\n was constructed in 1879. Among other things it was found that the Union canal 'carries water for 100 acres that were reclaimed in 1874, and irrigated by water that was then diverted from the river and carried to the land by the Montezuma canal. . . .'\n Embodied in the 'conclusions of law' made by the court is a statement that William Ellsworth and other named individuals 'were the persons or successors in interest to the persons who, in 1875, appropriated water for and applied it to the first 300 acres of land' in certain named sections, 'and who are diverting and carrying water thereto through the San Jose cannal. . . .'\n One half of a miner's inch per acre was found to be necessary for the irrigation of the lands served by the various canals. It was further found that a surface flow of 7,500 miner's inches in the Gila river at the head of the irrigation system furnished more water than is needed to irrigate the entire acreage shown by the evidence to have been in cultivation in the year 1904; and it was also found that 'there is a greater flow than this amount during the larger part of the year, so that the amount of water available for irrigation purposes is more than one half of a miner's inch per acre for a greater length of time each year than the time during which the supply is less than one-half inch per acre.'\n Substantially all of the canals referred to are now controlled by incorporated canal companies, respecting whom the trial court found as follows:\n'The different incorporated canal companies, who are parties plaintiff and defendant herein, are duly and regularly incorporated under the laws of this territory, and \n\n[218 U.S. 371, 376]\n\u00a0\n own and control the several canals, as alleged in the pleadings herein, which canals were originally operated by unincorporated partnerships or societies, and the present corporations, parties hereto, are the successors to the unincorporated owners of the several canals, and are in every instance carrying the water for the use of the landowners or the successors in interest of the landowners who were the original appropriators of the water carried therein for irrigation purposes. None of the parties hereto have been engaged or are now engaged in carrying water for hire, and none of the incorporated companies, parties hereto, have appropriated any water in their corporate capacity. None of the several parties hereto who are landowners, appropriators of water, or who are receiving water for irrigation from the different incorporated companies or through the several canals owned by the parties hereto, have ever maintained their right to their several priorities as against the coowners of land or cousers of water in their respective canals, but the individual landowners and appropriators of water that is furnished under the management of each of the several ditches or canals, herein referred to have surrendered to their cousers in that canal their priority, and the water that is taken from the river for the use of the land under the several canals has been, by the consent of the different landowners under each canal, delivered to the different tracts of land in accordance with the extent of the interest in the ditch or canal of each landowner, regardless of the acreage cultivated by the said landowner, and regardless of the date when the said acreage was placed under cultivation.'\n\n Findings 11 and 12 are as follows:\n'11. On the 17th day of February, 1897, a decree was entered in this court in action No. 505, wherein the Montezuma Canal Company was plaintiff, the San Jose Irrigating Company, a corporation, Chiricahua Cattle Company, a corporation, Pedro Michelena and others, were \n\n[218 U.S. 371, 377]\n\u00a0\n defendants, wherein it was judged and decreed that the plaintiff had the right and was entitled to have flow into the Montezuma canal continuously from the Gila river at all times during the dry season of the year when water is low and scarce in said river, 1,000 miner's inches of water, and was entitled to have flow from the said river into said canal 2,000 miner's inches of water at times of wet seasons of the year, when water is high and plentiful therein, as against each and all of the defendants in said action, and in which it was ordered, adjudged, and decreed that said defendants above named, and all persons claiming under them and each of them, be perpetually restrained and enjoined from diverting or taking water from the said river above the head of the plaintiff's said canal, or in any manner obstructing the flow of water in the said river, so as to prevent the said water from flowing in the bed of said river down the same, and therefrom into plaintiff's canal to the full extent of a thousand inches during each and every dry season of the year when water is low and scarce, and also from in any manner preventing the said 2,000 miner's inches of water from flowing down the channel or bed of said river, and from flowing therefrom into the plaintiff's said canal during the wet seasons of the year when water is plentiful in said river.\n\n'12. On the 18th day of September, 1900, a complaint was filed in the district court of the second judicial district, in and for Graham County, territory of Arizona, in action No. 797, in which the San Jose Irrigating Company was plaintiff and E. L. Tidwell et al. were defendants, and on March 31, 1901, a stipulation was filed in the said cause No. 797, by and between the San Jose Irrigating Company and its stockholders, on the one hand, and Frank Dysart, Pedro Michelena, and Frank McLean, using water on lands owned by them, through the Michelena ditch, on the other hand, in which it was stipulated and agreed that the grantors and predecessors \n\n[218 U.S. 371, 378]\n\u00a0\n in interest of both parties made their original appropriation of the water of the Gila river at the same date or time, and that neither should, as against the other, claim or attempt to prove any prior or superior right to any of the water of the said Gila river by reason of having been prior in date, or time of making the original appropriation of the water of said Gila river; and on the 29th of June, 1901, a decree was entered in the said district court in the said action No. 797, in which it was found and decreed by the court that the first right to diversion, use, and enjoyment of the water in the Gila river, after the prior appropriation of 1,000 miner's inches theretofore decreed to the Montezuma Canal Company, was in the plaintiff, the San Jose Irrigating Company, its shareholders and stockholders, to the extent of a perpetual flow of 1,500 miner's inches, and in the defendants Frank Dysart, Alexander McLean, and Pedro Michelena, using water through the Michelena ditch, to the extent of a perpetual flow of 500 miner's inches of water in the Gila river.\n\n'That neither the plaintiff nor defendants, users of water under the Michelena ditch, have priority of right over the other to the use of the water of the said Gila river, but they shall have equal right thereto, and shall prorate the flow of water in the Gila river in the above proportions in case of scarcity of water therein, or in case of a failure of a full flow of water in said river from any cause sufficient to supply each with the quantity herein decreed to be the quantity to which each is entitled in point of time.'\n\n We excerpt in full in the margin the decree which was\n Be it remembered, that on the 28th day of April, 1905, the same being a regular judicial day of the April term of the said district court, this cause came on regularly for trial before the court without a jury, a jury having been expressly waived by the parties in open court. The parties appeared in person and by their respective attorneys, and \n\n[218 U.S. 371, 379]\n\u00a0\n entered by the trial court, omitting the tabular statement as to the amounts of water to which the water users under the several canals were entitled when the surface flow at the head of the irrigating system was 300, 400, 500, \n\n[218 U.S. 371, 380]\n\u00a0\n 750, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, 2,500, 3,000, 3,500, 4,000, 4,500, 5,000, 5,500, 6,000, 6,500, 7,000, and 7,500 inches, respectively.\n The question arises whether due effect was given to \n\n[218 U.S. 371, 381]\n\u00a0\n the decree entered in the action No. 505 on February 17, 1897, in favor of the Montezuma Canal Company, referred to in finding No. 11; in other words, Is the decree as entered warranted by the facts as found? \n\n[218 U.S. 371, 382]\n\u00a0\n We premise that the Montezuma Canal Company and the defendant, individuals and canal companies in action No. 505, whether viewed as appropriators of water or as mere carriers for others, sufficiently represented the users of the waters of the respective canals to cause such water users to be bound by the judgment. Thorpe v. Tenem Ditch Co. 1 Wash. 566, 20 Pac. 588; Arroyo Ditch & Water Co. v. Baldwin, 155 Cal. 280, 100 Pac. 874.\n The portions of the tabular statement annexed to the decree with which we are now concerned relate to the distribution of water adjudged as between the Montezuma canal and the canals above the head of the Montezuma. Although, as against the appropriators of water served by the San Jose canal and the Michelena ditch, the Montezuma company, by the terms of the decree in ac-\n\n\n[218 U.S. 371, 383]\n\u00a0\n tion No. 505 'had the right and was entitled to have flow into the Montezuma canal continuously from the Gila river, at all times during the dry season of the year, when water is low and scarce in said river, 1,000 miner's inches of water,' these provisions were disregarded in the distribution of water ordered in this case. This plainly appears when it is considered that by the decree the following allowances were made to the San Jose and Michelena canals, when, if the rights conferred upon the Montezuma canal by the decree pleaded as res judicata had been respected, no allowances whatever at the stated stages of water could have been recognized as existing in the San Jose and Michelena canals; viz., 120 inches when the surface flow at the head of the irrigation system is 400 inches, 320 inches when the surface flow is 750 inches, 480 inches when the surface flow is 1,000 inches, and 600 inches when the flow is 1,500 inches, with an allowance also to the Mejia canal in the latter event of 30 inches.\n While the findings do not establish the reasons which led to these allowances contrary to the decree which was pleaded as res judicata, there is room for conjecture that the deductions from the Montezuma and the allowances to the San Jose and Michelena canals, contrary to the decree, were made for the following reasons: (a) As it was found that in 1875 Ellsworth and others had appropriated water for the irrigation of 300 acres of land, and were diverting the same through the San Jose canal, and the date of this appropriation was prior to some of the appropriations served through the Montezuma canal, it was considered that this priority should be regarded in the distribution, even if to do so would conflict with the prior judgment in favor of the Montezuma canal; and (b) because the share which was given to the Michelena canal out of the allowances made contrary to the prior judgment in favor of the Montezuma canal were presum- \n\n[218 U.S. 371, 384]\n\u00a0\n ably so given to the Michelena canal, in order to comply with the terms of the judgment in action No. 797, referred to in finding 12, which established an equality of rights in the water between the San Jose and the Michelena canals. But if these be the theories upon which the court considered it was justified in disregarding the prior judgment, its action was erroneous. This was so, because the rights of the appropriations to the water carried through the Montezuma canal, as against appropriators of water diverted by the San Jose canal, were adjudicated as late as 1897 by the decree which was pleaded as res judicata, and as no facts were stated by the court which served to take the appropriations of water made by Ellsworth and others in 1875 out of the operation of the judgment of 1897, we can perceive no reason why the fact that appropriations were made in 1875 by Ellsworth et al. justified a disregard of the rights which the judgment of 1897 established in favor of the Montezuma canal.\n The remaining contention urged is based upon the action of the trial court, affirmed by the supreme court of the territory, in the appointment of a water commissioner to make distribution of the waters of the Gila river pursuant to the apportionment adjudicated by the decree, and imposing upon the Montezuma company a liability to pay its pro rata share of the salary of the commissioner as fixed by the decree. The supreme preme court of the territory was of the opinion 'that it is essential that an officer of the court be continuously on the river to regulate the amount to be diverted under the decree by each canal, in accordance with the ever-varying volume of water in the river, according to the tabulated statement;' that the appointment of the commissioner was a proper choice of a method to carry the decree into effect; and that the appointment was authorized as well by a section of the Revised Statutes of the territory, providing that 'the court shall cause its judgment and decree to be carried \n\n[218 U.S. 371, 385]\n\u00a0\n into execution,' as by the power which the court possessed by virtue of its 'general jurisdiction to provide all necessary means to carry out its judgment and decree.'\n It would indeed seem that the decree was modeled upon legislative remedies provided for similar situations in other jurisdictions, as the decree and the remedies which it affords bear a peculiar resemblance to legislative provisions enacted in some of the states where irrigation is practised, to control and regulate the use of water for irrigating purposes. See part 4, Weil's Water Rights in the Western States, pp. 590 et seq. The reason for the creation of statutory provisions of this and kindred character undoubtedly is, as said in Farm Invest. Co. v. Carpenter, 9 Wyo. 110, 50 L.R.A. 747, 87 Am. St. Rep. 918, 61 Pac. 258, 'to be found in the inability of the ordinary procedure and processes of the law to meet the necessities pertaining to the segregation by various individuals or companies of water from the same stream by separate ditches or canals, and at different points along its course, under rights by appropriation to so divert and use the water.'\n But because it was within the legislative power to provide administrative machinery to supervise the common use of water in a flowing stream by those having a lawful right to appropriate the water of that stream for beneficial use, it does not result that the decree entered by the court below was in excess of its authority. On the contrary in view of the absence of legislative action on the subject, and of the necessity which manifestly existed for supervising the use of the stream by those having the right to take the water in accordance with the decree which, undoubtedly to that extent, the court was authorized to render, we think the action taken by the court did not transcend the bounds of judicial authority, and therefore is not justly amenable to the attack made upon it. It follows from what we have said that error was committed by the court below in refusing to give due effect \n\n[218 U.S. 371, 386]\n\u00a0\n to the judgment in action No. 505, which was pleaded as res judicata by the Montezuma Canal Company.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of the Territory of Arizona is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n the court having heard the testimony of the witnesses and the arguments of counsel, and having examined the documentary evidence, the records and papers introduced by both parties, the evidence was closed and the cause was submitted to the court for consideration and decision, and after due deliberation thereon and examination of the briefs filed by the attorneys of the respective parties, the court delivered its findings and decision in writing (filed herein) and orders that judgment be entered in accordance therewith.\n Wherefore, by reason of the law and the findings aforesaid, it is ordered and adjudged and decreed that the several parties to this suit are entitled to receive and are hereby authorized to divert and convey from the Gila river water sufficient, each for this or their lands, from time to time, in the amounts and in the order of priority as shown in the tabular statement hereto attached and filed herewith, and marked, 'Tabular statement of amounts of water to which the water users under the several canals are entitled at different stages of water in the river, showing the accretions to the surface flow at the head of the irrigation system, and giving the approximate amounts thereof at the head of the different canals.'\n And the several parties hereto are each hereby forever enjoined from in any wise obstructing or interfering with the rights of any of the other parties to this suit, and for the purpose of carrying into effect this decree Albert T. Colton is hereby appointed a commissioner of this court, to hold said office and exercise the powers and duties thereof, hereinafter prescribed, until a further order of this court.\n The said commissioner shall have the power, at all times, when it shall be proper and necessary, in the discharge of his duties, to enter upon any and all of those certain canals and ditches known as the Brown, Sanchez, Mejia, Fourness, San Jose, Michelena, Montezuma, Union, Sunflower, Graham, Central, Oregon, Smithville, Bryce, Dodge, Nevada, Curtis, Kempton, Zeckendorf-Clavenger, Reid, Fort Thomas, Zeckendorf-Collins, Thompson, Military, Saline, and upon each and every part thereof, and upon all the dams, gates, flumes, and other structures and appliances, for the obstruction, diversion, or conveyance of water from said Gila river for the irrigation of lands under any or all of said canals or ditches, and have supervision and direction of the placing of, changing, closing, or opening of, the same for the \n purpose of the discharge of his duties, and to direct the placing of proper gates, dams, or other means for the control of the water of said river at the heads of the canals or other points on the banks of said canals, as he may direct, at the expense of the parties hereto interested therein, and to make such rules and regulations as he may deem proper and expedient, to be observed by the parties hereto, for the distribution and use of said water.\n And it is further ordered that said commissioner shall in person, with the assistance of such help as he may need, superintend and control the distribution and use of water by the parties hereto, and by the proper practice direct the diversion of such water from said river, and its conveyance to the place of use by whatsoever means he may deem best to secure the greatest economy therein. In the service of said water he shall direct the distribution thereof in accordance with the rights of the parties as to the extent of land irrigated and order of priority of time of appropriation as in this decree established. In the distribution and use of such water the commissioner shall take as a basis of the supply necessary for the cultivation of said lands one half of a miner's inch constant flow for each acre of land, or at that ratio, reckoning 40 miner's inches as the equivalent to a flow of 1 cubic foot per second; provided, however, that no land shall be served with an amount of water in excess of that beneficially used thereon. In measuring the water so supplied, the measure shall be taken for the water supplied to the several canals at the point of diversion from the river.\n The commissioner shall report, from time to time, to the court, as to his action in the premises, and shall, whenever he needs the same, apply to the court for further directions as to his powers and duties to make this decree effective.\n Any of the parties to this suit may apply to this court for any proper modification of this order or in the supervision and direction of the commissioner.\n The compensation of said commissioner shall be one hundred and fifty dollars and twenty cents ($150.20) per month, and shall be paid by the parties hereto in the proportion set out in the following table, to wit:\n A table designating the amounts to be paid by the water users un \n der the several canals and ditches, as their pro rata proportion of the salary of the commissioner, based upon the acreage irrigated under each canal:\n Canal.

The parties herein each pay their own cost, and the court cost common to all parties necessarily incurred herein is adjudged against all the parties hereto in the same proportion as the salary of the commissioner has been apportioned herein.\n\n\n\n\n\n","120":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMOORE PRINTING TYPEWRITER CO. v. NATIONAL SAVINGS & TRUST CO.(1910)\nNo. 21\nArgued: Decided: November 28, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles A. Keigwin and George P. Montague for appellants.\n Messrs. J. J. Darlington, John J. Crawford, and J. Keith M. Norton for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill in equity, brought by the National Sav- \n\n[218 U.S. 422, 423]\n\u00a0\n ings & Trust Company against the appellants and certain others, to obtain a decree to permit it to resign a trust created by the deposit with it of 35,005 shares of the stock of the American Planograph Company. The stock was deposited under an agreement signed by George R. Cornwall, Marion Bryan, Charles T. Moore, and others, all of whom were made parties to the bill. The agreement contained the following provision:\n'And it is hereby mutually agreed by and between all the parties hereto that on the receipt of the respective certificates of the said 35, 005 shares of stock by the said trustee from the parties of the first part, the said trustee shall cause to be delivered to each of the parties of the first part who contribute toward said 35,005 shares an assignable trust certificate, which shall recite the number of shares so deposited by him, and state that the holder thereof is entitled to an equitable interest in the said 35,005 deposited shares equivalent to the number of shares so conveyed to and deposited with said trustee by each of said depositors respectively, and that the holder of said trust certificate or certificates has no right to vote on any such shares, but shall be entitled to receive his pro rata share of any dividends paid on the deposited stock, and that on and after March 31, 1911, each holder of such trust certificate will, on surrender thereof to the said trustee, be entitled to a certificate of an equal number of shares of stock of the American Planograph Company, and the trustee shall forthwith cause to be transferred on the books of the American Planograph Company the stock so held in trust, and deliver the certificates thereof to each of the holders of the said trust certificates.'\n\n The agreement transferred the legal title to the trust company, and authorized it to vote the stock in the meeting of the planograph company, 'for such measures and such persons as the owners of a majority in amount of said trust certificates shall direct.' Also to collect \n\n[218 U.S. 422, 424]\n\u00a0\n dividends and pay them to the stockholders of the trust certificates. The agreement also contained the following provision: 'It is further agreed that in case the said trustee shall decline to accept or serve, or upon the resignation of said trustee during the term for which it is or may be appointed or elected, then the holders of a majority in amount of the trust certificates shall elect a trustee to fill the vacancy or vacancies.' It was further provided that the agreement should continue in force until April 26, 1911, but that the trust might be dissolved before that time by a vote of three fourths of the depositors.\n It is alleged in the bill that the National Savings & Trust Company notified the depositors of its desire to resign its position as trustee, and that the depositors, by an instrument in writing, duly nominated and appointed the New York Trust Company of the city of New York and state of New York to be trustee in its place instead. And further, that the 22d of May, 1906, it received a written notice from the appellants, purporting to be issued by themselves and others, that the shares have been transferred to it 'by breach of trust on the part of the holders of certain of the shares,' who were trustees of the appellants, and that suit had been commenced by the beneficiaries of the trust in the state of West Virginia against the planograph company to determine, among other things, the ownership of such shares.\n It is also alleged that two suits had been brought and were pending against the Savings & Trust Company and others in the supreme court of the district, respectively numbered 26,731, and 26,847, in which restraining orders were issued and were enforced, restraining it and the other defendants, until the court's further order, from removing or attempt to remove from the District of Columbia, and from selling, encumbering, or in any manner disposing of any of the shares of the stock of the planograph company in its possession or custody. And that by \n\n[218 U.S. 422, 425]\n\u00a0\n reason thereof, and of the written notice served upon it by the Moore company, it is 'advised that it may not transfer the said shares of stock in its possession to the said New York Trust Company as its successor in the said trust, without the risk of liability and loss, except through the aid of this court, and that it is entitled in its said capacity as a trustee to apply to this court for its instructions and its protection in the premises.'\n The prayer of the bill was that the Savings & Trust Company 'may be permitted to resign and retire from its said trust, and to surrender the shares of stock now held by it to a new trustee; and that the complainant may be instructed by the courts as to the manner and form of transfer by it to its successor in the said trust.'\n Costs were also prayed and general relief. Copies of the various instruments referred to were attached to the bill.\n The answer of the Moore company neither admitted nor denied the averments of the bill, except that it admitted giving notice to the Savings & Trust Company as alleged by it and the pendency of the suit in West Virginia, as alleged. Also, that the shares of stock stand in the name of the Savings & Trust Company on the books of the planograph company.\n The answer alleges new matter to the following effect: In January, 1900, Moore, Bryan, and Cornwall, three of the appellants, entered into a conspiracy for the purpose of wrecking the Moore company and a company called in the answer the Liomatrix, the stock of which is owned by the Moore company, and acquiring for themselves the assets of the Moore company, including certain inventions of Moore. To this end they procured the organization of the planograph company, the purposes of which were of the same general character with those of the Moore company. \n\n[218 U.S. 422, 426]\n\u00a0\n Afterwards, by the use of the new incorporation and by a course of fraudulent representations and conduct, which included the piracy of the most valuable machine of the Moore company, the officers of the latter company were induced to believe that the planograph company possessed some inventions of great value, and that the Moore company would be benefited by a consolidation of the two companies. Such consolidation was effected in 1901, upon terms and in a manner which gave complete control of the consolidated companies to the confederates, and that they have used such control for their own profit, and have by various fraudulent means possessed themselves of a very large part of the 35,005 shares of that company's stock, deposited with the Savings & Trust Company. A detail of the transactions by which this was effected is not necessary to recite.\n The answer concludes as follows:\n'This defendant admits, on the allegations set forth in the bill of complaint, that the plaintiff is entitled to resign and be relieved of its trust, but it alleges, on information and belief, that the New York Trust Company has not consented to accept said trust; and, further, that no other responsible trust company will be likely to accept the same if it has full knowledge of the facts, and in view of all the facts and circumstances hereinabove set forth, including the restraining orders granted by this court in equity suits Nos. 26,731 and 26,847, referred to in the bill of complaint, which orders still remain in force, and prohibit the removal or transfer of the said 35,005 shares of planograph stock, defendant submits that the plaintiff can be granted relief and the rights of all parties protected only by the appointment of a receiver for the said 35,005 shares of planograph stock affected by said trust, who shall hold said stock subject to the orders of this court until the rights of the various claimants thereto have been settled and determined.' \n\n[218 U.S. 422, 427]\n\u00a0\n Certain exhibits were attached to the answer, by which it is alleged its allegations are sustained.\n\n The individual appellants, by a joint answer, adopted that of the Moore company.\n All of the other defendants in the suit and appellees here answered, and gave consent to an order permitting the Savings & Trust Company to resign its trust and surrender the shares of stock held by it to the New York Trust Company. Two of those so consenting are the complainants in the suits Nos. 26,731 and 26,847, referred to above.\n The cause was set down for hearing on bill and answers, and on the 13th of December, 1907, it coming on to be heard, a decree was entered, authorizing and directing the Savings & Trust Company to deliver to the New York Trust Company all of the certificates of stock in the American Planograph Company which it held by virtue of the agreement alleged in its bill, 'and to make such indorsement upon such certificates as may be required to enable its said successor to take complete title to such certificates.' And it was ordered that upon compliance with the decree it should be discharged from all liability to the defendants in the suit in respect of such certificates and its action as trustee under such agreement.\n The decree concluded as follows:\n'Provided, however, that this decree and order shall be void if, on or before the 23d of December, 1907, the defendants the Moore Printing Typewriter Company, Russell W. Montague, and George P. Montague, or one or more of said last-named defendants, by way of a cross bill in this case or by original bill in this court, as they may be advised, shall apply for and obtain a restraining order or injunction with undertaking and security as required by equity rule 42 of this court, prohibiting such transfer of said certificates.'\n\n The decree was made by consent of all parties ex- \n\n[218 U.S. 422, 428]\n\u00a0\n cept by the Moore company and the individual appellants.\n On December 13 the Moore company offered a cross bill, which repeated the charges of fraud contained in its answer, and made other charges of misconduct. It prayed that the Savings & Trust Company be required to hold the stock subject to such order or orders as should thereafter be made, and that it be a trustee of such stock for the purpose of the cause, and that, in the event that it be permitted to resign, the person substituted for it be deemed a trustee of the stock, and hold it subject to the orders of the court. The other relief prayed is not necessary to mention.\n Leave to file the cross bill was granted. Nothing else was done under it, but the appellants took an appeal from the decree to the court of appeals, by which court the decree was affirmed.\n The contentions of the parties turn upon the question whether or not the bill is one of interpleader. Appellants contend that it is one in the nature of interpleader, being in some respects identical with it, but involving 'another principle of equity, namely, a trust; and it has therefore a greater scope, and is free from many of the technical restrictions of strict interpleader, particularly as applied to bailors and bailees, principal and agent,' etc.\n The court of appeals considered the bill as one of strict interpleader, and rejected the contention of appellants (they were appellants, also in the court of appeals), because the claim 'asserted was not derived from the contractual relation existing between plaintiff [ Savings & Trust Company] and the depositors of the stock.' In other words, that the claim of appellants and the claim of the depositors were not derived from a common source.\n The court of appeals quoted from Richardson v. Belt, 13 App. D. C. 200, as follows: \n\n[218 U.S. 422, 429]\n\u00a0\n 'An essential foundation of the equity of interpleader is that the party seeking the relief must not be under an independent or special liability to one of the claimants. Adams, Eq. 204; 3 Pom. Eq. Jur.  1327. Where there is an independent liability of the party seeking the relief to one of the several defendants, arising out of the relations subsisting between them, or upon a special contract creating, for example, the relation of bailor and bailee, landlord and tenant, or creditor and debtor, there can be no interpleader, unless it be made to appear that others have acquired a claim of title or interest derived under the said liability.' [ 31 App. D. C. 458.]\n But it is not necessary to consider the essentials of a bill of interpleader or one in the nature of interpleader. It is very certain that the bill in the pending case was not intended to be either. The prayer of the bill is for permission to resign the trust created by the agreement between the Savings & Trust Company and the depositors of the stock,-a right which the agreement expressly gives it. But appellants say:\n'In the present case, either the complainant, the trust company, had a right to compel the adverse claimants to come into court and litigate their claims, or it had not. If it had not, the bill should have been dismissed. If, on the other hand, it had such right, as it clearly had, then the stock in controversy should have been awarded to the parties who established their ownership to it; that is, to the appellants; who, it is submitted, fully established their claims, while the defendant-appellees practically made default, which, in a case of this nature, amounts to a confession that they had no right or title as against appellants to the thing in controversy.'\n\n The assumptions of these statements are not justified. The complainant did not bring the appellants into court to interplead their claim to the stock with the depositors of it. The complainant sought only by its bill to termi- \n\n[218 U.S. 422, 430]\n\u00a0\n nate its relation to the depositors of the stock, and transfer the trust it had undertaken to someone else. There were good reasons for doing so. It had taken the custody of and assumed duties in regard to property the title to which had come into dispute. Every act that was done in discharge of those duties would be under the shadow of illegality and the possibility of litigation. And, besides, something had been done under the trust, the propriety of which might be questioned by the new claimants to the property. Whether justifiably was submitted to the court, and likewise the responsibility of the new trustee. It must be remembered that after the Savings & Trust Company received notice of the new claimants of the stock, it had to proceed, if it proceeded at all, in the possibility of such claim being declared the legal one. It sought, therefore, to relieve itself of the trust and receive a complete discharge from past and future responsibility. The appellants sought to make it a trustee for them during, it may be, a protracted litigation. It was something more, as we have seen, than a mere holder of the stock. It had active duties to perform. We see no error, therefore, in the action of the court on the bill and answers.\n But it is said that the trial court erred in refusing to receive the cross bill except upon the terms prescribed in the decree, which were, as we have seen, that they apply for an injunction and give a bond, as provided by equity rule 42 of the court. In the motion for permission to file the cross bill, orders were asked that would have suspended the operation of the decree and the transfer of the stock certificates. And it will further be observed that the stock was not to be transferred by the decree to those whose title appellants were seeking to devest, but to a responsible trust company, and that there were shares of stock held by the trust company in which others had an interest which, it is not contended, is subject to a trust in favor of appellants. The purpose of the cross \n\n[218 U.S. 422, 431]\n\u00a0\n bill was therefore to prevent the use of property under a claim of title to it which would take time to determine, and it was not inequitable in the court to require security of the appellants,-the security which was required of other litigants who sought the same kind of relief.\n Appellants, however, contend that the requirement was inequitable, because the amount of the bond would have been large and beyond their ability to give. But we may not assume that the court's action would have been in excess of what the circumstance would have justified. The appellants did not invoke further action, but took an appeal, even before the expiration of the time which they had been given to comply with the provision of the decree.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","121":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMOORE v.

It is as follows:\n'In this case, which has been argued and submitted to this court, questions of law arise concerning which the court desires the instruction and advice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\n'The plaintiff in error brought suit (at law) in the trial court to recover the amount paid to the defendant in error, as collector of internal revenue, under constraint, as a tax of 10 cents per pound, assessed by the commissioner of internal revenue, for the manufacture by the plaintiff in error of 284,998 pounds of oleomargarine under due authority to engage in such business. Issues were joined, and, upon written stipulation by the parties, were submitted to the court for trial without a jury. After hearing the testimony, the trial court made and filed a special finding of facts upon the several issues so submitted, and thereupon judgment was rendered against the plaintiff in error, whereof reversal is sought on writ of error.\n\n'The tax in controversy of 10 cents per pound purports to be assessed under the provisions of  3 of the act of Congress approved May 9, 1902, published as chap. 784, 32 \n\n[216 U.S. 344, 349]\n\u00a0\n Stat. at L. 193, 194, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 864; and the present inquiry involves only the following of such finding of facts, viz.:\n\n'(1) That in June, 1902 after the abovementioned enactment, 'the commissioner of internal revenue officially promulgated and published and issued in regular course by the United States Treasury Department, the regulation as to 'artificial coloration,' in language as follows:\n\n\"Regulation as to Artificial Coloration.\n\n\"If, in the production of oleomargarine, the mixtures of compounds set out in the law of 1886 are used, and these compounds are all free from artificial coloration, and no artificial coloration is produced by the addition of coloring matter as an independent and separate ingredient, a tax of 1\/4 of 1 cent per pound only will be collected, although the finished product may look like butter of some shade of yellow. For example, if butter that has been artificially colored is used as a component part of the finished-product oleomargarine (and that finished product looks like butter of any shade of yellow), as the oleomargarine is not free from artificial coloration, the tax of 10 cents per pound will be assessed and collected. But if butter is absolutely free from artificial coloration or cotton-seed oil free from artificial coloration, or any other of the mixtures or compounds legally used in the manufacture of the finished- product oleomargarine has naturally a shade of yellow in no way produced by artificial coloration, and through the use of one or more of these unartificially colored legal component parts of oleomargarine the finished product should look like butter of any shade of yellow, this product will be subject to a tax of only 1\/4 of 1 cent per pound, as it is absolutely free from artificial coloration that has caused it to look like butter of any shade of yellow.'\n\n'Which said 'Regulation as to Artificial Coloration,' thenceforth continued to be the regulation of the commissioner's office when the oleomargarine hereinafter referred to was made and sold by the plaintiff.' \n\n[216 U.S. 344, 350]\n\u00a0\n '(2) The rulings and assessments in question by the commissioner of internal revenue were made in 1903\n\n\n\n'(3) 'The oleomargarine, on account of which said assessment was levied by said commissioner of internal revenue, and said reduced amount thereof was required by him to be paid by said plaintiff, was composed of oleo oil, lard, milk, cream, salt, and two vegetable oils commonly known as cotton-seed oil and palm oil, and of nothing else. The proportion of palm oil present in said oleomargarine was about 1\/2 of 1 per cent (1\/2 per cent) of the total volume of said oleomargarine. Palm oil is a pure vegetable oil derived from the fruit of palm trees, which grow in certain parts of Africa, and has about the consistence of pure butter. Palm oil consists almost entirely of palmatine and olein, which are the chief constituents of pure butter. Palm oil is perfectly wholesome, is readily digested, and has long been used as an article of food in countries where it is produced. Palm oil was successfully employed in oleomargarine prior to May, 1902, and is a proper constituent of oleomargarine. The oleomargarine involved in this suit looked like butter of a shade of yellow, and such resemblance to butter of a shade of yellow was caused by the presence of the palm oil used in said oleomargarine, and the levy of said assessment by said commissioner of internal revenue was based upon and because of such resemblance to butter of a shade of yellow, resulting from such use of palm oil in said oleomargarine. In addition to coloring the oleomargarine in resemblance to butter, the palm oil probably gives to the oleomargarine slightly better grain of texture, causing it to act more like butter in the frying pan, and it also caused said oleomargarine to have a better physiological effect upon the persons who ate it; but such function of the palm oil, other than as coloring matter, was slight, and but for the coloring imparted to the oleomargarine would not probably have been actually used in its manufacture.\n\n'Upon the foregoing facts,-distinguishing the case from that presented in Cliff v. United States, \n195 U.S. 159\n, 49 L. ed. 139, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1, as we \n\n[216 U.S. 344, 351]\n\u00a0\n understand the facts there reported,-the questions of law concerning which this court desires the instruction and advice of the Supreme Court are these:\n\n'First. With the oleomargarine caused 'to look like butter,' by the use of natural palm oil as one of the ingredients,-'a pure vegetable oil,' named in the statute as an ingredient of oleomargarine,-which not only gives the coloration sought for the finished product, but otherwise (in some degree) improves the texture, quality, and healthfulness of the oleomargarine, can such use be denominated 'artificial coloration,' within the terms and meaning of the statute referred to, fixing the rate of taxation?\n\n'Second. For the purpose of assessing the statutory tax on the oleomargarine described in the first question, Is the rate of taxation dependent, either (1) upon the ratio which the quantity of palm oil used bears to the other ingredients, or (2) the extent or ratio of other benefits than that of coloration given by the palm oil?\n\n'Third. Can the fact that the manufacturer intended and used the palm oil for coloration of the oleomargarine enter into the determination of the amount taxable under the statute?'\n\n It, as it will be observed, is implied in the certificate, and it is also contended at bar, that the facts of this case distinguish it from Cliff v. United States, supra. What the decision was in that case, therefore, becomes the first subject of inquiry. And an element of that inquiry is the act of Congress under which the tax in controversy was imposed, of which  2 and 8 are only necessary to quote:\n'Sec. 2. That, for the purposes of this act, certain manufactured substances, certain extracts, and certain mixtures and compounds, including such mixtures and compounds with butter, shall be known and designated as 'oleomargarine,' namely: All substances heretofore known as oleomargarine, oleo, oleomargarine oil, butterine, lardine, suine, and neutral; \n\n[216 U.S. 344, 352]\n\u00a0\n all mixtures and compounds of oleomargarine, oleo, oleomargarine oil, butterine, lardine, suine, andneutral; all lard extracts and tallow extracts; and all mixtures and compounds of tallow, beef fat, suet, lard, lard oil, vegetable oil, anotto, and other coloring matter, intestinal fat, and offal fat made in imitation or semblance of butter, or, when so made, calculated or intended to be sold as butter or for butter.' [Act of August 2, 1886, 24 Stat. at L. 209, chap. 840, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2228.]\n\n Sec. 8. That upon oleomargarine which shall be manufactured and sold, or removed for consumption or use, there shall be assessed and collected a tax of 10 cents per pound, to be paid by the manufacturer thereof; and any fractional part of a pound in a package shall be taxed as a pound: provided, when oleomargarine is free from artificial coloration that causes it to look like butter of any shade of yellow, said tax shall be 1\/4 of 1 cent per pound' [italics ours]. [Act of August 2, 1886, as amended May 9, 1902, 32 Stat. at L. 194, chap. 784,  3, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 864.]\n The defendant in that case was charged with having knowingly purchased and received for sale oleomargarine which had not been properly stamped according to law. It was shown that out of 160 ounces of which the compound was composed, only 1 1\/2 ounces were palm oil, and the following ruling of the commissioner was introduced in evidence:\n'This office rules that where so minute and infinitesimal a quantity of a vegetable oil is used in the manufacture of oleomargarine as is proposed to be used in palm oil, and through its use the finished product looks like butter of any shade of yellow, it cannot be considered that the oil is used with the purpose or intention of being a bona fide constituent part or element of the product, but is used solely for the purpose of producing or imparting a yellow color to the oleomargarine, and, therefore, that the oleomargarine so colored is not free from artificial coloration, and becomes subject to the tax of 10 cents per pound.'\n\n The contention was that Congress having, in  2, defined oleomargarine to consist of certain substances, the color \n\n[216 U.S. 344, 353]\n\u00a0\n which resulted from the use of such substances, or any of them, was a natural, not an artificial, coloration. The contention, and the argument of counsel to support it, was given at length, so that its full extent and strength should be shown. Among other things, this was said: 'Howsoever minute may be the quantity of palm oil used, it is none the less a vegetable oil, a statutory, or, so to speak, a natural, ingredient of oleomargarine, and displaces in the finished product an equal volume of some other statutory ingredient of oleomargarine, as, for instance, cotton- seed oil.' And it was argued that the statute conferred 'no power upon the commissioner to prescribe the formula for the manufacture of oleomargarine, or the proportion of the different ingredients, or to exclude any ingredient except upon the ground of its being deleterious to health.' The argument could not be misunderstood or evaded. It asserted the purity of the oleomargarine under the law, and that its color came from its purity, not from any illegal addition to it. The contention, therefore, was direct, and unqualified by any consideration of the relative quantity of the ingredients. Its force was recognized, but it was nevertheless rejected, and in reply it was pointed out that the statute was not enacted to permit the manufacture of oleomargarine, but to prevent its sale 'as and for butter.' And it was decided 'that when any substance, although named as a possible ingredient of oleomargarine, substantially serves only the function of coloring the mass, and so as to cause the product to 'look like butter of any shade of yellow,' it is an artificial coloration.' It was stated that palm oil is a vegetable oil, and one of the substances authorized to be used by  2 in the composition of oleomargarine. But this, it was added, did not exempt the product from the higher tax if the palm oil or any other 'statutory ingredient,' to use the phrase of counsel, was used only for coloring. The statute was carefully analyzed, and the words, 'and other coloring matter,' in  2, were declared to have an obvious purpose. 'It was to prevent,' it was said, 'excluding from the operation of the stat- \n\n[216 U.S. 344, 354]\n\u00a0\n ute anything in its nature oleomargarine [that is, to exempt from the higher tax anything in its nature oleomargarine] by the addition of a substance not in reality an ingredient, but serving substantially only the purpose of coloring the product to cause it to look like butter.' And it was further said: 'The fact that one of the ingredients of this compound is palm oil does not show that such oil does anything else than color the product composed of other ingredients, and if it does substantially only this, it is rightfully styled an artificial coloration.' This language brings us to the point of distinction between that case and the case at bar. It is put beyond controversy that oleomargarine may be subject to the higher tax though its color result from a 'statutory ingredient.' To relieve from such consequence the ingredient must be there in substantial quantity,-in quantity substantial enough to contribute to the product something more than color. And this, it is insisted, the palm oil does in the case at bar, and the case is, therefore, it is further insisted, distinguished from the Cliff Case. The contention is that the defendant in the Cliff Case 'stood upon the narrow proposition that palm oil being a vegetable oil, and, therefore, being a statutory ingredient of oleomargarine, it made no difference whether the amount of it used was small or large, or whether the sole purpose of its use was to impart the desired color; coloration due to its use was not, within the meaning of the statute, 'artificial coloration.\"\n It is further urged that 'Cliff made no effort whatever to show what, if any, were the effects of palm oil upon the oleomargarine other than giving color to it,' but admitted, for the purpose of the case, 'that the sole and only function of the palm oil was to make the oleomargarine 'look like butter of a shade of yellow.\"\n He did not show, as he might have shown, it is further urged, 'what are found as facts in this case, namely: that palm oil in its nature is suitable for food; that, for many years prior to 1902, it had been used for food, and that, when \n\n[216 U.S. 344, 355]\n\u00a0\n so used, it was found healthful and digestible; and that palm oil had been successfully used in oleomargarine prior to May 9, 1902, the date of the passage of the amendment which, for the first time, made the tax upon oleomargarine that is free from artificial coloration smaller than the tax upon oleomargarine that is not free from artificial coloration. Prior to May 9, 1902, all oleomargarine was taxed under the original oleomargarine law passed in 1886, at the rate of 2 cents per pound, regardless of whether it was free or not free from artificial coloration.'\n Are these contentions sustained by the facts certified? Do they show that the palm oil has substantially any other purpose than to color the product? It is certified that palm oil is a purely vegetable oil, 'is perfectly wholesome, is readily digested, and has long been used as an article of food in countries where it is produced.' These are useful qualities, undoubtedly; and the extent of their contribution by the presence of 1\/2 of 1 per cent of palm oil is attempted to be estimated. It is the ingredient, the certificate says, that gives to the oleomargarine a 'shade of yellow' and makes it resemble butter; that is, enables it to seem what it is not, and so far, at least, to defeat the purpose of the law against coloration. And the certificate further recites that, 'in addition to coloring the oleomargarine in resemblance to butter, the palm oil probably gives to the oleomargarine slightly better grain of texture, causing it to act more like butter in the frying pan, and it also caused said oleomargarine to have a better physiological effect upon the persons who ate it; but such function of the palm oil, other than as coloring matter, was slight, and but for the coloring imparted to the oleomargarine would not probably been used in its manufacture.'\n We do not think these facts take the case out of the ruling in the Cliff Case. There is no more substantial contribution of character to the compound in this case than in that. The amount of palm oil used in that case was something greater than in this, and the purpose of its use was the same. It, of \n\n[216 U.S. 344, 356]\n\u00a0\n course, added whatever qualities it possessed and could exist in a fraction of 1 per cent of the product of which it made a part. This did not need explicit statement, and it gains nothing now by explicit statement. What effect is claimed for it? It gives, it is said, a slightly better grain of texture, a better physiological effect upon those who eat it. But those effects are 'slight,' it is certified. What is meant by 'slight?' It is the word of a rather indeterminate meaning. It usually implies unimportance or insignificance, and is practically given that meaning in the certificate. The palm oil, it is certified, contributes so little to the value or quality of the oleomargarine that, but for its coloring power, it would not be used. It may be, as counsel says, that the motive of its use cannot make it illegal, and that one cannot become an offender against the law by doing what it permits. But the question here is not what the law permits. That was decided in the Cliff Case. The question here is whether we shall exaggerate a slight use of a 'statutory ingredient' into a substantial use of it, and by doing so bring its use within the permission of the statute, and relieve the product of which it is a 'slight' part from a tax of 10 cents.\n We have so far considered this case on the authority of the Cliff Case, deeming it unnecessary to repeat the reasoning of the latter, as though the question was res integra. It may be well, however, to develop the argument of counsel somewhat further. It is presented in a summary way in the following syllogism:\n'First premise: Color due to the use of an authorized food ingredient, not artificially colored, is not artificial coloration. (McCray v. United States, \n195 U.S. 27\n, 49 L. ed. 78, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 769, 1 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 561.)\n\n'Second premise: Palm oil, being a vegetable oil, suitable for food, and its nature such as to make oleomargarine suitable for food, and being itself not artificially colored, is an authorized food ingredient. (Cliff Case.)\n\n'Conclusion: Therefore color due to the use of palm oil is not artificial coloration.' \n\n[216 U.S. 344, 357]\n\u00a0\n The premises and conclusions are assumed by ignoring, not by following, the cases cited to support them. The error arises by making the term 'authorized food ingredient' unqualified, and by disregarding what the Cliff Case makes essential. The quality of suitableness for food of an ingredient is made determinative, and wholly determinative, disregarding its quantity, its relation and proportion to other ingredients; and this, counsel indeed contends for, and is the proposition presented in the second question certified. But the contention contravenes the rule in the Cliff Case, where the distinction was made between the mere addition of an authorized food ingredient and its service in the compound for something more substantial than coloration. We now repeat it. Any other rule would give too easy a way to evade the statute, and make its purpose yield not to what is essential to the manufacture of oleomargarine, but what is nonessential; and render a law which was intended to prevent deception an easy means to accomplish it.\n\n We are not called upon to consider whether the first premise of counsel's syllogism is sustained by McCray v. United States, supra, but we are concerned to say, to meet a contention of counsel, that it will not be put into antagonism with the Cliff Case by the meaning we have given the latter. On the contrary, the cases support each other. In both, this court declined to follow arguments based upon the mere letter of the statute, in destruction of its manifest intention. The contention in the McCray Case was that butter, whether artificially colored or not, was an authorized ingredient of oleomargarine, and, when added to oleomargarine, made it free from artificial coloration. This was pronounced an 'obvious non sequitur.' The product, it was said, would be 'oleomargarine,' but it would not be 'oleomargarine free from artificial coloration within the intendment of the proviso' of  2.\n It follows from these views that the first question certified must be answered in the affirmative; the second and third questions do not call for specific answers on this record. \n\n\n\n","124":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNATIONAL BANK OF COMMERCE OF SEATTLE v. DOWNIE(1910)\nNo. 31\nArgued: Decided: November 28, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. George E. de Steiguer, Frederick Bausman, and Daniel kelleher for appellants.\n\n\n[218 U.S. 345, 348]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. E. Horan, H. D. Cooley, W. A. Peters, J. H. Powell, and Harold Preston for appellees. \n\n[218 U.S. 345, 349]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n There is no dispute as to the facts out of which the present controversy has arisen. Substantially the facts are these: On the 16th day of April, 1907, the appellee Downie was appointed receiver of the property of Gamwell & Wheeler, partners, who had previously, on the same day, been adjudged bankrupts. Subsequently he was elected and qualified as permanent trustee, and by order of the court, June 20th, 1907, was authorized to collect all moneys due the bankrupts from the United States or any of its departments.\n Gamwell & Wheeler, as a firm, held sixteen unallowed claims against the United States, aggregating $33,517.48, the first one being dated December 10th, 1906, and the last February 15th, 1907. The National Bank of Commerce of Seattle was a creditor of that firm in the sum of $37,149. 85. These claims were all assigned by Gamwell & Wheeler to the above bank. The Seattle National Bank was likewise a creditor of the firm and to the extent of $22,582.19, with interest, and that firm held certain unallowed claims against the United States, sixty-one in number, and amounting to $ 38,509.32. The first of the latter claims was dated September 25th, 1906, and the last April 4th, 1907. They were all assigned by Gamwell & Wheeler to the lastnamed bank.\n The parties, by stipulation of July 10th, 1907, agreed: 'That each and all of said claims against the United States government, so assigned [ to the banks named], were claims for money due from the government of the United States to the said bankrupts upon account of contracts entered into between said bankrupts and the United States for the furnishing of materials by said bankrupts to various departments of said government; that said assignments were each and all voluntarily made in consideration of a loan made by said bank to said bankrupts \n\n[218 U.S. 345, 350]\n\u00a0\n at the time of said assignments, and as collateral security for the repayment of said loans, and without notice to the other creditors of said bankrupts. That all of such assignments were made after the entering into of said contracts, and after partial performance thereof by said bankrupts, before the allowance of any such claims or the ascertainment of the amount due thereon, or the issuing of any warrant for the payment thereof, and that none of said assignments were executed in the presence of any witnesses at all, and that none of them recite any warrant for the payment of the claim assigned, and that none of them were acknowledged by any officer having authority to take acknowledgment of deeds, or any other acknowledging officer at all, and that none of them were certified as being acknowledged by any officer. The said loans to each of said banks exceeded in amount the value of said collaterals so assigned to secure the same, and there is now due to each of said banks on account of said loans an amount much in excess of the value of the said collaterals so assigned to each of said banks respectively.'\n The claims of the two banks ($37,149.85 and $22,582.19, with interest) were allowed by the referee in bankruptcy, and it was adjudged by the court that the banks were entitled, respectively, to receive, on account of the claims assigned to them, whatever amount might be collected on them from the government, and the trustee was ordered to pay over to the banks holding the assignments the collections as they were made thereon.\n The district court allowed the respective claims of the banks as general debts, but disallowed them as preferred. This order was affirmed in the circuit court of appeals, that court rejecting the claim of each bank for a lien upon the fund assigned. The case is here under a certificate by Justice Brewer, to the effect that the determination of the question involved in each case was \n\n[218 U.S. 345, 351]\n\u00a0\n essential to an uniform construction of the bankruptcy act throughout the United States.\n The questions raised by the parties make it necessary to determine the scope and effect of  3477 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2320) in its application to these cases. That section was brought forward from previous acts of Congress and is as follows: 'All transfers and assignments made of any claim upon the United States, or of any part or share thereof, or interest therein, whether absolute or conditional, and whatever may be the consideration therefor, and all powers of attorney, orders, or other authorities for receiving payment of any such claim, or of any part or share thereof, shall be absolutely null and void, unless they are freely made and executed in the presence of at least two attesting witnesses, after the allowance of such a claim, the ascertainment of the amount due, and the issuing of a warrant for the payment thereof. Such transfers, assignments, and power of attorney, must recite the warrant for payment, and must be acknowledged by the person making them, before an officer having authority to take acknowledgments of deeds, and shall be certified by the officer; and it must appear by the certificate that the officer, at the time of the acknowledgment, read and fully explained the transfer, assignment, or warrant of attorney to the person acknowledging the same.'\n The words of that section are so clear and explicit that there cannot be, we think, any reasonable ground to doubt the purpose of this legislation. Its essential features are not new, as can be seen by an examination of the act of Congress of July 29th, 1846, 'in relation to the payment of claims' on the United States, and the act of February 26th, 1853, 'to prevent frauds upon the Treasury of the United States.' 9 Stat. at L. 41, chap. 66; U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2320; 10 Stat. at L. 170, chap. 81, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2320. Turning to  3477, we find Congress had in mind not only all transfers and assignments of any claim on the United States, or part of a claim or any interest therein, whether \n\n[218 U.S. 345, 352]\n\u00a0\n the transfter or assignment be absolute or unconditional, and whatever was the consideration of the transfer or assignment, but all powers of attorney, orders, or other authorities for receiving payment of any such claim, or of any part or share thereof. All such transfers, assignments, powers of attorney, order, or authorities are declared to be 'absolutely null and void,' except there be a compliance with the conditions fully set out in the statute. None of those conditions were complied with in these cases.\n In United States v. Gillis, \n95 U.S. 407\n, 24 L. ed. 503, it appears that suit was brought in the court of claims, by the assignee of an unallowed claim on the United States, and the question arose whether the assignee could maintain a suit in his name for the proceeds of the claim. The court of claims sustained the assignee's right to sue, but this court, upon careful examination of the act of 1853, re-enacted in  3477 of the Revised Statutes, reversed the judgment, and directed the petition of the assignee to be dismissed. It was contended in that case that the act of 1853 had reference only to claims asserted before the Treasury Department. But that view was rejected. After observing that the comprehensive provisions of the statute excluded any exceptions to the rule presented, the court said: 'We think, therefore, the act of 1853 is of universal application, and covers all claims against the United States in every tribunal in which they may be asserted. And such, we think, was the understanding of Congress when the Revised Statutes were enacted. In the revision, the act of 1853 was included and re-enacted.'\n Among the earlier cases on the general subject is Spofford v. Kirk, \n97 U.S. 484\n, 488-490, 24 L. ed. 1032, 1034, 1035, frequently referred to in later decisions and always followed.\n That was a case of a suit by Spofford, in the supreme court of this district. He became the holder, by assign- \n\n[218 U.S. 345, 353]\n\u00a0\n ment, of certain acceptances which, upon their face, provided for payment to be made out of any moneys received from the United States on the claim of one Kirk against the government. The assignee or holder of the acceptances paid value for them, and acted in entire good faith. The question was whether an assignment of a claim against the United States, made before the claim had been allowed, and before a warrant had been issued for its payment, had any validity, either in law or in equity. The court of original jurisdiction dismissed Spofford's bill, and the judgment was affirmed here. Mr. Justice Strong, speaking for this court, referred to  3477 of the Revised Statutes, and, among other things, said: 'It would seem to be impossible to use language more comprehensive than this. It embraces alike legal and equitable assignments. It includes powers of attorney, orders, or other authorities for receiving payment of any such claim, or any part or share thereof. It strikes at every derivative interest, in whatever form acquired, and incapacitates every claimant upon the government from creating an interest in the claim in any other than himself.' After referring to the fact that the court had not been called upon to decide in the Gillis Case, whether the assignment there involved was invalid as between the assignor and the assignee, the opinion proceeds: 'But if, after the claim in this case was allowed, and a warrant for its payment was issued in the claimant's name, as it must have been, he had gone to the Treasury for his money, it is clear that no assignment he might have made, or order he might have given, before the allowance, would have stood in the way of his receiving the whole sum allowed. The United States must have treated as a nullity any rights to the claim asserted by others. It is hard to see how a transfer of a debt can be of no force as between the transferee and the debtor, and yet effective as between the creditor and his assignee to transmit an ownership of the debt, or create a lien upon it. Yet if \n\n[218 U.S. 345, 354]\n\u00a0\n that might be,-and we do not propose now to affirm or deny it, the question remains, whether the act of Congress was not intended to render all claims against the government, inalienable alike in law and in equity, for every purpose, and between all parties. The intention of Congress must be discovered in the act itself. . . . We cannot say, when the statute declares all transfers and assignments of the whole of a claim, or any part or interest therein, and all orders, powers of attorney, or other authority for receiving payment of the claim, or any part thereof, shall be absolutely null and void, that they are only partially null and void, that they are valid and effective as between the parties thereto, and only invalid when set up against the government. It follows that, in our opinion, the accepted orders under which the appellant claims gave him no interest in the claim of the drawer against the United States, and no lien upon the fund arising out of the claim. His bill was therefore rightly dismissed.'\n In St. Paul & D. R. Co. v. United States, \n112 \nU.S. 733, 736\n, 28 S. L. ed. 861, 862, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 366, 367, the court held that a voluntary transfer by mortgage, for the security of a debt, and finally completed and made absolute by a judicial sale, was within the prohibition of  3477, Mr. Justice Matthews, speaking for the court, saying that, 'if the statute does not apply to such cases, it would be difficult to draw a line of exclusion which leaves any place for the operation of the prohibition.'\n The latest adjudication by this court, construing  3477 of the Revised Statutes, is that of Nutt v. Knut, \n200 U.S. 12\n-14, 20, 50 L. ed. 348, 350-352, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 216, 217, 219. That case involved, among other things, the validity of the clause in a written contract relating to compensation to be made to an attorney employed to prosecute a claim against the United States. The contract provided that the payment of such compensation 'is hereby made a lien upon said claim, and upon any \n\n[218 U.S. 345, 355]\n\u00a0\n draft, money, or evidence of indebtedness which may be issued thereon. This agreement not to be affected by any services performed by the claimant, or by any other agents or attorneys employed by him.' After referring to the words of  3477, and citing previous cases in which the scope and meaning of that section were considered (which cases are given in the margin ), this court said: 'If regard be had to the words as well as to the meaning of the statute, as declared in former cases, it would seem clear that the contract in question was, in some important particulars, null and void upon its face. We have in mind that clause making the payment of the attorney's compensation a lien upon the claim asserted against the government, and upon any draft, money, or evidence of indebtedness issued thereon. In giving that lien from the outset, before the allowance of the claim, and before any services had been rendered by the attorney, the contract, in effect, gave him an interest or share in the claim itself, and in any evidence of indebtedness issued by the government on account of it. In effect or by its operation it transferred or assigned to the attorney in advance of the allowance of the claim such an interest as would secure the payment of the fee stipulated to be paid. All this was contrary to the statute; for its obvious purpose, in part, was to forbid anyone who was a stranger to the original transaction to come between the claimant and the government, prior to the allowance of a claim, and who, in asserting his own interest or share in the claim, pending its examination, might embarrass the conduct of the business on the part of the officers of the govern-\n Spofford v.

We are of opinion that the state court erred in holding the contract, on its face, to be consistent with the statute.'\n In this connection, it must be said that this court has held that the statute in question does not embrace the transfer of a claim against the United States, where the transfer has been by operation of law, not merely as the result of a voluntary assignment by the claimant. In Erwin v. United States, \n97 \nU.S. 392, 397\n, 24 S. L. ed. 1065, 1067, this court, speaking by Mr. Justice Field, after referring to the act of 1853, embodied now in  3477 of the Revised Statutes, to prevent frauds upon the Treasury, said that it 'applies only to cases of voluntary assignment of demands against the government. It does not embrace cases where there has been a transfer of title by operation of law. The passing of claims to heirs, devisees, or assignees in bankruptcy is not within the evil at which the statute aimed; nor does the construction given by this court deny to such parties a standing in the court of claims.' This construction of the statute was recognized as settled law in Goodman v. Niblack, \n102 \nU.S. 556, 560\n, 26 S. L. ed. 229, 231; St. Paul & D. R. Co. v. United States, \n112 \nU.S. 733, 736\n, 28 S. L. ed. 861, 862, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 366; Butler v. Goreley, \n146 \nU.S. 303, 311\n, 36 S. L. ed. 981, 985, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 84; Hager v.

Rep. 554.\n The present cases are not assignments which, by operation of law, created an interest in the assignor's claims against the United States. They are clean-cut cases of a voluntary transfer of claims against the United States, before their allowance, in direct opposition to the statute. If any regard whatever is to be had to the intention of Congress, as manifested by its words,-too clear, we think, to need construction,-we must hold such a transfer to be absolutely null and void, and as not, in itself, passing to the appellants any interest, present or remote, legal or equitable, in the claims transferred. The result is that when Gamwell & Wheeler were adjudged bankrupts, they \n\n[218 U.S. 345, 357]\n\u00a0\n were still in law the owners of these claims on the United States, and all interest therein passed under the bankrupt act to their general creditors, to be disposed of as directed by the bankrupt act, just as if there had been no attempt to transfer them to the banks. Any other holding will effect a repeal of the statute by mere judicial construction, in disregard of the plain, unequivocal intent of Congress, as indicated by the statute.\n The judgment as to each bank is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","125":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNOLLMAN & CO. v.

STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA EX REL MCCUE(1910)\nNo. 553\nArgued: Decided: March 14, 1910\n\n\n\n Mr. Charles W. Bunn for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Guy C. H. Corliss, Andrew Miller, and T. F. McCue for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a proceeding by the attorney general of North Dakota, charging the plaintiff in error with continuous violation of a law fixing rates for the carriage of coal within the state, and asking for an injunction. See N. D. Laws of 1907, chap. 51. The railroad answered that the act was void under art. 1,  8, of the Constitution, the commerce clause, and also under the 14th Amendment, because the maximum rates fixed by it were inadequate and confiscatory. Evidence was taken \n\n[216 U.S. 579, 580]\n\u00a0\n and reported to the supreme court, and that court decided that the injunction should issue as prayed. (N. D.) 120 N. W. 869. The grounds of its decision were that the act referred only to transportation wholly within the state, and therefore was not bad under art. 1,  8, thus removing that question; and that the evidence did not prove that the rates would entail a loss on the carriage of coal, so that it was not necessary to decide whether, in that event, it would be unconstitutional, if the railroad made a fair profit on its whole business within the state.\n The court did, however, intimate its opinion that if the railroad was able to make a fair profit upon its whole business within the state, it might be required to carry a particular commodity at cost or possibly below; and it expressed its opinion so strongly that the counsel for the plaintiff in error treats that doctrine as the ground of decision, and the statement as to the insufficiency of the evidence as made only in the light of it, and upon rather technical grounds. He argues that the evidence was undisputed, that the facts testified to and the fair inferences from them must be taken as proved, and that on those facts and inferences the constitutional question is raised. The evidence consisted of tables of rates in other states, computation as to the cost of transportation, and expert opinions, all of which were thought to converge to the conclusion that the statutory rates were unreasonable and less than the cost of carriage. But laying technical objections on one side, and taking the facts as admitted, the argument for the state showed that there are too many elements of uncertainty in the calculation for us to say, if we could, as to which we intimate no opinion, that the conclusion is proved, when the supreme court of the state says that it is not.\n The carriage of coal is a very small part of the railroad's business. The estimate of the cost is admitted to be uncertain, and to depend in part upon arbitrary postulates. It has to be increased considerably above the average cost for freight in order to make out the plaintiff in error's point. We are far from saying that the argument for doing so does not seem to \n\n[216 U.S. 579, 581]\n\u00a0\n us to have considerable probability on its side. We do not say that experiment may not establish a case in the future that would require a decision upon the question of constitutional law. But we can express no opinion upon it now. The great difficulty in the attempt to measure the reasonableness of charges by reference to the cost of transporting the particular class of freight concerned is well known and often has been remarked. It seems to us that the nearest approach to justice that can be made at this time is to follow the precedent of Wilcox v. Consolidated Gas Co. \n212 U.S. 19\n, 53 L. ed. 382, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 192, as nearly as may be, and affirm the decree, but without prejudice to the right of the railraod company to reopen the case by appropriate proceedings if, after adequate trial, it thinks it can prove more clearly than at present the confiscatory character of the rates for coal. Decree affirmed without prejudice.\n Similar decrees will be entered in Nos. 554 and 555. \n\n\n\n","127":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOLD NICK WILLIAMS CO. v. U S(1910)\nNo. 26\nArgued: Decided: January 24, 1910\n\n\n\n This was an indictment in the district court of the United States for the western district of North Carolina against the Old Nick Williams Company, a corporation which was authorized to carry on the business of a rectifier, and which was convicted of violating the second paragraph of  3317 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2164) by the verdict of a jury finding it guilty of carrying on the business of a rectifier with intent to defraud the United States of the tax on the spirits rectified by it. The verdict was rendered November 28, 1905, and motions to set aside the verdict and for new trial and in arrest of judgment were severally made and overruled, and thereupon judgment was entered on that day, sentencing defendant to pay a fine of $5,000 and be taxed with the costs. On the same day it was ordered that the defendant have ninety days to prepare its bill of exceptions, and that the attorney for the United States have \n\n[215 U.S. 541, 542]\n\u00a0\n thirty days, after being served with the defendant's bill of exceptions, to make objections thereto, and that the court would settle the bill of exceptions upon ten days' notice to the attorneys of the parties, and that, when filed, the bill of exceptions should be deemed as made in ample time.\n January 17, 1906, by consent of the parties, the court, by its order, further extended the time for preparing and filing defendant's bill of exceptions to March 15, 1906, and afterwards extended the time to April 1. On July 27, 1906, the court, over the objection of the attorney for the United States, made an order which recited that defendant had filed with the clerk its bill of exceptions, to which the United States attorney had filed certain objections and proposed amendments, so that the bill of exceptions had not been settled and signed by the court within six months from the date of the entry of the judgment, and the court, being of opinion that defendant was entitled, under the circumstances, to have the bill of exceptions settled and a writ of error and citation issued and served nunc pro tunc as within the time required by law, directed that the attorneys should appear before him August 7, 1906, and have the bill of exceptions settled and signed by the court, and further ordered that when the bill of exceptions was settled and signed, and after a petition for a writ of error and assignments of error had been filed by defendant, the writ of error and citation in due form should be issued and served, all to bear date as of the 15th of April, 1906, that being the date on which the defendant filed its proposed bill of exceptions with the clerk, and which was within six months from the entry of the judgment. Thereafter, on September 12, 1906, defendant, having presented its petition for the allowance of a writ of error and its assignment of errors, the court signed an order allowing the writ of error, and directing that the writ of error and citation, when issued, bear date April 15, 1906. Thereupon the writ of error was issued on September 12, 1906, as of April 15. The attorney for the United States moved to dismiss the writ of error because not sued out within six months after the entry of \n\n[215 U.S. 541, 543]\n\u00a0\n the judgment. The statute restricting the time for writs of error in such cases is  11 of the act of Congress of March 3, 1891, and reads:\n'Sec. 11. That no appeal or writ of error by which any order, judgment, or decree may be reviewed in the circuit court of appeals under the provisions of this act shall be taken or sued out except within six months after the entry of the order, judgment, or decree sought to be reviewed.' [26 Stat. at L. 829, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 552.]\n\n The writ was dismissed for the reasons given in the opinion by Morris, J., reported in 82 C. C. A. 73, 152 Fed. 925.\n Charles A. Moore, William P. Bynum, Jr., Moore & Rollins, and Burwell & Cansler for petitioner.\n Assistant Attorney General Fowler for respondent.\n\n Statement by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller:\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n The rule has long been settled that a 'writ of error is not brought, in the legal meaning of the term, until it is filed in the court which rendered the judgment. It is the filing of the writ that removes the record from the inferior to the appellate court, and the period of limitation prescribed by the act of Congress must be calculated accordingly.'

As Mr. Justice Bradley said in Credit Co. v. Arkansas C. R. Co. \n128 U.S. 261\n, 32 L. ed. 449, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 107:\n'An appeal cannot be said to be 'taken' any more than a writ of error can be said to be 'brought' until it is, in some way, presented to the court which made the decree appealed from, thereby putting an end to its jurisdiction over the cause, and making it its duty to send it to the appellate court.' \n\n[215 U.S. 541, 544]\n\u00a0\n There the appeal was allowed by Mr. Justice Miller on the last day on which an appeal could be taken (Rev. Stat.  1008), but was not presented to the court below nor filed with the clerk until five days after the prescribed time had expired. It was held that the appeal must be dismissed, and Mr. Justice Bradley added:\n\n'The attempt made, in this case, to anticipate the actual time of presenting and filing the appeal, by entering an order nunc pro tunc, does not help the case. When the time for taking an appeal has expired, it cannot be arrested or called back by a simple order of court. If it could be, the law which limits the time within which an appeal can be taken would be a dead letter.'\n\n In Farrar v. Churchill, \n135 U.S. 609\n, 34 L. ed. 246, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 771, it was held that a cross appeal in equity, like other appeals, must be entered within the time limited, calculating from the date of the decree, and because in that case petition, order, and bond were not filed in the circuit court until after the lapse of two years from the entry of the decree, the cross appeal was dismissed. It was ruled also that the failure to file an assignment of errors, although required by the act of Congress and the rule of court, was not jurisdictional, and could be waived. Rev. Stat.  997, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 712; Rule 11; Independent School Dist. v. Hall, \n106 U.S. 428\n, 27 L. ed. 237, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 417.\n In Conboy v. First National Bank, \n203 U.S. 141\n, 51 L. ed. 128, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 50, it was held that the time within which an appeal may be taken under  25b of the bankruptcy act1 and general order in bankruptcy 36 runs from the entry of the original judgment or decree, and when it has expired is not revived by a petition for a rehearing, and that where the right of appeal has been lost, appellant cannot reinvest himself with that right by filing such petition; and Credit Co. v. Arkansas C. R. Co. \n128 \nU.S. 258, 261\n, 32 S. L. ed. 448, 449, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 107, was cited with approval.\n Petitioner contends that the delay in settling the bill of exceptions was not its fault, but was attributable to the judicial engagements of the trial judge, and that until the bill of exceptions was settled its counsel could not intelligently \n\n[215 U.S. 541, 545]\n\u00a0\n prepare the assignment of errors which should accompany the petition for the writ of error. But the assignment of errors does not require the previous settlement of the bill of exceptions, and can be formulated before that takes place. In Waldron v. Waldron, \n156 U.S. 361\n, 39 L. ed. 453, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 383, cited in the opinion of the court of appeals, the judgment was entered July 10, 1890, and the writ of error was dated July 15, 1890, but the bill of exceptions was not settled during the term, and, because of subsequent delays, not until February, 1891, yet this court held it to be in time in the circumstances. But the writ of error had already issued and been deposited with the clerk of the trial court, and after that the time for complying with it might, by proper authority, be enlarged. Mussina v. Cavazos, 6 Wall. 355, 18 L. ed. 810.\n As we have stated, the assignment of errors is not a jurisdictional requirement, and although, by the rule, errors not assigned would be disregarded, the court might, at its option, notice a plain error not assigned or specified.\n The delay in the present case in taking out the writ of error was not the act of the court, but of petitioner. At all events, petitioner might have brought its writ of error within the time prescribed by statute, and the court had no power to allow it after the time limited had expired.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 553 (U.

The judgment was entered in the supreme court of New York by an order of the court of appeals of the same state. 190 N. Y. 458, 123 Am. St. Rep. 585, 83 N. E. 569.\n The facts, in substance, are: Silas Olmsted, a resident of the state of New York, died in that state in 1874, devising by his will, duly probated, a one-half interest in certain real estate in New York to his son, Benjamin F. Olmsted, with the remainder over to the lawful issue of said Benjamin. In 1850, Benjamin F. Olmsted, while a resident of the state of New York, married Mary Jane Olmsted, of the state of New York, and lived with her in that state until January, 1870. Benjamin F. Olmsted had children by that marriage, who are defendants in error in this case. On February 28, 1874, without procuring a divorce from his first wife, Benjamin F. Olmsted went through a marriage ceremony in New Jersey with Sarah Louise Welchman. Two children, John H. and William H. Olmsted, who are the plaintiffs in error in this case, were born, in the state of New Jersey, of this attempted marriage. Thereafter, in 1880, Benjamin F. Olmsted and Sarah Louise Welchman, with their two children, went to live in the state of Michigan. In 1882, Benjamin F. Olmsted secured a divorce from his first wife, mary Jane Olmsted, in accordance with the laws of Michigan, in the circuit court of Wayne county, Michigan. Service was made of process by publication in a Detroit newspaper, and no personal service was made on Mary Jane Olmsted, nor did she appear in the action, judgment being granted by default. On August 22, 1882, Benjamin F. Olmsted and Sarah Louise Welchman were married in the state of Michigan. By the provision of a statute enacted in that state in 1881, children born out of wedlock became legitimate upon the subsequent marriage of \n\n[216 U.S. 386, 391]\n\u00a0\n their parents. In January, 1883, in an action in the supreme court of New York, a decree of separation and for alimony was granted to Mary Jane Olmsted from her husband, Benjamin F. Olmsted. Benjamin F. Olmsted did not appear in that action, and the record contains no evidence of service of summons upon him. He was represented by counsel on a motion to sequestrate his property, and upon appeal from an order thereon. The judgment was affirmed. January 22, 1902, and Benjamin F. olmsted 30, 1900; Mary Jane Olmsted died Janyary 22, 1902, and Benjamin F. Olmsted July 16, 1905\n\n\n The action was for partition of the New York real estate devised under the will of Silas Olmsted. The plaintiffs in error, John H. and William H. Olmsted, children of the marriage with Sarah Louise Welchman, claim the right to participate equally with the children of Benjamin F. Olmsted and mary Jane Olmsted, as lawful issue of Benjamin F. Olmsted, in the real estate located in the state of New York, and devised under the will of Silas Olmsted. The supreme court of New York, by its judgment, denied the right of the plaintiffs in error to thus participate.\n The opinion delivered in the New York court of appeals shows that its decision was rested, in part, upon the invalidity of the Michigan marriage, because the courts of Michigan had never obtained jurisdiction over Mary Jane Olmstead, the first wife of Benjamin F. Olmsted. For that view the learned court, in denying that it was bound to give full faith and credit to such a decree and to the Michigan statute of 1881, cited Re Kimball, 155 N. Y. 68, 49 N. E. 331; Winston v. Winston, 165 N. Y. 555, 59 N. E. 273; Haddock v. Haddock, \n201 U.S. 562\n, 50 L. ed. 867, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 525, 5 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 1; Atherton v. Atherton, 155 N. Y. 129, 40 L.R.A. 291, 63 Am. St. Rep. 650, 49 N. E. 933, \n181 U.S. 155\n, 45 L. ed. 794, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 544.\n It also puts its decision on the ground that the Michigan statute of 1881, legitimating the children born previous to marriage, could not have the effect of admitting them to participate in the division of the real estate in the state of New York, as it was passed long after the death of Silas \n\n[216 U.S. 386, 392]\n\u00a0\n Olmsted, and the probate of his will, under which his legitimate grandchildren had vested estates as remaindermen, subject to the life use in the father. And further, said the court of appeals of New York, in speaking of the contention that the Michigan act should be given full faith and credit in the state of New York:\n'Should we sanction the doctrine contended for, then the legislature in any state could, in effect, nullify our own statutes and deprive our own citizens of property which, under our laws, they had become lawfully vested with and entitled to receive. Not only this, but the statute of Michigan, passed in 1881, could change the provisions of a will executed here and probated in 1874, bringing in persons as remaindermen who, under the provisions of the will, were not remaindermen, nor entitled to share in the estate. We think this should not be permitted.'\n\n By the laws of New York, 1895, chap. 531, it is provided:\n'Section 1. All illegitimate children whose parents have heretofore intermarried, or shall hereafter intermarry, shall thereby become legitimatized and shall be considered legitimate for all purposes. Such children shall enjoy all the rights and privileges of legitimate children, provided, however, that vested interests or estates shall not be devested or affected by this act.'\n\n By chapter 272 of the laws of New York of 1896, vol. 1, it is provided,  18:\n'An illegitimate child whose parents have heretofore intermarried, or shall hereafter intermarry, shall thereby become legitimatized and shall be considered legitimate for all purposes, entitled to all the rights and privileges of a legitimate child; but an estate or interest vested [or trust created] before the marriage of the parents of such child shall not be devested or affected by reason of such child being legitimatized.'\n\n The question, therefore, is as to the title to real estate in the state of New York. Does the full faith and credit clause of the Federal Constitution require that effect be given to the \n\n[216 U.S. 386, 393]\n\u00a0\n Michigan act of 1881, under the circumstances which we have detailed?\n In Clarke v. Clarke, \n178 U.S. 186\n, 44 L. ed. 1028, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 873, the question was as to the effect to be given to a judgment rendered in the supreme court of South Carolina in the courts of the state of Connecticut, respecting real estate situated in the latter state. The South Carolina court held that a certain will worked an equitable conversion into personalty at the time of the death of the testatrix of all her real estate, wherever situated, and that the executor of the will was authorized to administer the same as personalty, and to sell and convey the same for the purpose of executing the will. The supreme court of Connecticut refused to follow the judgment of the supreme court of South Carolina, and the case was brought here under the full faith and credit clause. This court, in disposing of the question, said:\n'It is a doctrine firmly established that the law of a state in which land is situated controls and governs its transmission by will or its passage in case of intestacy. This familiar rule has been frequently declared by this court, a recent statement thereof being contained in the opinion delivered in DeVaughn v. Hutchinson, \n165 U.S. 566\n, 41 L. ed. 827, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 461, where the court said (p. 570):\n\n\"It is a principle firmly established that to the law of the state in which the land is situated we must look for the rules which govern its descent, alienation, and transfer, and for the effect and construction of wills and other conveyances. United States v. Crosby, 7 Cranch, 115, 3 L. ed. 287; Clark v. Graham, 6 Wheat. 577, 5 L. ed. 334; McGoon v. Scales, 9 Wall. 23, 19 L. ed. 545; Brine v. Hartford F. Ins. Co. \n96 U.S. 627\n, 24 L. ed. 858.\"\n\n In speaking of the contention of the plaintiff in error, that the South Carolina judgment must be given full force and effect, the court further said:\n'The proposition relied on, therefore, is this although the court of last resort of Connecticut (declaring the law of that state) has held that the real estate in question had not become \n\n[216 U.S. 386, 394]\n\u00a0\n personal property by virtue of the will of Mrs. Clarke, nevertheless it should have decided to the contrary, because a court of South Carolina had so decreed. This, however, is but to argue that the law declared by the South Carolina court should control the passage by will of land in Connecticut, and therefore is equivalent to denying the correctness of the elementary proposition that the law of Connecticut, where the real estate is situated, governed in such a case.'\n\n In the case of Fall v. Eastin, decided at this term, \n215 U.S. 1\n, 54 L. ed. --, 23 L.R.A.(N.S.) 924, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 3, the same principle was recognized. In that case it was held that a deed made by a master, by order of the court, in the state of Washington, in execution of a decree where the court had jurisdiction of the parties, did not have any efficacy as to the title to real estate beyond the jurisdiction of the court. It is unnecessary to review the previous cases from this court; a number of them are examined in the opinion in Fall v. Eastin.\n After stating the principle that the disposition of real estate, whether by deed, descent, or otherwise, must be governed by the laws of the state where the real estate is situated, this court said (\n215 U.S. 12\n):\n'This doctrine is entirely consistent with the provision of the Constitution of the United States, which requires a judgment in any state to be given full faith and credit in the courts of every other state. This provision does not extend the jurisdiction of the courts of one state to property situated in another, but only makes the judgment rendered conclusive on the merits of the claim or subject-matter of the suit. 'It does not carry with it into another state the efficacy of a judgment upon property or persons, to be enforced by execution. To give it the force of a judgment in another state, it must become a judgment there; and can only be executed in the latter as its laws permit.' M'Elmoyle v. Cohen, 13 Pet. 312, 10 L. ed. 177.'\n\n The principle established by these cases is applicable to the case at bar. The full faith and credit clause of the Constitu- \n\n[216 U.S. 386, 395]\n\u00a0\n tion applies with no more effect to the legislative acts of a foreign state than it does to the judgments of the courts of such state. The controversy herein concerns an interest in real estate located in the state of New York. Under a will probated in the state of New York, where the land is situated, it was devised to the lawful issue of Benjamin F. Olmsted. The contention of the plaintiffs in error is that by the act of 1881 of the state of Michigan, they had become legitimate, and are accordingly entitled to participate in the division of the estate. To this contention the highest court of the state of New York has answered that neither the law of the state of Michigan nor the act of the state of New York, legitimating children, under such circumstances, can have the effect and force of disturbing interests already vested when the acts were passed.\n We think there is nothing in the due faith and credit clause which requires the courts of New York to give the effect contended for to the Michigan statute. The legislature of Michigan had no power to pass an act which would affect the transmission of title to lands located in the state of New York. No more had it power to legislate concerning the titles to lands in New York than the courts of Michigan, by their judgments, would have authority to adjudicate such rights.\n We are not concerned with the correctness of the decision of the court of appeals of New York, interpreting its statutes and applying the law of its jurisdiction to the construction of the will of Silas Olmsted. We hold that there is nothing in the Federal Constitution requiring the courts of the state of New York to give force and effect to the statute of the state of Michigan, so as to control the devolution of title to lands in New York.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","129":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nONG CHANG WING v. U S(1910)\nNo. 418\nArgued: October 21, 1910Decided: November 7, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles F. Consaul, Charles C. Heltman, and Frank B. Ingersoll for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[218 U.S. 272, 275]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edwin P. Grosvenor and Assistant Attorney General William S. Kenyon for defendant in error.\n\n\n[218 U.S. 272, 277]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiffs in error bring this case here for review by writ of error to the supreme court of the Philippine Islands, upon the ground that the effect of the judgment of that court has been to deprive them of due process of law, in violation of  5 of the act of Congress of July 1, 1902 ( 32 Stat. at L. 692, chap. 1369), enacting the due process clause of the Federal Constitution as a part of the statute for the government of those islands. No other question is presented in the record which we can review.\n The plaintiffs in error were tried, convicted, and sentenced on October 4, 1907, in the court of first instance, for violation of  343 of the Philippine Penal Code, which makes it an offense to conduct a gambling house, or to be a banker therein. Plaintiffs in error were sentenced in the court of first instance to two months and one day of arresto mayor, with the accessories of  61, and to pay a fine of 625 pesetas, and in default thereof to suffer subsidiary imprisonment, not to exceed one third of the principal penalty, and costs.\n Upon appeal to the supreme court of the Philippine Islands, that court held that the guilt of the appellants was fully established, and affirmed the judgment of the court of first instance. In the supreme court the plaintiffs in error made the objection, which is the foundation of the proceedings here, that they were convicted under the provisions of article 343 of the Philippine Code for an \n\n[218 U.S. 272, 278]\n\u00a0\n offense committed on the 15th of September, 1907; that thereafter the Philippine Commission, on October 9, 1907, by an act numbered 1757, repealed, among others, article 343 of the Philippine Penal Code, and that consequently the court had no authority to impose upon the appellants the penalty prescribed in the repealed article of the Code. The supreme court of the islands denied this contention upon the authority of another decision in the same court. United States v. Cuna, 12 Philippine, 241. A reference to the Cuna Case shows that the supreme court of the Philippines, construing the articles of the local Penal Code, and applying what was deemed the applicable Spanish law, held that whether an act was punishable after the repeal of the act under which it was undertaken to be inflicted depended upon whether or not, at the time of the commission of the act, there was a law in force which penalized it. The court reserved the question whether the punishment provided in the repealing act could alone be inflicted if such penalty is more favorable to the accused than that prescribed in the former act, because of the provisions of article 22 of the Code, which provides that penal laws shall have a retroactive effect in so far as they favor persons convicted of a crime or misdemeanor.\n It appears that the new act, No. 1757, which took the place of the repealed act, article No. 343 of the Philippine Penal Code, did not undertake to wipe out the offense of gambling, or keeping a gambling house in the Philippine Islands, but substantially re-enacted the former law with more elaboration and detail in its provisions than were contained in the former law.\n In the new act  2 defines a gambling house to be a building or structure or vessel, or part thereof, in which gambling is frequently carried on. Under article 343 of the Penal Code of the Philippine Islands, as it existed when the sentence in this case was imposed, the bankers \n\n[218 U.S. 272, 279]\n\u00a0\n and proprietors of houses where games of chance, stakes, or hazard are played were punished. The decision of the court of first instance, found in the record in this case, held that, in order to punish the crime of gambling, in accordance with article 343 of the Penal Code, it must appear that the house where the gambling took place was a house devoted to encouraging gambling, as held in various decisions of the Supreme Court of Spain applicable to the case at bar, and that such facts had been fully established by the proof in the case.\n The sentence imposed was within the limits provided in act No. 1757, under which the keeping of a gambling house can be punished. The case, therefore, presented for our consideration, is one of conviction under a statute which was repealed after the conviction and sentence in the court of first instance, the repealing act also providing for the punishment of the same offense, and within limitations not exceeded by the sentence imposed under the former act.\n The precise question then is, Did the supreme court of the Philippine Islands deny the plaintiffs in error due process of law in affirming a conviction under the circumstances stated? It is argued that the supreme court of the Philippines misapplied the provisions of the Penal Code and the Spanish law in the light of which it was interpreted. On the part of the government it is insisted that, even at common law, the affirmation of a conviction under a law valid when it was had was not erroneous, and that it was within the power of a reviewing court so to do; but we are not concerned with this question. Our sole province is to determine whether the judgment of the supreme court of the Philippine Islands amounts to a denial of due process of law.\n This court has had frequent occasion to consider the requirements of due process of law as applied to criminal procedure, and, generally speaking, it may be said that \n\n[218 U.S. 272, 280]\n\u00a0\n if an accused has been heard in a court of competent jurisdiction, and proceeded against under the orderly processes of law, and only punished after inquiry and investigation, upon notice to him, with an opportunity to be heard, and a judgment awarded within the authority of a constitutional law, then he has had due process of law. Rogers v. Peck, \n199 U.S. 435\n, 50 L. ed. 260, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 87; Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 U.S. 78\n, 53 L. ed. 97, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 14, and the cases therein cited.\n In the present case there can be no doubt that the lawmaking power in the Philippine Islands could, by statutory enactment, have preserved the right to prosecute and punish offenses committed in violation of the former law while in force in the islands, notwithstanding the repeal of the act. The effect of the decision of the Philippine supreme court is to hold that under the law and local statutes, the repealing act re-enacting substantially the former law, and not increasing the punishment of the accused, the right still exists to punish the accused for an offense of which they were convicted and sentenced before the passage of the later act. In other words, the effect of the decision construing the local law is to accomplish what it was clearly within the power of the legislative authority to do by an express act saving the right to proceed as to offenses already committed. The accused have not been punished for a crime which was not punishable when committed by the sentence imposed. The supreme court has only held that the right to impose the penalty of the law under the Philippine Penal Code has not been taken away by the subsequent statute. We are unable to see that due process of law, which is the right of a person accused of a crime, when prosecuted within a jurisdiction wherein the Constitution of the United States, or a statute embracing its provisions, is in force, has been denied.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands will be affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","130":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOSBORN v. FROYSETH(1910)\nNo. 395\nArgued: Decided: March 14, 1910\n\n\n\n This was an action of ejectment to recover the southeast quarter of section 7, township 119, range 40, in Chippewa county, Minnesota. A jury was waived and the case tried by the court, which made a finding of facts upon which judgment was entered for the defendant. Upon appeal to the supreme court of the state, this judgment was affirmed. \n\n[216 U.S. 571, 572]\n\u00a0\n 107 Minn. 568, 119 N. W. 1135. Thereupon, in due course, this writ of error was sued out by the original plaintiffs.\n The plaintiffs claim title under a land grant made by Congress, July 4, 1866 [14 Stat. at L. 87, chap. 168], known as the Hastings & Dakota Railway land grant. The premises are not within the place limits of that grant, but are included within the indemnity limits of the line of railroad as located, and were withdrawn from a settlement for the benefit of the grant on July 12, 1866, and again by a modified order of April 22, 1868. On May 26, 1883, the Hastings & Dakota Railway Company, for whose benefit the grant was made, and hereafter referred to as the railway company, attempted to select the land in question, together with other lands within the indemnity limits of the grant, but the selection was rejected by the local land office of the district. Upon appeal, this action was affirmed by the Secretary of the Interior on October 23, 1891. This attempted selection was refused, because not made in accordance with the rules of the Department, requiring, as a condition precedent, that there should be furnished by the railroad company a list of the lands lost within place limits for which lands in lieu were selected. On July 22, 1890, under the land grant adjustment act of March 3, 1887 (24 Stat. at L. 556, chap. 376, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1595), said land grant was adjusted in the Land Department of the United States, and it was found that there existed a deficiency in the place limits of the grant of 922, 182 acres, and that all of the lands within the indemnity limits applicable to cover such loss aggregated less than 100,000 acres. On May 28, 1891, pursuant to instructions from the Secretary of the Interior, the Commissioner of the General Land Office directed the officers of the proper local office that, after giving notice, they should restore to the public domain and open to settlement all the lands in the indemnity limits of said land grant, 'not embracing selections heretofore made and applied for by said company.'\n After the final rejection, on October 23, 1891, of the original selection made in 1883, the predecessor of the plaintiffs in title \n\n[216 U.S. 571, 573]\n\u00a0\n made a second selection on October 29, 1891, of the land in suit, together with other lands, which last selection was in due form and in full compliance with the rules of the Department, and thereafter, through steps not necessary to be stated, the title acquired by this second selection under said grant was vested in the plaintiffs in error.\n The tenth, eleventh, and twelfth findings of fact are in these words:\n'Tenth. At the time of said selection, the land in question was not vacant, but was occupied by the defendant, Peter Froyseth, as hereinafter found.\n\n'Eleventh. Said selection was not approved by the Secretary of the Interior until 1901\n\n\n\n'Twelfth. That the defendant, on the 1st day of November, 1888, declared his intention to become a citizen of the United States, and was, after said date, in all respects qualified and entitled to make a homestead entry under the laws of the United States, and, on May 15th, 1889, he settled upon and went into possession of the land in controversy, with intent to enter upon and claim the same as a homestead, and with the view of making it his home, and has continued in possession and resided thereon ever since, and his residence and improvements were at all times sufficient to comply with the requirements of the homestead laws of the United States, and at the time of the commencement of this action, such improvements exceeded in value the sum of seven hundred dollars ($700); that the defendant has never owned or occupied other real estate. That he became a full citizen of the United States on June 9, 1897, and been such citizen ever since. On the 3d day of November, 1891, the defendant offered, at the proper land office, a homestead entry in due form for said land, which filing was refused by the local land officers solely on the ground that said land was withdrawn from settlement by the executive withdrawal of April 22d, 1868, from which refusal the defendant duly appealed, which appeal remained pending in the Land Depart- \n\n[216 U.S. 571, 574]\n\u00a0\n ment until September 11th, 1894, on which date the rejection of said filing by the local land officers was affirmed. From the decision of the General Land officers the defendant appealed to the Secretary of the Interior, which appeal was pending until the 25th day of January, 1896, when the decision of the General Land Office of September 11th, 1894, was affirmed. That the defendant did all that was in his power to secure the land as his homestead.'\n\n Messrs. Aldis B. Browne, Alexander Britton, and Evans Browne for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. C. A. Fosnes for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Lurton, after making the foregoing statement of facts, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The facts found show that on May 15, 1889, the defendant in error, being in every way qualified, entered upon the land in question with the intention of claiming it as a homestead, and has ever since continued in possession, residing thereon with his family, and that his improvements have at all times been such as to comply with the homestead laws, and exceeded in value $700 when this action of ejectment was started. On November 3, 1891, he offered at the proper land office a homestead entry, in due form, for said land. This was rejected. Upon appeal the decision was affirmed by the Secretary of the Interior on September 11, 1894. But the facts found in the trial court, and upon which the supreme court of Minnesota made its decision, show that this entry was refused by the local land office 'solely on the ground that said land was withdrawn from settlement by the executive withdrawal of April 22, 1868.' A rejection upon the ground stated was not authorized, for the Secretary of the Interior had no authority to withdraw from settlement lands within the indemnity limits of the grant which had not been before selected and approved by \n\n[216 U.S. 571, 575]\n\u00a0\n him. Sjoli v. Dreschel, \n199 U.S. 564\n, 50 L. ed. 311, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 154, and cases cited. It has been insisted that although the local land office rejected the application for the reason stated, the affirmance, upon his appeal, was because his homestead application, instead of alleging that he had settled upon the land at some date prior to the selection made by the railroad company on October 29, 1891, simply alleged, that 'he resides on the described land.' This contention as to the grounds of the affirmance is only made out by the introduction now for the first time of the decision of the Secretary of the Interior, under date of January 25, 1896. But that simply affirms the decision of the Commissioner made September 11, 1894, affirming the rejection made by the local land office, and gives no reason for the affirmance. This decision is sought to be explained by what purports to be a copy of an official communication under date of September 11, 1894, from the Commissioner to the local land register and receiver, notifying him that his rejection of a number of homestead entries, including that of Froyseth, on the indemnity lands in question, had been affirmed. Among other matters in that communication, it is stated, 'that none of the applicants allege that the lands were settled upon either by themselves or others at the date of the said selections in October, 1891, by the Hastings & Dakota Company, nor do the records show that the lands were otherwise than vacant and subject to such selection at said date.' If this be competent for our consideration upon this writ of error, it being no part of the record, it does not appear that the applicant was ever advised of this supposed defect in his affidavit. The local office simply advised him that its decision had been affirmed. The matter was remediable, as the fact was that his settlement was made months prior to his application affidavit. But, assuming that the application in its then form was defective, it is of no legal consequence in determining the validity of the title of the plaintiffs in error. This was a plain common-law action of ejectment. The plaintiffs must recover, if at all, upon the \n\n[216 U.S. 571, 576]\n\u00a0\n legal title. That the defendant's application for a homestead has not yet ripened into a legal title is of no moment if the plaintiffs are unable to show a complete and superior legal title. The plain effect of the settlement made upon the land here in controversy before any valid selection of the same land by the railroad company, under its grant, was to initiate a homestead right. That settlement and possession continued from the time it was first made, and when, in October 1891, the Hastings & Dakota Railroad, or its successors in title, attempted to select that land as indemnity land, the land in question was in the actual occupancy of Froyseth, claiming it as a homestead. It had, by such settlement, been segregated from the lands subject to selection, and in a contest between such a homesteader and those claiming under selections subsequently made of lieu lands, the claim of the former is the better claim. Under the act of May 14, 1880 (chap. 89, 21 Stat. at L. 141,  3, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1393), the right of one settling in good faith for the purpose of claiming a homestead 'relates back to the date of settlement.' Nelson v. Northern P. R. Co. \n188 U.S. 108\n, 47 L. ed. 406, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 302; Sjoli v. Dreschel, \n199 U.S. 564\n, 50 L. ed. 311, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 154; St. Paul, M. & M. R. Co. v. Donohue, \n210 U.S. 21\n, 52 L. ed. 941, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 600. But it is urged that the original selection made May 26, 1883, was valid, and operated to vest the title as of that date in the railroad company. There is nothing peculiar in the act of July 4, 1866, which protected indemnity lands against settlement upon the filing of a map showing definite location of the railroad. The grant was one of every alternate section of land, designated by odd numbers, to the amount of five alternate sections per mile on each side of the road. Then follows the indemnity provision, in these words:\n'But in case it shall appear that the United States have, when the lines or route of said roads are definitely located, sold any section, or part thereof, granted as aforesaid, or that the right of pre-emption or homestead settlement has attached to the same, or that the same has been reserved by the United \n\n[216 U.S. 571, 577]\n\u00a0\n States for any purpose whatever, then it shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Interior to cause to be selected, for the purposes aforesaid, from the public lands of the United States, nearest to the tiers of sections above specified, so much land in alternate sections or parts of sections designated by odd numbers, as shall be equal to such lands as the United States have sold, reserved, or otherwise appropriated, or to which the right of homestead settlement or pre-emption has attached, as aforesaid, which lands, thus indicated by odd numbers and sections, by the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, shall be held by,' etc.\n\n The rejection by the Secretary of the Interior of the selection made in 1883 is fatal to any claim now made to carry back the title of the plaintiffs in error to that selection. The right to any land within the indemnity limits of the grant, as has been often decided, depended upon the inquiry whether deficiencies had been established within the place limits, and also whether the lands selected in place of such lost lands were, at the time, subject to such appropriation. Thus, if either preemption or homestead rights had been initiated before such selection, the parcels to which such right had attached were not subject to appropriation as indemnity lands. The function of the Secretary of the Interior was therefore judicial, and not ministerial. Wisconsin C. R. Co. v. Price County, \n133 \nU.S. 496, 512\n, 33 S. L. ed. 687, 695, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 341, 347. In the case cited above, this court said:\n'Until the selections were approved there were no selections in fact, only preliminary proceedings taken for that purpose; and the indemnity lands remained unaffected in their title. Until then, the lands which might be taken as indemnity were incapable of identification; the proposed selections remained the property of the United States. The government was, indeed, under a promise to give the company indemnity lands in lieu of what might be lost by the causes mentioned. But such promise passed no title, and, until it was executed, created no legal interest which could be enforced in the courts. The doctrine that, until selection \n\n[216 U.S. 571, 578]\n\u00a0\n made, no title vests in any indemnity lands, has been recognized in several decisions of this court. Thus, in Ryan v. Central P. R. Co. \n99 \nU.S. 382, 386\n, 25 S. L. ed. 305, in considering a grant of land by Congress, in aid of the construction of a railroad similar in its general features to the one in this case, the court said: 'Under this statute, when the road was located and the maps were made, the right of the company to the odd sections first named became ipso facto fixed and absolute. With respect to the 'lieu lands,' as they are called, the right was only a float, and attached to no specific tracts until the selection was actually made in the manner prescribed.' And again, speaking of a deficiency in the land granted, it said: 'It was within the secondary or indemnity territory where that deficiency was to be supplied. The railroad company had not and could not have any claim to it until specially selected, as it was for that purpose.\"\n\n In Sjoli v. Dreschel, \n199 \nU.S. 564, 566\n, 50 S. L. ed. 311, 312, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 154, 155, this court said:\n'That up to the time such approval is given, lands within indemnity limits, although embraced by the company's list of selections, are subject to be disposed of by the United States, or to be settled upon and occupied under the pre-emption and homestead laws of the United States.'\n\n But it is urged that the mere fact that there was no record evidence of the homestead claim when the selections of 1891 were made was enough to give efficacy to that selection and vest the legal title under the patents thereafter issued. But this is answered by what we have already said; namely, that if, at that date, this land was actually occupied by one qualified under the law, who had entered and settled thereon before that time, with the intent to claim it as a homestead, the land had ceased to be public land, and as such subject to selection as lieu land.\n We find no error in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Minnesota, and it is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Brewer did not sit in this case. \n\n\n\n","131":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOWEN v.

[Seal]\n The question in the case turns upon the construction of the following provision of the contract: 'And in the contingency of the fees not being provided for by legislation, as per the contract of the Eastern Cherokee Council aforesaid, but upon proof of services, then, and in that event, each of the parties hereto shall prove service independently of the other, and said Owen shall not be expected, out of fees collected for his \n\n[217 U.S. 488, 490]\n\u00a0\n personal service, to pay the fees to the said Dudley and Michener, but it is understand and agreed that he will, in such a contingency, do what he can to assist Dudley and Michener to collect the fees hereby contracted by them.' Certain facts were found by the trial court as helping to clear up, with the statute law then existing, the ambiguity of the provision. That court deduced from them a meaning favorable to plaintiff in error. The court of appeals found in them evidence of a different meaning, and reversed the judgment of the trial court. The facts found, in addition to the agreement, are as follows:\n'On March 20, 1905, the court of claims rendered a judgment in the case of the Eastern Cherokees against the United States. On April 17, 1905, the defendant Owen addressed the following letter to the plaintiffs:\n\n'The Southern,\n\n'St. Louis, April 17, 1905.\n\n'Dudley & Michener,\n\n'Washington, D. C.\n\n'Gentlemen:--\n\n'I expect to be at Riggs House about April 28th, 1905, and wish by that time you would make up a careful affidavit of services rendered in case under contract of May 28, '02, as I am preparing decree and wish to protect your fee.\n\n'Yours truly,\n\n'R. L. Owen.\n\n'A few days thereafter the plaintiff Michener met the defendant, and was told by him that he had abandoned the purpose to make application for fees at that time, and would postpone said application until after the Supreme Court of the United States, to which the said case was to be appealed, had acted thereon, and the application was so postponed by the defendant, Owen. The judgment of the court of claims was affirmed by the Supreme Court with a slight modification. After the return of the mandate of the Supreme Court to the court of claims, the defendant, Owen, who was one of the attorneys of record in the case in the court of claims, together with his coattorney of record, R. V. Belt, made an applica- \n\n[217 U.S. 488, 491]\n\u00a0\n tion to the court of claims for the allowance of 15 per cent of the judgment to them as their fee. By an agreement between the said Owen and Belt and certain of their associate attorneys, other than the plaintiffs, and without notice from defendant to the plaintiffs, the court apportioned the fee of 15 per cent among said Owen and Belt and those associate attorneys, in accordance with their several contracts.\n\n'Under the rules of the court of claims, the attorneys of record had absolute control of the distribution of the fee allowed by the court, and the court, not recognizing any associate counsel, save as directed by the attorneys of record, the plaintiffs could not, under the rules of the court, have claimed any fee except by permission of the said attorneys of record.\n\n'Under said decree the defendant, Owen, was allowed and was paid the full amount of fees contemplated to be received by him according to the terms of the said contract between him and Dudley & Michener.\n\n'The plaintiffs were not parties to the said agreement between Owen and Belt, as attorneys of record, and said associate counsel, and had no further notice from Owen that any application was to be made to the court to apportion fees to any counsel except attorneys of record, nor were they ever further notified by the defendant to prepare and render proof of their services after the interview between the plaintiff Michener and the defendant, in April, 1905.'\n\n The trial court also found that defendants in error gave plaintiff in error 'their cooperation, assistance, and services in the prosecution and collection of the claim referred to in said contract, as said contract provided they should do,' and that they have not been paid anything therefor.\n The contentions of the parties are in sharp opposition. Plaintiff in error contends that the 'contingency' provided for in the passage which we have quoted was direct and positive legislation, fixing his fee, and cites instances of such legislation as examples in the minds and intention of the parties. \n\n[217 U.S. 488, 492]\n\u00a0\n Defendants in error contend that the legislation contemplated was that which would exempt plaintiff in error from making proof of service to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and to the Secretary of the Interior under  2103 to 2106, both inclusive, of the Revised Statutes of the United States. And that the acts of Congress which we shall presently refer to constitute such legislation.\n That some legislation there might be is conceded by both parties. That some proof of service might become necessary is also conceded by both parties. The disagreement is as to what tribunal, whether the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs or the court of claims. There was some legislation, and this is urged by defendants in error as proof of their contention; there was, in a sense, a proof of services required, and this is urged by plaintiff in error as a support of his contention. It must therefore be conceded that each contention has plausible support, and the different meanings which the lower courts assigned to the agreement show its ambiguity. The trial court, as we have seen, taking the view contended for by plaintiff in error; the court of appeals, that urged by defendants in error; and decided that the contract referred to the proof of services required by  2103 to 2106.\n Those sections provide that no agreement shall be made by any person with any tribe of Indians or individual Indians not citizens of the United States (italics ours) unless the agreement be in writing and in duplicate, and be executed before a judge of a court, and 'bear the approval of the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs indorsed upon it.' Many other formalities are prescribed, and it is provided that contracts and agreements made in violation of the section 'shall be null and void, and all money or other thing of value, in excess of the amount provided by the Commissioner and the Secretary for such services, may be recovered by suit in the name of the United States, regardless of the amount in controversy.' \n\n[217 U.S. 488, 493]\n\u00a0\n By  2104 it is provided that no money shall be paid under such contract except for fees due thereunder and by the United States, through its officers or agents, and not until a sworn statement be filed with the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, showing each particular act of service, giving date and fact in detail, 'and the Secretary of the Interior and Commissioner of Indian Affairs shall determine therefrom whether, in their judgment, such contract or agreement has been complied with or fulfilled; if so, the same may be paid; but if not, it shall be paid in proportion to the services rendered under the contract.' It is provided in  2105 that if any person receives money contrary to the provisions of the preceding section, he shall forfeit the sum paid, and be punished by fine and imprisonment.\n It will be observed that these provisions apply to Indians not citizens of the United States, and it is pointed out that the Eastern Cherokees became citizens March 3, 1901 (31 Stat. at L. 1447, chap. 868). That may be true, but the foundation of Owen's right to the fee was under an agreement with John Vaile, and the latter's right to engage Owen depended upon a contract with the Indians, made in February and April 1900; that is, a contract which was made before citizenship had been confrred upon the Indians. It certainly can be contended that when the Vaile contract was made, it was subject to the provision of  2103 et seq., and that the approval of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and the Secretary of the Interior was necessary to give it validity. It is true that it was ratified by the Indians September the 4th, 1901; that is, after they had been made citizens; but the effect of that might be disputed, and there being elements of doubt about it, plaintiff in error and defendants in error well might have supposed the contract would be subject to the provisions of the Revised Statutes, quoted above. The fact that legislation was sought confirms such view. If the Indians, after March 3, 1901, had the same power to contract and the same extent of responsibility as white citizens, their contract would \n\n[217 U.S. 488, 494]\n\u00a0\n need no confirmation by legislation. But such freedom of contract was certainly not supposed to exist. It is not without importance that the first act passed contained a limitation of it, and adopted the proof of services required by the Revised Statutes. That act conferred jurisdiction on the court of claims to hear and determine the claim of the Indians, and provided that any suit brought under it should 'be through attorneys employed and to be compensated in the manner prescribed in  2103 to 2106, both inclusive, of the Revised Statutes of the United States.' [32 Stat. at L. 726, chap. 1375,  68.]\n It must therefore have been a proof of services by sworn statement, as provided in the sections referred to, that the parties contemplated. There were no other provisions in existence, and there is not a circumstance to show that in the legislation that was looked forward to there would be provision for a proof of services which should supercede the contract of Vaile with the Indians, and bn the means through which Owens would be compensated. The legislation which was finally secured cannot be said to have acquired or provided for a 'proof of services' in the sense that those words are used in the contract of plaintiff in error and defendants in error.\n The final act was passed March 3, 1903. It made the Eastern Cherokees, so called, including those in the Cherokee Nation, a band or bands for all purposes of  68 of the act of July 1, 1902 [32 Stat. at L. 726, chap. 1375], and provided that the prosecution of the suit in the court of claims on the part of the Eastern Cherokees should 'be through attorneys employed by their proper authorities, their compensation for expenses and services rendered in relation to such claim to be fixed by the court of claims upon the termination of such suit.' 32 Stat. at L. 996, chap. 994. In other words, it recognized whatever contract of employment that should be made by the Indians with their attorneys, and it gave the court of claims power over the amount of compensation. But that such power might be given, or rather, that there might be a limitation of the amount agreed upon, and therefore a re- \n\n[217 U.S. 488, 495]\n\u00a0\n duction of the amount to be received by the plaintiff in error under the Vaile contract, was contemplated. The agreement recites that he (plaintiff in error) had been employed by Vaile, and that he agrees 'to convey' to defendants in error 'the sum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) out of the fees so placed' to him 'immediately upon the collection, or in the exact proportion as the said fees may be collected' (italics ours). It seems to us, therefore, that the contract contemplated two contingencies and provided for them. (1) That the fee of plaintiff in error might receive reduction, even if it should be specifically provided for by legislation. In such case, the amount to be paid to defendants in error would be proportionately reduced. (2) That if the fee, as fixed by the Vaile contract, should be subject to supervision by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and the proof of services required as provided by  2104, then the parties should make such proof independently.\n It is contended by plaintiff in error that 'the Vaile contract was confessedly invalid and was not enforced, and Owen (plaintiff in error) was not paid by virtue of its validity, but upon 'proof of service.\". The contention as to the invalidity of that contract is made for the first time in a supplemental brief filed by plaintiff in error after the oral argument. The contract had no validity, it is said, 'for the simple reason that there were 32,000 Eastern Cherokees, citizens of the United States, who obviously could not be bound by a few of their numbers.' The purpose of the contention, no doubt, is to show that the contracvt was not, and that proof of services was, the ground of the action of the court of claims. And yet it is conceded that to Vaile was assigned 3 per cent of the fee allowed by the court. Why? it may be asked, and what other evidence is there in the record that plaintiff in error had any authority to appear for the Indians except through his engagement by Vaile? He was one of the attorneys of recore-how did he become such? May we assume that it was in some other way than the record shows? \n\n[217 U.S. 488, 496]\n\u00a0\n The contention, however, has not much relevancy. The agreement sued on states the authority of plaintiff to be the Vaile contract, and the foundation of his power to engage defendants in error. His services and their services get their sanction from that contract, and according to the findings of the trial court he 'was paid the full amount of the fees contemplated to be received by him according to the terms of the said contract between him and Dudley & Michener.'\n Our construction of the contract is fortified by that finding. It is also fortified by the letter which plaintiff in error addressed to the defendants in error April 17, 1905, which is set out in the bill of exceptions, and the subsequent conversation he had with them. It is also fortified by the finding of the trial court that the attorneys of record had absolute control of the distribution of the fees. The latter finding is attacked by plaintiff in error, and it is asserted that it has no justification in the rules of the court of claims, and is contradicted by the fact that fees were allowed others for services. We must take the record as we find it, and under what circumstances fees were allowed others does not appear. But the fact does appear, and we repeat it, because we regard it as especially pertinent, that the plaintiff in error received the fees, and the exact fees, that he expected to receive by his contract with Vaile with aid of legislation, upon which event he promised to pay defendants in error ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for their services. And there is no denial that they rendered them, and no question is made of their value and efficiency.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","132":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPECKHAM v. HENKEL(1910)\nNo. 366\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. Nash Rockwood, Henry E. Davis, and Max D. Steuer for appellant. \n\n[216 U.S. 483, 484]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Jesse C. Adkins and Assistant Attorney General Fowler for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Lurton delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an appeal from a judgment of the circuit court, denying the application of the appellant to be discharged from arrest on a writ of habeas corpus, and remanding him to the custody of the marshal.\n The case differs from the case of Haas v. Henkel, just disposed of [ \n216 U.S. 462\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 249], only in certain particulars; otherwise it is governed by the opinion in that case.\n\n 1. \nPeckham is included in only two of the indictments against Haas, namely Nos. 26,086 and 26,087. The first charges a conspiracy with Edwin S. Holmes, Jr., and Moses Haas to defraud the United States; the other with a conspiracy with Haas, and others unknown, to commit an offense against the United States,-that of bribing Holmes, an assistant statistician in the Department of Agriculture, to do an act in violation of his official duty.\n Neither of the indictments found in the District of Columbia against Peckham includes the count charging a conspiracy to bribe Holmes to falsify one of the official cotton crop reports.\n In all other matters this appeal is controlled by the opinion and judgment in the Haas Case, unless a different result must follow from the facts now to be stated.\n In 1905, three indictments were returned against Peckham, Holmes, and Haas in the supreme court for the District of Columbia, charging them with conspiring to defraud the United States and to commit an offense against the United States. A warrant for Peckham's arrest was issued in the northern district of New York upon a complaint filed with the commissioner for his removal to the District of Columbia for trial. Peckham appeared and waived examination, and gave bail for his appearance in the District of Columbia court to answer the indictments there pending. Subsequently his \n\n[216 U.S. 483, 485]\n\u00a0\n sureties surrendered him, pursuant to  1018, Rev. Stat., U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 719, whereupon the commissioner issued a warrant recommitting him to the custody of the United States marshal for the northern district of New York. Thereupon he applied to District Judge Ray, of that district, for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging, upon the facts stated, that his detention was contrary to law and in violation of the Constitution of the United States, for that the aforesaid indictments did not charge any crime or offense against the United States. Upon a hearing before Judge Ray, the petition was dismissed, the writ denied, and Peckham remanded to the custody of the marshal, and an order made at the same time for his removal to the District of Columbia. From this judgment an appeal was at once allowed to the circuit court of appeals for the second circuit. In consequence of this, Judge Ray directed that the execution of the removal order made by him be stayed until the appeal should be disposed of. That stay order was made January 10, 1906, and was still in force when, in November, 1908, the proceedings for his removal to answer the 1908 indictments were had. The pendency of the proceedings for his removal from the northern district of New York to answer the District of Columbia indictments found in 1905, and of his appeal from the judgment of the circuit court for that district, and the order made staying the removal order made in the proceedings referred to, were shown in evidence before the commissioner in the proceedings under review in the present appeal, as a legal obstacle to any order of removal to answer the 1908 indictments, and also as evidence bearing upon the defense of the statute of limitations as a bar to those indictments. The 1905 indictments are for similar offenses to those charged in the later indictments of 1908; but they are not for the same offenses. They charge conspiracy at a different time and with respect of different cotton reports, and were, therefore, offenses distinct from those included in the later indictments.\n But it is said that while the removal proceedings in the northern district of New York are pending, appellant cannot \n\n[216 U.S. 483, 486]\n\u00a0\n be removed under the later complaint without disregarding the jurisdiction over his person which first attached by virtue of the prior effort to remove him to the District of Columbia. That Peckham is under bond to appear and comply with the order of removal made by Judge Ray, and, therefore, constructively in the custody of his sureties, must be conceded. But if the performance of the condition of that bail bond is rendered impossible by his removal in these subsequent proceedings, at the instance of the United States, the effect may be to exonerate his sureties. Taylor v. Taintor, 16 Wall. 371, 21 L. ed. 290; Beavers v. Haubert, \n198 \nU.S. 77, 85\n, 49 S. L. ed. 950, 953, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 573. But it is said that removal to the District of Columbia is forbidden under Judge Ray's order of January 10, 1906, and that a removal under the order made by the commissioner in the proceedings now under review will invalidate the order of Judge Ray.\n This is a fanciful claim. He will not be removed under or in pursuance of the original order of removal, execution of which has been stayed, but under an order made in an altogether distinct and subsequent proceeding to answer distinct offenses.\n Finally, it is said that the jurisdiction of the court for the northern district of New York, having attached to the person of appellant, must be respected as exclusive until its jurisdiction is exhausted.\n The rule is one of comity only, and has a wide application in civil cases, but a limited one in criminal cases. See Re Johnson, \n167 \nU.S. 120, 125\n, 42 S. L. ed. 103, 104, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 735, and Beavers v. Haubert, \n198 \nU.S. 77, 84\n, 49 S. L. ed. 950, 953, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 573. But when, as here, the subsequent proceedings for the removal of appellant are to answer indictments later found for other and distinct offenses, the question is quite a different one, for the 'cases' are not the same. That they are 'cases' against the same offender is not of itself sufficient to constitute the second proceedings void as an unlawful interference with the jurisdiction of the circuit court for the northern district of New York. The present case differs upon this point from that of Beavers v. Haubert, in that the consent of the court of prior jurisdiction was not obtained as in that. In that case \n\n[216 U.S. 483, 487]\n\u00a0\n the court reserved the question as to 'whether the government had the right of election, without such consent,' to proceed in either of the two districts in which indictments were pending. But there is here no question of electing whether to try in the northern district of New York or in the District of Columbia, but whether it would elect between the two removal proceedings, the object of each being to remove the appellant to the same place for trial. The institution of the second removal proceeding without the consent of the circuit court for the northern district of New York may very well be regarded as an election by the United States, the plaintiff in both cases to abandon the first complaint. But aside from this, and assuming, without deciding, that the removal proceedings were in disregard of the prior proceedings, and therefore erroneous, the jurisdiction of the commissioner was not affected. No constitutional right of the appellant was invaded. A petition for a writ of habeas corpus is not a writ of error. The error, if any, was a mere disregard of a rule of comity, which is not reversible in a proceeding of this character.\n In principle, the case is governed by Beavers v. Haubert, and the final order of the Circuit Court is affirmed.\n\n Brewer, j., concurring:\n I concur in affirming the orders of removal in these cases, but my concurrence must not be taken as holding that the indictments will stand the final test of validity or sufficiency. Assuming that there is a doubt in respect to these matters, as I think there is, and as seems to be suggested by the opinion in No. 367, I am of the opinion that such doubt should be settled by direct action in the court in which the indictments were returned, and not in removal proceedings.\n Mr. Justice McKenna concurs in the result, but reserves opinion whether the facts alleged in the indictment constitute a conspiracy to defraud the United States. \n\n\n\n","133":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPENDLETON v. U S(1910)\nNo. 53\nArgued: January 21, 1910Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. James H. Blount and Henry E. Davis for plaintiff in error. \n\n[216 U.S. 305, 306]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Russell for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Plaintiff in error was convicted of the crime of murder in the court of first instance of the province of Cebu, Philippine Islands, and sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment, which was reduced to seventeen years by the supreme court.\n The assignments of error are as follows:\n'1. The accused has been compelled to be a witness against himself, in violation of article 5 of the law of Congress of July 1, 1902. [32 Stat. at L. 692, chap. 1369.]\n\n'2. The fact that the accused did not offer himself as a witness in his own favor has been used to his prejudice, in violation of his right to remain silent until his guilt be established by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. \n\n[216 U.S. 305, 307]\n\u00a0\n\n'3. The evidence does not show the guilt of accused of the crime imputed to him beyond a reasonable doubt.'\n\n\n The argument to support the first assignment of error is not very tangible. It is based upon an affidavit of defendant that he was subpoenaed as a witness, and obeyed by going to the fiscal's, where he answered questions put to him without knowing that he had a right to refuse, or being notified that he had such right, and not knowing that 'the object of securing his statement was in order to search for proof against him.' The affidavit also states that he was not represented by counsel, and did not know that he had a right to consult a lawyer. Motion was made, presumably based on the affidavit, for an order to the fiscal to return to the defendant the statement, together with all copies of the same, and that the fiscal be prohibited from using the statement in any manner whatever. Nothing seems to have been done with that motion, and subsequently it was repeated and denied on the ground 'that it was not a proper time to make such motion, as the court could not then decide on the admissibility of proofs which had not yet been offered in the cause.' An exception was entered.\n It is not contended that the statement was afterwards used in any way, but the action of the court is urged nevertheless as an error 'so grave and so material,' to use counsel's words, 'as to call for a new trial.'\n The argument to support it is based on suppositions of what might have been done, and the potency of the statement in the hands of the prosecuting officer. 'It left the defendant open, it is said, to the fire of a masked battery.' But the law has no measure to apply to such a situation. Defendant was certainly not disabled from telling the truth in other statements if he wished to make them, and to be able not to tell the truth can hardly be urged as a legal and constitutional right. The assignment of error, therefore, is not well taken.\n The second assignment of error is that the fact that the \n\n[216 U.S. 305, 308]\n\u00a0\n defendant did not offer himself as a witness was used against him. To support this contention, certain remarks of the judge of the trial court in delivering sentence upon the defendant are quoted. The court said:\n'The prosecution has presented an abundance of proof which, in case the court should give it full credence, would establish the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt. On the other hand, the defense has presented very little direct proof; the accused did not use his right to testify in his own favor, and no eyewitness has testified favorably to him. The defense has practically limited itself to insisting on: (1) Alleged contradictions between the various witnesses of the prosecution relating to the details of identical facts or happenings related by them. (2) Mistakes which they claim to be essential, in the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution with respect to distances and relative positions of persons and objects connected with the case. (3) The expert testimony of two physicians that the deceased could not have died as the result of a wound received in the manner stated by the witnesses for the prosecution.'\n\n An analysis of this language is made by counsel, and its relation to the general character of the evidence is discussed, and the conclusion deduced that the trial court urged three arguments to sustain its judgment: 'First, paucity of proof in behalf of the defendant. Second, his failure to testify in his own favor. Third, his failure to get any eyewitness to the shooting, to rebut evidence of the Filipinos who claim to have been eyewitnesses.' And to this summary, which, it is urged, demonstrates that the trial court considered in determining the guilt of defendant, that he failed to take the stand in his own behalf, there is added the comment of the supreme court of the Islands in its review of the case, or rather, in denying a motion for a new trial, after its decision of the case. Upon the first consideration of the case in the supreme court, no assignment of error based on the point was made. It was raised for the first time in what is styled, 'Exception to the \n\n[216 U.S. 305, 309]\n\u00a0\n Judgment, and Motion for a New Trial,' in which he excepted to the judgment rendered by the supreme court, and prayed that it be set aside and a new trial granted him. The reasons given were as follows:\n'1. The defendant has been compelled to testify against himself, in violation of art. 5 of the law of Congress of July 1, 1902, in the following manner:\n\n'The accused, taking advantage of the right conceded him in the third paragraph of article 15 of the general orders, No. 58, did not testify in the court of first instance, and said court, in its judgment, considered this circumstance as prejudicial to the defendant; and the attorney general adduced duced the same circumstance in his brief in this court in the following words:\n\n\"No direct proof was presented by the defense to contradict the facts stated by the witnesses for the prosecution; nor did the defendant himself testify in his own favor to deny the grave crime with which he is charged.'\n\n'And to overcome, as far as possible, the effect of this illegal procedure so prejudicial to the accused, his counsel in this court, speaking in his name, felt himself obliged to state to the court that the defendant did not go on the witness stand because he did not remember anything about the occurrence; which circumstance was considered by the court as a fact prejudicial to the defendant and appellant in the following words:\n\n\"The defendant, a lieutenant of constabulary, in command at the Parian barracks at Cebu, being intoxicated, borrowed a carromata, which was without lights, from a friend, and was found wandering about the streets therein by a municipal policeman named Almonte, who, at his request, drove him to the barracks. As to subsequent occurrences, we have not the benefit of his recollection, and must rely on the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution and the circumstances of the case.\"\n\n To which it was replied: \n\n[216 U.S. 305, 310]\n\u00a0\n 'The court having heard the petition of Attorney Kincaid, praying for a new trial of case No. 3176, the United States v. Pendleton, in which a decision was rendered by this court on the 9th of the present month of February, 1907, said that although the fact that the defendant declined or failed to testify as a witness was taken into consideration by the court of first instance, this court, in deciding the cause, did not take said fact into consideration, but rendered the decision in accordance with the proofs presented at the trial, and therefore the new trial solicited is denied.'\n Defendant puts aside the disclaimer of the supreme court as unimportant in an argument which is certainly difficult to represent if not to follow. He appealed to the supreme court to review the judgment of the lower court. He made a motion for a new trial in the supreme court, and that being denied, he now urges, not error committed in the supreme court, but error committed in the trial court. This is worked out and attempted to be justified by an argument that, it may be, we do not understand. It is said that the supreme court misapprehended the 'function conferred upon it by Congress and the Philippine Commission in relation to reviewing the decisions of courts of first instance.' That it seemed to be of opinion that it had 'the same authority in this regard as was possessed by its Spanish predecessor, the audiencia,' and 'passed on the decision of the court below about as a reviewing court would pass on an equity proceeding upon written testimony submitted by affidavits and interrogatory depositions.' And by doing so, counsel further urge that the supreme court did not have before it what they describe as 'the supremely human element,-the appearance of the witnesses and their manner on the stand, etc.,' and, not having such element, could not judge of the effect of the evidence independently of the silence of the defendant, and could not determine, therefore, how much the error of the trial court, in considering such silence, controlled its judgment. The answer is that the supreme court had the power \n\n[216 U.S. 305, 311]\n\u00a0\n to review the case and consider all that was necessary to the exercise of such power. That power was invoked by defendant, and he secured from its exercise a reduction of three years in his sentence. And Trono v. United States, \n199 U.S. 521\n, 50 L. ed. 292, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 121, 4 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 773, may be cited as an answer to the contention. In that case the power of review which the supreme court possessed over the judgment of the trial court was exerted to the extent of reversing a judgment and sentence for assault, and rendering a judgment for homicide. Trono v. United States needs very little comment. It declares the relation of the courts and the scheme of procedure existing in the Philippine Islands, and brings the case at bar to the simple proposition, when stripped of ingenious suggestions, that an error which was made (if error was made, of which we express no opinion) at the trial in the court of first instance, and which was not repeated in the supreme court, is not a ground of legal complaint.\n The third assignment of error is not discussed by counsel. It is, however, manifestly without merit.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Harlan dissents. \n\n\n\n","134":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPENMAN v. ST. PAUL FIRE & MARINE INS CO(1910)\nNo. 67\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 311, 312]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. A. J. Truitt, Frederick D. McKenney, and B. M. Clark for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 311, 314]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William D. Mitchell, W. K. Jennings, Jared How, Pierce Butler, and George Hoke for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action to recover the sum of $2,600, with interest, upon a fire insurance policy for the value of a building de- \n\n[216 U.S. 311, 315]\n\u00a0\n stroyed by fire. The action was brought in the court of common pleas of Jefferson county, Pennsylvania, and by the insurance company, the respondent herein, removed to the United States court for the western district of Pennsylvania.\n Plaintiff's statement, to use the local name for her pleading, alleged a contract of insurance whereby the insurance company insured, for the term of three years, against direct loss by fire, 'a two-story shingleroofed building, 28 x 96, and additions,' etc., to be occupied by tenants as dwellings, and situated in Punxsutawney, Jefferson county, Pennsylvania. Payment of the premium and charges was alleged, also the total loss of the building by fire. A copy of the policy was attached to the statement and made a part of it. The policy contained the following covenant:\n'This entire policy, unless otherwise provided by agreement indorsed thereon or added hereto, shall be void . . . if (any usage or custom of trade or manufacture to the contrary notwithstanding) there be kept, used, or allowed on the above-described premises, benzin, benzole, dynamite, ether, fireworks, gasolene, Greek fire, gunpowder, exceeding 25 lbs. in quantity, naphtha, nitroglycerin, or other explosives.'\n\n The policy also contained the full covenant:\n'This policy is made and accepted subject to the foregoing stipulations and conditions, together with such other provisions, agreements, or conditions as may be indorsed hereon or added hereto, and no officer, agent, or other representative of this company shall have power to waive any provision or condition of this policy except such as, by the terms of this policy, may be the subject of agreement, indorsed hereon or added hereto, and as to such provisions and conditions no officer, agent, or representative shall have such power, or be deemed or held to have waived such provisions or conditions unless such waiver, if any, shall be written upon or attached hereto; nor shall any privilege or permission affecting the insurance under this policy exist or be claimed by the insured unless so written or attached.' \n\n[216 U.S. 311, 316]\n\u00a0\n The case was tried to a jury and resulted in the verdict for the plaintiff, upon which judgment was duly entered. A motion for a new trial was denied. The judgment was reversed by the circuit court of appeals. 81 C. C. A. 151, 151 Fed. 961. This writ of certiorari was then allowed.\n\n The question in the case is the effect of the covenants which we have quoted. It was raised in the circuit court by objection to certain testimony, which was admitted, and the denial of certain instructions which were requested.\n The property is situated in the coal mining regions of Pennsylvania, and the testimony shows that an explosion preceded or was coincident with the fire as its cause or effect. Indeed, it seems to be clear that the explosion was caused by one of the tenants throwing lighted 'squibs' in the air 'for fun.' And there was testimony that it was the custom of miners to keep more or less blasting powder in their dwellings. The custom seems to have arisen on account of a law of Pennsylvania which provides that 'no powder or high explosive shall be stored in any mine, and no more of either article shall be taken into the mine at any one time than is required in any one shift unless the quantity be less than 5 pounds.' [3 Purdon's Dig. 13th ed. p. 2592.]\n In supplement to this testimony the circuit court admitted, over the objection of the company, the testimony of the agent who placed the insurance upon the property, to the effect that he had taken considerable risks as agent for defendant company on miners' dwellings; that he knew of the custom of miners to keep blasting powder in their dwellings; that he knew that the building insured was in seven compartments, 'seven miners' dwellings,' to be occupied by seven different families, and that he 'increased the rate by reason of the fact that this building was to be occupied by miners, and having knowledge that they kept more or less blasting powder about their dwellings.' And he also testified that, after he had placed the risk, the special agent of the company went with him, looked at the risk, and said it was satisfactory, after \n\n[216 U.S. 311, 317]\n\u00a0\n having made inquiry as to the rate. He expressed the increase in percentage as 'one and a quarter for one year, or two and a half for two years.' He also charged an extra premium for finishing.\n He increased the premium, he further testified, because he 'thought it was going to be occupied by coal miners,' and 'because there was seven of them.' The increase was from 1 1\/4 per cent to 2 1\/2 per cent, but he did not know what he would have charged if the building had not been for coal miners. And further, that he was not told that the building was to be occupied by coal miners, he knew that from his experience in the business. Mrs. Penman did not tell him, nor did he tell her that he had increased the rate, because she might possibly have it occupied by miners, but he told the special agent of the company 'that that entered into the calculations.' He did not report it on the form, because it was not his custom to do so. To the question whether it was special business he was 'performing, rather than acting for the company,' he answered, 'Yes.'\n The policy recited that the building insured was 'in process of erection, with privilege to finish and to be occupied by tenants as dwellings,' and that 'in consideration of the extra premium of three and 90-100 dollars ($3.90) thirty days' permission is hereby granted to finish the building.' There was evidence showing that blasting powder is a lower degree of explosive than gunpowder or dynamite, and that the latter is a higher degree than gunpowder.\n In view of this testimony, the circuit court decided, as it said, that though ordinarily it was 'the duty of a court to construe a written instrument, and instruct the jury what its terms meant,' he would leave to the jury 'as a question of fact' for it 'to determine, whether, under the evidence and the facts proven here, blasting powder' was 'included in the term 'other explosives.\" Entertaining that view, the court refused to instruct the jury, as requested by the company, 'that, under the evidence, the verdict should be for the \n\n[216 U.S. 311, 318]\n\u00a0\n defendant.' The court refused other requests which were based on the controlling effect of the policy.\n In passing upon the motion for a new trial, the circuit court reasserted the view that it was for the jury to 'determine whether blasting powder was one of the prohibited articles which were to invalidate the policy.' The court observed: 'It was contended by one side that it was embraced under the term 'other explosives;' by the other, that it was not.' The court further said: 'While, of course, blasting powder is an explosive, and is therefore covered by the generic term 'other explosives,' yet the fact that other explosives of the general character of blasting powder, and those of a much more dangerous character than blasting powder, to wit, dynamite and gun powder, of which 20 and 5 pounds were permitted, were specified, it was contended that the expressed mention of these more dangerous powders evidenced an intent not to cover the less dangerous article of blasting powder under the general term 'other explosives.\" To the last contention, the court, as we have seen, yielded, and rejected the case of Northern Assur. Co. v. Grand View Bldg. Asso. \n183 U.S. 308\n, 46 L. ed. 213, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 133, as not decisive, by saying that 'in that case there was no question as to what the policy provided; in the present, the crucial question was as to what the policy in question covered by the term 'other explosives.\"\n The majority of the circuit court of appeals took another view. It found nothing obscure in the language of the policy, and nothing, therefore, to excuse the circuit court from exercising the duty of construing it. Answering the contention that the words 'or other explosives' should not be held to include explosives of lower power than gunpowder or dynamite, it was said: 'Such an application of the maxim noscitur a sociis is too narrow.'\n It was pointed out that the enumeration of explosives included other explosives than gunpowder and blasting powder, and that there was nothing in the record to show their relative degrees of power, nor whether they or any of them were \n\n[216 U.S. 311, 319]\n\u00a0\n of less explosive power than gunpowder or dynamite. Their relative power, it was said, was not a matter of common knowledge, and if the general words 'or other explosives' were to be or could be limited by such relation or their relation to blasting powder, the burden was upon the plaintiff to show it, as those words, 'in their literal and natural meaning, included blasting powder.' It was hence concluded that 'to hold, under the present proofs, that the general words 'or other explosives' do not include blasting powder, merely because it is a less dangerous explosive than dynamite or gunpowder, when it may be more dangerous than Greek fire, benzin, benzole, ether, gasolene, or naphtha, is virtually to decide arbitrarily that no meaning or effect shall be given to the general words. We are satisfied that this cannot be done, and that, as the proofs stand, the general words include blasting powder.'\n The court, thus deciding that the words of the policy included blasting powder, further decided that the circuit court erred in admitting parol testimony to vary its terms, and also erred in not directing a verdict for the company.\n A member of the court dissented from both propositions. His argument was elaborate and would not be adequately represented by condensation. It asserted the view of the circuit court and the contention of the plaintiff. It considered that, by the rule of ejusdem generis, blasting powder was not covered by the words 'other explosives,' and by them were meant explosives of the same power as those enumerated, which it seems to have been assumed blasting powder was not. It was considered, besides, that the words could be given a meaning by the custom of miners and the industrial conditions which existed in the neighborhood, and also from the knowledge and conduct of the company's agent when the insurance was placed. Cases from Pennsylvania were cited to support that proposition, of which we may select as representative, McKeesport Mach. Co. v. Ben Franklin Ins. Co. 173 Pa. 53, 34 Atl. 16, where the policy of insurance on two buildings, one a \n\n[216 U.S. 311, 320]\n\u00a0\n foundry and machine shop, and the other a pattern shop, was considered. The policy covered the patterns in the pattern shop by these words, 'on patterns therein $1,000.' The pattern shop was from 15 to 20 feet from the foundry in which the fire occurred, and in which the patterns were destroyed, where they were taken the evening before the fire for actual use next day, in accordance with the orders and customs in that and other shops in the use of patterns. It was found by a jury returning a special verdict that such use was a reasonable one and answered the convenient operation of such plants, and that the agent of the defendant company examined the shops and patterns and buildings before taking the insurance. The court said:\n'The policy sued on in this case was issued to a manufacturing company, and covered the buildings, machinery, fixtures, and appliances in daily use in the business of the company. The rules of construction applicable to such a contract of insurance are well settled. The object of the contract is indemnity against the loss by fire of the business plant, or any portion of it, while used and occupied by the owners in the manner and for the purposes for which it was designed. If its provisions are susceptible of two or more interpretations, that one should be adopted that will make the contract effective for the protection of the insured. In other words, the contract should be liberally construed in aid of the indemnity which was in contemplation of the parties who made it. Western & A. Pipe Lines v. Home Ins. Co. 145 Pa. 346, 27 Am. St. Rep. 703, 22 Atl. 665.\n\n'Again, an insurance company issuing a policy upon a business plant, or any portion of it, is chargeable with knowledge of the customary methods of conducting the business in which the property insured is used. Ibid. This rule is not limited to insurance upon property in use for manufacturing or other business purposes. It was applied in the construction of a policy issued upon a dwelling house in Doud v. Citizens' Ins. Co. 141 Pa. 47, 23 Am. St. Rep. 263, 21 Atl. 505, and in Roe v. Dwelling House Ins. Co. 149 Pa. \n\n[216 U.S. 311, 321]\n\u00a0\n 94, 34 Am. St. Rep. 595, 23 Atl. 718. It was applied to a policy of insurance upon a horse in Haws v. Fire Asso. of Philadelphia, 114 Pa. 431, 7 Atl. 159. Still another rule of construction is that the circumstances surrounding the making of the contract, and affecting the subject to which it relates, form a sort of context that may properly be resorted to for aid in determining the meaning of the words and provisions of the contract. Bole v. New Hampshire F. Ins. Co. 159 Pa. 53, 28 Atl. 205; Graybill v. Penn Twp. Mut. F. Ins. Asso. 170 Pa. 75, 29 L.R.A. 55, 50 Am. St. Rep. 747, 32 Atl. 632.'\n\n We have stated the rulings of the courts below, because they accurately exhibit the contentions of the parties and the questions for decision, and with such fullness of argument that there is not much more for this court to do than to select and concur. The court of appeals decided, as we have seen, that, under the terms of the policy, blasting powder could not be 'kept, used, or allowed' on the insured property, and that such prohibition was not waived by the knowledge and acts of the company's agent. We concur in this, and we think the reasoning by which it was supported is conclusive. The rule of ejusdem generis is rule of interpretation; and granting, arguendo, it should be applied more liberally to contracts of insurance than to contracts of other kinds, yet we think it would be giving it too much force to yield to the contention of petitioner. Blasting powder is an explosive, and one of power; it is therefore capable of producing the result that the provision of the policy was intended to guard against. We are given no tests, as the court of appeals said, and we certainly may not assume them, of a comparison of it with the explosives which are enumerated, except dynamite and gunpowder. The law of Pennsylvania, an we have seen, has given it character and has guarded against its destructive force.\n We think also that the policy furnishes the only way by which its terms can be waived. It provides against modifications by the usage or custom of trade or manufacture. It guards against any acts of waiver of its conditions or a change of them by agents. It provides that such waiver or change \n\n[216 U.S. 311, 322]\n\u00a0\n 'shall be written upon or attached' to the policy. The company could have used no words which would have been more explicit. There is no ambiguity about them. Parol testimony was not needed nor admissible to interpret them. They constituted the contract between the company and the insured. No agent had power to change or modify that contract except in the manner provided. This was decided in Northern Assur. Co. v. Grand View Bldg. Asso. supra. Any other ruling would take from contracts the certain evidence of their written words, and turn them over for meaning to the disputes of parol testimony.\n The Pennsylvania cases cited by the petitioner do not militate with the rule there announced. If they did, it might be open to controversy how far they were binding on this court. Kuhn v. Fairmount Coal Co. \n215 U.S. 349\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct.

U.S.(1910)\nNo. 270\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 456, 457]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Harr for defendant\n No appearance for plaintiff in error.\n Assistant Attorney General Harr for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Lurton delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a writ of error to a judgment of the circuit court of the United States for the western district of Oklahoma, upon a Conviction in a capital case, sued out by the plaintiff in error, the defendant below, by authority of the 5th section of the act of March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. at L. 826, 827, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549).\n The plaintiff in error, Silas Pickett, a negro, was indicted in the district court of the United States for the western district of Oklahoma for the murder of a negro known as Walter the Kid, within the limits of the Osage Indian Reservation. The indictment was remitted to the circuit court for the same \n\n[216 U.S. 456, 458]\n\u00a0\n district, as required by  1039, Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 723). This murder was charged as having been committed on October 14, 1907. The state of Oklahoma was admitted to the Union on November 16, 1907. The offense was, therefore, committed before its admission as a state, and for that offense the plaintiff in error was, after such admission, both indicted and convicted in a court of the United States for the western district of Oklahoma,-the Osage Indian Reservation being within that district. The jurisdiction of the court was challenged by motion to quash, by demurrer, and by motion in arrest of judgment. Of course, if the offense was not one against the United States, or not committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the district court for the western district of Oklahoma, the indictment would be bad, and the court which tried and convicted the plaintiff in error, without jurisdiction. But the crime charged in this indictment was one against the United States. By  5339 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3627), as amended by the act of January 15, 1897 (29 Stat. at L. 487, chap. 29, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3620), the crime of murder, when committed within any 'place or district or country under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States,' is defined and the punishment provided. This general law was, by  2145, Rev. Stat., extended 'to the Indian country,' when not within one or the other of the exceptions of  2146\n\n\n The averments of the indictment make it plain that the crime charged was committed within a 'place or district' at that time exclusively under the jurisdiction of the United States, being Indian country, not within any state. As it also averred that the plaintiff in error was a negro, and not an Indian, and the person slain a negro, and not an Indian, the exceptions made by  2145, Rev. Stat., do not apply.\n The crime was charged to have been committed on October 14, 1907,-a date subsequent to the enabling act of June 16, 1906 [34 Stat. at L. 267, chap. 3335], under which, on November 20, 1907, Oklahoma was admitted to the Union.\n The jurisdiction of the district court of the United States, exercised in respect to the indictment and trial of this plaintiff \n\n[216 U.S. 456, 459]\n\u00a0\n in error, depends upon the provisions of that enabling act. Such a crime might have been prosecuted in the territorial court for the proper district of the territory, sitting as a court of the United States, and administering the law of the United States in the exercise of its jurisdiction conferred by Congress. Ex parte Crow Dog (Ex parte Kang-Gi- Shun-Ca) \n109 U.S. 556\n, 27 L. ed. 1030, 3 Sup. Ct Rep. 396; Brown v. United States, 77 C. C. A. 173, 146 Fed. 975. but the function and jurisdiction of such territorial courts would naturally terminate upon the territory becoming a state, and therefore render necessary some provision for the transfer of pending business and jurisdiction in respect of local matters to state courts, and of civil and criminal business and jurisdiction arising under the laws of the United States to courts of the United States when they should come into existence. Forsyth v. United States, 9 How. 571, 576, 13 L. ed. 262, 264.\n It was therefore altogether competent for Congress to provide, as it did in the 14th section of this enabling act, for the transfer of jurisdiction in respect of all crimes against the United States-for the act must be read as applying to crimes under the general criminal law of the United States,-to the Federal Courts provided by the same act. If this could not be done, the change from a territorial condition to that of a state would operate as an automatic amnesty for crimes committed against the general law of the United States within districts exclusively under its jurisdiction, and not within the jurisdiction of any state, for the courts of the state could not be empowered to prosecute crimes against the laws of another sovereignty. Martin v. Hunter, 1 Wheat. 304, 337, 4 L. ed. 97, 105. The power to punish was not lost if the crime was one of the character described, and the enabling act might well provide that such crime, committed either before or a after the admission of the state, might be prosecuted in the courts of the United States when established within the new state. The subject is elaborately considered and decided by District Judge Marshall in United States v. Baum, 74 Fed. 43.\n Section 13 of the enabling act2 referred to provides 'that the state, when admitted [italics ours], should be divided into \n\n[216 U.S. 456, 460]\n\u00a0\n two judicial districts,' for the appointment of a district judge, clerk, and marshal for each, and that the state should be attached to the eighth judicial circuit. It provides also for the holding of regular terms of both the district and circuit courts, with all the powers and jurisdiction of similar courts. The 14th section was in these words:\n'That all prosecutions for crimes or offenses hereafter committed in either of said judicial districts as hereby constituted shall be cognizable within the district in which committed, and all prosecutions for crimes or offenses committed before the passage of this act, in which indictments have not yet been found or proceedings instituted, shall be cognizable within the judicial district as hereby constituted in which such crimes or offenses were committed.'\n\n There may be some doubt as to whether the section set out should be construed as applying to crimes and offenses committed before and after the passage of the enabling act, or only to such crimes committed before and after the admission of the state. The reference to 'the passage of this act,' in the second clause, would tend to the first construction. But such a construction would leave out of consideration the fact that neither the courts nor the judicial districts referred to would exist until the admission of the state, by the express terms of the preceding section, which should be read in connection with the 14th section. No construction should be adopted, if another equally admissible can be given, which would result in what might be called a judicial chasm. Under the first interpretation, crimes committed after the passage of this enabling act could not be prosecuted until the admission of the state, and the coming into existence of the courts and judicial districts to which jurisdiction of such crimes was to be transferred. If such crimes could only be prosecuted in courts organized upon the admission of the state, there would be an indefinite period during which such crimes might go unpunished. In fact, there elapsed seventeen months between the date of this enabling act and the admission of the state, \n\n[216 U.S. 456, 461]\n\u00a0\n and a consequent organization of the districts and courts to which jurisdiction over such crimes was to be transferred. A construction which might result in such deplorable consequences should not be adopted if any more sensible meaning can be reasonably given. The reason of the law, as indicated by its general terms, should prevail over its letter, when the plain purpose of the act will be defeated by strict adherence to its verbiage. Applications of this general rule are shown in Church of Holy Trinity v. United States, \n143 U.S. 457\n, 36 L. ed. 226, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 511; Lau Ow Bew v. United States, \n144 \nU.S. 47, 59\n, 36 S. L. ed. 340, 344, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 517; United States v. Corbett, decided at this term, \n215 U.S. 233\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 81. The obvious intention was that this, like the preceding section, should become effective upon the state being admitted, and it should be read as applying to crimes and offenses before and after such admission. But if the section be otherwise construed, the district court had, in either case, jurisdiction over this crime, for it was committed after the enabling act, and whether it might have been prosecuted in a territorial court, sitting as a court of the United States, before the admission of the state of Oklahoma, is not here important. It was not so prosecuted, and when the territory ceased to be a territory, and became a state, the jurisdiction of all such courts terminated, and jurisdiction was properly transferred to the courts of the United States having jurisdiction over the place of the crime.\n There are a number of errors assigned. The first and tenth are for error in denying a new trial. The granting or denying of a new trial is a matter not assignable as error. Bucklin v. United States, \n159 U.S. 682\n, 40 L. ed. 305, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 182. The second assignment is double, and therefore bad; but it is without merit. The first error included is for overruling an objection to being tried at Oklahoma City. No such objection is shown by the record. The remainder is for denying a continuance. Continuances are within the discretion of the court, and unless great abuse is shown, the action of the court below will not be disturbed. As no bill of exceptions was taken, we have no showing of abuse upon which the action of this court may be invoked. \n\n[216 U.S. 456, 462]\n\u00a0\n The third and fourth errors assigned are for overruling an objection made to the sufficiency of the indictment and to the admission of any evidence because the indictment was bad. No such objection is shown by the record. The indictment is not in form bad nor vague, but charges the crime of murder with great particularity. There seems to have been no reason for doubt as to the crime charged. Besides, objections of this character cannot be made upon writ of error for the first time.\n Aside from the question of jurisdiction, considered heretofore, the remaining assignments are for alleged errors in admitting or rejecting evidence. But as no bill of exceptions was taken, these assignments cannot be considered. Storm v. United States, \n94 U.S. 76\n, 24 L. ed. 42.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 34 Stat. 275 (U. S. Comp.

Price, was, on March 1, 1909, \n\n[216 U.S. 488, 489]\n\u00a0\n committed by a United States commissioner for the southern district of New York to the custody of the appellee, as marshal for that district, to await an order of removal to the District of Columbia, for trial upon two indictments, numbered respectively 26,088 and 26,089, being two of the indictments considered in the case of Haas v. Henkel, just disposed of [ \n216 U.S. 462\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 249]. Price thereupon filed his petition in the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York, alleging that his imprisonment was unlawful and in violation of the Constitution of the United States, and praying for a writ of habeas corpus and certiorari, and that he might be discharged from such arrest. Upon a hearing, his petition was dismissed and he was remanded to the custody of the marshal. From this order he has prayed this appeal.\n This appeal and that of Haas were argued together, the difference between the two being slight. The two New York indictments against Price which he had been held to answer when these removal proceedings were begun were numbered 307 and 308. The first charged him with having entered into a conspiracy with Moses Haas, Edwin S. Holmes, Jr., and other persons unknown, to defraud the United States, and the other charged him with having conspired with Haas to bribe Holmes, an official in the Statistical Bureau of the Department of Agriculture, to violate his duty. These indictments allege the conspiracy to have been formed in the southern district of New York. They are in all respects similar to the two District of Columbia indictments against the same persons, which lay the locus of the conspiracy in the District of Columbia, except that certain counts in the latter indictments charge particular offenses not charged in either of the New York indictments.\n It is now insisted that the order of the commissioner, committing appellant to the custody of the marshal to wait a removal, is void:\n\n 1. \nBecause  1014, Rev.

Stat. 1901, p. 716), does not authorize a removal from the district where an accused is found when he \n\n[216 U.S. 488, 490]\n\u00a0\n is there under bail to answer local indictments for the same offense.\n\n 2. \nThat the commitment to await an order of removal was illegal and an abuse of power, because the District of Columbia indictments did not substantially charge any offense against the United States.\n\n 3. \nThat the record certified by the commissioner under the certiorari issued by the circuit court does not show any evidence justifying a conclusion that there was probable cause to believe that the appellant had committed any crime in the District of Columbia.\n As two of the counts included in one of the District of Columbia indictments are for particular offenses, similar in character, but not identical with those covered by either of the two New York indictments, it is apparent that appellant has not been held in New York to answer all of the offenses which he is charged with having committed in the District of Columbia, and could not be brought to trial under the New York indictments for the offenses charged by the fifth and seventh counts of one of the District of Columbia indictments. This alone serves to take the case out of the precise situation presented by the first objection against the order made by the commissioner. If there is one good count under which a trial might be had in the district to which the removal is sought, it is enough to support an order in a habeas corpus proceeding. Horner v. United States, \n143 \nU.S. 207, 214\n, 36 S. L. ed. 126, 130, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 407.\n But for the reasons already stated in the opinion in the Haas Case, just handed down, we are of opinion that absolute identity in the two sets of indictments does not operate to defeat a removal, if the government elect to try in another district, and that the only function of a commissioner before whom a removal complaint is made in such a situation is to be satisfied that there is probable cause to believe that the accused is guilty of an offense charged to have been committed in the district to which the removal is sought. This case, upon this point, as well as upon the point that the two indictments here \n\n[216 U.S. 488, 491]\n\u00a0\n involved do not sufficiently charge an offense against the United States, is governed by the opinion and judgment in the Haas Case.\n This brings us to the only question which is not necessarily concluded by the opinion in the Haas Case; namely, whether there was any substantial evidence before the commissioner upon which he might, in the exercise of his jurisdiction, decide that there was probable cause for believing that appellant had committed, within the District of Columbia, the offenses charged in the indictments against him found in that district.\n That at least a prima facie case for the removal was made by the introduction of the indictments returned against him in the District of Columbia is not disputable. That much efficacy is attributed to a certified copy of an indictment found in a competent court of another district, when put in evidence in a removal proceeding. Bryant v. United States, \n167 U.S. 104\n, 42 L. ed. 94, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 744; Greene v. Henkel, \n183 U.S. 249\n, 46 L. ed. 177, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 218; Hyde v. Shine, \n199 U.S. 62\n, 50 L. ed. 90, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 760; Beavers v. Henkel, \n194 U.S. 73\n, 48 L. ed. 882, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 605. But the evidence of probable cause afforded by the indictment is not conclusive. For this reason it has been held that the refusal of a commissioner to hear evidence offered for the purpose of showing that no offense had been committed, triable in the district to which removal was sought, would be a denial of a right secured under the Constitution. Tinsley v. Treat, \n205 U.S. 20\n, 51 L. ed. 689, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 430. But in this case there was no closing of the door to evidence offered to show a want of probable cause. Copies of the New York indictments against appellant for many of the same offenses were received in evidence, as tending to show that the conspiring, if any there was, had been done in New York, and not in the District of Columbia. Some evidence tending to show that Price was not in the District of Columbia at the time when the conspiracies are charged to have been formed was also introduced. There was also some evidence offered, questioning the identity of the appellant with the person accused by the District of Columbia indictments. The probative weight of certified copies of the New York indictments is necessarily \n\n[216 U.S. 488, 492]\n\u00a0\n limited to such counts as are identical in the two sets of indictments. This would leave counts five and seven of indictment No. 26,088 unaffected as evidence of probable cause, and justify the order of commitment, although there might be conclusive evidence that the offense charged in the other counts had not been committed in the District of Columbia, as charged. Horner v. United States, \n143 U.S. 207\n, 36 L. ed. 126, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 407.\n But it cannot be conceded that the introduction of copies of the New York indictments operated to destroy the evidential effect of the indictments found in the District of Columbia, even as to the identical counts. In the case of Haas v. Henkel, we held that such evidence did not so conclusively destroy the evidence afforded by copies of the District of Columbia indictments as to leave no testimony upon which the commissioner might, upon the whole case, decide that there was proof of probable cause.\n The commissioner had before him competent evidence in the certified copies of the District of Columbia indictments upon which he might base a conclusion of probable cause. At most, the New York indictments, together with the evidence tending to prove that appellant had not been in the District of Columbia at any of the times when the conspiracy was said to have been formed, only made an issue which the commissioner had jurisdiction to decide, and when we find from the proceedings before him that he did hear such evidence upon which he might base his decision, that decision is not open for review upon a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Re Oteiza y Cortes, \n136 U.S. 330\n, 34 L. ed. 464, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1031; Bryant v. United States, supra; Greene v. Henkel, \n183 \nU.S. 249, 261\n, 46 S. L. ed. 177, 189, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 218; Hyde v. Shine, \n199 \nU.S. 62, 84\n, 50 S. L. ed. 90, 97, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 760. This is the rule, as stated by Mr. Justice Brown, speaking for the court in Hyde v. Shine, cited above, where it was said:\n'In the Federal courts, however, it is well settled that, upon habeas corpus, the court will not weigh the evidence, although, if there is an entire lack of evidence to support the accusation, the court may order his discharge. In this case, however, the \n\n[216 U.S. 488, 493]\n\u00a0\n production of the indictment made at least a prima facie case against the accused, and if the commissioner received evidence on his behalf, it was for him to say whether, upon the whole testimony, there was proof of probable cause. Re Oteiza y Cortes and Bryant v. United States, supra. The requirement that the usual mode of process adopted in the state shall be pursued refers to the proceedings for the arrest and examination of the accused before the commissioner, but it has no bearing upon the subsequent independent proceeding before the circuit court upon habeas corpus. In this case the commissioner did receive evidence on behalf of the appellants, and upon such evidence found the existence of probable cause and committed the defendants, and, upon application to the district judge for the warrant of removal, he reviewed his action, but did not pass upon the weight of the evidence.'\n\n The evidence, independent of that afforded by the New York indictments, relied upon to show that appellant was not in the District of Columbia when the conspiracy is charged to have been formed, has been examined. It cannot be said to be at all conclusive. First, it leaves out of consideration the fact that the indictments may be sustained by evidence of a conspiracy formed at dates before the finding of the indictment, other than those named, if not barred by the statute of limitations. Ledbetter v. United States, \n170 \nU.S. 606, 612\n, 42 S. L. ed. 1162, 1164, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 774. Second, it does not exclude the possibility that the conspiracy may have been formed in the District of Columbia without appellant being physically present when the conspiracy was formed. Re Palliser, \n136 \nU.S. 257, 265\n, 34 S. L. ed. 514, 517, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1034; Burton v. United States, \n202 \nU.S. 344, 387\n, 50 S. L. ed. 1057, 1073, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 688, 6 A. & E. Ann.

United States, cited above, it was said by this court that 'the constitutional requirement is that the crime shall be tried in the state or district where committed; not necessarily in the state or district where the party happened to be at the time.'\n Upon the whole case, we are satisfied that there is not shown that entire absence of evidence which, upon an appeal \n\n[216 U.S. 488, 494]\n\u00a0\n like this, would require us to hold that the decision that there was probable cause was void as not based upon any evidence.\n Final order affirmed.\n\n Brewer, J., concurring:\n I concur in affirming the orders of removal in these cases, but my concurrence must not be taken as holding that the indictments will stand the final test of validity or sufficiency. Assuming that there is a doubt in respect to these matters, as I think there is, and as seems to be suggested by the opinion in No. 367, I am of the opinion that such doubt should be settled by direct action in the court in which the indictments were returned, and not in removal proceedings.\n Mr. Justice McKenna concurs in the result, but reserves opinion whether the facts alleged in the indictment constitute a conspiracy to defraud the United States. \n\n\n\n","137":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPULLMAN CO. v. STATE OF KANSAS EX REL. COLEMAN(1910)\n\nArgued: Decided: January 31, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 56, 57]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank B. Kellogg, Charles Blood Smith, Francis B. Daniels, and Gustavus S. Fernald for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Fred S. Jackson and C. C. Coleman for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 56, 58]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a proceeding in quo warranto, instituted by the state in the supreme court of Kansas against the Pullman Company, a corporation of Illinois, in which the state, by its petition, prays that the defendant be required to show by what authority it exercises within Kansas the corporate right and power of charging compensation for the use of reserved stats in its cars by day and sleeping berths during the night, and of serving meals in its dining cars within the state of Kansas, such services, it is alleged, being rendered to and said fees being collected from passengers transferring upon railroads from places within the state to other places within the state; and that it be adjudged that the defendant has no authority of law for the performance of such corporate acts, powers, franchises, and business in the state of Kansas, and be ousted of and from the exercise within the state of the said corporate rights and franchises, and of receiving compensation therefor.\n On the petition of the company the case was removed to the circuit court of the United States, but that court remanded it to the state court, where the defendant filed an answer resisting the relief asked on various grounds, one of which was that such relief could not be granted consistently with the power of Congress to regulate commerce among the several states, or with rights belonging to the defendant under the Constitution of the United States. A demurrer to the answer was sustained, and a decree rendered by which it was adjudged that the Pullman Company be ousted, prohibited, restrained, and enjoined from transacting, as a corporation, any business of a domestic or intrastate character within the state of Kansas. The decree declared that it should in nowise affect or restrict the interstate business of the company, nor affect any of its contracts, obligations, or corporate duties with or to the government of the United States.\n The business of the Pullman Company, under its charter, \n\n[216 U.S. 56, 59]\n\u00a0\n was that of furnishing sleeping, parlor, and tourist cars on railroads, the company reserving to itself the right to charge a certain price for the use of reserved seats in such cars during the day-time and sleeping berths during the night. The company's business extended throughout the United States, where any trunk line railroad was operated. It is not necessary to go into detail as to the mode in which that business was conducted, further than to say that the business was and is principally that of interstate commerce.\n This case arises under the statute of Kansas which was examined in Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Kansas, recently decided. [\n216 U.S. 1\n, 54 L. ed . --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 190] Laws of Kansas, Special Session, 1898, p. 30; Kan. Gen. Stat. 1901, title, 'Corporations,' p. 280; Id. 1905, same title, p. 284. The only provisions of that statute which need be recalled for the purposes of this opinion are these: 'Each corporation which has received authority from the [state] charter board to organize shall, before filing its charter with the secretary of state, as provided by law, pay to the state treasurer of Kansas, for the benefit of the permanent school fund, a charter fee of 1\/10 of 1 per cent of its authorized capital, upon the first $100,000 of its capital stock, or any part thereof; and upon the next $400,000, or any part thereof, 1\/20 of 1 per cent; and for each million or major part thereof over and above the sum of $500,000, $200 . . . . In addition to the charter fee herein provided, the secretary of state shall collect a fee of $2.50 for filing and recording each charter containing not to exceed ten folios, and an additional fee of 25 cents for each folio in excess of ten contained in any charter. The fee for filing and recording a charter shall also entitle the corporation to a certified copy of its charter. All the provisions of this act, including the payment of the fees herein provided, shall apply to foreign corporations seeking to do business in this state, except that, in lieu of their charter, they shall file with the \n\n[216 U.S. 56, 60]\n\u00a0\n secretary of state a certified copy of their charter, executed by the proper officer of the state, territory, or foreign country under whose laws they are incorporated; and any corporation applying for a renewal of its charter shall comply with all the provisions of this act in like manner, and to the same extent, as is herein provided for the chartering and organizing of new corporations.' 'Any corporation organized under the laws of another state, territory, or foreign country, and authorized to do business in this state, shall be subject to the same provisions, judicial control, restrictions, and penalties, except as herein provided, as corporations organized under the laws of this state.' Id.  1264, 1267\n\n\n Proceeding under the statute of Kansas, the Pullman Company made written application to the charter board for permission to engage in business in that state. The application was granted, and the board made the following order: 'The board having under consideration the application of the Pullman Company, a foreign corporation organized under the laws of the state of Illinois, for leave to transact the business of a sleeping car company in the state of Kansas; and it appearing that said foreign corporation has, in due form of law, filed with the secretary of state a certified copy of its charter, executed by the proper officers of the state of its domicil, and the written consent, irrevocable, of said corporation that actions may be commenced against it in the proper court of any county in this state in which the cause of action may arise, accompanied by a duly certified copy of the resolution of the board of directors of said corporation, authorizing the proper officers to execute the same, it is, upon motion, thereupon ordered that said application be granted, and that said applicant be authorized and empowered to transact the business of operating sleeping cars, dining cars, tourist cars, and other cars within the state of Kansas, and receiving money for such services, and transacting within the state its business of a sleeping car and transportation company, provided, that this order shall not take effect and no \n\n[216 U.S. 56, 61]\n\u00a0\n certificate of such authority shall issue or be delivered to said company until such applicant shall have paid to the state treasurer of Kansas, for the benefit of the permanent school fund, the sum of $14,800, being the charter fees provided by law, necessary to be paid by the corporation with a capital of $74,000,000, seeking to transact business within this state. It is further understood, ordered, and provided that nothing herein contained shall apply to nor be construed as restricting in anywise the transaction, by said applicant, of its interstate business; but that this grant of authority and requirement as to payment relate only to the business transacted wholly whthin the state of Kansas.'\n We have seen from the provisions of the statute, as set forth in Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Kansas, that it is made a condition of the right of a foreign corporation seeking to do local business in Kansas, that it should apply to the state charter board for permission to do so. It is also prescribed as a condition of the right of a foreign corporation to do intrastate business in Kansas that it shall pay not only an application fee of $25, but a charter fee 'of 1\/10 of 1 per cent of its authorized capital upon the first $100,000 of its capital stock or any part thereof; and upon the next $400,000, or any part thereof, 1\/20 of 1 per cent; and for each million or major part thereof over and above the sum of $500,000, $ 200.'\n The Pullman Company is admittedly engaged, as it has been continuously for many years, in commerce among all the states of the Union, as well as in intrastate business in Kansas. The charter board, we have seen, gave it permission to engage in intrastate business in Kansas on condition that it should pay to the state treasurer for the benefit of the permanent school fund of the state, as a charter fee, the sum of $14,800, which is the prescribed statutory per cent of the compnay's authorized capital, representing all of its property and interests everywhere, in and out of the state, and all its \n\n[216 U.S. 56, 62]\n\u00a0\n business, both interstate and intrastate. It does not appear how much of the single 'fee' demanded by the state is to be referred to the interstate business of the company, nor how much to its property outside of the state, nor what part has reference to its intrastate business, or to its property within the state.\n The Pullman Company refused to pay the fee so demanded, upon the general ground, among others, that the state could not, consistently with the Constitution of the United States or with the company's rights under the Constitution, make it a condition of its doing intrastate business in Kansas, that the company should pay, in the form of a fee, a specified per cent of all its authorized capital; that such a fee necessarily operated as a burden on the company's interstate business as well as a tax on its property interests outside of the state, and was hostile to its constitutional right of exemption from local taxation in reference to its property beyond the jurisdiction or the state.\n For the reasons, and under the limitations, expressed in the opinion delivered in Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Kanas, and without expressing any opinion upon questions raised by the pleadings, but not covered by this opinion, we hold, 1. That the Pullman Company was not bound to obtain the permission of the state to transact interstate business within its limits, but could go into the state, for the purposes of that business, without liability to taxation there with respect to such business, although subject to reasonable local regulations for the safety, comfort, and convenience of the people which did not, in a real, substantial sense, burden or regulate its interstate business, nor subject its property interests outside of the state to taxation in Kansas. 2. That the requirement that the company, as a condition of its right to do intrastate business in Kansas, should, in the form of a fee, pay to the state a specified per cent of its authorized capital, was a violation of the Constitution of the United States, in that such a single fee, based \n\n[216 U.S. 56, 63]\n\u00a0\n as it was on all the property interests, and business of the company, within and out of the state, was, in effect, a tax both on the interstate business of that company, and on its property outside of Kansas, and compelled the company, in order that it might do local business in Kansas in connection with its interstate business, to waive its constitutional exemption from state taxation on its interstate business and on its property outside of the state, and contribute from its capital to the support of the public schools of Kansas; that the state could no more exact such a waiver than it could prescribe as a condition of the company's right to do local business in Kansas that it agree to waive the constitutional guaranty of the equal protection of the laws, or the guaranty against being deprived of its property otherwise than by due process of law. 3. That a decree ousting and prohibiting the company from doing intrastate business in Kansas was improperly granted, the aid of the court should have been refused and the bill dismissed, because a decree such as the state asked would, in effect, have recognized the validity of a condition which the state could not constitutionally prescribe under the guise of a fee for permission to do intrastate business.\n Mr. Justice Moody heard the argument of this case, participated in its decision, and approves this opinion.\n On the authority of Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Kansas, and for the reasons and with the reservations therein set forth in the opinion in that case, the decree must be reversed and the cause remanded for such further proceedings as may be consistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n\n Mr. Justice White, concurring:\n It is not disputed that the Pullman Company, many yeras ago, enthered Kansas, and has since therein operated its cars for the purposes of interstate as well as local business. Although the cars, in passing in and out of the state, may not have been constantly the same, it was long ago settled (Pul- \n\n[216 U.S. 56, 64]\n\u00a0\n lman's Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 U.S. 18\n, 35 L. ed. 613, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 595, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 876) that a proportionate number of the cars so used are to be considered as having a definite situs in the state, and therefore as property permanently therein, subject to the power of the state to tax. Taking this rule into consideration, in my opinion the case is controlled by the reasons given for my concurrence in the Western Union Case. That is to say, as a due proportion of the cars of the Pullman Company used in the state of Kansas were there permanently, I am not able to conclude that the company or its property were not permanently in the state, and, hence, that such property can be taken by the state without due process of law, as a condition of the right to bring the property into the state and there carry on local business. To so hold without overruling Pullman's Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania and the many cases which have followed it would be to place the court in the position of saying, on the one hand, for the purpose of upholding the state's lawful power of taxation, that the property of the company was permanently in the state, and, on the other, of deciding, for the purpose of enabling the state to impose an unconstitutional tax, that the company was outside of the state and had no property permanently employed in carrying on business therein. True it is that my concurrence in the Western Union Case was placed upon the ground that the company was in the state, and consequently was not subject to be dealt with upon the fictitious assumption that such was not the fact. However, it was also siad that I did not dissent from the fundamental application which the court made of the commerce clause of the Constitution. As the reasons for this statement differed somewhat from those expressed by the court in its opinion, it to me seems, in view of the importance of the subject, that it is my duty now to state as briefly as possible my reasons for thinking that the tax in question is repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution, even under the assumption that the corporation and its property \n\n[216 U.S. 56, 65]\n\u00a0\n were out of the state, and that the tax is a condition affixed to the privilege of coming in to do a local business, and may therefore be escaped by not doing such business.\n The conflict of opinion as to the decisive effect of certain prior decisions of the court exacts that the principles which this case involves should be first definitely brought into view in order that the appositeness of the cases referred to may be determined in the light of the true doctrine by which the case should be controlled. I therefore at once summarily state certain dominant propositions which are to my mind not subject to be controverted, because, whatever may be the differences of opinion as to some of them, considered originally, they are all so conclusively established by the previous decisions of this court as to be now beyond dispute.\n\n 1. \nA state may not exert its concededly lawful powers in such a manner as to impose a direct burden on interstate commerce. This is so elementary as to require no reference to the multitude of authorities by which it is sustained.\n\n 2. \nEven though a power exerted by a state, when inherently considered, may not, in and of itself, abstractly impose a direct burden on interstate commerce, nevertheless, such exertion of authority will be a direct burden on such commerce if the power as exercised operates a discrimination against that commerce, or, what is equivalent thereto, discriminates against the right to carry it on. I. M. Darnell & Son Co. v. Memphis, \n208 U.S. 113\n, 52 L. ed. 413, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 247; American Steel & Wire Co. v. Speed, \n192 U.S. 500\n, 48 L. ed. 538, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 365, and authorities there cited.\n\n 3. \nSubject to constitutional limitations, the states have the power to regulate the doing of local business within their borders. As a result of this power, and of the authority which government may exert over corporations, the states have the right to control the coming within their borders of foreign corporations. In cases where this power is absolute, the states may affix to the privilege such conditions as are deemed proper, or, without giving a reason, may arbitrarily forbid such corporation from coming in. When, therefore, \n\n[216 U.S. 56, 66]\n\u00a0\n in a case where the absolute power to exclude obtains, a condition is affixed to the right to come into a state, and a foreign corporation avails of such right, it may not assail the constitutionality of the condition because, by accepting the privilege, it has voluntarily consented to be bound by the condition. In other words, in such case the absolute power of the state is the determining factor, and the validity of the condition is immaterial. This doctrine finds, in the decided cases, no terser and clearer statement than that expressed in the opinion in Horn Silver Min. Co. v. New York, \n143 U.S. 305\n, 36 L. ed. 164, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 57, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 403. In that case, a manufacturing company, organized under the laws of Utah, was sought to be made liable for a tax on the franchise of carrying on, in the state of New York, a manufacturing business. It contested liability on the ground that the tax was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. The court, in deciding that the constitutionality of the burden was an irrelevant consideration because of the absolute power of the state to impose it as a condition on the right of the corporation to come into the state and do a manufacturing, and, therefore local, business, said, speaking of the power of the state (p. 315):\n'Having the absolute power of excluding the foreign corporation, the state may, of course, impose such conditions upon permitting the corporation to do business within its limits as it may judge expedient; and it may make the grant or privilege dependent upon the payment of a specific license tax, or a sum proportioned to the amount of its capital. No individual member of the corporation, or the corporation itself, can call in question the validity of any exaction which the state may require for the grant of its privileges. It does not lie in any foreign corporation to complain that it is subjected to the same law with the domestic corporation.'\n\n And in a passage of the opinion previous to the one just quoted, concerning the right of a state, where its power to exclude was absolute, to impose such condition as it pleased, it was observed (p. 314): \n\n[216 U.S. 56, 67]\n\u00a0\n 'This doctrine has been so frequently declared by this court that it must be deemed no longer a matter of discussion, if any question can ever be considered at rest.'\n In addition, the following cases either directly, expressly, or by fair implication must be taken as sustaining the right of the state, where it has the absolute power to exclude, to affix whatever condition it deems proper to the right of a foreign corporation to come in, and the consequent inability of such corporation, after accepting the privilege, to assail the constitutionality of the condition: Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 19 L. ed. 357; Postal Teleg. Cable Co. v. Charleston, \n153 U.S. 693\n, 38 L. ed. 872, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 637, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1094; Hooper v. California, \n155 U.S. 648\n, 39 L. ed. 297, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 610, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 207; Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas, \n177 U.S. 28\n, 44 L. ed. 657, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 518; Pullman Co. v.

Rep. 46.\n\n 4. \nThe absolute power of the state, as stated in the preceding proposition, does not include the right to exclude a foreign corporation from doing in a state interstate commerce business, since the regulation of such business is vested by the Constitution in Congress, and the states are impotent, as stated in the first and second propositions, to directly burden the right to do such business, or to discriminate against those doing it.

And, indeed, by necessary implication, the want of power in the states to exclude corporations as well as individuals from carrying on within their borders interstate commerce results, by implication, from the decisions in the cases previously cited under proposition 3. This is aptly illustrated by the Horn Silver Mining Case, where, after stating, in the clearest way, the absolute power of the state, generally speaking, to exclude a foreign corporation, it was declared (pp. 314-315):\n'Only two exceptions or qualifications have been attached to it, in all the numerous adjudications in which the subject has been considered since the judgment of this court was announced more than half a century ago in Bank of Augusta \n\n[216 U.S. 56, 68]\n\u00a0\n v. Earle, 13 Pet. 519, 10 L. ed. 274. One of these qualifications is that the state cannot exclude from its limits a corporation engaged in interstate or foreign commerce, established by the decision in Pensacola Teleg. Co. v. Western U. Teleg. Co. \n96 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 24 S. L. ed. 708, 711. The other limitation on the power of the state is where the corporation is in the employ of the general government,-an obvious exception, first stated, we think, by the late Mr. Justice Bradley in Stockton v. Baltimore & N. Y. R. Co. 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 411, 32 Fed. 9, 14. As that learned justice said: 'If Congress should employ a corporation of shipbuilders to construct a man-of-war, they would have the right to purchase the necessary timber and iron in any state of the Union.' And this court, in citing this passage, added, 'without the permission and against the prohibition of the state.' Pembina Consol. Silver Min. & Mill. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n125 \nU.S. 181, 186\n, 31 S. L. ed. 650, 652, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 24, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 737.'\n\n Let me, then, test the question for decision by the light of these principles.\n As it is obvious that the Pullman Company, in so far as it was engaged in interstate commerce within the state of Kansas, was independent of the will of the state, it follows that the state had no absolute power to exclude the corporation, and therefore no authority to impose an unconstitutional burden as the price for the privilege of doing local in conjunction with the interstate commerce business. The power to exclude in such a case being only relative, affords no warrant for the exertion by the state of an absolute prohibition. That is to say, the exerted power could not, in the nature of things, be wider than the authority in virtue of which alone it could be called into play. Moreover, to me it seems that where the right to do an interstate commerce business exists, without regard to the assent of the state, a state law which arbitrarily forbids a corporation from carrying on with its interstate commerce business a local business would be a direct burden upon interstate commerce, and in conflict with the principles stated in proposition 1. This follows, since the imposition on a corporation which has the right to do interstate commerce \n\n[216 U.S. 56, 69]\n\u00a0\n business within the state of an unconstitutional burden for the privilege of doing local business is, in my opinion, the exact equivalent of placing a direct burden on its interstate commerce business. It is not by me doubted that, as a practieal question, the arbitrary prohibition against doing a local business, imposed on one engaged in, and having the right to engage in, interstate commerce, is to burden that business. But passing, for argument's sake, the considerations just stated, if a state, in express terms, enacted that all foreign corporations which availed of the right granted them by the Constitution of the United States to carry on interstate commerce within the state without the previous consent of the state, should, as a penalty for not obtaining that consent, be deprived of all right to transact local business, it would not, I assume, be contended that such an enactment was not a discrimination against the corporations to which it applied because of their possession of a right conferred upon them by the Constitution of the United States. And yet such must be the direct and immediate result of applying an absolute act of exclusion to corporations who are not subject to such absolute exercise of power, because of the right bestowed upon them by the Constitution of the United States to carry on within a state an interstate commerce business. Nor is it an answer to say that, as a state may exclude a foreign corporation from doing local business, the exertion of its lawful power may not be prevented because a bad reason is given or an illegal condition imposed, since the power exerted is the test, and not the reason which has been given for exerting the power. But the proposition in effect assumes the question at issue, since, however controlling it may be conceded to be, when applied to a case where the absolute power to exclude exists, it can have no application to a case where the power of the state is relative, because it may not extend to prohibiting the doing of an interstate commerce business. In such a case the limitation upon the power operates not only to fordid the exclusion, as the result of the expressed enactment \n\n[216 U.S. 56, 70]\n\u00a0\n of an unconstitutional condition, but also, in the nature of things, prohibits the absolute exclusion, although the reason for the attempted exertion of such a power be not given. In other words, where the power to exclude is absolute, no inquiry as to the reasons for its exertion need be resorted to in order to determine its constitutionality. But, where the power is only relative, because it may not be exerted under particular conditions and circumstances, the violation of the Constitution cannot be accomplished by a failure to express the reason for the exclusion, and thus absolute power be exerted where such power does not exist. The controlling influence of the Constitution may not be destroyed by doing indirectly that which it prohibits from being done directly.\n It is to be observed that the conclusions just expressed take away from the states no lawful power. It leaves to the states the right to exert absolute authority where such power is possessed, and simply requires that where, as a result of the Constitution of the United States, the power is not absolute, but is merely relative, not only the right of regulation, but likewise the right to exclude, must be exerted conformably to the requirements of the Constitution of the United States; that is, in such a manner as not, either directly, by the expression of a condition, or indirectly, by its nonexpression, to deprive of rights secured by that instrument.\n The principal cases relied upon to establish that the prior decisions support the right of the states to impose the unconstitutional tax here in question are reviewed in the opinion of the court, and I might well rest content with that review. But, in addition, it to me seems that none of the cases relied upon are apposite here, for two obvious reasons,-because they either involved the exercise of state power concerning subjects over which the authority of the state was absolute, or considered state burdens which were upheld as being in effect neither direct burdens upon interstate commerce nor discriminatory against such commerce.\n A very summary reference to the cases will be made for \n\n[216 U.S. 56, 71]\n\u00a0\n the purpose of indicating why this is said. Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 19 L. ed. 357, involved the validity of a state statute which prescribed certain conditions for the doing of the business of insurance within a state by a foreign insurance company, and it was held that such business was not commerce, and therefore was within the absolute regulating power of the states. Horn Silver Min. Co. v. New York, \n143 U.S. 305\n, 36 L. ed. 164, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 57, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 403, as previously shown, involved no question of interstate commerce, but the right of a foreign corporation to carry on in a state a manufacturing business without compliance with the laws of the state. And although the ruling of the court, as heretofore stated, was, in express terms, placed upon the absolute power of the state over the subject, the court was careful to point out that such power did not embrace the right to exclude a foreign corporation from doing an interstate commerce business in the state, or extend to excluding a corporation chartered by the United States for governmental purposes, Postal Teleg. Cable Co. v. Charleston, \n153 U.S. 693\n, 38 L. ed. 872, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 637, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1094, involved a tax concerning which the court said (p. 699): 'The express terms of the ordinance restricts the tax to 'business done exclusively within the city of Charleston, and not including any business done to or from points without the state, and not including any business done for the government of the United States, its officers or agents.\" It is certain that the burden was sustained on its inherent merit as a purely lawful tax on a subject within the state's authority, and not as an unconstitutional tax on interstate commerce, which, although void, was to be enforced because it was a mere condition for the privilege of doing local business, which privilege had been accepted. This is certain, since the court said ( p. 695): 'That this license is not a condition upon which the right to do business depends, but is a tax, is shown by the case of Home Ins. Co. v. Augusta, \n93 \nU.S. 116, 122\n, 23 S. L. ed. 825, 826.' How the ruling thus made is applicable here my mind does not perceive. The distinction between this case and that is but the difference which exists between \n\n[216 U.S. 56, 72]\n\u00a0\n the exertion of a lawful power and the attempt to violate the Constitution by doing that which it forbids to be done. The gulf which separates the case referred to from this, it may be, can be made plainer by observing that this case involves no issue as to the right of a state to lawfully tax the local business of corporations, whether domestic or foreign. That right is fully conceded. The only right here challenged is the authority of a state to impose an unconstitutional tax, and validate the tax by making the payment of the unlawful tax a condition of the right to do a local business. And this upon the false assumption that absolute power to exclude exists; that is, to impose an unlawful tax and sustain it by another unlawful assumption of power,-a process of reasoning which, to my mind, must rest on the proposition that, in deciding questions of constitutional power, it is to be held that two wrongs make a right. Hooper v. California, \n155 U.S. 648\n, 39 L. ed. 297, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 610, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 207, was a case involving only the right of a state to absolutely control the doing of insurance business within the state, and the doctrine of Paul v. Virginia was reiterated. The court, however, was sedulous to declare that, as that particular subject was not commerce, the authority of the state was absolute, and not relative; but it expressly pointed out the limitation upon the absolute power which would obtain where a right arose in favor of a corporation under the Constitution of the United States to engage within the state in interstate commerce. In Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas, \n177 U.S. 28\n, 44 L. ed. 657, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 518, the oil company had accepted a permit from the state of Texas to engage for the period therein stated in local as well as interstate commerce within the state, upon the conditions therein set forth. No question was raised as to what would have been the rights of the company had it gone into the state for the purpose of transacting therein a purely interstate commerce business without the consent of the state. Indeed, the decision proceeded upon the theory that no such question was involved in the case, since it was assumed in the opinion that, under the circumstances of the case, the power \n\n[216 U.S. 56, 73]\n\u00a0\n of the state was absolute, and not relative. Paul v. Virginia and cases of that character were cited. Hooper v. California was referred to and the exception as to interstate commerce business which that case enunciated was pointed out. It was declared that the case could have been rested upon the Hooper Case without saying anything further,-a conclusion wholly incompatible with any other conception than that the right recognized was based upon the absolute power of the state, and did not come within the exception based upon the right to do an interstate commerce business, even by a foreign corporation, which the Hooper Case had announced and which the case of Horn Silver Min. Company had, in effect, treated as being as well established as the principle of absolute power. It is true that in Pullman Co. v. Adams, \n189 U.S. 420\n, 47 L. ed. 877, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 494, and Allen v. Pullman's Palace Car Co. \n191 U.S. 171\n, 48 L. ed. 134, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 39, the taxes which were assailed as invalid were treated as conditions imposed for the privilege of carrying on local business, and which were therefore considered to be optional, as the right to escape payment would result upon discontinuing the doing of the local business. But the taxes in question in those cases were not levied upon interstate commerce, either directly or indirectly, but only upon the business done within the state, and therefore substantially involved no question of the absolute right of the state to impose an unconstitutional condition where the power of the state was not absolute, but only relative. No reference was made in the opinion to the distinction stated in the previous cases between the absolute power to exclude, generally considered, and the relative character of that power where the foreign corporation possessed the power to do an interstate commerce business, irrespective of the consent of the state. Security Mut. L. Ins. Co. v. Prewitt, \n202 U.S. 246\n, 50 L. ed. 1013, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 619, 6 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 317, involved the right of the state to deal with the business of insurance,-a matter purely of state concern, involving interstate commerce in none of its aspects; and the case of National Council v. State Council, \n203 U.S. 151\n, 51 L. ed. 132, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 46, also involved the right of a \n\n[216 U.S. 56, 74]\n\u00a0\n state to control the doing within the state of a business purely local in character, as distinct from an interstate commerce business.\n Moreover, none of the cases referred to prevent me, in this case, from acting upon my independent convictions, even if it be conceded that expressions may be found in the opinions in some of the cases, which, when separated from their context, and apart from the subject-matter of the controversies which the cases presented, would tend to conflict with the views I have expressed. This is said because certain is it that in none of the cases is the slightest reference made to the distinction between the absolute and relative power which this case involves, and the direct burden which must result to interstate commerce from the attempt to exert absolute power, where, as the result of the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution, relative power alone obtains. When first after the duty came to me of taking part in the work of the court, the question arose of the right of a state, in cases where it had absolute authority, to impose an unconstitutional condition as a prerequisite to the right to do local business, my individual convictions were suppressed and my opinion yielded because of the conception that it was my duty to enforce in such a case the previous rulings of the court, however much, as an original question, I would have held a contrary view. But because my convictions were thus yielded in such a case affords no reason why I now should assent to extending the doctrine of the previous cases to conditions to which, in my opinion, they do not apply. And certainly this should not be done when the result of such extension of the previous cases would be to destroy the efficiency of the commerce clause of the Constitution, to restrict the powers of Congress conferred by that clause, and ultimately, by the doctrine to result from the unwarranted extension of the cases, to destroy the substantial powers of both Congress and the states, and establish a system from which it would come to pass that, instead of living under a constitutional government, we would live under \n\n[216 U.S. 56, 75]\n\u00a0\n a government of unconstitutional exactions, sanctioned by means of the exertion of arbitrary and absolute power, although the right to exert such power did not exist.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes, dissenting:\n As this case has received some further discussion beyond that in Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Kansas [\n216 U.S. 1\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 190], I will contribute my mite. I do not care to add to what I said the other day as to the supposed accession of rights to a corporation because it already has property in the state. Argument from Pullman's Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 U.S. 18\n, 35 L. ed. 613, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 595, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 876, is excluded by New York ex rel. New York C . & H. R. R. Co. v. Miller, \n202 U.S. 584\n, 50 L. ed. 1155, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 714, which shows that the question whether there is any necessary parallelism between liability to taxation elsewhere and immunity at home still is an open question (p. 598), and points out that in the earlier case the same cars were continuously receiving the protection of Pennsylvania (p. 597). In the present case it is alleged that the cars are taxed in other states as well as in Kansas, and that the property represented by the capital of the company has no situs in Kansas. If I thought it material I should say that, on the declaration, the cars were taxable at the Pullman Company's domicil more certainly than anywhere else. But I think it immaterial, for the reasons that I gave last week; and, furthermore, the argument drawn from the presence in the state of cars that can be and are rolled out of it at will cannot, I should think, be meant to be pressed.\n I will add a few words on the broader proposition put forward, that the Constitution forbids this charge, whether the corporation was established previously in the state or not. I do not see how or why the right of a state to exclude a corporation from internal traffic is complicated or affected in any way by the fact that the corporation has a right to come in for another purpose. It is said that in such a case \n\n[216 U.S. 56, 76]\n\u00a0\n the power of the state is only relative, and in the sense that it is confined to the local business, I agree. But, in the sense that it is not absolute over that local business, the statement seems to me merely to beg the question that is to be discussed. I do not understand why the power is less absolute over that because it does not extend to something else. So, again, the proposition that a state may not subject all corporations that enter the state for commerce with other states to such conditions as it sees fit to impose upon local business, no matter how offensive the terms, seems to me a proposition not to be assumed, but to be proved; or again, that the arbitrary prohibition of local business is a burden on commerce among the states. I am quite unable to believe that an otherwise lawful exclusion from doing business within a state becomes an unlawful or unconstitutional burden on commerce among states because, if it were let in, it would help to pay the bills. Such an exclusion is not a burden on the foreign commerce at all; it simply is the denial of a collateral benefit. If foreign commerce does not pay its way be itself, I see no right to demand an entrance for domestic business to help it out.\n The distinction that I believe exists is sanctioned by many cases earlier than those referred to in my former dissent. That the local business of telegraph and railroad companies may be taxed by the states has been held over and over again, with full acceptance of the doctrine that quoad hoc, 'the power to tax involves the power to destroy (M'Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 431, 4 L. ed. 579, 607),-essentially the doctrine on which the power of the states to tax interstate commerce was denied (State Freight Tax Case, 15 Wall. 232, 21 L. ed. 146). Thus, in Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Alabama Bd. of Assessment (Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Seay) \n132 U.S. 472\n, 33 L. ed. 409, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 726, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 161, it was held that the telegraph company could be taxed upon all messages carried and delivered wholly within the state, and the principle was stated by Mr. Justice Miller to be that this 'class are elements of internal commerce solely within the limits and jurisdiction of the state, and therefore subject to its taxing \n\n[216 U.S. 56, 77]\n\u00a0\n power.' This was by a unanimous court, and followed the intimations and decisions of earlier cases. The above passage was cited and followed in Postal Teleg. Cable Co. v. Charleston, \n153 U.S. 692\n, 38 L. ed. 871, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 637, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1094, when a license fee or tax was exacted in respect of local business, and the previous decisions were cited and commented upon by Mr. Justice Shiras. One of the arguments repudiated was that the tax was a burden upon commerce among the states. I do not see how the reasoning that denies the power to tax one kind of commerce and asserts it with regard to the other can be reconciled with the denial of the power of the state to exclude the latter altogether, or to tax it for whatever sum it likes. The right to tax 'in its nature acknowledges no limits.' Weston v. Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 466, 7 L. ed. 481, 487; New York ex rel. Bank of Commerce v. Tax Comrs. 2 Black, 620, 17 L. ed. 451.\n I think that the tax in question, for I am perfectly willing to call it a tax, was lawful under all the decisions of this court until last week. From other points of view, if I were at liberty to take them, I should agree that it deserved the reprobation it receives from the majority. But I have not heard, and have not been able to frame, any reason that I honestly can say seems to me to justify the judgment of the court in point of law.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE concurs in this dissent.\n Mr. Justice McKenna also dissents. \n\n\n\n","138":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRICHARDSON v. AINSA(1910)\nNo. 28\nArgued: Decided: November 14, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 289, 290]\n\u00a0\n Mr. S. L. Kingan for appellant.\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 289, 293]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Joseph W. Lewis, Selim M. Franklin, and Frank H. Hereford for appellee.\n\n\n[218 U.S. 289, 294]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a suit to quiet title, brought in 1887 by the appellee's intestate in the district court of Arizona. The decision was in favor of the appellee, and this decision was affirmed by the supreme court of the territory, \n\n[218 U.S. 289, 295]\n\u00a0\n whereupon the defendant Richardson appealed to this court.\n The appellant represents a title derived from a grant by the Mexican government of land in the portion of Arizona afterwards acquired by the Gadsden Purchase, December 30, 1853. 10 Stat. at L. 1031. At the time of the Gadsden Purchase this title was complete. The appellant claims through mesne conveyances from holders of patents issued by the United States in 1879 and 1880, under the homestead laws.\n The first error assigned is that the district court was without jurisdiction. That point already has been decided against the appellant in this very case under the name of Ainsa v. New Mexico & A. R. Co. No. 2, \n175 U.S. 91\n, 44 L. ed. 84, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 33, so that it is not open to him to urge it. United States v. Camou, \n184 \nU.S. 572, 574\n, 46 S. L. ed. 694, 695, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 505. But it is proper to say that, in our opinion, the decision did not proceed upon a mistake of fact, and is not inconsistent with the reasoning of the immediately preceding decision between the same parties (\n175 \nU.S. 76, 86\n, 44 S. L. ed. 78, 82, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 28), although No. 2 was begun before, and No. 1 after, the passage of the act of March 3, 1891, chap. 539, 26 Stat. at L. 854, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 765, establishing a court of private land claims.\n In 1892 the United States brought a suit against the present appellee in the court of private land claims, alleging that his claim was void, and that the United States had granted patents for portions of the land, praying that the title might be adjudicated, and, if valid, the boundaries established, excepting such parts as might have been disposed of by the United States. The appellee answered, setting up title, and praying confirmation. Ultimately, in pursuance of the decision of this court (Ely v. United States, \n171 U.S. 220\n, 43 L. ed. 142, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 840), a decree was entered in his favor, and a patent issued to him on October 29, 1906, specifying no exceptions other than one of 'gold, silver, or quicksilver mines or minerals of the same.' \n\n[218 U.S. 289, 296]\n\u00a0\n THE APPELLANT, HOWEVER, CONTENDS THAT, BY vIrtue of the above-mentioned statute of March 3, 1891, the effect of the appellee's appearance in the court of private land claims was to forfeit all portions of the land in controversy that had been patented by the United States, and to give the appellee in place of it a claim for not exceeding $1.25 per acre so patented against the United States. The contrary decision is the other error assigned.\n Of course, the patents for homesteads issued in the name of the United States, on the facts that we have stated, were a mere usurpation and were void. The lands covered by them, whether reserved or not by the acts of July 22, 1854, chap. 103,  8, 10 Stat. at L. 308; July 15, 1870, chap. 292, 16 Stat. at L. 304, were not public lands, but private property, which the government was bound by the express terms of the Gadsden treaty of December 30, 1853, to respect. The appellant's claim rests solely on an interpretation of  8 and 14 of the above-mentioned act of 1891, that would cut down the performance of the treaty promise by the United States to at least the narrowest limits consistent with good faith. We are of opinion that the different construction adopted by the court below, and also by the Acting Secretary of the Interior in Ely v. Magee, 34 Land Dec. 506, 512, is correct. After providing in  6 for incomplete titles, the act goes on in  8 to deal with complete ones. Holders of claims under such titles, it says, 'shall have the right (but shall not be bound) to apply to said court' for a confirmation of their title. Of course, this means that the title is recognized as good without the proceeding in court. Ainsa v. New Mexico & A. R. Co. \n175 \nU.S. 76, 90\n, 44 S. L. ed. 78, 84, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 28.\n The confirmation is granted, 'excepting any part of such land that shall have been disposed by the United States,' and without prejudice to conflicting private interests. Then, in  14 it is enacted that 'if, in any case, it \n\n[218 U.S. 289, 297]\n\u00a0\n shall appear that the lands or any part thereof decreed to any claimant under the provisions of this act shall have been sold or granted by the United States to any other person, such title from the United States to such other person shall remain valid, notwithstanding such decree,' with a provision for a judgment in favor of the claimant, against the United, States, for the proved value of such granted lands, not exceeding $1.25 per acre. If this were all there could be no question that the exception of lands granted by the United States was merely a condition attached to the decree of confirmation, and did not purport to affirm such grants if the claimant did not see fit to go into the court of private land claims.\n But is  8 there is a further provision by which the United States may proceed against the claimant, as it did against the appellee, on the ground that the title or boundaries are open to question, and therefore the court is to determine the matter, 'but subject to all lawful rights adverse to such claimant or possessor, as between such claimant and possessor and any other claimant or possessor, and subject in this respect to all the provisions of this section applicable thereto.' The appellant argues that this provision gives a wider meaning to  14. He says that the words 'if in any case' it shall appear that lands have been sold by the United States apply as well to a proceeding by the United States as to one where the claimant goes forward. He argues that so to apply them is just, in view of the supposedly unknown boundaries of the old Mexican grants and the policy of the United States in offering its public lands to settlers,- that otherwise there is a suspended threat, and possibility of a claimant turning up after many years, and dispossessing those who had been encouraged by the United States to go upon the land. Botiller v. Dominguez, \n130 U.S. 238\n, 32 L. ed. 926, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 525. But the considerations mentioned in the case cited did not prevent the United States, in the act of March 3, 1891, from leaving \n\n[218 U.S. 289, 298]\n\u00a0\n the holders of perfected titles free not to present them to the court, as they were required to do in earlier statutes. The good faith of the United States was pledged to respect the Mexican titles. It recognized in the act of 1891 that holders of such titles need not go into the land claims court to get them confirmed, and we should be slow to suppose that it meant to make a doubt in the Department of Justice as to the validity of a perfect title a ground for cutting down what otherwise it was bound to protect, and did, by the statute, leave intact. But for that unfounded doubt, the appellee would have been secure in his rights, and could have turned the holders of the homestead patents off his land. United States v. Martinez, \n184 \nU.S. 441, 445\n, 46 S. L. ed. 632, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 422. The proceeding by the government was a matter over which he had no control, and ought not to affect his rights. Looking at the words of  14 more exactly, they do not require the appellant's construction. 'If in any case' means in any case before the court that the act established. And when the section goes on, 'it shall appear that the lands or any part thereof, decreed to any claimant under the provisions of this act, shall have been sold,' it is reasonable to suppose that it has reference to those cases in which a claimant is seeking a decree; that is to say, where the claimant is the plaintiff in the case. It is true that a petition by the United States may end in the same result, but the terms of the sentence and the duty of the government concur in leading us to limit the words as we do. On the other hand, the consideration mentioned sufficiently shows that the claimant did not impair his position by praying for confirmation in his answer. The prayer merely expressed what would have happened without it by the force of law.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.S. Comp.

Halbert, E. L. Worthington, and W. D. Cochran for plaintiff in error.[ Richardson v. McChesney \n218 U.S. 487\n (1910) ]\n\n\n[218 U.S. 487, 490]\n\u00a0\n No counsel for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Lurton delivered the opinion of the court:\n Shortly stated, this is an attack upon the validity of the Kentucky act of March 12, 1898, and certain amendments thereto, apportioning the state into eleven congressional districts. The bill alleges that the districts do not conform to the requirement of the acts of Congress apportioning representatives among the states, which acts require that such districts shall be of contiguous territory, 'containing as nearly as practicable an equal number of inhabitants.' The averments of the bill are that the districts are grossly and unnecessarily unequal in population.\n The bill was filed in an equity court of the state. A demurrer, as not stating a case good in law, was sustained and the bill dismissed. This judgment was affirmed upon an appeal to the court of appeals of Kentucky. The ground upon which the Kentucky court rested its judgment was, in substance, that neither the Constitution of the United States nor of the state contained any provision which vested in the court any authority to annul an apportionment of the state into districts for the election of Congressmen, and that the matter pertained to the political department of the government, and was subject only to the supervising control of the Congress, if any such power of supervision existed at all.\n The bill, in substance, alleges that a congressional election in each of the eleven congressional districts of the state will be held in November, 1908. That under the law of Kentucky it is the duty of the defendant H. V. McChesney, as secretary of the commonwealth, or his successor in office at the time, to certify, within sixty days prior to said election, the names of the nominees of the Republican and Democratic parties for members of Con- \n\n[218 U.S. 487, 491]\n\u00a0\n gress in each district, to clerks of the various county courts of the state, and the duty of such clerks to print the name so certified upon the official ballots to be used in said congressional election.\n The complainant's interest in the matter is that he is a citizen of the United States and of the state of Kentucky, and a qualified voter and resident of Hart county, one of the counties of said state, and as such entitled to vote for a Congressman in the district to which that county is lawfully attached. The act of the general assembly dividing the state in congressional districts prior to the act of March 12, 1898, was an act passed April 15, 1882. By this act of 1882 the counties of Hart, Green, and Taylor formed part of the fourth congressional district. By the act of March 12, 1898, and acts amendatory, the three counties named were made part of the eleventh district, and certain counties were taken from the eleventh and placed in other districts.\n The contention is that, the act of 1898 and its amendments being void, because of gross inequality of inhabitants, the aforesaid act of April 15, 1882, is the apportionment act in force, and that the approaching election should be held for the election of eleven members of Congress in the eleven districts organized by the act of 1882, and not in the districts as shaped by the later illegal arrangement.\n The object and prayer of the bill is to require the defendant H. V. McChesney, or his successor in office, to proceed in conformity with the apportionment act of April 15, 1882, by certifying the names of party nominees for Congress made in districts organized in conformity with that act, and to require the county court clerks, who are made defendants, to print only the names of nominees so certified upon the ballots for the election of Congressmen at the election to be held in November, 1908, and that said McChesney, or his successor, be restrained \n\n[218 U.S. 487, 492]\n\u00a0\n from certifying, or the defendant clerks from printing, otherwise.\n Without considering the question of the authority for judicial interference in respect to a congressional apportionment act, we are of opinion that this writ of error must be dismissed.\n The matter which the defendant McChesney, as secretary of the commonwealth of Kentucky, is to be prohibited from doing, relates solely to an election to be held in November, 1908, and the thing which he is to be required to do relates only to the same election. The election to be affected by a decree, according to the prayer of the bill, has long since been held, and the members of Congress were, in November, 1908, elected under the apportionment act of 1900. They were, as we may judicially know, admitted to the respective seats, and, as we may also take notice, their successors have been elected according to the same scheme of apportionment. The thing sought to be prevented has been done, and cannot be undone by any judicial action. Under such circumstances there is nothing but a moot case. Mills v. Green, \n159 U.S. 651\n, 40 L. ed. 293, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 132; Jones v. Montague, \n194 U.S. 147\n, 48 L. ed. 913, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 611.\n The duty of the court is limited to the decision of actual pending controversies, and it should not pronounce judgment upon abstract questions, however such opinion might influence future action in like circumstances.\n Aside from this, we may judicially take notice that the defendant H. V. McChesney is no longer secretary of the commonwealth of Kentucky, his term having expired and a successor having been inducted into office, who has not been substituted as a defendant to this suit.\n This is not a suit against the state of Kentucky. The state is not the subject of suit. Nor is it a suit against the secretary of state as one of a corporation or continuing board, 'where the obligations sought to be enforced devolve upon a corporation or continuing body,' as \n\n[218 U.S. 487, 493]\n\u00a0\n pointed out in United States ex rel. Bernardin v. Butterworth, \n169 \nU.S. 600, 603\n, 42 S. L. ed. 873, 874, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 441, distinguishing Leaven- worth County v. Sellew, \n99 U.S. 624\n, 25 L. ed. 333, and Thompson v. United States, \n103 U.S. 480\n, 26 L. ed. 521. The only ground for making McChesney a defendant is to enjoin him personally from doing something which he may not lawfully do, and to require him personally to do another thing which it is claimed is his legal duty to do as an administrative act requiring no discretion. If he disobey the mandate or injunction of the court he personally would be in contempt. He only can be rightly made to bear the costs of this proceeding if the complainant should succeed, and he only could be compelled to obey the decree of the court. As his official authority has terminated, the case, so far as it seeks to accomplish the object of the bill, is at an end, there being no statute providing for the substitution of McChesney's successor in a suit of this character. The case is governed by United States v. Boutwell, 17 Wall. 604, 21 L. ed. 721; United States ex rel. Bernardin v. Butterworth, \n169 U.S. 600\n, 42 L. ed. 873, 18 Sup. Ct.

MILLER & LUX(1910)\n\nArgued: Decided: November 7, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 258, 259]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James F. Peck, Charles C. Boynton, and Frederick D. McKenney for petitioner.\n Messrs. Aldis B. Browne, Alexander Britton, Frank H. Short, Isaac Frohman, Edward F. Treadwell, and W. B. Treadwell for respondents.\n Mr. James F. Peck for petitioner on reargument.\n Messrs. Edward F. Treadwell, Aldis B. Browne, and Alexander Britton for respondents on reargument.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n These cases are brought to this court by certiorari. The facts material to the understanding and decision of them are these: Miller & Lux is a corporation using the water of the Walker river in Nevada, and claiming rights in the same. The two branches of this river, known as East Fork and West Fork, rise in California and unite in Nevada above Miller & Lux. One Rickey used the water of both of these branches in California, and claimed rights superior to those of the parties lower down on the stream. On June 10, 1902, Miller & Lux brought a bill in equity in the circuit court for the district of Nevada against Rickey and certain other defendants, some of whom are respondents in the second of the present cases, to enjoin interference with its use of water. Rickey appeared, pleaded to the jurisdiction that the diversion of water by him was in California (127 Fed. 573), and, later, answered. But, after appearing, he, with other members of his family, organized the petitioning corporation, and he conveyed his lands and rights in California to it. On October 15, 1904, this corporation began two actions in a state court of California against Miller & Lux, the defendants in the bill of Miller & Lux other than Rickey, and others, to quiet its title and establish its prior right to 1575 cubic feet per second on the West Fork, and to 504 feet on the East Fork. In December, a few days before they were served with process in the last- \n\n[218 U.S. 258, 260]\n\u00a0\n mentioned suits, other defendants in the bill brought by Miller & Lux brought a cross bill against their codefendant Rickey to establish their priority as against him. In 1906, the bills in these present cases were brought by Miller & Lux, and defendants other than Rickey in the original Miller & Lux suit, to restrain proceedings in the California actions, on the ground that the United States court for Nevada had acquired jurisdiction before the California actions were begun. Injunctions were granted as prayed, and now are before this court for review. 81 C. C. A. 207, 152 Fed. 11, affirming 146 Fed. 574, 581, 588.\n The petitioner contends that there is no conflict of jurisdiction, and that the proceedings in the California court should go on. Its argument is this: When a right is asserted in favor of land in one jurisdiction over land in another, different principles are involved from those that suffice when both parcels are subject to the same law. When such rights have been recognized, it has been on the ground of an assumed 'concurrence between the two states, the one, so to speak, offering the right, the other permitting it to be accepted. Mannville Co. v. Worcester, 138 Mass. 89,' 52 Am. Rep. 261. Missouri v. Illinois, \n200 \nU.S. 496, 521\n, 50 S. L. ed. 572, 579, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 268. But still there are two parcels of land subject to different systems of law; and although the rights and liabilities in respect of each may require a consideration of the other if they are to be dealt with completely, the fact remains that each may be regulated by the state where the land lies according to its sovereign will. Kansas v. Colorado, \n206 \nU.S. 46, 93\n, 51 S. L. ed. 956, 973, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 655. If, then, the courts of one state are about to deal with one parcel, they should not be indirectly interfered with by a foreign court that has no power to control the use of the res. It is said to be a general principle that apart from some privity, such as is created by contract, trust, or fraud, courts of equity recognize the impropriety of using their power over the \n\n[218 U.S. 258, 261]\n\u00a0\n person to achieve such a result. Northern Indiana R. Co. v. Michigan C. R. Co. 15 How. 233, 242-244, 14 L. ed. 674-679; Carpenter v. Strange, \n141 U.S. 87\n, 35 L. ed. 640, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 960; Norris v. Chambres, 29 Beav. 246, 253, 254, S. C. 3 De G. F. & J. 583, 584. It is conceivable, to be sure, that the decisions of this court may determine that the states have rights as against each other in invitum in streams that flow through the land of both. Kansas v. Colorado, \n206 \nU.S. 46, 84\n, 51 S. L. ed. 956, 969, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 655; Missouri v. Illinois, \n200 \nU.S. 496, 519\n, 520 S., 50 L. ed. 572, 578, 579, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 268. These rights may vary according to the system of law required by natural conditions. They may be more or less analogous to common-law rights between upper and lower proprietors, where irrigation is not necessary, as in most of the older states. See New York v. Pine, \n185 \nU.S. 93, 96\n, 46 S. L. ed. 820, 821, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 592. There may be some, perhaps limited, right of appropriation in the upper state, at least in the watershed of the stream, where irrigation is the condition of using the land. See Kansas v. Colorado, \n206 U.S. 46\n, 100-104, 117, 51 L. ed. 956, 975-977, 983, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 655. But whatever this court may decide, if a private owner should derive advantage from such a decision it would not be in his own right, but by reason of and subordinate to the rights of his state, and those rights, the petitioner insists, can, or at least should be, determined only in a suit brought by the state itself.\n But if for any reason the foregoing argument should not have prevailed as against Rickey if he had brought the actions in California after the beginning of the suit in Nevada, the present petitioner is not affected by the proceedings against Rickey, as they were purely personal, and did not concern a purchaser of land outside the jurisdiction. To affect a purchaser with a suit against his vendor, it is said that at least the res must be within the territorial jurisdiction of the court, in which the suit is brought. See Fall v. Eastin, \n215 U.S. 1\n, 54 L. ed. 65, 23 L.R.A.(N.S.) 924, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 3.\n We are of opinion that the petitioner fails to establish the conclusion for which it contends. The alleged rights \n\n[218 U.S. 258, 262]\n\u00a0\n of Miller & Lux involve a relation between parcels of land that cannot be brought within the same jurisdiction. This relation depends as well upon the permission of the laws of Nevada as upon the compulsion of the laws of California. It is true that the acts necessary to enforce it must be done in California, and require the assent of that state so far as this court does not decide that they may be demanded as a consequence of whatever right, if any, it may attribute to Nevada. But, leaving the latter possibility on one side, if California recognizes private rights that cross the border line, the analogies are in favor of allowing them to be enforced within the jurisdiction of either party to the joint arrangement. Great Falls Mfg. Co. v. Worster, 23 N. H. 462. Full justice cannot be done and anomalous results avoided unless all the rights of the parties before the court in virtue of the jurisdiction previously acquired are taken in hand. To adjust the rights of the parties within the state requires the adjustment of the rights of the others outside of it. Of course, the court sitting in Nevada would not attempt to apply the law of Nevada, so far as that may be different from the law of California, to burden land or water beyond the state line, but the necessity of considering the law of California is no insuperable difficulty in dealing with the case. Foreign law often has to be ascertained and acted upon, and one court ought to deal with the whole matter.\n We are of opinion, therefore, that there was concurrent jurisdiction in the two courts, and that the substantive issues in the Nevada and California suits were so far the same that the court first seised should proceed to the determination without interference, on the principles now well settled as between the courts of the United States and of the states. Prout v. Starr, \n188 \nU.S. 537, 544\n, 47 S. L. ed. 584, 587, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 398; Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123, 161\n, 162 S., 52 L. ed. 714, 729, 730, 13 L.R.A.(N.S.) 932, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 441.\n As to the argument that the Rickey Land Company is not affected by any priority that may have been gained \n\n[218 U.S. 258, 263]\n\u00a0\n as against Rickey, it might be a question, even if the petitioner was a purchaser without notice, whether the purchaser would not be confined to asserting its rights in the pending cause. See Whiteside v. Haselton, \n110 \nU.S. 296, 301\n, 28 S. L. ed. 152, 154, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1. But in this case, if the judge below was of opinion as matter of fact on what appears that the institution of the petition was merely a device to dodge the jurisdiction of the Nevada court, and that the Rickey Land & Cattle Company was merely Rickey under another name, we could not say that his finding was wrong.\n It is urged that the cross bills on which the bill and injunction in the second case were based were not maintainable because not in aid of the defenses to the original suit of Miller & Lux. But it might very well be, as was shown by the argument for the respondents, that even if they admitted the right of Miller & Lux, still a decree as between themselves and other defendants would be necessary in order to prevent a decree for Miller & Lux from working injustice. See further, Ames Realty Co. v. Big Indian Min. Co. 146 Fed. 166. The cross bills being maintainable, the jurisdiction in respect of them follows that over the principal bill.\n Decrees affirmed. \n\n\n\n","141":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nROGERS v.

Coudert and Howard Thayer Kingsbury for plaintiffs in error. \n\n[218 U.S. 386, 387]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Fowler for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n Maria and Juana Roura petitioned the court of land registration to register their alleged title as undivided equal owners of a piece of real estate situated in the pueblo of San Miguel de Mayumo, province of Bulacan. See, for the general functions of the court of land registration, Carino v. Insular Government, \n212 U.S. 449\n, 53 L. ed. 594, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 334; Reavis v. Fianza, \n215 U.S. 16\n, 54 L. ed. 72, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1. This writ of error is prosecuted to a judgment of the supreme court, affirming the trial court in refusing, on the opposition of the insular government, the prayer for registration.\n The right to prosecute the writ is challenged on the ground that the amount involved is not sufficient to confer jurisdiction, and because there are no questions arising adequate alone to give jurisdiction. Without going into detail, we say, in view of the affidavits filed in this court concerning the value of the property, after allowing for the elements of speculation possibly entering into the amount fixed in the affidavits, we think, in the absence of affidavits in rebuttal, a sufficient showing has been made to give jurisdiction. We therefore overrule the motion to dismiss, and proceed to the merits.\n To reduce the case to the issues essential to be decided requires a statement of the source and history of the title whose registry was asked. We therefore at once state the salient and indisputable facts on that subject. On the 24th of March, 1885, by act before a notary public, Jose Mercado, declaring that he owned and possessed two parcels of irrigated land situated in Sibul, pueblo of San Migual de Mayumo, sold the same for cash to Juan Roura. A few weeks after, on May the 3d, 1885, the acting petty governor of the pueblo of San Miguel \n\n[218 U.S. 386, 388]\n\u00a0\n de Mayumo issued a certificate, stating that Jose Mercado had a certificate, stating that jose Mercado had three parcels of irrigated land in the pueblo, two of which are rice lands and the other serves as a building lot and garden, where he has his house erected; that he had possessed the land peaceably and uninterruptedly for more than thirty years, and asking that a certificate be issued as to the truth of these declarations. It was recited in the certificate that the 'commune of leading citizens' was convoked and that they unanimously declared that the statements of Mercado were in effect true. The certificate was signed by the petty governor and the individual citizens who had been convoked to pass upon its statements. The purpose of obtaining the certificate does not appear, but it is inferable that it was intended to be used in a proceeding to be instituted by Mercado to obtain a recognition from the proper administrative authorities of his alleged title to the land. We say this because, four months after, it appears among the files of a proceeding in which, on September 10, 1885, the general directorate of civil administration, under the authority vested in it by the regulations authorizing it to adjust and compose outstanding claims of title to the royal and unreclaimed lands, directed a deed to be issued to Mercado covering two tracts of land in the pueblo of San Miguel de Mayumo upon the payment of two and a fraction pesos. The sum thus to be paid, it was declared, represented 10 per cent of the assessment of the land, and was exacted 'for the expense of surveying the measurement to be made by a deputy surveyor of unreclaimed lands and the fees for the title deed, according to the provisions of the decree of the general government of these islands of September 12, 1882, approved by royal order of July 25, 1884.' On October 19, following, the director general of civil administration executed, on behalf of the directorate, a deed to Mercado of two \n\n[218 U.S. 386, 389]\n\u00a0\n pieces of real estate situate in the pueblo of San Miguel de Mayumo, the description of the second of which pieces in a general sense conformed as to its exterior boundaries to the description of one of the pieces which had been previously sold by Mercado to Roura, and also of one of the pieces described in the certificate of the petty governor. In making this deed, the director general declared that it was executed conformably to the decree of the general directorate of September 7, 1885, by which decree the ownership of the land had been 'awarded gratuitously to Mercado.' Shortly prior to the making of the deed by the director general to Mercado, that is, on September 25, and shortly following, on November 9, deeds authorized by the general directorate, to unreclaimed land in the pueblo of San Miguel, were made, the one in favor of Regino Pengson, and the other in favor of the parish priest of San Miguel. While the description of the land embraced by these two deeds, or the surveys cotemporaneously made concerning the same, are not in the record, it is established that the land which they embraced was surveyed by the official surveyor who surveyed the Mercado land, and that it was not supposed by the directorate that there was any conflict between the three claims.\n Shortly after the making of the Mercado deed it would seem that a complaint was made to the directorate of civil administration by Pengson, based upon an alleged conflict between the descriptions of the land embraced in the composition sale made to him and that described in the composition deed to Mercado. The precise character and extent of this conflict is not disclosed, but it is inferable from the documentary evidence that it related to the situation of a medicinal mineral spring, which was apparently claimed by both, Pengson under his composition and by Mercado under his. The matter was heard by the directorate of civil administration, and \n\n[218 U.S. 386, 390]\n\u00a0\n the result of the investigation of that body was by it reported to the governor general, with its recommendation for his action.\n The governor general, conformably to the recommendations made to him, issued an order annulling the composition proceedings, and the deeds issued thereunder to Pengson, Mercado, and the parish curate. It was expressly directed that all the proceedings in the several compositions be annulled, reserving the right of the parties to apply for a new composition. It was further directed, however, that before such new composition be allowed, a competent surveyor be appointed, who should mark out the boundaries of the medicinal mineral spring, with the appurtenant land necessary to enable the public to enjoy its benefits, and that such spring and the land so marked out should be held as public property, reserving to private owners the right to demand compensation for any private land taken in the execution of the order. In addition, the order commanded the local authorities to demand from Pengson, Mercado, and the parish priest a return of the deeds issued to them, which the order canceled; that the order be transmitted to the proper provincial and local authorities to be executed and put of record, in conformity to law. The order was published in the official gazette at Manila, and was undoubtedly communicated through the proper administrative channels to all the administrative officers who were concerned with its execution, including local officers of the pueblo of San Miguel. The grounds upon which the directorate recommended and the governor general annulled the composition proceedings, as above stated, were thus enumerated in the official files:\n'Account having been given by this central office to his excellency, the governor general, of the proceeding instituted by Don Jose Fores on behalf of Don Regino Pengson, Jose Fores on behalf of Don Regino Pengson, composition in the barrio of Sibul, pueblo of San Miguel de \n\n[218 U.S. 386, 391]\n\u00a0\n Mayumo, it being found that not only the land granted to the aforesaid Pengson, but also those granted to Jose Mercado and to the parish priest of San Miguel, do not agree in their location or boundaries with those set forth in the title deeds issued by this general directorate under date of November 9, October 19, and September 25 of last year, respectively, and that these differences originate in errors committed by the expert appraiser of lands, Don Jose Moreno, when he practised the acts relative to said lands in the capacity of acting deputy of unreclaimed lands. And it being found that the Sibul spring has never been known as private property, nor is it included in land which may have this character, but rather that those medicinal waters have been utilized, without any hindrance or obstacle, not only by the residents of the pueblo, but by the public in general, as is evidenced amongst other things by a certificate of the municipal authorities of San Miguel de Mayumo, and is confirmed by the unanimous and universal voice of the public, and it being found that the general inspection of unreclaimed lands and this general directorate have been taken unawares by the aforesaid expert to issue, as they did issue, by virtue of the surveys made by him, titles of ownership by composition of the lands bordering upon the Sibul springs, by reason of which it might be believed that the spring is found included within some of them, and that the public and free zone which all springs have and need for their enjoyment had disappeared, and considering that the three proceedings referred to embrace a vice of nullity from their beginning, because the data which appear in the notes of survey and measurement of the lands and the plans which accompany them are not correct, and consequently the title deeds issued do not describe the lands such as they really are, and considering that the party responsible for this discrepancy crepancy is the expert, Don Jose Moreno, who, when called to explain \n\n[218 U.S. 386, 392]\n\u00a0\n the errors committed by him, has not done so satisfactorily, errors all the more inexcusable in that there are involved parcels relatively small and contiguous, and surveyed and measured with an insignificant lapse of time between one and the other, giving rise to the suspicion that said errors have not been caused solely by neglect nor lack of zeal, but voluntarily, and with knowledge of the mistakes which are contained.'\n\n We state in a summary way the further official action concerning the medicinal spring referred to in the order. The governor general directed the proper provincial and local authorities to establish at the spring a sanitarium for the use of the public. But this not being carried out, it was suggested that the spring be placed under the control of private persons for the purpose of creating a sanitarium for the public benefit, and a moderate subvention from the treasury. This project also fell through, on the suggestion that private capital might not be willing to venture an outlay for the erection of the sanitarium, because of the fear of outstanding claims to ownership of the spring, and the dread that it might ultimately not be held to be public property. Subsequently the provincial and local authorities were directed by the governor general to investigate and report concerning the existence of alleged claims to private ownership of the spring, and, as incident thereto, to expressly report concerning its possession and use during the past. This order brought out an official statement as to the previous composition deeds, their annulment, etc., as we have stated them, coupled with a renewed declaration that investigation disclosed that the spring had never been possessed by any private person, but had always been enjoyed by the public and used as public property. Finally, in September, 1895, from Madrid, a royal decree was issued, the necessary effect of which was to sanction the previous action of the local authorities. This order \n\n[218 U.S. 386, 393]\n\u00a0\n directed that the spring, with adequate appurtenant property, be sold at public auction.\n Long prior to this, in fulfilment of the order of the governor general of March 5, 1886, in that year, and on the 23d of that month, demand was made of the curate of San Miguel for the return of the deed made to him in consequence of the composition proceedings, and he declared that he had mislaid the deed and could not find it. On the same day of the same month and year a demand was made both on Mercado and Pengson for their deeds. Pengson declared that, having filed his in the proceedings to vacate which had taken place before the directorate, he did not have the deed in his possession. Mercado declared that he had sold the land, and had delivered the deed to the purchaser. Not having disclosed who the purchaser was, further orders to call on him for disclosure were made, but he was absent and could not be reached. Afterwards, in October, 1890, Mercado having died, his widow, in answer to an official demand upon her, dcclared that the property covered by the composition had been conveyed by her husband during his life to Roura, to whom the deed had been delivered, and that Roura being dead, the deed would probably be found in the possession of his heir and daughter, Maria Roura, and she, upon demand being made upon her, declared that during the lifetime of her father she had heard the title deed mentioned, 'but at the present time I am ignorant of its whereabouts.' Although the precise date does not appear, it is certain that Roura died testate, and that, by an amicable adjustment and extrajudicial partition of his estate, his two daughters, Juana and Maria Roura, petitioners before the court of registration, become entitled to one undivided half each of his rights in and to the land conveyed by Mercado, if any such there were.\n With this prelude, we are brought to the initiation of \n\n[218 U.S. 386, 394]\n\u00a0\n the proceedings in the court of land registration, now before us.\n The petition was filed on September 19, 1904. It is alleged that the two plaintiffs were the equal undivided owners of a tract of land, which was described, the description evidently relating to one of the tracts of land which had been described in the deed from Mercado to Roura, and in the certificate issued to Mercado by the petty governor. It was besides alleged that the title of the petitioners was derived by them as heirs of their father, and that he had derived his title from the conveyance made to him by Mercado. It was averred that 'said property described is not occupied by anyone,' and, aside from any inference of possession to be drawn from the alleged ownership, there was no averment whatever of possession. Various documents were annexed to the petition, among which it is only necessary to mention the certificate issued to Mercado in 1885 by the petty governor and the deed made by Mercado to Roura.\n The insular government appeared and opposed the prayer for registration, on the ground that the petitioners had no title to the property, and that it was a part of the public domain. When the case was called for hearing, the husband of Mrs. Modesta Pengson appeared in her behalf to resist the registration applied for, on the ground that she held title to the property, and time was given to formulate an opposition, but this was not availed of, and no further action was taken on behalf of Mrs. Pengson. At the trial the petitioners offered various documents to establish their heirship of their father, which need not be referred to. Declaring that the property to which the petition related was that secondly described in the deed from Mercado to Roura (containing the spring), the petitioners offered that deed and the plan or sketch of the property, which was made in 1885, at the time of the composition proceedings. In addition they offered an \n\n[218 U.S. 386, 395]\n\u00a0\n official file containing one of the administrative reports which we have stated; that is, the one saying that it would be unwise to seek to procure private capital for the purpose of establishing a sanitarium until the question of whether there was a private claim to the property was clearly settled. The government offered files of the administrative proceedings, showing in great detail the facts which we have previously stated; that is, the order for composition in favor of Mercado by the directorate, the deed to him, the controversy originated by Pengson, the decree of the governor general vacating the compositions, and annulling all that had been done under them, and, indeed, establishing all the facts as to notice, the investigation and report as to possession, and the ultimate making of the royal decree. The evidence being closed, counsel for the petitioner thus stated to the court the proposition upon which he relied to secure the allowance of the registration of the title as prayed:\n'The court offers to hear the oral argument of Sr. Ferrer. Sr. Ferrer stated that he sought the court of land registration to obtain title deed to the parcel of land which is the subject of the proceeding. The right which his principals invoked was derived from the right of the original owner, Don Jose Mercado, who acquired the same by virtue of the grant made by the council of civil administration for a stipulated sum, in exchange for the parcel of land. The deceased, Juan Roura, father of the petitioners, acquired possession of this land by virtue of a deed of sale executed by Don Jose Mercado in his favor, and from him the petitioners inherited the same. After some time had elapsed, the general government annulled that title by grant without returning the money consideration for the land, and without previously hearing the defenses which the aggrieved owner might set up, when, as a matter of fact, this matter ought to have been heard before the competent court. This is not legal; it \n\n[218 U.S. 386, 396]\n\u00a0\n is an embezzlement, since it cannot be conceived that after the possession of this real estate had been lawfully granted, and the cost thereof had been paid to the satisfaction of both parties, as is witnessed by the documents in evidence, all the transaction should be afterward retroactively annulled.\n\n'These points having been explained, he requested the registration of the property in the name of his clients.'\n\n The court denied the prayer for the registration of the title. Summarily stated, it was of opinion, (a) that the subject of making the composition as to the unreclaimed land and awarding a deed was within the administrative authority of the officials, as was also the right to revoke and cancel the deed within a limited time for error found to exist or fraud discovered to have been practised in obtaining the deed; (b) that it was unnecessary to inquire whether irregularities existed in the proceedings by which the deed was canceled, or whether an abuse of administrative discretion had happened in those proceedings, because the Spanish law created express and exclusive remedies for the correction of such errors, and required that those remedies should be resorted to within a time designated, and did not therefore allow such complaints to become the subject matter of ordinary judicial controversies; (c) that as the deed which was relied upon as the basis for registration was the mere result of a composition proceeding, and was, in its essence, not a contract upon a moneyed consideration, but a mere gratuitous award, without the payment of a price, the question of error committed in the annulment proceedings came within one or the other of the systems of administrative recourse provided by the Spanish law, which, not having been availed of, operated to deprive of the right to complain judicially of the cancelation; (d) that there was no room for holding that the right to registry obtained because of a prescriptive title, acquired under the composi- \n\n[218 U.S. 386, 397]\n\u00a0\n tion deed to Mercado by virtue of article 1957 of the Civil Code, providing that 'ownership and other property rights in real property are prescribed by possession for ten years . . . with good faith and a proper title,' because, first, from the date of the annulment of the title good faith had in any event ceased to exist, and, second, because of the absence of the essential element of possession; since 'it has not been proved that there had been exercised, either before or after the declaration of nullity of the title, any possessory act on the part of the petitioners or of their predecessor. All effort of counsel for the petitioners consisted, after the opposition of the insular government was known, in proving that the former administration did not act within its powers in declaring the nullity of the title deed offered.' The case having been carried to the supreme court, that court affirmed the judgment upon grounds substantially identical with those which controlled the action of the trial court.\n Although we have concluded, from a consideration of the opinion of the court below, aided by the painstaking and full reference to the Spanish law contained in the brief on behalf of the insular government, that the court below was clearly right in its opinion as to the legal principles held to be decisive, we do not stop to state and review those considerations, because we think the argument at bar renders it unnecessary. We say this, because the argument for the plaintiffs in error in substance but proceeds upon the theory that, although the Spanish law was correctly expounded by the court below, nevertheless that law was inapposite because of conditions which it is insisted existed prior to and at the time the composition deed was issued and when the administrative order of annulment of that title was made. The proposition is thus stated in the argument:\n'The position of the plaintiffs may be very briefly summarized as follows: In 1885 Jose Mercado was already, \n\n[218 U.S. 386, 398]\n\u00a0\n by virtue of his thirty years' possession, the absolute owner of the land in question. The composition deed of October 19, 1885, did not create his title, but was merely evidence of it. The decree of March 5, 1886, was wholly ineffectual to devest his ownership, and at most only affected the record evidence of such ownership. It is immaterial that no affirmative proceedings were taken by Mercado or his successors in interest to question the validity and effect of the decree of annulment. They were justified in relying on their undisturbed possession and awaiting adverse action, when it would be open to them to raise all such questions. This ownership, founded on possession, was in itself a property right, protected by the treaty of Paris and the organic act, entitled to registration as a title in fee simple. The insular government is now asking this court to carry into effect even beyond its very terms a decree of a Spanish governor general, made thirteen years before the cession, which is void on its face, as in violation of the fundamental laws of the former government, and, by virtue of such void decree, to deny plaintiffs' ownership of lands which have been in their possession for fifty years,-a possession which the Spanish government never undertook to disturb.'\n\n And the theory of established possession upon which the contention rests is reiterated in many forms of expression throughout the entire argument. But when the statement of the case which we have made is considered, it becomes apparent that this contention misconceives the case as presented, since it proceeds upon an assumption unwarranted by the pleadings and unsustained by any proof whatever. As we have seen, the case as made by the pleadings was rested solely upon the right to register resulting from the composition deed, without the slightest averment of possession prior to the time that deed was issued, except as it may be considered that such possession was alleged as a necessary result of the averments as to \n\n[218 U.S. 386, 399]\n\u00a0\n the deed. It is further evident that the validity of the deed to Mercado was the one issue which arose on the opposition of the insular government. That this was understood by both parties clearly results from the fact that not a particle of proof was offered concerning the possession prior to or at the time of the composition deed, irrespective of the administrative proceedings leading up to the issue of that deed and following on its annulment. This, moreover, is additionally demonstrated by the express declaration of counsel for petitioners concerning the matter for decision, made after the evidence was in and the case was ripe for consideration. That the trial court had not the remotest thought that such issue was before it is plainly manifest from its statement that all the effort of the counsel of petitioners was directed to assailing the competency of the administrative officers to avoid the Mercado deed and annul the composition proceedings, and that no evidence whatever had been offered to prove possession of the property in controversy by Mercado or any of those holding under him, from the date of the deed up to and including the time of the submission of the cause. That this conception of the issue also prevailed when the case was taken to the supreme court of the islands we think is plainly apparent from the assignment of errors, referred to by the supreme court in its opinion. We think it also conclusively results from the opinion of the supreme court, when considered as a whole, that that court also thought the issue presented to it was thus limited. True it is that a concluding passage in the opinion of the supreme court is referred to as indicating that the court thought that the question of the acquisition by Mercado of the title to the property by pre emption prior to the composition deed was involved. But we do not think the passage in the opinion, when taken in connection with its context, has the meaning attributed to it. If it had, it would be the merest obiter, \n\n[218 U.S. 386, 400]\n\u00a0\n since the pleadings did not raise that issue, and there was not the slightest proof concerning it. While it is not necessary, we deem it well to say that, in reviewing the action of the court below, we are, of course, confined to the record and the case therein made, and may not, as the result of mistaken suggestions as to the issues and proof, disregard our duty by deciding, not the case as made, but an imaginary one, wherein issues not made and not presented below would have to be supplied, and whereby conjecture and surmise must be indulged to replace the total absence of all proof on a particular subject. So far as the unwarranted assumption concerning the subject of possession relates to acts done after the deed to Mercado, it is also disposed of by what we have said, and is besides completely answered by the express finding of both courts concerning the absence of all proof of possession during that period.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","143":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSANCHEZ v. U S(1910)\nNo. 69\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n Mr. S. Mallet-Prevost for appellant.\n\n\n[216 U.S. 167, 170]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Thompson and Mr. Franklin W. Collins for appellee.\n\n\n[216 U.S. 167, 171]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n The appellant, an inhabitant and citizen of Porto Rico, seeks to recover from the United States the value of a certain office held by him in that island before and during the war with Spain, of which office, it is alleged, he was illegally deprived by the United States. A demurrer to the complaint was sustained and judgment given for the United States, the \n\n[216 U.S. 167, 172]\n\u00a0\n opinion of the court of claims being delivered by Chief Justice Peelle. 42 Ct. Cl. 458, 472.\n The complaint, which, on demurrer, was adjudged to be bad, presents- using substantially the words of the complaint-the following case:\n In the year 1878, the claimant, Sanchez, purchased from one Florenzio Berrios y Lopez, for a valuable consideration, the office known as 'numbered procurador [solicitor] of the courts of first instance of the capital of Porto Rico,' at Guayamo, in perpetuity, and in the same year the governor general of Porto Rico issued a provisional patent in his favor. In 1881, the claimant's tenure of the office was approved and confirmed, and a final patent therefor was issued by the King of Spain, in accordance with the laws, practice, and custom of Spain and Porto Rico governing the sale, surrender, and transfer of such an office. The claimant, it is alleged, thereby became vested with all the legal rights and privileges appertaining to the office.\n From the date of the provisional patent issued to him until, as will be presently stated, he was deprived of his office, August 31st, 1899, the claimant exercised all the rights and privileges belonging to the office of procurador or solicitor. Under the laws of Spain and Porto Rico, it will be assumed, the office was transferable in perpetuity, and vested the incumbent with exclusive rights and privileges, and, as a consequence thereof, the claimant was entitled, under the laws of Spain in force in Porto Rico, during all the time he held the office, to perform its duties and receive its fees and emoluments, which, prior to August 31st, 1899, averaged, it is alleged, more than $200 per month, of which he could not be legally deprived except by due process of law.\n On the 10th day of December, 1898, [30 Stat. at L. 1754], a treaty of peace between the United States and Spain was concluded, and having been duly ratified by the respective countries, was duly proclaimed April 11th, 1899. The treaty contained these provisions: 'Spain cedes to the United States the island of \n\n[216 U.S. 167, 173]\n\u00a0\n Porto Rico and other islands now under Spanish sovereignty in the West Indies, and the island of Gaum in the Marianas or Ladrones.' Art. 2. 'And it is hereby declared that the relinquishment or cession, as the case may be, to which the preceding paragraph refers, cannot in any respect impair the property or rights which by law belong to the peaceful possession of property of all kinds, of provinces, municipalities, public or private establishments, ecclesiastical or civic bodies, or any other associations having legal capacity to acquire and possess property in the aforesaid territories renounced or ceded, or of private individuals, of whatsoever nationality such individuals may be.' Art. 8.\n A military government was organized in Porto Rico and was maintained there from October, 1898, up to and after April 30th, 1900. On the latter date, General Davis, as military governor, issued what is known as general order 134, containing these, among other, paragraphs: '11. The office of solicitor ('procurador') is abolished. Those who have heretofore practised as such before any court, and are of good repute, shall, in default of lawyers, have the right to be appointed municipal judges or clerks of municipal courts. 12. Hereafter, litigants who do not appear personally shall be represented before the supreme court and district courts exclusively by a lawyer, no powers of attorney being necessary therefor; it shall be the duty of the courts to suspend from the practice of his profession any lawyer who shall, without authority, assume to represent a litigant; but this shall not affect the civil or criminal liability which such lawyer may thereby incur. In the municipal courts, litigants may represent themselves or may be represented by an attorney in fact, resident of the place. 13. For the purpose of conducting the proceedings, lawyers may make use of such agents as they may by writing designate to the court.' That order was issued without notice to claimant and without any complaint being made as to the manner in which he was exercising his rights or discharging his dities. \n\n[216 U.S. 167, 174]\n\u00a0\n On the 12th day of April, 1900, Congress passed (to take effect May 1st, 1900) what is known as the Foraker act, temporarily to provide revenues and civil government for Porto Rico, and for other purposes. That act contained this provision: 'Sec. 8. That the laws and ordinances of Porto Rico now in force shall continue in full force and effect, except as altered, amended, or modified hereinafter, or as altered or modified by military orders and decrees in force when this act shall take effect, and so far as the same are not inconsistent or in conflict with the statutory laws of the United States not locally inapplicable, or the provisions hereof, until altered, amended, or repealed by the legislative authority hereinafter provided for Porto Rico, or by act of Congress of the United States' 31 Stat. at L. 77, 79, chap. 191.\n The reasonable value, the claimant alleges, of the 'transferable' or 'numbered procurador of the courts of first instance of the capital of Porto Rico,' in perpetuity, was $50,000, for which amount he asks judgment. No compensation has ever been made to claimant for the loss of his office, and no action has been taken on his present claim, either by Congress or by any department of the United States government.\n Such is the case made by the claimant in his petition.\n The claimant proceeds in his petition on the ground that the effect of the 8th section of the act of Congress of April 12th, 1900, was to confiscate, funally and effectually, without compensation to him, the office which he claims to have lawfully purchased in perpetuity, prior to the occupation of Porto Rico by the military forces of the United States, and the cession of that island to this country; which confiscation, he insists, could not have been legally done without violating the treaty between the United States and Spain which was in force when the act of 1900 was passed.\n We do not think that the present claim is covered by the treaty. It is true that a treaty negotiated by the United States is a part of the supreme law of the land, and that it is \n\n[216 U.S. 167, 175]\n\u00a0\n expressly provided in the treaty in question that it 'cannot in any respect impair the property or rights which by law belong to the peaceful possession of property of all kinds . . . of private individuals.' But, clearly, those provisions have no reference to public or quasi public stations, the functions and duties of which it is the province of government to regulate or control for the welfare of the people, even where the incumbents of such stations are permitted, while in the discharge of their duties, to earn and receive emoluments or fees for services rendered by them. The words in the treaty, 'property . . . of private individuals,' evidently referred to ordinary private property, of present, ascertainable value, and capable of being transferred between man and man.\n When the United States, in the progress of the war with Spain, took firm, military possession of Porto Rico, and the sovereignty of Spain over that island and its inhabitants and their property was displaced, the United States, the new sovereign, found that some persons claimed to have purchased, to hold in perpetuity, and to be entitled, without regard to the public will, to discharge the duties of certain offices or positions which were not strictly private positions in which the public had no interest. They were offices of a quasi public nature, in that the incumbents were officers of court, and in a material sense connected with the administration of justice in tribunals created by government for the benefit of the public. It is inconceivable that the United States, when it agreed in the treaty not to impair the property or rights of private individuals, intended to recognize, or to feel itself bound to recognize, the salability of such positions in perpetuity, or to so restrict its sovereign authority that it could not, consistently with the treaty, abolish a system that was entirely foreign to the conceptions of the American people, and inconsistent with the spirit of our institutions. It is true that Congress did not, we assume, intend by the Foraker act to modify the treaty, but, if that act were deemed inconsistent with the treaty, the act would \n\n[216 U.S. 167, 176]\n\u00a0\n prevail; for an act of Congress, passed after a treaty takes effect, must be respected and enforced, despite any previous or existing treaty provision on the same subject. J. Ribas y Hijo v. United States, \n194 \nU.S. 315, 324\n, 48 S. L. ed. 994, 996, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 727, and authorities cited. If, originally, the claimant lawfully purchased, in perpetuity, the office of solicitor (procurador) and held it when Porto Rico was acquired by the United States, he acquired and held it subject, necessarily, to the power of the United States to abolish it whenever it conceived that the public interest demanded that to be done. The intention of Congress in relation to the office of solicitor or procurador by the Foraker act cannot be doubted,-indeed, its abolition by Congress is made the ground of the present action and claim. Upon the acquisition of Porto Rico, that island was placed under military government, subject, until Congress acted in the premises, to the authority of the President as Commander in Chief acting under the Constitution and laws of the United States. Porto Rico was made a department by order of the President on the 18th of October, 1898. By his sanction, it must be presumed, general order No. 134 was made, abolishing the office of solicitor or procurador. That order was recognized by Congress, if such recognition was essential to its validity, when Congress, by the Foraker act of 1900, provided that the laws and ordinances of Porto Rico, then in force, should continue in full force and effect, except 'as altered or modified by military orders in force' when that act was passed. It is clear that claimant is not entitled to be compensated for his office by the United States because of its exercise of an authority unquestionably possessed by it as the lawful sovereign of the island and its inhabitants. The abolition of the office was not, we think, in violation of any provision of the Constitution, nor did it infringe any right of property which the claimant could assert as against the United States. See O'Reilly de Camara v. Brooke, \n209 \nU.S. 45, 49\n, 52 S. L. ed. 676, 677, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 439.

WAGNER(1910)\nNo. 81\nArgued: January 17, 1910Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 375, 376]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Antonio Knauth and John G. Johnson for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 375, 378]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Walter F. Murray for respondents.\n\n\n[216 U.S. 375, 379]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The petitioner is the owner of wells in Budapest from which comes the water known throughout the world by the arbitrary name, 'Hunyadi Janos,' given to it by her husband. The \n\n[216 U.S. 375, 380]\n\u00a0\n respondents make a bitter water in Cincinnati, and label it 'W. T. Wagner's Sons Carbonated Artificial Hunyadi, Conforming to Fresenius Analysis of Hunyadi Janos Springs.' Formerly they for a time labeled it 'W. T. Wagner's Sons Artificial Hunyadi Janos. Ofen Bitter Water. Highly Aerated;' but this label had been given up before the bill was brought. The petitioner seeks an injunction against the use of either 'Hunyadi Janos' or 'Hunyadi' on any water not coming from her wells. The circuit court of appeals for the seventh circuit, in a more or less similar case, granted an injunction against the use of the word 'Hunyadi.' Thackeray v. Saxlehner, 60 C. C. A. 562, 125 Fed. 911. In the present suit, the circuit court and the circuit court of appeals, treating the right of the petitioners to 'Hunyadi Janos' as admitted, refused an injunction against the use of 'Hunyadi,' and, finding that no unfair competition was shown, dismissed the bill. 85 C. C. A. 321, 157 Fed. 745. A writ of certiorari was allowed by this court.\n We see no reason for disturbing the finding of the courts below, that there was no unfair competition and no fraud. The real intent of the plaintiff's bill, it seems to us, is to extend the monopoly of such trademark or tradename as she may have to a monopoly of her type of bitter water, by preventing manufacturers from telling the public in a way that will be understood, what they are copying and trying to sell. But the plaintiff has no patent for the water, and the defendants have a right to reproduce it as nearly as they can. They have a right to tell the public what they are doing, and to get whatever share they can in the popularity of the water by advertising that they are trying to make the same article, and think that they succeed. If they do not convey, but, on the contrary, exclude, the notion that they are selling the plaintiff's goods, it is a strong proposition that when the article has a well-known name, they have not the right to explain by that name what they imitate. By doing so, they are not trying to get the good will of the name, but the good \n\n[216 U.S. 375, 381]\n\u00a0\n will of the goods. See Flagg Mfg. Co. v. Holway, 178 Mass. 83, 91, 59 N.

Although the application is different, the principle seems to be similar to the rule that when a patent has expired, descriptive words or even an arbitrary or personal name by which it has become known may be used, if sufficient precautions are taken to prevent the public from being deceived. See Singer Mfg. Co. v. June Mfg. Co. \n163 U.S. 169\n, 41 L. ed. 118, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1002\n\n\n The plaintiff says that no one can succeed in imitating a natural water. But all are free to try. In the absence of some fraud, injurious to the plaintiff, it would be going far under any circumstances to allow her to prevent advertising 'Artificial Hunyadi.' But it is enough to say that under the decision in Saxlehner v. Eisner & M. Co. \n179 \nU.S. 19, 36\n, 45 S. L. ed. 60, 75, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 7, the defendants may do so in this case. In that decision it was said that 'Hunyadi,' as applied to similar water, had been public property in Hungary, and therefore had become so here; and that a later change there would not work a corresponding change in the United States. 'The right to individual appropriation, once lost, is gone forever.' See also French Republic v. Saratoga Vichy Spring Co. \n191 \nU.S. 427, 437\n, 48 S. L. ed. 247, 252, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 145. At the very least, the family name has become the name for any natural water of a certain type coming from a more or less extensive district, if not from anywhere in Hungary. It does not belong to the plaintiff alone in this country, even if she is the only one now sending the water here. But if there is any well-founded doubt as to the right to use a personal tradename with proper guards against deception to signify what one is imitating, where one has the right to imitate, there can be none that one is at liberty to refer to a geographical expression to signify the source of one's model. 'Hunyadi,' at best, is now only a geographical expression in effect.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","145":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSCHULTZ v.

Smith for defendant in error. \n\n[218 U.S. 57, 62]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case involves the consideration of the validity under the Constitution of the United States of the imposition of double damages under an act of the state of Minnesota for a 'casual and involuntary trespass,' made by cutting or assisting to cut timber upon the lands of the state. The act is set out in the margin. \n The action was brought to recover the sum of $51,324.42 for timber cut by plaintiffs in error from certain lands of \n Sec. 7. If any person, firm, or corporation, without a valid and existing permit therefor, cuts, or employs or induces any other person, firm, or corporation to cut or assist in cutting, any timber of whatsoever description, on state lands, or removes or carries away, or employs, or induces, or assists any other person, firm, or corporation to remove or carry away, any such timber or other property, he shall be liable to the state in treble damages, if such trespass is adjudged to have been wilful; but double damages only in case the trespass is adjudged to have been casual and involuntary, and shall have no right whatsoever to any remuneration or allowance for labor or expenses incurred in removing such other property, cutting such timber, preparing the same for market, or transporting the same to or towards market.\n Whoever cuts or removes, or employs or induces any other person, firm, or corporation to cut or remove, any timber or other property from state lands, contrary to the provisions of this act, or without conforming in each and every respect thereto, shall be guilty of a felony, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand ( 1,000) dollars, or by imprisonment in the state prison not exceeding two ( 2) years, or by both, in case the trespass is adjudged to have been wilful.\n Whenever any timber so cut is intermingled with any other timber, or whenever other property taken from state lands is intermingled with other property, the state may seize and sell the whole quantity so intermingled, pursuant to the provisions of section forty (40) of this act, and such other timber or property shall be presumed to have been also cut from state lands.\n Providing the intermingling of timber above referred to shall only apply to cases having been adjudged as wilful trespass. [Gen. Laws 1895, chap. 163, p. 352.] \n\n[218 U.S. 57, 63]\n\u00a0\n the state 'without a valid and existing permit.' The question in the case revolves around this permit and the extensions of it alleged by plaintiffs in error to have been given.\n The findings of the court show the following facts: The state sold at public auction, in accordance with the statute, the timber on the lands to John F. Irwin, one of the plaintiffs in error, acting for himself and as agent of the Shevlin-Carpenter Company, and a permit was issued by the auditor and land commissioners of the state, which contained the following clause: 'That no extension of time of this permit shall be granted except as provided in  24, chapter 163, General Laws 1895.' The section provides that no permit shall be issued to cover more than two seasons, and no permit shall be extended except by unanimous consent of the board of timber commissioners, and under no circumstances shall an extension be granted for more than one year, and then only for good and sufficient reasons. Irwin gave bond as required by law. On the 7th of May, 1902, the permit was extended until the 1st of June, 1903. At the time the permit was extended, the sum of $1,307, as required by law, was paid by plaintiffs in error into the treasury of the state, that sum being 25 per cent of the appraised value of the timber. In the winter of the years 1903- '4, plaintiffs in error, knowing that there had been one extension of the permit, and that that extension had expired, entered upon the land and cut and removed therefrom 2,444,020 feet of timber, which it was agreed was worth $6 per thousand feet, board measure. After the timber was cut, the surveyor general of the lumber district scaled and returned the amount of the same to the auditor of the state, which officer erroneously computed the amount due from the plaintiffs in error at the contract price of stumpage value thereof, as if the permit were still in force, finding the same to be $18,574.39. \n\n[218 U.S. 57, 64]\n\u00a0\n This amount was paid to the state, and no part of it has been returned.\n From these facts the court deduced the conclusion that the permit expired on the 1st of June, 1902, and that the extension thereof expired on the 1st of June, 1903, and that after the latter date it was of no effect and absolutely void, and was known to be so to plaintiffs in error when they cut the timber in controversy, and that their entry upon the lands was in violation of the law. They were adjudged wilful violators of the law, and damages were assessed against them at treble the value of the timber; to wit, $43,992.36. The court, however, decided that a deduction should be made from that sum of $16,997, money paid by plaintiffs in error to the state after the permit had expired. There were other sums of money, with the disposition of which we are not concerned. Judgment was entered against plaintiffs in error for the sum of $26,995.17. The supreme court affirmed the conclusion of the trial court, that the permit had expired, and that the cutting and removing of the timber were illegal, but disagreed with that court as to the character of the trespass. The supreme court said: 'The finding of the trial court that appellant was guilty of a wilful trespass is not sustained by the evidence. On the contrary, the record conclusively shows that appellant had reasonable ground for believing authority had been granted, and honestly acted on such belief.' [ 102 Minn. 479, 113 N. W. 638.] The court hence decided that the judgment should only have been for double, not treble, damages, saying: 'Being of opinion that in this action the state is limited to a recovery of double damages, and the timber cut having been paid for, the judgment is necessarily to the value as found.' The case was remanded with directions to reduce the judgment to $14,664.12. In all other respects it was affirmed.\n On the question of the validity of the law under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United \n\n[218 U.S. 57, 65]\n\u00a0\n States, the court said: 'On a former appeal upon demurrer to the complaint ( 99 Minn. 158, 108 N. W. 935, 9 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 634), the constitutional questions were raised, and it was there held that the act was constitutional, and that in case of trespass the state might recover either the double value of the property taken, or treble its value, according to whether the facts constituted a casual or involuntary, or a wilful and unlawful trespass. We adhere to that decision, and for the reasons set forth in the opinion then filed.'\n This statement of the facts and the rulings of the courts of Minnesota exhibit the controversy, the state contending that the penalties of the statute are incurred by a casual or involuntary trespass; the plaintiffs in error insisting that to attach that consequence to acts done in good faith violates the due process clause of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n Another contention is made by plaintiffs in error. The statute makes one who cuts or removes timber contrary to the provisions of the act, or 'without conforming in each and every respect thereto,' guilty of a felony, and prescribes a fine or imprisonment, or both, in case the trespass is adjudged to have been wilful. To avail themselves of an objection to these provisions, plaintiffs in error insist that they are not separable from the provision for double and treable damages, and the statute becomes therefore unconstitutional, for under it the plaintiffs in error are subject to be put twice in jeopardy for the same offense.\n The argument made to sustain the contention that the act must be considered single, and that to treat its provisions as separable would destroy its integrity and defeat the purpose of the legislature, is somewhat elaborate. Its basic elements are that the statute is penal, and its provisions for damages and for fine and imprisonment are punishments for the same act of wrongdoing, designed as \n\n[218 U.S. 57, 66]\n\u00a0\n such, and intended to be inseparable, and that the statute therefore subjects an offender to a double jeopardy. And this though the two punishments 'may be inflicted in different proceedings;' it being contended that 'it is immaterial that one of the proceedings is civil in form.' This being the consequence of the statute, it is insisted that it 'does not satisfy the requirements of due process of law,' and deprives plaintiffs in error 'of a privilege and immunity guaranteed under the Federal Constitution.'\n The argument may be answered by denying its assumptions. The purpose of the act does not depend upon the inseparableness of its punishment. Its purpose, of course, was to protect the timber lands of the state, and some sanctions of the purpose there necessarily had to be. Double or treble damages and criminal punishment were selected, but they have no such dependence on each other, nor such relation to the purpose of the act, as to demonstrate that both forms were necessary to it, or that one would not have been selected if the other could not have been. But, it is contended, this conclusion is not open to ths court to make, for the 'sufficient and compelling reason' that the supreme court of the state has decided to the contrary. To sustain this conclusion, plaintiffs in error quote certain contentions of the attorney general of the state, made in the supreme court, and the reply of the court to the contentions. They do not support the conclusion deduced from them. It was urged by the attorney general that only wilful trespassers were subject to fine and imprisonment, but if such punishment could be held applicable to 'casual and involuntary' trespassers, and the act to decided unconstitutional as to that class, nevertheless it could be adjudged constitutional as to wilful trespassers. The court replied that the provision for fines and imprisonment was applicable to both classes of trespassers. As to the punishments, the \n\n[218 U.S. 57, 67]\n\u00a0\n court intimated that they were independent. Replying to the contention that to sustain this action would subject plaintiffs in error to the jeopardy of a second punishment, the court said that plaintiffs in error were 'probably a little premature in raising the point.' And further said, 'it might come with some force if presented in a criminal prosecution after recovery in a civil action.' In this we concur. In other words, plaintiffs in error cannot base a defense upon an anticipation of what may never occur. To permit this would discharge them from all liability, for the defense, if good at all, would be good against whatever action might be brought. Necessarily there must be a first jeopardy before there can be a second, and only when a second is sought is the constitutional immunity from double punishment threatened to be taken away. An occasion for the defense of double jeopardy may occur if the state of Minnesota should proceed criminally against plaintiffs in error. We do not mean to say, however, that it will be justified. We do not mean to say that the state law subjects an offender against its provisions to a double jeopardy. Nor do we mean to imply that even if it have such effect, the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States may be invoked against it. Of that question we reserve opinion.\n The next contention of plaintiffs in error is that 'both the provisions of  7 make a casual and involuntary trespasser liable to the state in double damages, and that declaring his act a felony violates the 14th Amendment,' because those provisions 'eliminate altogether the question of intent,' and that the 'elimination of intent as an element of an offense is contrary to the requirements of due process of law.' To support the contention, plaintiffs in error attack the power of a legislature to make an innocent act a crime, and say that the 'principle that the legislature cannot, by its mere flat, make an act otherwise innocent a crime, and punishable as such, is one to \n\n[218 U.S. 57, 68]\n\u00a0\n which this court will give effect, even though it be not expressly enunciated by the Constitution.' The principle as thus expressed is very general, and takes no account of whether a law have prospective or retrospective operation. It would seem, therefore, to destroy the well- recognized distinction between mala in se and mala prohibita. The principle contended for is probably not intended to be taken so broadly, and its generality is further limited by concession that it may have exceptions 'where so-called criminal negligence supplies a place of criminal intent, or where, in a few instances, the public welfare has made it necessary to declare a crime, irrespective of the actor's intent.' A concession of exceptions would seem to destroy the principle. If the principle gets its life or its protection from the 14th Amendment, it cannot be destroyed by the legislature upon any conception of the public welfare. The Constitution declares the principle upon which the public welfare is to be promoted, and opposing ones cannot be substituted. Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co. \n184 \nU.S. 540, 558\n, 46 S. L. ed. 679, 689, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 431.\n It will be seen that the foundation of the arguments of plaintiffs in error is that their trespass was an innocent act. There is some ambiguity as to what is meant by 'innocence.' They quote Mr. Justice Chase in Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 1 L. ed. 648. It was there said that 'a law that punished a citizen for an innocent action, or, in other words, for an act which, when done, was in violation of no existing law,' could not 'be considered a righful exercise of legislative power.' But it was said: 'The legislature may enjoin, permit, forbid, and punish; they may declare new crimes and establish rules of conduct for all its citizens in future cases.' In other words, innocence cannot be asserted of an action which violates existing law, and ignorance of the law will not excuse. The law in controversy has no ex post facto element or effect in it. It was existing law when the trespass of plaintiffs in error \n\n[218 U.S. 57, 69]\n\u00a0\n was committed, and a trespass is a legal wrong, not an innocent act. There is no element of deception or surprise in the law. When the permit was issued, plaintiffs in error knew the limitations of it, and they took it at the risk and consequences of transgression. The state sought to guard against its wilful or accidental abuse. Permits had been abused and the lands of the state despoiled of their timber. The offenders were difficult to detect, or, if detected, the character of their acts, whether wilful, accidental, or involuntary, equally difficult to establish; and the state, the supreme court said, had been 'defrauded and robbed of large sums of money.' Double and treble damages and a criminal prosecution were provided to meet the situation. It would be strange, indeed, if it were not within the competency of the legislature. To hold otherwise would take from the legislature the power to adjust legislation to evils as they arise and to the ways by which they may be effected. We held in St John v. New York, \n201 U.S. 633\n, 50 L. ed. 896, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 554, 5 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 909, that a state did not offend the equality clause of the 14th Amendment by taking as a basis of classification the ways by which a law may bedefeated. That case was applied in District of Columbia v. Brooke, \n214 U.S. 138\n, 53 L. ed. 941, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 560, to sustain a statute which provided a criminal proceeding against resident owners of property for neglecting to connect their property with sewers, and civil proceedings against nonresident owners for a like neglect.\n We do not understand the position of plaintiffs in error to be that a legislature may not prescribe a larger measure of damages than simple compensation, but that anything in excess of such compensation is punishment, and cannot be constitutionally prescribed where there is no 'conscious intent' to do wrong. And yet plaintiffs in error except from the principle 'certain instances within the police power,' overlooking that the principle, if it exist at all, must be universal. It is true that the police \n\n[218 U.S. 57, 70]\n\u00a0\n power of a state is the least limitable of its powers, but even it may not transcend the prohibition of the Constitution of the United States. If, as contended, intent is an essential element of crime, or, more restrictively, if intent is essential to the legality of penalties, it must be so, no matter under what power of the state they are prescribed. Plaintiffs in error, while considering there may be exceptions to the principle contended for in the exercise of the police power, urge that the legislation in controversy is not of that character. The supreme court of the state, however, expressed a different view. It decided that the legislation was in effect an exercise of the police power, and cited a number of cases to sustain the proposition that public policy may require that in the prohibition or punishment of particular acts it may be provided that he who shall do them shall do them at his peril, and will not be heard to plead in defense good faith or ignorance. Those cases are set forth in the opinion of the court, and some of them reviewed.\n We will not repeat them. It was recognized that such legislation may, in particular instances, be harsh, but we can only say again what we have so often said, that this court cannot set aside legislation because it is harsh. cause it is harsh.\n We have considered only the basic principle of the contention of plaintiffs in error, and have not attempted to follow the details of their argument by which they support it, or the cases which they cite to illustrate it. The cases are subject to the exceptions we have given.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Harlan concurs in the result. \n\n\n\n","147":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSHINE v.

Robert Goeller and Benjamin Slade for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William J.

The judgment, omitting title, is copied in the margin. \n This action having been begun by the service of the summons herein* on the defendant personally, . . . now on motion of . . . attorneys for the plaintiff, it is\n Ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the plaintiff be, and she hereby is, forever separated from the defendant, and from the bed and board of said defendant, on the ground of nonsupport and cruel and inhuman treatment by the defendant. And it is\n Further ordered, adjudged, and decreed that from and after the entry of this decree the defendant, Horace Randall Sistare, pay to the plaintiff, Matilda Von Ellert Sistare, for her maintenance and support and the maintenance and education of Horace Von Ellert Sistare, the minor child of the plaintiff and defendant, the sum of twenty-two and 50-100 dollars ($22. 50) per week, such sum to be paid into the hands of her attorneys of record in this action on each and every Monday. And it is further\n Ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the sole care, custody, control, and education of said minor child, Horace Von Ellert Sistare, is hereby awarded to the plaintiff, and the defendant, upon complying fully with each and all of the directions of the decree herein, and not otherwise, and during his good behavior, shall, until the further order of this court, be permitted to see said child for the space of two hours, between the hours of 10 and 12 o'clock in the forenoon on Wednesdays and Saturdays, excepting Wednesdays and Saturdays during the months of July, August, and September of each year. And it is further\n Ordered, adjudged, and decreed that costs are hereby awarded to the plaintiff against the defendant, taxed at the sum of one hundred and seventeen and 67-100 dollars ($117.67), and that the plaintiff do recover said costs from the defendant and have execution therefor. And it is further\n Ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the plaintiff have leave to apply from time to time for such orders at the foot of this judgment as may be necessary for its enforcement and for the protection and enforcement of her rights in the premises. \n\n[218 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n In July, 1904, at which time none of the instalments of alimony had been paid, the wife commenced this action in the superior court of New London county, Connecticut, to recover the amount then in arrears of the decreed alimony. The cause was put at issue and was heard by the court. As stated by the trial judge, in a 'finding' by him made: 'The defendant made the following claims of law as to the judgment to be rendered in this action: \n\n[218 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n '(a) That the judgment rendered by the supreme court of the state of New York, in requiring the future payment of $22.50 per week, did not constitute a final judgment for a fixed sum of money, which is enforceable and collectible in this action.\n'(b) That said judgment, being subject to modification by the court which granted it, is not a judgment which the courts of this state will enforce.\n\n'(c) That the requirement that said sums of money should be paid as aforesaid does not constitute a debt or obligation from the defendant to the plaintiff which can be enforced in this action.\n\n'(d) That said judgment requiring the said weekly payments cannot be enforced in any other way than according to the procedure prescribed in the statutes of the state of New York, and cannot be enforced in this action.\n\n'(e) That the judgment which is sought to be enforced in this action is not a final judgment, entitled to full faith and credit in this state by virtue of the provisions of the Constitution of the United States.\n\n'(f) That the judgment which is sought to be enforced in this action will not be enforced by the courts of this state through comity.\n\n'(g) That the facts will not support a judgment for the plaintiff.'\n\n The court, however, adjudged in favor of the plaintiff, and awarded her the sum of $5,805, the arrears of alimony at the commencement of the action.\n On appeal, the supreme court of errors (80 Conn. 1, -- L.R.A.(N.S .) --, 125 Am. St. Rep. 102, 66 Atl. 772) reversed the judgment and remanded the cause 'for the rendition of judgment in favor of the defendant;' and such a judgment, the record discloses, was subsequently entered by the trial court. This writ of error was prosecuted.\n The supreme court of errors of Connecticut reached the conclusion that the power conferred upon a New York \n\n[218 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n court to modify a decree for alimony by it rendered extended to overdue and unsatisfied instalments as well as those to accrue in the future; that hence decrees for future alimony, even as to instalments after they had become past due, did not constitute debts of record, and were not subject to be collected by execution, but could only be enforced by the special remedies provided in the law, and were not susceptible of being made the basis of judgments in the state of New York in another court than the one in which the decree for alimony had been made. Guided by the interpretation thus given to the New York law, and the character of the decree for future alimony which was based thereon, it was decided that the New York judgment for alimony which was sought to be enforced, even although the instalments sued for were all past due, was not a final judgment, which it was the duty of the courts of Connecticut to enforce in and by virtue of the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution of the United States. While the ruling of the court was, of course, primarily based upon the interpretation of the New York law, the ultimate ruling as to the inapplicability of the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution was expressly rested upon the decision of this court in Lynde v. Lynde, \n181 U.S. 187\n, 45 L. ed. 814, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 555.\n To sustain her contention that the action of the court below was in conflict with the duty imposed upon it by the full faith and credit clause, the plaintiff in error, by her assignments, in effect challenges the correctness of all the propositions upon which the court below rested its action, and virtually the defendant in error takes issue in argument as to these contentions. In disposing of the controversy, however, we shall not follow the sequence of the various assignments of error, or consider all the forms of statement in which the contentions of the parties are pressed in argument, but come at once to two fundamental questions which, being determined, will dispose of all the \n\n[218 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n issues in the case. Those inquiries are: 1st. Where a court of one state has decreed the future payment of alimony, and when an instalment or instalments of the alimony so decreed have become due and payable and are unpaid, is such a judgment as to accrued and past-due alimony ordinarily embraced within the scope of the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution of the United States so as to impose the constitutional duty upon the court of another state to give effect to such judgment? 2d. If, as a general rule, the full faith and credit clause does apply to such judgments, is the particular judgment under review exceptionally taken out of that rule by virtue of the nature and character of the judgment, as determined by the law of the state of New York, in and by virtue of which it was rendered? We shall separately consider the questions.\n First. The application, as a general rule, of the full faith and credit clause to judgments for alimony as to past-due installments.\n An extended analysis of the principles involved in the solution of this proposition is not called for, since substantially the contentions of the parties are based upon their divergent conceptions of two prior decisions of this court (Barber v. Barber, 21 How. 582, 16 L. ed. 226, and Lynde v. Lynde, supra), and an analysis of those cases will therefore suffice. For the plaintiff in error it is insisted that the case of Barber v. Barber conclusively determines that past-due instalments of a judgment for future alimony, rendered in one state, are within the protection of the full faith and credit clause, while the defendant in error urges that the contrary is established by the ruling in Lynde v. Lynde, and that if the Barber Case has the meaning attributed to it by the plaintiff in error, that case must be considered as having been overruled by Lynde v. Lynde.\n Substantially the controversy in Barber v. Barber was \n\n[218 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n this: In the year 1847, the court of chancery of New York granted Huldah B. Barber a separation from Hiram Barber, and directed the payment of alimony in quarterly instalments. Although the separation was decreed to be forever, the power to modify was reserved by a provision that the parties might at any time thereafter, by their joint petition, apply to the court to have the decree modified or discharged. It was provided that unpaid instalments of alimony should bear interest, 'and that execution might issue therefor toties quoties.' The husband failed to pay where he procured an absolute divorce. where be procured an absolute divorce. Subsequently an action was brought by Mrs. Barber upon the common-law side of the district court of the United States in the territory of Wisconsin, to recover the arrears of alimony, but relief was denied 'for the reason that the remedy for the recovery of alimony was in a court of chancery, and not at law.' A suit in equity to recover the overdue alimony was then commenced by Mrs. Barber, Wisconsin having been admitted into the Union, in the district court of the United States for the district of Wisconsin. Among other things, it was urged in a demurrer by the respondent, as a reason why the relief should be denied, 'that the relief sought could only be had in the court of chancery for the state of New York, and that it did not appear that the complainants had exhausted the remedy which they had in New York.' The proceedings culminated in a decree in favor of the complainant for the amount of alimony in arrears at the commencement of the suit, and the case was then brought to this court and the questions arising were disposed of in a careful and elaborate opinion. The decree was affirmed. In the course of the opinion it was declared, among other things, that courts of equity possessed jurisdiction to interfere to prevent the decree of the court of another state from being defeated by fraud, and reference was made to English decisions \n\n[218 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n asserting the power of chancery to compel the payment of overdue alimony. Considering the nature and character of a decree of separation and for alimony, and the operation and effect upon such a decree as to past-due instalments of the full faith and credit clause, it was said (p. 591):\n'The parties to a cause for a divorce and for alimony are as much bound by a decree for both, which has been given by one of our state courts having jurisdiction of the subject-matter and over the parties, as the same parties would be if the decree had been given in the ecclesiastical courts of England. The decree in both is a judgment of record, and will be received as such by other courts. And such a judgment or decree, rendered in any state of the United States, the court having jurisdiction, will be carried into judgment in any other state, to have there the same binding force that it has in the state in which it was originally given.'\n\n And, again, determining the effect of a decree for future alimony, the court expressly declared (p. 595): 'Alimony decreed to a wife in a divorce of separation from bed and board is as much a debt of record, until the decree has been recalled, as any other judgment for money is.' And it is, we think, clear from the context of the opinion, that the court held that the decree in favor of Mrs. Barber operated to cause an indebtedness to arise in her favor as each instalment of alimony fell due, and that a power to modify, if exerted, could only operate prospectively.\n The facts in Lynde v. Lynde which are pertinent to this controversy are these: A decree of the court of chancery of New Jersey in favor of Mrs. Lynde was rendered in 1897 for the sum of $7,840, as alimony due at the date of the decree, with $1,000 for counsel fees, and payment was directed to be made of $80 weekly from the date of the decree. An action on this New Jersey decree was brought in May, 1898, in the supreme court of New York, and \n\n[218 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n recovery was allowed by the trial court for the alimony due at the date of the New Jersey decree, with interest, counsel fee, and costs, and for an additional amount representing future alimony, which had accrued from the date of the decree to the commencement of the action in New York. The judgment also directed the payment of future alimony as fixed by the New Jersey decree, and awarded certain remedies for the enforcement of the decree in accordance with the relief which had been awarded in the New Jersey decree, in conformity to the law of that state. The judgment thus rendered by the trial court in New York was ultimately modified by the court of appeals of New York by allowing the recovery only of the alimony which had been fixed in the New Jersey decree as due at its date, with interest and the counsel fee, and disallowing recovery of the instalments of future alimony which had accrued when the action was commenced in New York, as well as the allowance in respect to alimony thereafter to accrue. In this court three questions were presented: 1. Whether the decree of the New Jersey court was wanting in due process because of the absence of notice to the defendant; 2, whether the duty to enforce the decree for alimony was imposed upon the courts of New York by the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution; and, 3, upon the hypothesis that the full faith and credit clause was applicable, whether that clause required that the remedies afforded by the laws of New Jersey should be made available in the state of New York. Deciding that the New Jersey decree was not wanting in due process, the court came to consider the second and third questions, and held that in so far as the New Jersey decree related to alimony accrued at the time it was rendered and fixed by the decree and the counsel fee, it was entitled to be enforced in the courts on New York; but that, in so far as it related to future alimony, its enforcement was not commanded by the full faith and credit clause. No reference \n\n[218 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n was made to the case of Barber v. Barber, the opinion briefly disposing of the issue as follows (p. 187): 'The decree for the payment of $8,840 was for a fixed sum already due, and the judgment of the court below was properly restricted to that. The provision of the payment for alimony in the future was subject to the discretion of the court of chancery of New Jersey, which might at any time alter it, and was not a final judgment for a fixed sum.' These sentences were followed by a brief adverse disposition of the claim that there was a right to avail, for the enforcement of the New Jersey decree in the courts of New York, of the remedies peculiar to the New Jersey law.\n When these two cases are considered together we think there is no inevitable and necessary conflict between them, and, in any event, if there be, that Lynde v. Lynde must be restricted or qualified so as to cause it not to overrule the decision in the Barber Case. In the first place, in the Lynde Case no reference whatever was made to the prior decision, and it cannot be said that such decision was overlooked, because it was referred to in the opinion of the court below and was expressly cited and commented upon in the briefs of counsel submitted in the Lynde Case. In the second place, in view of the elaborate and careful nature of the opinion in Barber v. Barber, of the long period of time which had intervened between that decision and the decision in Lynde v. Lynde, and the fact which is made manifest by decisions of the courts of last resort of the several states that the rule laid down in the Barber Case had been accepted and acted upon by the courts of the states generally as a final and decisive exposition of the operation and scope of the full faith and credit clause, as applied to the subject with which the case dealt, it is not to be conceived that it was intended by the brief statement in the opinion in Lynde v. Lynde to announce a new and radical departure from the settled rule ofconstitutional \n\n[218 U.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n construction which had prevailed for so long a time. And nothing in the mere language used in the Lynde Case would justify such a conclusion, because the reasoning expressed in that case was based solely and exclusively on the ground that the portions of the decree for alimony which were held to be not within the purview of the full faith and credit clause were not so embraced, because their enforcement 'was subject to the discretion of the court of chancery of New Jersey, which might at nay time alter it, . . .' In other words, the ruling was expressly based upon the latitude of discretion which the courts of New Jersey were assumed to possess over a decree for the payment of future alimony. But it is said although this be true, the decision in the Lynde Case must be here controlling and treated as overruling the Barber Case, since it will be found, upon examination of the New Jersey law which governed the New Jersey decree considered in the Lynde Case, that such law conferred no greater discretion upon the New Jersey court of chancery as to the enforcement of past-due instalments of future alimony than will be found to be possessed by the New York courts as to the decree here in question. But this is aside from the issue for decision, since the question here is not whether the doctrine expounded in the Lynde Case was there misapplied as a result of a misconception of the New Jersey law, but what was the doctrine which the case announced. And, answering that question, not only by the light of reason, but by the authoritative force of the ruling in the Barber Case, which had prevailed for so many years, and by the reasoning expressed in the Lynde Case, we think the conclusion is inevitable that the Lynde Case cannot be held to have overruled the Barber Case, and therefore that the two cases must be interpreted in harmony, one with the other, and that on so doing it results: First, that, generally speaking, where a decree is rendered for alimony and is made payable in future instalments, \n\n[218 U.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n the right to such instalments becomes absolute and vested upon becoming due, and is therefore protected by the full faith and credit clause, provided no modification of the decree has been made prior to the maturity of the instalments, since, as in the Barber Case, 'alimony decreed to a wife in a divorce of separation from bed and board is as much a debt of record, until the decree has been recalled, any other judgment for money is.' Second, that this general rule, however, does not obtain where, by the law of the state in which a judgment for future alimony is rendered, the right to demand and receive such future alimony is discretionary with the court which rendered the decree, to such an extent that no absolute or vested right attaches to receive the instalments ordered by the decree to be paid, even although no application to annul or modify the decree in respect to alimony had been made prior to the instalments becoming due.\n It follows, therefore, from the statement which we have made of the case, that the New York judgment which was relied upon came within the general rule, and, therefore, that the action of the supreme court of errors of Connecticut in refusing to enforce it was in conflict with the full faith and credit clause, unless it be, as a result of the law of the state of New York, the judgment for future alimony in that state, even as to past-due instalments, was so completely within the discretion of the courts of that state as to bring it within the exceptional rule embodied in the second proposition. A consideration of this subject brings us to an investigation of the second question, which we have previously stated.\n Second. The finality of the New York judgment as to past-due instalments for future alimony under the law of the state of New York.\n The conception of the statute law of the state of New York and of the decisions of the courts of that state, inter- \n\n[218 U.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n preting that law, which led the supreme court of errors of Connecticut to conclude that the enforcement of the judgment before it was so completely subject to the discretion of the court which had rendered it as not to entitle it to enforcement in virtue of the full faith and credit clause, was thus stated in its opinion:\n'The nature, operation, and effect, within the state of New York, of orders like that in question, directing payments in futuro to a wife by a husband living in judicial separation, and passed in 1899, pursuant to the then provisions of statute, have been well settled by the repeated decisions of the courts of that jurisdiction. They have been declared to be tentative provisions, which remain at all times within the control of the court issuing them, and subject at any time to modification or annulment. Tonjes v. Tonjes, 14 App. Div. 542, 43 N. Y. Supp. 941. The right of modification or annulment which is thus reserved to the court is one which extends to overdue and unsatisfied payments as well as to those which may accrue in the future. Sibley v. Sibley, 68 App. Div. 552, 73 N. Y. Supp. 244; Goodsell v. Goodsell, 94 App. Div. 443, 88 N. Y. Supp. 161; Kiralfy v. Kiralfy, 36 Misc. 407, 73 N. Y. Supp. 708; Wetmore v. Wetmore, 34 Misc. 640, 70 N. Y. Supp. 604. The amount awarded 'does not exist as a debt in favor of the wife against the husband, in the sense of indebtedness as generally understood.' Tonjes v. Tonjes, supra. The order is not one 'which simply directs the payment of a sum of money,' and not such an one as can have enforcement by execution. Weber v. Weber, 93 App. Div. 149, 152, 87 N. Y. Supp. 519. The special remedies provided in  1772 and 1773 for the enforcement of the orders are exclusive. Weber v. Weber, supra; Branth v. Branth, 20 N. Y. Civ. Proc. Rep. 33, 13 N. Y. Supp. 360. No judgment in another court can be entered upon them. Branth v. Branth, supra.'\n\n But we are unable to assent to the view thus taken of the statute law of New York, or to concede the correctness of the effect attributed by the court to the New York decisions which were referred to. \n\n[218 U.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure of New York, pertinent to be considered in determining the scope and effect of judgments for separation and alimony rendered by the courts of New York, are copied in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n 1 Sec. 1762. For what causes action may be maintained.-In either of the cases specified in the next section, an action may be maintained by a husband or wife against the other party to the marriage, to procure a judgment separating the parties from bed and board forever, or for a limited time, for either of the following causes:\n\n 1. \nThe cruel and inhuman treatment of the plaintiff by the defendant. 2. Such conduct on the part of the defendant towards the plaintiff as may render it unsafe and improper for the former to cohabit with the latter. 3. The abandonment of the plaintiff by the defendant. 4. Where the wife is plaintiff, the neglect or refusal of the defendant to provide for her.\n Sec. 1763. Id.; in what cases.-Such an action may be maintained in either of the following cases: 1. Where both parties are residents of the state when the action is commenced. 2. Where the parties were married within the state and the plaintiff is a resident thereof when the action is commenced. 3. Where the parties, having been married without the state, have become residents of the state, and have continued to be residents thereof at least one year, and the plaintiff is such a resident when the action is commenced.\n Sec. 1766. Support, maintenance, etc., of wife and children.-Where the action is brought by the wife, the court may, in the final judgment of separation, give such directions as the nature and circumstances of the case require. In particular, it may compel the defendant to provide suitably for the education and maintenance of the children of the marriage, and for the support of the plaintiff, as justice requires, having regard to the circumstances of the respective parties, and the court may, in such an action, render a judgment compelling the defendant to make the provision specified in this section, where, under the circumstances of the case, such a judgment is proper, without rendering a judgment of separation.\n Sec. 1767. Judgment for separation may be revoked.-Upon the \n\n[218 U.S. 1, 20]\n\u00a0\n In considering the meaning of these provisions, it must be borne in mind that the settled rule in New York is that the courts of that state have only the jurisdiction over the subject of divorce, separation, and alimony conferred by statute, and that the authority to modify or amend a judgment awarding divorce and alimony must be found in the statute or it does not exist. Erkenbrach v. Erkenbrach, 96 N. Y. 456, 463; Livingston v. Livingston, 173 N. Y. 377, 61 L.R.A. 800, 93 Am. St. Rep. 600, 66 N.E. 123.\n___ joint application of the parties, accompanied with satisfactory evidence of their reconcilation a judgment for a separation forever, or for a limited period, rendered as prescribed in this article, may be revoked at any time by the court which rendered it, subject to such regulations and restrictions as the court thinks fit to impose.\n Sec. 1769. Alimony, expenses of action, and costs; how awarded.-Where an action is brought, as prescribed in either of the last two articles, the court may, in its discretion, during the pendency thereof, from time to time, make and modify an order or orders requiring the husband to pay any sum or sums of money necessary to enable the wife to carry on or defend the action, or to provide suitably for the education and maintenance of the children of the marriage, or for the support of the wife, having regard to the circumstances of the respective parties. The final judgment in such an action may award costs in favor of or against either party, and an execution may be issued for the collection thereof, as in an ordinary case; or the court may, in the judgment or by an order made at any time, direct the costs to be paid out of any property sequestered or otherwise in the power of the court.\n Sec. 1771. Custody and maintenance of children and support of plaintiff.-Where an action is brought by either husband or wife, as prescribed in either of the last two articles, the court must, except as otherwise expressly prescribed in those articles, give, either in the final judgment or by one or more orders made from time to time before final judgment, such directions as justice requires between the parties for the custody, care, education, and maintenance of any of the children of the marriage; and where the action is brought by the wife, for the support of the plaintiff. The court may, by order, upon the application of either party to the action, after due notice to the other, to be given in such manner as the court shall prescribe, at any time after final judgment, annul, vary, or modify such directions. But no such appli- \n\n[218 U.S. 1, 21]\n\u00a0\n Other than the provision in  1767, authorizing the revocation of a judgment for separation upon the joint application of the parties, the power of the court to vary or modify a judgment for alimony, if it existed in 1899, was to be found in  1771. It is certain that authority is \n\n[218 U.S. 1, 22]\n\u00a0\n there given to the courts of New York to modify or vary a decree for alimony by the following:\n'The court may, by order, upon the application of either party to the action, after due notice to the other, to be given in such manner as the court shall prescribe, at any time after final judgment, vary or modify such directions. But no such application shall be made by a defendant unless leave to make the same shall have been previously granted by the court by order made upon or without notice, as the court, in its discretion, may deem proper, after presentation to the court of satisfactory proof that justice requires such an application should be entertained.'\n\n But it is equally certain that nothing in this language expressly gives power to revoke or modify an instalment of alimony which had accrued prior to the making of an application to vary or modify, and every reasonable implication must be resorted to against the existence of such power, in the absence of clear language manifesting an intention to confer it. The implication, however, which arises from the failure to expressly confer authority to retroactively modify an allowance of alimony is fortified by the provisions which are expressed. Thus, the methods of enforcing payment of the future alimony awarded, provided by the statute, all contemplate the collection and paying over as a matter of right of the instalments as they accrue, as long as the judgments remains unmodified, or, at least, until application has been made or permission to make one in pursuance to the statute has been accorded. And the force of this suggestion is accentuated when it is considered that it was not unusual in New York to resort to executions as upon a judgment at law to enforce the collection of unpaid instalments of alimony. Wetmore v. Wetmore, 149 N. Y. 520, 527, 33 L.R.A. 708, 52 Am. St. Rep. 752, 44 N. E. 169. Indeed, as in principle, if it be that the power to vary or modify operates retroactively and may affect past-due instalments so as to relieve of the obligation to pay such instalments, \n\n[218 U.S. 1, 23]\n\u00a0\n it would follow, in the nature of things, that the power would exist to increase the amount allowed, it is additionally impossible to imply such authority in the absence of provisions plainly compelling to such conclusion. Beyond all this, when it is considered that no provision is found looking to the repayment by the wife of any instalments which had been collected from the husband, in the event of a retroactive reduction of the allowance, it would seem that no power to retroactively modify was intended.\n A brief consideration of the state of the law of New York concerning the power to modify allowances for alimony prior to the enactment of the provisions as to modification in question, and the rulings of the court of last resort of New York on the subject of such power, we think will serve to further establish the impossibility, in reason, of supposing that the statutory provisions in question conferred the broad and absolute power of retroaction as to past-due instalments of alimony which the court below assumed to exist. Prior to 1894, the courts of New York did not possess the power to modify a judgment in the case either of an absolute divorce or of a judicial separation, except in respect to the custody, etc., of the children of the marriage. Erkenbrach v. Erkenbrach, 96 N. Y. 456. In the year 1894, the statute was amended to permit the court to vary or modify the provision for the support of the wife upon her application alone, on notice to the husband. Laws of 1894, chap. 728. Subsequently,  1771, which, by the amendment of 1894, conferred power upon the application of the wife to vary or modify the allowance, was enlarged to read as it stood in 1899, when the action was brought in which the judgment in question was rendered; that is, so as to confer authority upon the court to vary or modify an allowance of alimony on the application of either party. Laws of 1895, chap. 891.\n But in view of the well-settled doctrine prevailing in \n\n[218 U.S. 1, 24]\n\u00a0\n New York, that no power exists to modify a judgment for alimony, absolute in terms, unless conferred by statute, and the practice of treating the right to collect accrued instalments of alimony as vested and subject to be enforced by execution, and in view of the further fact that decrees for alimony in New York, where authority to modify was not expressly conferred by statute, or was not reserved in the decree at the time of rendition, created vested rights not subject to either judicial or legislative control (Livingston v. Livingston, supra), we think it becomes quite clear that the mere enlargement of the power of the court so as to permit modification of the allowance for alimony upon the application of the husband did not confer the authority to change or set aside the rights of the wife in respect to instalments which were overdue at the time application was made by the husband to modify the decree. And although we have been referred to and can find no decision of the court of last resort of New York dealing with the subject, the view we have taken, as an original question, of the Code provision in question, accords with that of the first department of the appellate division of the supreme court of the state of New York, announced in a decision rendered in 1903. Goodsell v. Goodsell, 82 App. Div. 65, 81 N. Y. Supp. 806. Nor do we find that the New York decisions relied upon by the lower court, and cited by it to sustain its conclusion that 'the right of modification or annulment which is thus reserved to the court is one which extends to overdue and unsatisfied payments as well as to those which may accrue in the future,' have even a tendency to that effect. The cases cited and relied on are Sibley v. Sibley, 66 App. Div. 552, 73 N. Y. Supp. 244; Goodsell v. Goodsell, 94 App. Div. 443, 88 N. Y. Supp. 161; Kiralfy v. Kiralfy, 36 Misc. 407, 73 N. Y. Supp. 708; and Wetmore v. Wetmore, 34 Misc. 640, 70 N. Y. Supp. 604.\n The Sibley Case was decided in 1901 by the appellate division of the supreme court of New York, first department. The case was not concerned with a decree \n\n[218 U.S. 1, 25]\n\u00a0\n for the payment of permanent alimony. It related to the failure, during the pendency of an action for separation, to comply with an order for the payment of temporary alimony and counsel fees. Whether such order was made ex parte or upon notice does not appear. Among other things, the appeal presented the question of the propriety of the denial of a motion to modify the order directing the payment of alimony and counsel fees by reducing the amount directed to be paid. The order appealed from was affirmed, without prejudice, however, to the right of the appellant 'to renew his application when he returns to this state and subjects himself to the jurisdiction of the court.' No intimation is given in the opinion as to whether the power to reduce the amount of alimony and counsel fees could be exerted so as to have a retroactive effect. The decision in the Goodsell Case was made in 1904 by the appellate division, first department, and concerned a denial at special term of a motion to punish the defendant for contempt in not paying the difference between certain payments made as alimony by agreement between the parties, and the amount ordered to be paid in the final judgment awarding an absolute divorce. The appellate court declined to consider the question of whether the defendant was in contempt until a report had been made by the referee who had been appointed to determine the financial ability of the defendant to pay. There was no intimation as to the extent of the power to modify an allowance of alimony. A year prior, however, in the same litigation (82 App. Div. 65), the same court, as we have already stated, decided that the provisions of the New York Code giving power to modify an allowance of alimony could only have a prospective operation. It was said (p. 70):\n'It may, we think, be given full force and effect by ascribing to the legislature the intention of authorizing the courts to vary or modify the allowance of alimony from \n\n[218 U.S. 1, 26]\n\u00a0\n the time of the adjudication that such variation or modification is proper, without making the same retroactive.'\n\n The Kiralfy Case was a decision of the New York special term, rendered in December, 1901. The matter acted upon was a motion to amend a final decree of divorce by reducing the amount of alimony to a sum not merely less than that awarded by the decree, but less than the sum which the defendant had been paying under agreement with his wife. The motion was granted, but it was clearly given a prospective operation only. Wetmore v. Wetmore was also decided in 1901 by the New York special term. What was held was merely that the court would not relieve the defendant, who had persistently evaded a decree of absolute divorce, in which there had been awarded future alimony for the support of the wife and children. There is no discussion as to the extent of the power to modify decrees of divorce in respect to alimony, and a modification of a decree as to the amount of alimony to be paid, which is referred to in the course of the proceedings, plainly had only a prospective operation.\n Contenting ourselves in conclusion with saying that, as pointed out in Lynde v. Lynde, although mere modes of execution provided by the laws of a state in which a judgment is rendered are not, by operation of the full faith and credit clause, obligatory upon the courts of another state in which the judgment is sought to be enforced, nevertheless, if the judgment be an enforceable judgment in the state where rendered, the duty to give effect to it in another state clearly results from the full faith and credit clause, although the modes of procedure to enforce the collection may not be the same in both states.\n It follows that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut must be reversed, and the case remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n And it is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n cation shall be made by a defendant unless leave to make the same shall have been previously granted by the court by order made upon or without notice, as the court, in its discretion, may deem proper after presentation to the court of satisfactory proof that justice requires that such an application should be entertained.\n Sec. 1772. Support, maintenance, etc., of wife and children. Sequestration.-Where a judgment rendered, or an order made, as prescribed in this article, or in either of the last two articles, requires a husband to provide for the education or maintenance of any of the children of a marriage, or for the support of his wife, the court may, in its discretion, also direct him to give reasonable security, in such a manner and within such a time as it thinks proper, for the payment from time to time of the sums of money required for that purpose. If he fails to give the security, or to make any payment required by the terms of such a judgment or order, whether he has or has not given security therefor, or to pay any sum of money which he is required to pay by an order, made as prescribed in  1769 of this act, the court may cause his personal property, and the rents and profits of his real property, to be sequestered, and may appoint a receiver thereof. The rents and profits, and other property, so sequestered, may be, from time to time, applied, under the direction of the court, to the payment of any of the sums of money specified in this section, as justice requires.\n Sec. 1773. Id.; when enforced by punishment for contempt.-Where the husband makes default in paying any sum of money specified in the last section, as required by the judgment or order directing the payment thereof, and it appears presumptively, to the satisfaction of the court, that payment cannot be enforced by means of the proceedings prescribed in the last section, or by resorting to the security, if any, given as therein prescribed, the court may, in its discretion, make an order requiring the husband to show cause before it, at a time and place therein specified, why he should not be punished for his failure to make the payment; and thereupon proceedings must be taken to punish him, as prescribed in title third of chapter seventeenth of this act. Such an order to show cause may also be made, without any previous sequestration, or direction to give security, where the court is satisfied that they would be ineffectual. \n\n\n\n\n","149":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUFFRONT v. LA COMPAGNIE DES SUCRERIES DE PORTO RICO(1910)\nNo. 155\nArgued: April 15, 1910Decided: May 16, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. Hannis Taylor and Charles M. Boerman for plaintiffs in error.[ Souffront v. La Compagnie Des Sucreries De Porto Rico \n217 U.S. 475\n (1910) ]\n\n\n[217 U.S. 475, 477]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles Hartzell and Manuel Rodriguez-Serra for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n In July, 1906, plaintiffs in error commenced this action in the district court of the United States for the district of Porto Rico, to recover, from the defendants in error, the possession of certain described real estate, and damages from April 12, 1904, for unlawfully withholding possession thereof. \n\n[217 U.S. 475, 478]\n\u00a0\n The right to the relief sought was based upon the averment that one Clemente De Fleurian, at his death, on February 24, 1892, was seised in fee and entitled to the possession of the premises, and that he died intestate, leaving the plaintiffs-his widow and two children-'as his legal succession.' A demurrer to the complaint was overruled, except as to the necessity of furnishing certain information in regard to rents and profits, which was afterwards done through the medium of a bill of particulars. The defendants filed a joint answer. In addition to a general denial, they pleaded title by adverse possession of twenty years, and that plainiffs' right to recover was barred by reason of certain judgments obtained by the predecessors in title of defendants, in actions prosecuted by them in the courts of France and in the courts of Porto Rico during the Spanish regime, and by reason of a judgment of dismissal entered in favor of predecessors in title of defendants, and against the plaintiffs, in a suit in equity, brought by the latter in the trial court below, in the year 1904, to quiet the title to the premises in controversy. A motion was filed to strike out portions of the answer as alleging mere evidentiary matter, and a demurrer was also filed to the special defenses of res judicata. The motion and demurrer were overruled, the court filing an opinion, in which it detailed the substance of the matters set up in the answer, and, in effect, held that the decrees or judgments of the French and Porto Rican courts prior to the cession from Spain were res judicata as to the claims of the plaintiffs, unless their rights had subsequently arisen. After setting forth its reasons for such conclusion, the court called upon the plaintiffs 'to file a replication within ten days or such longer period as they may, if at all, be entitled to, setting up the fact whether or not the answer is true in so far as it sets out the source of plaintiffs' title, and describes or recites these proceedings in other courts regarding this property.' This requirement was followed by the statement that 'if it shall transpire that the answer has set up the real facts in the case, then, on the application of \n\n[217 U.S. 475, 479]\n\u00a0\n defendants, the action will be immediately dismissed at the cost of the plaintiffs.' Thereafter a replication was filed on the part of the plaintiffs, which, omitting the title and the signatures of the attorneys, is as follows:\n'Replication.\n\n'Now come the plaintiffs herein, in conformity with the order of the court, entered herein, and make reply to the answer of the defendants, as follows:\n\n'First. They deny that the defendants have ever had any just title to the premises, or that those from whom they derived title have possessed the premises in good faith or with just title.\n\n'Second. The plaintiffs impugn the alleged prescription either of ten years or of twenty years.\n\n'Third. The plaintiffs deny the allegations in the answer that the ancestor, Clemente De Fleurian, has obtained the deed to the properties described in the complaint through fraud, and they allege that he purchased the said properties in good faith and for valuable consideration, and always was ready, and the plaintiffs are ready, to comply with all the conditions of the said deed of sale, and that said deed was delivered to him by the vendors and their agents.\n\n'Fourth. The plaintiffs admit that the judgments mentioned in the answer as a third defense to the complaint have been rendered, but the suits in which said judgments were rendered have been instituted against Clemente De Fleurian while he was insane and out of his mind, and without any curator or guardian or committee of his person being named by the court; and that the defendants herein were neither parties nor privies to the said judgments and suits and appeals, and therefore said judgments cannot bar this action.\n\n'Fifth. The plaintiffs admit that the judgment mentioned in the answer as a fourth defense to the complaint has been rendered, but the plaintiffs state that the court which rendered said judgment had no jurisdiction in the subject-matter, \n\n[217 U.S. 475, 480]\n\u00a0\n and said judgment, being of a foreign court without jurisdiction, is not binding; and the plaintiffs further allege that the defendants herein were neither parties nor privies to the said judgment and suit, and therefore said judgment is not a bar to this action.\n\n'Sixth. The plaintiffs, further replying, say that the judgment or decree mentioned in the answer as a fifth defense to the complaint was rendered not upon the merits of the case, and without any proof being taken, but only upon a demurrer to the complaint for want of equity and for laches,-both purely equitable defenses, available only in suits in equity, and the plaintiffs state that this decree is not a bar to this action.\n\n'Wherefore the plaintiffs pray judgment thereon.'\n\n Thereupon the following entry of dismissal was made:\n'Now come the plaintiffs, by their attorneys, Boerman & Llorens, and file a replication to the answer in this cause, and upon consideration thereof it appears to come within the rule laid down in the court's opinion on the demurrer to the answer of the defendants, filed June 1st. Now, upon application by Hartzell & Rodriguez, the attorneys of said defendants, the cause is dismissed at the cost of the plaintiffs, to be taxed by the clerk, for which execution may issue.\n\n'Plaintiffs except to the dismissal hereof.'\n\n From this judgment of dismissal the appeal now before us was taken. In addition to assigning as error the overruling of the demurrers to the respective defenses of res judicata, it is set up that 'the court erred in rendering judgment against the plaintiffs in said cause, upon the pleadings in said cause, and that said judgment is contrary to the law and facts as stated in the pleadings in said court.'\n As upon the overruling of the demurrer, the court in substance made it a condition for granting leave to reply to the answer, that such reply should disclose that the answer had not set up the real facts in the case, which condition was manifestly not complied with in the replication, we shall review the \n\n[217 U.S. 475, 481]\n\u00a0\n action of the court upon the hypothesis that the order overruling the demurrer had also absolutely decreed a dismissal of the complaint. On this assumption we proceed to examine the defense setting up as res judicata the judgments of the Porto Rican courts, rendered during the spanish regime, to determine whether the court properly held that they barred recovery.\n The defense in question covers twenty-six pages of the printed record, the judgment of the court of first instance embracing seventeen, and that of the supreme court of Porto Rico seven pages. The judgments establish the following, among other, facts: The real estate, the subject of controversy, was a sugar plantation known by the name of Serrano. The plantation was owned in 1879 and prior thereto by David Laporte and others, and Clemente De Fleurian, through whom plaintiffs claim title, was the manager of the plantation. On October 9, 1879, what is termed a 'private contract of sale' of the plantation to De Fleurian was executed in France. In November following, the owners of the property brought suit in the civil court of Nimes, France, to annul the contract. On February 18, 1880,- the day after the return of De Fleurian to Porto Rico,-although the contract of sale was not of record in Porto Rico, De Fleurian mortgaged the plantation to one Labastide, to secure the payment of 36,811 pesos. The civil court of Nimes, on May 10, 1880, entered a decree of nullity in the suit brought by the Laportes, and this decree, upon the appeal of De Fleurian, was affirmed by the court of appeals of Nimes on March 24, 1885, and by the court of cassation on May 17, 1886\n\n\n Pending the litigation just referred to, the Laportes, in the proper district in Porto Rico, 'instituted possessory proceedings for the said property,' in which Labastide and his wife were summoned 'as abutting owners,' and, they not making opposition, the title of the Laportes was duly registered. Thereafter, the Laportes, by public instrument of October 16, 1883, 'sold the property to Don Juan Forgas and \n\n[217 U.S. 475, 482]\n\u00a0\n to Don Jose Gallart, free of all encumbrances, the vendors binding themselves to guarantee the title to the same, as well as to answer for all obligations for which the said property might be liable.'\n In the defense we are considering, it was averred that title to the premises came to the defendants through Forgas and Gallart. It is also averred as follows:\n'That these defendants are the successors and privies in the ownership of said property to said original owners and to the said Gallart and Forgas, and the succession of Gallart, by virtue of the said sale to the said Forgas and Gallart. That in the deed selling and conveying said premises by the said owner to the said Forgas and Gallart, it was expressly contracted and agreed that the said owners should conduct the litigation necessary to free the title of said premises from any lien, cloud, or encumbrance whatsoever, and the same was made the express condition of the payment of a large portion of the purchase price of said premises. And that, in pursuance of said obligation resting upon the said owners of said property, in addition to the proceedings in the courts of France, hereinbefore referred to, the said owners of the said property commenced their action in the court of first instance in the judicial district of Ponce, Porto Rico, the district where the said lands were located, the said court having full jurisdiction over the said property and over the said defendants. The object of said suit being to cancel and have declared null and void, or for the rescission, as the case might be, of the private contract of sale of the said plantation described in plaintiffs' complaint and known as 'Serrano,' and also to have declared null and void, and for the rescission and cancelation of, the said mortgage executed by the said Fleurian in favor of the said Labastide.'\n\n As above mentioned, the litigation in France was commenced by the Laportes before the sale to Forgas and Gallart, and continued after such sale, terminating in May, 1886. The action against De Fleurian and Labastide in the Porto \n\n[217 U.S. 475, 483]\n\u00a0\n Rican courts, referred to in the excerpt just made, was commenced on May 9, 1887, and the final judgment of the trial court, relied upon as res judicata, was entered therein on October 26, 1889. In that judgment, after referring to the proceedings had in the litigation in France, as shown by the records of the judgments of the French courts which were in evidence, the court of first instance, after making certain statements as to the effect, as res judicata, of the French judgments, which statements are copied in the margin, pro-\n 9. Whereas there is not any treaty between France and Spain providing special rules as to the force and efficacy of the contracts executed, and of judgments rendered in civil matters, in any one of said nations as regards the other, and therefore the general principles of international law are applicable to the case, among which of said principles there is the principle of reciprocity, specially expressed as to the execution of judgments rendered by foreign courts, in articles 951 and 952 of the law of Civil Procedure.\n 10. Whereas, according to the French legislation, real property, even if possessed by foreigners, is governed by the French law (article 3d of the Civil Code); 'a judicial mortgage does not ensue from a judgment rendered in a foreign country except when such judgment has been declared executory by a French court' (paragraph 4 of article 2123); 'contracts entered into a foreign country, and acts executed before foreign officers, cannot produce mortgage on property in France' (article 2128); 'the said acts and judgments are not subject to execution in France except in the manner and in the cases provided by articles 2123 and 2128 of the Civil Code' (article 546 of the Code of Procedure).\n 11. Whereas, according to the general interpretation in France as to the aforesaid provisions of its legislation, as well as to article 14 of the Civil Code, the acts and judgments rendered by foreign courts are subject to revision and new discussion before the French courts, and that in that respect, and on the principle of reciprocity, the final judgment rendered by the French courts, to which reference has been made in this action by the plaintiff, cannot produce the force and effect of res judicata as to a decision of the questions which are being ventilated in the same, especially when the same have not had the exequatur of the supreme court of justice in the form provided by article 954 and subsequent articles of the said law of Civil Procedure.\n 12. Whereas, according to the principle of private international law, sanctioned by the supreme court of justice in several opinions, the efficacy of the acts or contracts affecting directly real property are governed by the royal statute, or namely, by the laws of the country where the real property is situated, and therefore, as the question in this suit is in regard to a property situated in a Spanish territory, the questions relating to the nullity or validity of the title to the said property, and of the mortgage put on the same, should be ventilated or decided in accordance with the Spanish laws. Locus regit actum. \n\n[217 U.S. 475, 484]\n\u00a0\n ceeded to reinvestigate the merits of the controversy, and determine the questions arising as matters of first impression, concluding by giving to the plaintiffs the full relief demanded, the judgment reading as follows:\n'I adjudge that Don Clemente De Fleurian is held to have confessed to the questions propounded at folios 340 and 341 of the second record of the roll of evidence of the plaintiffs. I should declare and do declare also the nullity of the instrument of sale and of the instrument of mortgage of the sugar cane plantation called 'El Serrano,' the first of which was executed in the private contract in Anduze, France, dated October 9th, 1879, between the plaintiffs and Don Clemente De Fleurian, and the second named at Juana Diaz, before the notary Don Ramon Rodriguez, on the 18th day of February, 1880, by Don Clemente De Fleurian and Don Fernando Labastide, in consequence of which it is ordered that after this decision shall have been final, the annotation of the said instrument of mortgage in the registry of property be canceled, for which purpose the proper orders shall issue, with the necessary excerpts, addressed to the registrar of property for the district, taxing all costs against the defendants, Don Clemente Fleurian and Don Fernando Labastide. Thus, finally adjudging, was pronounced, ordered, and signed by the judge.'\n\n On an appeal, taken by Labastide, the supreme court of Porto Rico, on January 28, 1891, affirmed the judgment of the court of first instance. Thereafter an appeal, also taken by \n\n[217 U.S. 475, 485]\n\u00a0\n Labastide, to the Supreme Court of Spain, was dismissed, and it is averred in the answer that 'the said decision of the supreme court of Porto Rico became firm and fixed, and is still in full force and effect;' and that, pursuant to the decisions of the Porto Rican courts above referred to, 'the proper orders were issued and the registration of the said mortgage from the said Clemente De Fleurian to the said Labastide was duly canceled and annulled in the registry of property of Ponce, and the said decision of the court of first instance of Ponce, and the said decision of the supreme court of Porto Rico, confirming the same, have been carried out as to all matters and things which were ordered and directed therein and thereby.'\n The question, then, is whether these judgments of the courts of Porto Rico, entered in litigation prosecuted in the names of the former owners, for the benefit of their vendees, through whom the defendants in this action deraign title, are, as contended by the defendants in error, 'a full, complete, and final determination of all the matters and things relating to the alleged title of the said Clemente De Fleurian in or to the said premises described in the plaintiff's complaint herein,' operative as res judicata in favor of the defendants, and constituting a bar to the further prosecution of the proceedings under the complaint herein. We proceed to consider this question.\n It is recited in the judgment entered on October 26, 1889, by the court of first instance of Porto Rico, that the then pending action was commenced on May 9, 1887, by the Laporte heirs, and it also expressly found that the property had been sold prior to the institution of the action, viz., on October 16, 1883, by the Laportes, to Forgas and Gallart, from whom mediately or immediately the present defendants acquired title, 'the vendors binding themselves to guarantee the title to the same, as well as to answer for all obligations for which the said property might be liable.' It is also apparent from the findings of the court that the action referred \n\n[217 U.S. 475, 486]\n\u00a0\n to was intended to make effective the result of the proceedings instituted in France, which had been commenced in order to remove the cloud upon the title of the Laportes, resulting from the contract of sale made to De Fleurian and the mortgage made by him to Labastide. As the judgment of the court of first instance, reciting the facts referred to, was affirmed by the supreme court of Porto Rico, we may properly assume that the Porto Rican courts did not consider that they were passing upon a merely moot question, but were of opinion that the adjudication made inured to the benefit of the vendees of the nominal complainants, such vendees being the real owners. It being, then, competent, under the Spanish law, for the vendors of property, after parting with title, to conduct in their own names, for the benefit of their vendees, a litigation having for its object ultimate relief such as was sought in the action so instituted by the Laporte heirs in 1887, we are of opinion that there is no merit in the contention upon which plaintiffs in error rely in assailing the sufficiency of the defense set up in the third paragraph of the answer. In effect, that contention simply was that, as the original owners had sold the property before the institution of the action commenced in 1887, the defendants herein, as claimants under purchasers who had bought from the Laportes before the commencement of that action, are not in privity with the complainants in that suit, as they were mere strangers to the litigation, and not entitled to enjoy the benefit of the adjudication. Let it be conceded, for the sake of argument, that ordinarily no one is privy to a judgment whose succession to the rights of property thereby affected occurred previously to the institution of the suit (Dull v. Blackman, \n169 U.S. 248\n, 42 L. ed. 735, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 333; Freeman, Judgm. 1st ed.  162), nevertheless, the rule has no application to a case like this, where the nominal plaintiffs or complainants were, in legal intendment, conducting the litigation under the direction and for the benefit of the real owners of the property. The persons for whose benefit, to the knowledge of the court and of all the parties \n\n[217 U.S. 475, 487]\n\u00a0\n to the record, litigation is being conducted, cannot, in a legal sense, be said to be strangers to the cause. The case is within the principle that one who prosecutes or defends a suit in the name of another, to establish and protect his own right, or who assists in the prosecution or defense of an action in aid of some interest of his own, and who does this openly, to the knowledge of the opposing party, is as much bound by the judgment, and as fully entitled to avail himself of it, as an estoppel against an adversary party, as he would be if he had been a party to the record. Lovejoy v. Murray, 3 Wall. 1, 18 L. ed. 129.\n There is no merit in the contention that, in rendering judgment upon the pleadings, the court usurped the province of the jury. In the view we have taken of the case, it becomes necessary, for the purpose of testing that contention, to consider only the fourth paragraph of the replication, heretofore quoted. In asserting, as was done in that paragraph, 'that the defendants herein were neither parties nor privies to the said judgments, suit, and appeals (referred to in the third defense), and therefore said judgments cannot bar this action,' there was presented merely a question of law as to whether, upon the facts appearing in the judgments, or averred in the third defense, the defendants in this action were, as a matter of law, in privity with the complainants in the cause in which the judgments pleaded as res judicata were rendered. And this is true also as to the charge made in the fourth paragraph of the replication, that De Fleurian was insane when the judgments relied upon as res judicata were entered. We say this, because clearly, whether the judgments, on such mere averment, were subject to be collaterally attacked, was a matter of law for the court, even if the assumption be indulged in that the right to plead the asserted insanity (which we do not intimate to be the case) was within the condition as to replying imposed by the court when it overruled the demurrer.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","150":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN R. CO. v. GREENE(1910)\nNo. 450\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n Action was brought in the city court of Birmingham, Alabama, by the Southern Railway Company, to recover the sum of $22,458.36, for so much money received by the defendant as judge of the probate court of Jefferson county, Alabama, which sum the plaintiff claimed was wrongfully exacted from \n\n[216 U.S. 400, 401]\n\u00a0\n it under the provisions of the act of March 7, 1907. This sum is the amount taxed against the Southern Railway Company under the said legislative act, and, under the practice in Alabama, if illegally exacted, it may be recovered.\n This act is found in the Code of Alabama of 1907, vol. 1, page 986,  2391 to 2400, inclusive. It provides for the payment of an annual franchise tax to the probate judge by every foreign corporation authorized to do business within the state, in which it has a resident agent, with certain exceptions, for the use of the state, upon the actual amount of the capital stock employed by it in the state; in the amount of $25 on the first $100, 5 per cent on the next $900, and 1\/10 of 1 per cent on all the remaining amount of capital so employed.\n Provision is made for the assessment of the tax by proceedings before the probate judge, with an appeal to the circuit court in certain cases. The statute enacts that no foreign corporation required to pay a tax under this statute shall do any business in the state of Alabama not constituting interstate commerce, or maintain or commence any action in any of the courts of the state, upon contracts made in the state other than contracts based upon interstate commerce, unless such corporation shall have paid said tax within sixty days after the same shall have become due. The payment of the tax in one county shall be sufficient, notwithstanding the corporation shall do business or have a resident agent in more than one county.\n The payment of the franchise tax required by this statute does not exempt any corporation paying the same from payment of the regular license or privilege tax specified or required for engaging in or carrying on business, the license for which is required from individuals, firms, or corporations. In addition to the amount of the franchise tax required to be paid to the state, such foreign corporation shall pay to the county, for the use of the county, an amount equal to one half of the amount paid by it to the state. Loans of money upon which a mortgage tax is paid are deducted from capital em- \n\n[216 U.S. 400, 402]\n\u00a0\n ployed in the state upon which there shall be paid the recording privilege tax required by law.\n The complaint averred that the act is unconstitutional and void, as it impaired the obligation of a contract between the plaintiff and the state of Alabama, and in that it deprived the plaintiff of its property without due process of law, and denied to it the equal protection of the laws.\n Plaintiff averred that it is a corporation created under the laws of the state of Virginia, and as such authorized to lease, use, operate, and acquire any railroad or transportation company, then or thereafter incorporated by the laws of the United States, or any of the states thereof. That it thus organized, in February, 1894, and has since carried on the business of acquiring, owning, and operating lines of railroads in various states, and conducting interstate and intrastate transportation of persons and property. That, in conformity with the laws of the state of Alabama, on July 16, 1894, it filed in the office of the secretary of state a copy of its charter, and designated an agent upon whom service could be made, and that, at the same time, it paid to the treasurer of the state of Alabama the sum of $250, being the sum required as a license fee for beginning business in the state. It avers that, after thus complying with the laws of Alabama, it commenced carrying on its authorized business within the state, and has therein carried on the same business ever since; that between the time of entering the state, as aforesaid, and the year 1899, it purchased and acquired, as permitted and authorized by the laws of Alabama, various lines of railroad and the franchises under which they had been built and operated, which lines are connected with, and continuous with, other lines owned by the plaintiff.\n The complaint states that these lines of railroad, situated in the state of Alabama, had been theretofore constructed under its laws by duly authorized corporations, and the complaint contains a list of such lines; that it acquired said lines, paying large sums of money therefor, in pursuance of and re- \n\n[216 U.S. 400, 403]\n\u00a0\n liance upon the laws of the state of Alabama, that since such acquisition it has continued to operate such lines of railroad, transacting a large amount of business thereon, both interstate and intrastate, and has expended large sums of money in the maintenance and improvement thereof.\n Plaintiff avers that, from time to time, ownership taxes, similar to those assessed against other persons and corporations, have been assessed against it, all of which the plaintiff has paid. It has also paid from year to year the license tax exacted of it and other persons and corporations operating railroads in the state of Alabama under  3489 of the Code of Alabama of 1896, under  1128 of the Code of Alabama of 1886. It has also paid on account of its ownership of such railroad, taxes assessed against it under the act of March 7, 1897, taxing the franchises or intangible property, in the state, of every person and corporation engaged in transporting persons or property over any railroad therein. It has also paid the license fee, and has procured the license provided for by the act of the legislature of the state of Alabama, approved March 7, 1907, entitled, 'An Act to Further Regulate the Doing of Business in Alabama by Foreign or Nonresident Corporations, or Corporations Organized under or by Authority of the Law of Any Other State or Government than the State of Alabama, and to Fix a Punishment for the Violation Thereof.'\n Plaintiff states that all these exactions have been made by the state of Alabama upon corporations owning and operating railroads in Alabama, without regard to whether the corporation owning and operating such railroad was a domestic corporation or a corporation organized under the laws of some other state, with the sole exception of the license fee last above mentioned, which is a nominal amount ($10 per annum), is exacted from foreign corporations only, for mere police purposes, in order that there may be a registration of such foreign corporations, doing business in Alabama, in the office of the secretary of state. Plaintiff avers that the legislative act of March 7, 1907, under which it was compelled to pay the said sum of \n\n[216 U.S. 400, 404]\n\u00a0\n $22,458.36, does not apply to persons or corporations of the state of Alabama owning the same character of property and carrying on the same kind of business as is owned and carried on by corporations organized under the laws of other states, nor is there any similar exaction against domestic corporations owning such property and engaged in the same character of business.\n Plaintiff recites the proceedings before the probate judge of Jefferson county, resulting in the finding that the capital of the plaintiff employed in the state of Alabama was $14,903,246, and the assessment thereon of the tax of $22,458.36, as aforesaid, its payment under protest, and prays judgment for its recovery. A demurrer to the complaint was sustained and judgment rendered for defendant. Upon appeal, the supreme court of Alabama affirmed the judgment. 49 So. 404.\n Messrs. Alfred P. Thom, Alexander P. Humphrey, James Weatherly, and Humphrey & Humphrey for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[216 U.S. 400, 409]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Alexander M. Garber, Samuel D. Weakley, and Henry C. Selheimer for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Day:\n\n\n[216 U.S. 400, 411]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The supreme court of Alabama placed its decision upon the ground that the act of March 7, 1907, should be sustained as a lawful tax, not upon the franchises of a foreign corporation, as property, but as a tax 'to add to the license tax already required an additional privilege tax for the continued exercise of the corporate franchises in the state.' 49 So. 408.\n The errors assigned attack the validity of the act of March 7, 1907, upon grounds, among others, that it violates the 14th Amendment of the Federal Constitution, in that it denies to the plaintiff the equal protection of the laws, and deprives it of its property without due process of law.\n The 14th Amendment provides that 'no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.' \n\n[216 U.S. 400, 412]\n\u00a0\n The important Federal question for our determination in this case is: When a corporation of another state has come into the taxing state, in compliance with its laws, and has therein acquired property of a fixed and permanent nature, upon which it has paid all taxes levied by the state, is it liable to a new and additional franchise tax for the privilege of doing business within the state, which tax is not imposed upon domestic corporations doing business in the state of the same character as that in which the foreign corporation is itself engaged?\n The Federal Constitution, it is only elementary to say, is the supreme law of the land, and all its applicable provisions are binding upon all within the territory of the United States. Whenever its protection is invoked, the courts of the United States, both state and Federal, are bound to see that rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution are not violated by legislation of the state. One of the provisions of the 14th Amendment, thus binding upon every state of the Federal Union, prevents any state from denying to any person or persons within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. If this statute, as it is interpreted and sought to be enforced in the state of Alabama, deprives the plaintiff of the equal protection of the laws, it cannot stand.\n The equal protection of the laws means subjection to equal laws, applying alike to all in the same situation. If the plaintiff is a person within the jurisdiction of the state of Alabama within the meaning of the 14th Amendment, it is entitled to stand before the law upon equal terms, to enjoy the same rights as belong to, and to bear the same burdens as are imposed upon, other persons in a like situation.\n That a corporation is a person, within the meaning of the 14th Amendment, is no longer open to discussion. This point was decided in Pembina Consol. Silver Min. & Mill. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n125 U.S. 181\n, 31 L. ed. 650, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 24, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 737, wherein this court declared:\n'The inhibition of the Amendment that no state shall deprive any person within its jurisdiction of the equal protection \n\n[216 U.S. 400, 413]\n\u00a0\n of the laws was designed to prevent any person or class of persons from being singled out as a special subject for discriminating and hostile legislation. Under the designation of 'person' there is no doubt that a private corporation is included.'\n\n And see Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Ellis, \n165 U.S. 150\n, 41 L. ed. 666, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 255, and cases cited on p. 154.\n Is the plaintiff corporation a person within the jurisdiction of the state of Alabama? In the present case, the plaintiff is taxed because it is doing business within the state of Alabama. The averments of the complaint, admitted by the demurrer, show it has acquired a large amount of railroad property by authority of, and in compliance with, the laws of the state; that it is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the state; that it has paid taxes upon its property, and also upon its franchises within the state; in short, that it came into the state in compliance with its laws, and, at the time of the imposition of the tax in question, had been for many years carrying on business therein under the laws of the state. We can have no doubt that a corporation thus situated is within the jurisdiction of the state. Blake v. McClung, \n172 U.S. 239\n, 43 L. ed. 432, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 165.\n The argument on the part of the state of Alabama places much weight upon the cases in this court which have sustained the right of the state to exclude a foreign corporation from its borders, and to impose conditions upon the entry of such corporations into the state for the purpose of carrying on business therein. That line of cases has been so amply discussed in the opinions and concurring opinions in the cases of Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Kansas and Pullman Co. v. Kansas, decided at the present term [\n216 \nU.S. 1, 56\n, 54 S. L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 190, 232], that any extended discussion of them is superfluous now. It is sufficient for the present purpose to say that we are not dealing with a corporation seeking admission to the state of Alabama, nor with one which has a limited license, which it seeks to renew, to do business in that state; nor with one which has come into the state upon conditions which it has since violated. In the case at bar we have a corporation which has come into and is doing business \n\n[216 U.S. 400, 414]\n\u00a0\n within the state of Alabama, with the permission of the state, and under the sanction of its laws, and has established therein a business of a permanent character, requiring for its prosecution a large amount of fixed and permanent property, which the foreign corporation has acquired under the permission and sanction of the laws of the state. This feature of the case was dealt with by Mr. Justice Brewer, then a circuit judge, in the case of Ames v. Union P. R. Co. 64 Fed. 165, 177, wherein he said:\n'It must always be borne in mind that property put into railroad transportation is put there permanently. It cannot be withdrawn at the pleasure of the investors. Railroads are not like stages or steamboats, which, if furnishing no profit at one place, and under one prescribed rate of transportation, can be taken elsewhere and put to use at other places and under other circumstances. The railroad must stay, and, as a permanent investment, its value to its owners may not be destroyed. The protection of property implies the protection of its value.'\n\n Notwithstanding the ample discussion of the questions involved in the case of the Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Kansas and Pullman Co. v. Kansas, to which we have already referred, we deem it only fair to the learned counsel for the state of Alabama to notice some of the cases which it is insisted have disposed of the question herein involved, and maintained the right of the state to impose a tax upon a foreign corporation, lawfully within the state, for the privilege of doing business in the state, when no such tax, or one less burdensome, is imposed upon domestic corporations engaged in the same business. The first case referred to is Ducat v. Chicago, 10 Wall. 410, 19 L. ed. 972, in which a tax was sustained upon a foreign insurance company which had come into the state upon complying with certain terms prescribed by the state, and was thereafter subjected to a tax on all their premiums, the statute declaring it unlawful in the companies otherwise to do business in the state. It is sufficient to say of that case \n\n[216 U.S. 400, 415]\n\u00a0\n that it arose before the 14th Amendment had become part of the Federal Constitution, and that no reference is made in the opinion of the court to the 14th Amendment, although the case was decided after that Amendment went into effect.\n In New York v. Roberts, \n171 U.S. 662\n, 43 L. ed. 323, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 58, a tax was imposed upon the franchises or business of corporations, with certain exceptions, computed upon the amount of capital stock employed within the state. It was pointed out by Mr. Justice Shiras, who delivered the opinion of the court, that the tax was imposed as well for New York corporations as for those of other states, and he said: 'So that it is apparent that there is no purpose disclosed in the statute either to distinguish between New York corporations and those of other states, to the detriment of the latter, or to subject property out of the state to taxation.'\n In Horn Silver Min. Co. v. New York, \n143 U.S. 305\n, 36 L. ed. 164, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 57, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 403, the tax imposed was applicable alike to corporations doing business in New York, whether organized in that state or not; and in the courtse of the opinion in the case Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the court, said: 'It does not lie in any foreign corporation to complain that it is subjected to the same law with the domestic corporation.'\n In Fire Asso. of Philadelphia v. New York, \n119 U.S. 110\n, 30 L. ed. 342, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 108, a Pennsylvania corporation which was taxed in the state of New York was subjected to a license fee, which license ran for a period of a year, and it was held that the state had the power to change the conditions of admission to the state, and to impose as a condition of doing business in the state, at any time or for the future, the payment of a new or further tax. Mr. Justice Blatchford, speaking for the court, said: 'If it imposes such license fee as a prerequisite for the future, the foreign corporation, until it pays such license fee, is not admitted within the state, or within its jurisdiction. It is outside, at the threshold, seeking admission, with consent not yet given.'\n We have adverted to these cases with a view of showing that \n\n[216 U.S. 400, 416]\n\u00a0\n the precise point involved herein is not concluded by any of them. It would not be frank to say that there is not much said in the opinions in those cases which justifies the argument that the power of the state to exclude a foreign corporation, not engaged in interstate commerce, authorizes the imposition of special and peculiar taxation upon such corporations as a condition of doing business within the state. But none of the cases relied upon presents the question under the conditions obtaining in the case at bar. We have here a foreign corporation within a state, in compliance with the laws of the state, which has lawfully acquired a large amount of permanent and valuable property therein, and which is taxed by a discriminating method, not employed as to domestic corporations of the same kind, carrying on a precisely similar business.\n As we have already indicated, the discussion of the question herein involved has largely been anticipated in the recent cases from Kansas, involving the right to tax the Western Union Telegraph Company and the Pullman Company. Those cases are the latest declaration of this court upon the subject, and in one aspect of them really involve the determination of the case at bar. In the Western U. Teleg. Case, it was held that a state could not impose a tax upon an interstate commerce corporation as a condition of its right to do domestic business within the state, which tax included within its scope the entire capital of the corporation, without as well as within the borders of the state. The Kansas tax was sought to be sustained as a legal exaction for the privilege of doing domestic business within the state. It was held invalid because it violated the right secured by the Constitution of the United States, giving to Congress the exclusive power to regulate interstate commerce, and because it violated the due-process clause of the Federal Constitution in undertaking to make the payment of a tax upon property beyond the borders of the state a condition of doing domestic business within the state. In that case, the 14th Amendment was directly applied in the due-process feature. In this case, we have an \n\n[216 U.S. 400, 417]\n\u00a0\n application of the same Amendment, asserting the equal protection of the laws.\n We therefore reach the conclusion that the corporation plaintiff, under the conditions which we have detailed, is, within the meaning of the 14th Amendment, a person within the jurisdiction of the state of Alabama, and entitled to be protected against any statute of the state which deprives it of the equal protection of the laws.\n It remains to consider the argument made on behalf of the state of Alabama, that the statute is justified as an exercise of the right of classification of the subjects of taxation, which has been held to be entirely consistent with the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. It is argued that the imposition of special taxes upon foreign corporations for the privilege of doing business within the state is sufficient to justify such different taxation, because the tax imposed is different, in that the one imposed on the domestic corporation is for the privilege of being a corporation, whereas the one on the foreign corporation is for the privilege of such corporation to do business within the state. While reasonable classification is permitted, without doing violence to the equal protection of the laws, such classification must be based upon some real and substantial distinction, bearing a reasonable and just relation to the things in respect to which such classification is imposed; and classification cannot be arbitrarily made without any substantial basis. Arbitrary selection, it has been said, cannot be justified by calling it classification. Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Ellis, \n165 \nU.S. 150, 155\n, 165 S., 41 L. ed. 666, 668, 671, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 255; Cotting v. Kansas City Stock Yards Co. (Cotting v. Godard) \n183 U.S. 79\n, 46 L. ed. 92, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 30; Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co. \n184 \nU.S. 540, 559\n, 46 S. L. ed. 679, 689, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 431.\n It is averred in the complaint, and must be taken as admitted, that there are other corporations of a domestic character in Alabama, carrying on the railroad business in precisely the same way as the plaintiff. It would be a fanciful distinction to say that there is any real difference in the burden imposed because the one is taxed for the privilege of a foreign \n\n[216 U.S. 400, 418]\n\u00a0\n corporation to do business in the state, and the other for the right to be a corporation. The fact is that both corporations do the same business in character and kind, and under the statute in question a foreign corporation may be taxed many thousands of dollars for the privilege of doing, within the state, exactly the same business as the domestic corporation is permitted to do by a tax upon its privilege, amounting to only a few hundred dollars. We hold, therefore, that to tax the foreign corporation for carrying on business under the circumstances shown, by a different and much more onerous rule than is used in taxing domestic corporations for the same privilege, is a denial of the equal protection of the laws, and the plaintiff being in position to invoke the protection of the 14th Amendment, that such attempted taxation under a statute of the state does violence to the Federal Constitution.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama is therefore reversed, and the case remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Dissenting: The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice McKenna, and Mr. Justice Holmes. \n\n\n\n","151":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN RY. CO. v. KING(1910)\nNo. 140\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 524, 525]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John J. Strickland, Alfred P. Thom, Hamilton McWhorter, and McDaniel, Alston, & Black for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 524, 528]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Reuben R. Arnold for respondents.\n\n\n[217 U.S. 524, 530]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n These cases were tried together in the circuit court, and were so considered in the circuit court of appeals, and will be so disposed of here. In No. 140, Josephine King brought her suit in the superior court of Habersham county, Georgia, to recover $10,000 against the Southern Railway Company for the wrongful death of her husband, killed while riding in a buggy, at a crossing of the defendant's railway. The alleged negligence was the volation of a certain statute of the state of Georgia, in that the company failed to check and to keep checking \n\n[217 U.S. 524, 531]\n\u00a0\n the speed of its train while approaching the crossing at which her husband was killed.\n In case No. 141, the action was brought by Inez King, by her next friend, Josephine King, in the same court, because of injuries received at the same time and place, and in alleged violation of the same statute. Both cases were removed to the United States circuit court for the eastern division of the northern district of Georgia. Upon trial, verdicts and judgments was rendered against the railroad company. These judgments were affirmed in the circuit court of appeals for the fifth circuit. 87 C. C. A. 284, 160 Fed. 332. The cases were then brought here by writs of certiorari.\n The Federal question presented concerns the validity of the statute of the state of Georgia for violation of which a recovery was had, it being the contention of the petitioner that the statute is in violation of the interstate commerce clause of the Federal Constitution, in that it is an illegal burden upon and a regulation of interstate commerce. This statute is found in  2222 of the Civil Code of Georgia, and reads as follows:\n'There must be fixed on the line of said roads at the distance of 400 yards from the center of each of said crossings, and on each side thereof, a post, and the engineer shall be required, whenever he shall arrive at either of said posts, to blow the whistle of the locomotive until it arrives at the public road, and to simultaneously check and keep checking the speed thereof, so as to stop in time should any person or thing be crossing said track on said road.'\n\n It has been frequently decided in this court that the right to regulate interstate commerce is, by virtue of the Federal Constitution, exclusively vested in the Congress of the United States. The states cannot pass any law directly regulating such commerce. Attempts to do so have been declared unconstitutional in many instances, \n\n[217 U.S. 524, 532]\n\u00a0\n and the exclusive power in Congress to regulate such commerce uniformly maintained. While this is true, the rights of the states to pass laws not having the effect to regulate or directly interfere with the operations of interstate commerce, passed in the exercise of the police power of the state, in the interest of the public health and safety, have been maintained by the decisions of this court. We may instance some of the cases of this nature in which statutes have been held not to be a regulation of interstate commerce, although they may affect the transaction of such commerce among the states. In Smith v. Alabama, \n124 U.S. 465\n, 31 L. ed. 508, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 804, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 564, it was held to be within the police power of the state to require locomotive engineers to be examined and licensed. In New York, N. H. & H. R. Co. v. New York, \n165 U.S. 628\n, 41 L. ed. 853, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 418, a law regulating the heating of passenger cars and requiring guard posts on bridges was sustained. In Lake Shore & M. S. R. Co. v. Ohio, \n173 U.S. 286\n, 43 L. ed. 702, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 465, it was held to be a valid enactment to require railway companies operating within the state of Ohio to cause three of its regular passenger trains to stop each way daily at every village containing over 3,000 inhabitants. In Erb v. Morasch, \n177 U.S. 584\n, 44 L. ed. 897, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 819, it was held that a municipal ordinance of Kansas City, Kansas, although applicable to interstate trains, which restricted the speed of all trains within the city limits to 6 mile an hour, was a valid exertion of the police power of the state. In the case of Crutcher v. Kentucky, \n141 U.S. 47\n, 35 L. ed. 649, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 851, this court said:\n'It is also within the undoubted province of the state legislature to make regulations with regard to the speed of railroad trains in the neighborhood of cities and towns; with regard to the precautions to be taken in the approach of such trains to bridges, tunnels, deep cuts and sharp curves, and, generally, with regard to all operations in which the lives and health of people may be endangered, even though such regulations affect, to some extent, the \n\n[217 U.S. 524, 533]\n\u00a0\n operations of interstate commerce. Such regulations are eminently local in their character, and, in the absence of congressional regulations over the same subject, are free from all constitutional objections, and unquestionably valid.'\n\n On the other hand, it has been held to be an illegal attempt to regulate interstate commerce to require interstate passenger trains to stop at county seats when adequate train service had already been provided for local traffic. Cleveland, C. C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Illinois, \n177 U.S. 514\n, 44 L. ed. 868, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 722. In Mississippi R. Commission v. Illinois C. R. Co. \n203 U.S. 335\n, 51 L. ed. 209, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 90, it was held that orders of a state railroad commission which directed the stopping of interstate trains at certain local stations, where adequate transportation facilities had already been provided, was an unlawful attempt to regulate interstate commerce, and repugnant to the Federal Constitution.\n Applying the general rule to be deduced from these cases to such regulations as are under consideration here, it is evident that the constitutionality of such statute will depend upon their effect upon interstate commerce. It is consistent with the former decisions of this court, and with a proper interpretation of constitutional rights, at least, in the absence of congressional action upon the same subject-matter, for the state to regulate the manner in which interstate trains shall approach dangerous crossings, the signals which shall be given, and the control of the train which shall be required under such circumstances. Crossings may be so situated in reference to cuts or curves as to render them highly dangerous to those using the public highways. They may be in or near towns or cities, so that to approach them at a high rate of speed would be attended with great danger to life or limb. On the other hand, highway crossings may be so numerous and so near together that to require interstate trains to slacken speed indiscriminately at all such \n\n[217 U.S. 524, 534]\n\u00a0\n crossings would be practically destructive of the successful operation of such passenger trains. Statutes which require the speed of such trains to be checked at all crossings so situated might not only be a regulation, but also a direct burden upon interstate commerce, and therefor beyond the power of the state to enact.\n It is the settled law of this court that one who would strike down a state statute as violative of the Federal Constitution must bring himself, by proper averments and showing, within the class as to whom the act thus attacked is unconstitutional. He must show that the alleged unconstitutional feature of the law injures him, and so operates as to deprive him of rights protected by the Federal Constitution. Tyler v. Registration Ct. Judges, \n179 U.S. 405\n, 45 L. ed. 252, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 206; Turpin v. Lemon, \n187 \nU.S. 51, 60\n, 47 S. L. ed. 70, 74, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 20; Hooker v.

Cas. 736.\n In the case at bar, the Federal question was sought to be raised by an amendment to the answer. The answer originally filed was general in its nature, and did not set up the defense of violation of the Federal Constitution. The amendment filed set up that the railroad company was engaged in interstate commerce, and, at the time of the injury complained of, was operating an interstate train; and after setting up the statute of the state of Georgia for a violation of which the company was sued, averred that it was inoperative as to the defendant's train, because in violation of  8, article 1, of the Federal Constitution, giving Congress the power to regulate commerce, and further stated:\n'Your defendant further shows that the statute of Georgia is not a reasonable regulation of the police power of the state, to secure the safety of passengers, but that the statute is a direct burden on and impedes the interstate traffic being done by this defendant, and impairs the usefulness of its facilities for such traffic.\n\n'Defendant further shows that it is impossible to ob- \n\n[217 U.S. 524, 535]\n\u00a0\n serve said statute and carry the mails as defendant is required to carry them under the contract it has with the government; and it is likewise impossible to do an interstate business and at the same time comply with the terms of said statute.\n\n'Wherefore it says that said statute is inoperative as to it, and it should not be required to comply with the same on its interstate line of railroad.\n\n'All which it stands ready to verify, and prays that it be hence discharged with its reasonable cost.'\n\n On oral demurrer to this amendment to the answer, the same was held insufficient, and it was dismissed. Petitioner's counsel further sought to raise the Federal question by an offer of proof at the trial by an engineer of the commpany, as follows:\n'I expect to prove that between the South Carolina line and Atlanta there are practically one hundred road crossings, or between eighty-five and one hundred public road crossings; that the distance is 101 miles; that the crossings in some localities are very close together, and within a few hundred yards of each other, and at others farther apart, but, on the average, making a crossing to the mile, almost. We expect to show further that, to observe the statute, and check and keep checking, so as to have a train under control, and to stop should any person or thing be on the crossing, would consume from five to ten minutes for each crossing, dependent, of course, upon the weight and length of the train and the grade; but it would make an average of seven or eight minutes. We wish to show that this train was made up and known as No. 39, the vestibule train which runs from the city of Washington, through the states of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia; that it was carrying passengers from one state to another, also carrying an express car with freight on it, from one state to another. We wish and expect to show that obedience \n\n[217 U.S. 524, 536]\n\u00a0\n to that crossing act would hinder, and practically prevent, interstate business being done by the defendant railroad. We wish to show the condition I have just stated all existed at the time this accident occurred, on the 11th of October, 1903.'\n\n This testimony was excluded and an exception was taken. It is apparent from this outline of the state of the record that when this testimony was offered there was no answer on file in the case under which it would be competent. A demurrer had been sustained to the amendment to the answer, and the case stood upon the complaint and the general issue filed by the defendant. It is elementary that the proof must conform to the allegations, and that without proper allegations, testimony cannot be admitted. We are then remitted to the question, Did the court err in sustaining the demurrer to the amended answer? The circuit court of appeals held, and we think correctly, that an inspection of that document shows that it did not contain a proper averment of the facts, which would show that the operation of the statute in controversy was such as to unlawfully regulate interstate commerce, and therefore deprive the railway company of its constitutional right to carry on such commerce unhampered by such illegal restrictions. The amended answer contains the general statement that the statute is in violation of the commerce clause of the Constitution, and a direct burden upon, and impedes, interstate traffic, and impairs the usefulness of defendant's facilities for that purpose; that it is impossible to observe the statute in carrying mails and in interstate commerce business. But these averments are mere conclusions. They set forth no facts which would make the operation of the statute unconstitutional. They do not show the number or location of the crossings at which the railway company would be required to check the speed of its trains, so as to interfere with their successful operation. For aught that appears \n\n[217 U.S. 524, 537]\n\u00a0\n as allegations of fact in this answer, the crossing at which this injury happened may have been so located and of such dangerous character as to make the slackening of trains at that point necessary to the safety of those using the public highway, and a statute making such requirement only a reasonable police regulation, and not an unlawful attempt to regulate or hinder interstate commerce. In the absence of facts setting up a situation showing the unreasonable character of the statute as applied to the defendant under the circumstances, we think the amended answer set up no legal defense, and that the demurrer thereto was properly sustained.\n The learned counsel for the petitioner insists that under the decisions in Georgia, in the absence of a special demurrer requiring a more particular statement, the answer was sufficient. It is enough to say that we have examined those decisions, and think that they do not indicate a departure from the general rule that a pleading must state facts, and not mere conclusions, and that the want of definite allegations essential to a cause of action or defense renders a pleading subject to demurrer.\n We find no error in the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, and the same is affirmed in both cases.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes, dissenting:\n The petitioner set up as a defense to these actions that the statute under which it was sued was such a burden on commerce among the states as to violate art. 1,  8, of the Constitution of the United States,-a pure issue of law. If, in order to try this issue intelligently, it was necessary to take evidence of facts, I think the court was bound to hear such evidence, even without any specific allegation of the facts that would maintain it, as it is the court's duty to know and to declare the law. But I \n\n[217 U.S. 524, 538]\n\u00a0\n leave that question on one side because the petitioners did not stop with the naked proposition, but alleged further that 'it is impossible to observe said statute and carry the mails as the defendant is required to carry them under the contract it has with the government; and it is likewise impossible to do an interstate business and at the same time comply with the terms of said statute.' These are pure allegations of fact. They mean on their face that the requirement that the engineer at every grade crossing should have his train under such control as to be able to stop, if necessary, to avoid running down a man or wagon crossing the track, requires such delays as to prevent, or seriously to interfere with, commerce among the states. They refer to physical conditions and to physical facts; they can refer to nothing else. I think it obvious that they mean that the crossings are so numerous as to make the requirement impracticable, since I can think of nothing but the number of them that would have that effect.\n The statement may be called a conclusion, but it is a conclusion of fact, just as the statement that a certain liquid was beer is a conclusion of fact from certain impressions of taste, smell, and sight. If the objection to the pleading had been that more particulars were wanted, although, for my part, I think it would have been unnecessarily detailed and prolix pleading to set forth what and where the crossings were, the pleading should not have been rejected, but the details should have been required. The petitioner showed that it was ready to give them, by its offer of proof. But evidently the answer was not held bad on that ground. Presumably, at least, as stated by the counsel for the petitioner, it was held bad on the ground taken by the supreme court of that state, that although the requirement was impracticable, it was the law. Central R. Co. v. Hall, 109 Ga. 367, 369, 34 S. E. 605. See 87 C. C. A. \n\n[217 U.S. 524, 539]\n\u00a0\n 284, 289, 160 Fed. 332, 337. For it is to be observed further that the facts involved were public facts, and that although the court might not take notice of the precise situation of particular crossings, it well might take notice, as the supreme court of Georgia seems to have taken notice in the case just mentioned, that they were numerous. See United States v. Rio Grande Dam & Irrig. Co. \n174 \nU.S. 690, 698\n, 43 S. L. ed. 1136, 1139, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep 770, and for many cases, Wigmore, Ev.  2575, 2580; 16 Cyc. Law & Proc. p. 862; 17 Am. & Eng. Enc. Law, 2d. ed. p. 904. Again, if any merely technical objection had been thought fatal to the defense, the petitioner undoubtedly would have met it by a further amendment to its plea.\n It seems to me a miscarriage of justice tosustain liability under a statute which possibly, and I think probably, is unconstitutional, until the facts have been heard which the petitioner alleged and offered to prove. I think that the judgment should be reversed.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice White concurs in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","152":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN RY. CO. v. MILLER(1910)\nNo. 122\nArgued: March 3, 1910Decided: April 4, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. John J. Strickland, Alfred P. Thom, Hamilton McWhorter, and McDaniel, Alston, & Black for plaintiffs in error.[ Southern Ry. Co. v. Miller \n217 U.S. 209\n (1910) ]\n\n\n[217 U.S. 209, 211]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Reuben R. Arnold and Reuben Arnold for defendant in error.\n\n\n[217 U.S. 209, 213]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The defendant in error, plaintiff below, brought suit in the city court of Hall county, Georgia, against the Southern Railway Company, a corporation of Virginia, and certain individual citizens of Georgia, to recover damages for personal in- \n\n[217 U.S. 209, 214]\n\u00a0\n juries received by him while in the employ of the railroad company as an engineer. A recovery in the court of original jurisdiction was affirmed in the court of appeals of Georgia (3 Ga. App. 410, 59 S. E. 1115), and the case is brought here to review certain Federal questions presented by the record. These are, first, that the state court erred in refusing to remove the case to the United States circuit court upon the petition of the plaintiff in error; second, as it appeared that the case had once been removed to the Federal court and was dismissed by the plaintiff, the state court should have held that the right to further prosecute in that court was lost, and the jurisdiction completely and finally transferred to the Federal court.\n In order to determine these questions, it is necessary to state how the case arose. Originally this suit was brought against the Southern Railway Company alone, to recover damages for injuries charged to have been inflicted, because the train upon which the plaintiff was engineer was permitted to run from the main track through an open switch, onto a siding, where another train was standing, when, by reason of the rules and regulations of the company in the circumstances set forth, plaintiff's train had the right of way upon the track, and, because the switch was turned the wrong way, plaintiff's train was thrown into the siding upon which the other train was standing, and in order to avoid more serious injury, plaintiff jumped from his engine, and was greatly injured.\n The first suit, being against the Southern Railway Company alone, was removed to the United States circuit court, the transcript of record was duly filed, and the company answered. Thereafter the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the case, and later began the present case against the Southern Railway Company for the same injury, and enjoined Cox, Voils, and Hurst as parties defendant. These parties were, respectively, the conductor of the train with which plaintiff's train collided, the engineer and front brakeman of said train. The negligence charged was that the brakeman negligently failed to turn the switch back to the main line after his train went into the sid- \n\n[217 U.S. 209, 215]\n\u00a0\n ing; that Cox, the conductor, was in control and management of the train, and under the duty of seeing that the switch was turned to the main line; and that Voil, the engineer, after he got his engine into the siding, with the exercise of ordinary care should have known that the switch was turned wrong, and yet failed to take any steps to report the situation or to have it remedied. It was further alleged that the individual defendants, in causing the switch to be unlocked and turned from the main line, were guilty of negligence, which was the negligence of the railroad company, inasmuch as they represented the company in the operation of the train which collided with the plaintiff's train. It is also alleged that the individual defendants should have flagged the plaintiff's train if, for any reason, the switch remained turned to the side track.\n The petition for removal contained no charge that the attempt to join the defendants was for the purpose of fraudulently avoiding the jurisdiction of the United States court, or with a view to defeat a removal thereto. The case here presented is one in which the record discloses there was an attempt to join, in good faith, the railway company and the individual defendants as for a joint liability in tort.\n Under the practice in Georgia, the case went to the court of appeals of that state on the question of the right to remove the case to the Federal court. The decision of the court of appeals upon that question is reported in 1 Ga. App. 616, 57 S. E. 1090. In that case, the court dealt with the right, under the law of Georgia, to join the individual defendants with the railroad company, and held that the objections to joinder were untenable, and that there was no separable controversy, either at common law or under the statutes of Georgia. In an opinion by the chief judge it was held that the acts of negligence charged against the individual defendants involved both acts of omission and commission, and were not merely matters of nonfeasance, for which the agents would not be jointly liable with the principal. The court further held that the objection that the liability of the railroad company* \n\n[217 U.S. 209, 216]\n\u00a0\n was statutory, and that of the other defendants at common law, made no difference in the right to join the defendants, and that, under the statute law of Georgia, the acts of negligence set out in the declaration against the individual defendants may have amounted to criminal negligence, in which event both the railroad company and the individual defendants were jointly liable to the plaintiff under the law of the state. In view of the conclusions which the learned court reached, it further held that the case was ruled by Alabama G. S. R. Co. v. Thompson, \n200 U.S. 206\n, 50 L. ed. 441, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 161, 4 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 1147. We agree with that conclusion. In that case it was held that, for the purposes of determining the removability of a cause, the case must be deemed to be such as the plaintiff has made it in good faith in his pleadings. See also Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co. v. Bohon, \n200 U.S. 221\n, 50 L. ed. 448, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 166, 4 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 1,152. There was no error in the refusal to remove the case.\n A further objection is made that, inasmuch as the suit was once removed from the state court to the Federal court, and therein dismissed, there was no right to begin the case again in the state court. This argument is predicated upon the statement in a number of cases in this court, to the effect that where the petition for removal and bond have been filed, the state court loses jurisdiction of the case, and subsequent proceedings therein are void and of no effect. But this is far from holding that a Federal court obtains jurisdiction of a suit thus removed in such wise that it can never again be brought in a state court, although there has been no judgment upon the merits in the Federal court, and the case has been dismissed therein without any other disposition than is involved in a voluntary dismissal with the consent of the court.\n While it is true that a compliance with the act of Congress entitling the party to remove the case may operate to end the jurisdiction of the state court, notwithstanding it refuses to allow such removal, it by no means follows that the state court may not acquire jurisdiction in some proper way of the same cause of action after the case has been dismissed without final judgment in a Federal court. By complying with the removal \n\n[217 U.S. 209, 217]\n\u00a0\n act, the state court lost its jurisdiction; and upon the filing of the record in the Federal court, that court acquired jurisdiction. It thereby had the authority to hear, determine, and render a judgment in that case to the exclusion of every other court. But where the court permitted a dismissal of the action by the plaintiff, it thereby lost the jurisdiction which it had thus acquired.\n We know of no principle which would permit the Federal court under such circumstances, and after the dismissal of the suit, to continue its jurisdiction over the case in such wise that no other court could ever entertain it. After the voluntary dismissal in the Federal court, the case was again at large, and the plaintiff was at liberty to begin it again in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n We find no error in the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Georgia, and the same is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","153":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHWESTERN OIL CO. v. STATE OF TEXAS(1910)\nNo. 119\nArgued: March 2, 1910Decided: April 4, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 114, 115]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George C. Greer, F. C. Proctor, D. E. Greer, and Greer, Minor , & Miller for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. James DuBose Walthall and Robert Vance Davidson for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n This action was brought by the state of Texas in one of its own courts, against the Southwestern Oil Company, a corporation of that state, to recover the amount of certain taxes alleged to be due under what is known as the Kennedy act (chapter 148, General Laws of Texas, 1905, p. 358 ), providing \n\n[217 U.S. 114, 116]\n\u00a0\n for the levy and collection of a tax upon individuals, firms, associations, or other persons, owning, managing, operating, or controlling for profit within the state certain specified kinds of business, including wholesale dealers in coal oil, etc., and prescribing penalties for violations of the act. The state recovered judgment for a part of that amount. Upon appeal to the court of civil appeals the judgment was affirmed, and the action of the latter court was afterwards affirmed by the supreme court of Texas.\n Upon this writ of error the Southwestern Oil Company contends here, as it contended in the state courts, that the statute under which the state proceeded was in violation of the Constitution of the United States.\n The statute in question ( 9) provides: 'Each and every person, association of persons, or corporation created by the laws of this or any other state or nation, which shall engage in their own name, or in the name of others, or in the name of their representatives or agents in this state, in the wholesale business of coal oil, naphtha, benzin, or any other mineral oils refined from petroleum, and any and all mineral oils, shall pay an annual tax of 2 per cent upon their gross receipts from any and all sales in this state of any said articles in  9 of this act hereinabove mentioned, and an annual tax of 2 per cent of the cash market value of any and all of said articles that may be received or possessed or handled or disposed of in any manner other than by sale in this state; and it is hereby expressly provided that delivery to or possession by any person, association of persons, or corporation in this state, of any of the articles hereinabove mentioned in  9 of this act, from whatever source the same may have been received, shall, for the purpose of this act, be held and considered such a sale and such ownership and possession of such articles and property (where no sale is made) as will and shall subject the same to the tax herein provided for. Said tax herein provided for shall be paid to the state treasurer quarterly, and every such person, agent, association, on per- \n\n[217 U.S. 114, 117]\n\u00a0\n sons, or corporation so owning, controlling, or managing such business, shall, on or before the 1st day of April, and quarterly thereafter, report to the comptroller, under oath of the president, treasurer, superintendent, or some other officer of said corporation or association, or some duly authorized agent thereof, the amount received by them from such business in this state. Should any person, association of persons, or corporation, or the officers or agents of any such corporation, person, or association of persons herein named, fail to make the report herein provided for, and pay said taxes, for thirty days after the termination of any quarter of the year, then he shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be fined in any sum not less than fifty nor more than one hundred dollars. Each and every day after said thirty days have expired shall be deemed a separate offense. In addition thereto, in the event of the failure of the officers or agents of any such company or corporation to make the reports and pay said taxes, for thirty days after the termination of any quarter of the year, each and every such company or corporation, or their officers or agents so failing, shall forfeit and pay to the state the sum of $25 for each day said report and payment are delayed, which forfeiture and taxes shall be sued for by the attorney general in the name of the state. For the purpose of suits and prosecutions provided for in this article, venue and jurisdiction are hereby expressly conferred upon the courts of Travis county, and service may be had upon any officer or agent of such company or corporation in the state, and such service shall, in all respects, be held legal and valid. The tax herein levied shall be in addition to all other taxes levied by law.'\n The defendant insists that the statute is inconsistent with the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, in the following particulars: That it arbitrarily selects and levies upon the wholesale business in coal oil, naphtha, benzin, or other mineral oils refined from petroleum, and any and all mineral oils, a tax of from fifty to one hundred times \n\n[217 U.S. 114, 118]\n\u00a0\n greater than is levied by the state upon wholesale business in other articles; that it denies to the defendant the equal protection of the laws, in that the failure of the wholesale dealer to pay the required tax for thirty days is made a misdemeanor, and subjects such dealer, upon conviction, to a fine of not less than fifty nor more than one hundred dollars, each day after the expiration of the thirty day being deemed a separate offense; and, in addition, subjects him to a forfeiture of $25 for each day's delay in making the report required and paying the taxes imposed, while the only punishment prescribed against a wholesale dealer in other articles was a fine in any sum not less than the taxes due, and not more than double that sum and the cost of prosecution, the taxpayer in such case having the right to a dismissal of the prosecution on the payment of the tax and costs of prosecution and procuring the license to pursue or follow the occupation for the pursuing of which, without license, the prosecution was instituted; no prosecution to be commenced against any person after the procuring of said license, if the license procured covers the time actually followed in said occupation or calling. Penal Code, art. 112.\n The transcript contains three principal assignments of error, one of which is that the state court should have held  9 of the statute to be unconstitutional as laying a tax or burden on interstate commerce. It may be observed that no such defense was made by the company in its answer, and we need not stop to consider the question whether such a defense would have merit. Besides, the certificate made by the supreme court of Texas, at the request of the Oil Company, shows that the alleged invalidity of the statute was based entirely on the 14th Amendment. Again, no point under the commerce clause is urged in the brief of the company. In this court it contends only that  9 of the statute contravenes the 14th Amendment. In our consideration of that proposition we assume, in conformity with the decision of the state court, that the statute is not in vio- \n\n[217 U.S. 114, 119]\n\u00a0\n lation of any provision of the Constitution or statute of Texas. That is a local question, with which this court is not concerned on this writ of error. We are only concerned to inquire whether the statute is inconsistent with the 14th Amendment, either as depriving the taxpayer of property without due process of law, or as denying the equal protection of the laws.\n Looking at the clause of the Amendment prohibiting the deprivation of property without due process of law, it is to be remembered that the provision to that effect appeared in most of the state Constitutions long before the Amendment was adopted, and that principle was accepted everywhere as vital in the American systems of government. But the Amendment, although negative in its words, had the effect to incorporate into the fundamental law of each state a rule theretofore prescribed by the Constitution of the United States for the general government and its agencies. So that, prior to the adoption of the 14th Amendment, the states were controlled, in imposing and collecting taxes, entirely by their own fundamental law; and if they departed from due process of law in matters involving the deprivation of property, the taxpayer injuriously affected by its action could not, for that reason, prior to the Amendment, invoke for his or its protection any provision of the Constitution of the United States. But upon the adoption of the 14th Amendment,-whatever their own Constitutions may then, or have subsequently, declared,-the states became bound, as was the United States by the 5th Amendment, not to deprive any person of property without due process of law. Still it was never contemplated, when the Amendment was adopted, to restrain or cripple the taxing power of the states, whatever the methods they devised for the purposes of taxation, unless those methods, by their necessary operation, were inconsistent with the fundamental principles embraced by the requirements of due process of law and the equal protection of the laws in respect of rights of property. \n\n[217 U.S. 114, 120]\n\u00a0\n Can it be predicated of the statute of Texas that its provisions for the imposition and collection of taxes are not conformable to due process of law? We think not. The tax in question is an occupation tax only. The statute has been so construed by the state court, and counsel for the Oil Company accept that construction as the law that should be applied in this case. The tax was imposed by the legislature, charged with the duty of providing the means necessary for the support of the state government. That branch of the state government alone could declare what taxes should be imposed and upon whom or upon what kinds of business imposed. If the state seeks, directly, by civil suit, or indirectly, by criminal prosecution in one of its courts, to enforce the provisions of the statute, the way is open for the taxpayer, in his defense, to raise the question of the constitutional validity either of the statute as a whole, or of any method prescribed in it for the collection of the tax. No element of due process of law seems to be wanting unless it be, as contended by the Oil Company, that the penalties prescribed for failing to make the 'reports' required by the statute are so severe and exacting as to make it unsafe for the taxpayer to question the validity of such penalties, and thereby interfere with or suspend the collection of the taxes by insisting that they have been imposed in disregard of due process of law. But this point as to the severity and exacting character of the penalties, need not be now considered, because no penalties are claimed by the state in this action and no judgment therefor was rendered. Besides, the provision as to penalties is not so necessarily connected with the other parts of the statute as to vitiate the entire act, even if that provision should be held to be void. The right of the state, by a civil suit, to recover the taxes imposed, is wholly independent of its right, by suit or prosecution, to recover the prescribed penalties. If the provisions as to penalties should be stricken down, there will still be left a complete act providing for the collection by civil suit of the taxes due the \n\n[217 U.S. 114, 121]\n\u00a0\n state. The rule is well settled that if one part of a statute is valid and another invalid, the former may be enforced, if it be not so connected with or dependent on the other as to make it clear that the legislature would not have passed that part without the part that may be deemed invalid.\n But it is contended that the statute contravenes the 14th Amendment, in that it denies to the Oil Company the equal protection of the laws. This position is based mainly on the ground that the statute, by imposing a tax on wholesale dealers of coal oil, naphtha, benzin, mineral oils refined from petroleum, and all other mineral oils, while omitting to put any such tax whatever on wholesale dealers in other articles of merchandise,-such, for instance, as sugar, bacon, coal, and iron,-so discriminates against wholesale dealers in the several articles specified in  9 as to deny them the equal protection of the laws. This view gives to the Amendment a scope that could not have been contemplated at the time of its adoption. The tax in question is conceded to be an occupation tax simply. It was imposed under the authority of the state Constitution, providing that the legislature may 'impose occupation taxes, both upon natural persons and upon corporations other than municipal, doing any business in this state . . . except that persons engaged in mechanical and agricultural pursuits shall never be required to pay an occupation tax.' [ Art. 8,  1.] It is not questioned that the state may classify occupations for purposes of taxation. In its discretion it may tax all, or it may tax one or some, taking care to accord to all in the same class equality of rights. The statute, in respect of the particular class of wholesale dealers mentioned in it, is to be referred to the governmental power of the state, in its discretion, to classify occupations for purposes of taxation. The state, keeping within the limits of its own fundamental law, can adopt any system of taxation or any classification that it deems best for the common good and the maintenance of its government, provided such classification be not in violation of the 14th Amendment. \n\n[217 U.S. 114, 122]\n\u00a0\n A leading case on the general subject is Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 33 S. L. ed. 892, 895, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 533, 535. In that case a question arose as to whether a statute of Pennsylvania, subjecting bonds and other securities issued by corporations, to a higher rate of taxation than was imposed on other moneyed securities, was a denial of the equal protection of the laws to corporations. This court held that there was no discrimination which the state was not competent to make, saying: 'All corporate securities are subject to the same regulations. The provision in the 14th Amendment, that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, was not intended to prevent a state from adjusting its system of taxation in all proper and reasonable ways. It may, if it chooses, exempt certain classes of property from any taxation at all, such as churches, libraries, and the property of charitable institutions. It may impose different specific taxes upon different trades and professions, and may vary the rates of excise upon various products; it may tax real estate and personal property in a different manner; it may tax visible property only, and not tax securities for payment of money; it may allow deductions for indebtedness, or not allow them. All such regulations, and those of like character, so long as they proceed within reasonable limits and general usages, are within the discretion of the state legislature, or the people of the state, in framing their Constitution. But clear and hostile discriminations against particular persons and classes, especially such as are of an unusual character, unknown to the practice of our governments, might be obnoxious to the constitutional prohibition. It would, however, be impracticable and unwise to attempt to lay down any general rule or definition on the subject, that would include all cases. They must be decided as they arise. We think that we are safe in saying, that the 14th Amendment was not intended to compel the state to adopt an iron rule of equal taxation. If that were its proper construction, it would not only supersede all those constitutional provisions \n\n[217 U.S. 114, 123]\n\u00a0\n and laws of some of the states, whose object is to secure equality of taxation, and which are usually accompanied with qualifications deemed material, but it would render nugatory those discriminations which the best interests of society require; which are necessary for the encouragement of needed and useful industries, and the discouragement of intemperance and vice; and which every state, in one form or another, deems it expedient to adopt.'\n In Home Ins. Co. v. New York, \n134 U.S. 594\n, 33 L. ed. 1025, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 593, involving the constitutional validity of a law taxing corporate franchises and business, the court held that the statute was not a denial of the equal protection of laws. It said that the Amendment 'does not prevent the classification of property for taxation,-subjecting one kind of property to one rate of taxation, and other kind of property to a different rate,-distinguishing between franchises, licenses, and privileges, and visible and tangible property, and between real and personal property. Nor does the Amendment prohibit special legislation. Indeed, the greater part of all legislation is special, either in the extent to which it operates, or the objects sought to be obtained by it. And when such legislation applies to artificial bodies, it is not open to objection if all such bodies are treated alike under similar circumstances and conditions, in respect to the privileges conferred upon them and the liabilities to which they are subjected. Under the statute of New York, all corporations, joint stock companies, and associations of the same kind, are subjected to the same tax. There is the same rule applicable to all under the same conditions in determining the rate of taxation. There is no discrimination in favor of one against another of the same class.'\n So, in Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co. \n184 \nU.S. 540, 562\n, 46 S. L. ed. 679, 690, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 431, 440: 'A tax may be imposed only upon certain callings and trades, for when the state exerts its power to tax, it is not bound to tax all pursuits or all property that may be legitimately taxed for governmental purposes. It would be an intolerable burden if a state could not tax any property or \n\n[217 U.S. 114, 124]\n\u00a0\n calling unless, at the same time, it taxed all property or all callings. Its discretion in such matters is very great, and should be exercised solely with reference to the general welfare, as involved in the necessity of taxation for the support of the state. A state may, in its wisdom, classify property for purposes of taxation, and the exercise of its discretion is not to be questioned in a court of the United States, so long as the classification does not invade rights secured by the Constitution of the United States.'\n There are many other cases in which the court considered the meaning and scope of the constitutional guaranty of the equal protection of the laws. We will refer to a few of them.\n In Kentucky R. Tax Cases, \n115 \nU.S. 321, 337\n, 29 S. L. ed. 414, 419, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 57, 63, the court sustained, as not inconsistent with the equal-protection clause of the 14th Amendment, a Kentucky statute providing for the assessment of railroad property for purposes of taxation in a mode different from that prescribed as to ordinary real estate, or as to the property of corporations chartered for other purposes, such as bridge, mining, street railway, manufacturing, gas, and water companies. It said that 'the rule of equality in respect to the subject only requires the same means and methods to be applied impartially to all the constituents of each class, so that the law shall operate equally and uniformly upon all persons in similar circumstances. There is no objection, therefore, to the discrimination made as between railroad companies and other corporations in the methods and instrumentalities by which the value of their property is ascertained.' In Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Sav. Bank, \n170 \nU.S. 283, 294\n, 42 S. L. ed. 1037, 1043, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 594, which involved the constitutionality of an inheritance-tax law, the court recognized the power of the state to 'distinguish, select, and classify objects of legislation,' by laws which did not violate the settled usages and established practices of our government. In American Sugar Ref. Co. v. Louisiana, \n179 U.S. 89\n, 45 L. ed. 102, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 43, a state enactment imposing a license tax on the business of refining sugar and molasses was held not \n\n[217 U.S. 114, 125]\n\u00a0\n to be a denial of the equal protection of the laws because of the exemption from such tax of planters and farmers who ground and refined their own sugar and molasses. In W. W. Cargill Co. v. Minnesota, \n180 U.S. 452\n, 45 L. ed. 619, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 423, a statute requiring a license to operate a warehouse for the receipt of grain, located upon the right of way of a railroad, but which did not require a license as to a similar warehouse not located on any right of way, was not a denial of the equal protection of the laws to the first-named class. In Cook v. Marshall County, \n196 U.S. 268\n, 49 L. ed. 473, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 233, which involved the validity of a cigarette-tax law that made a distinction between jobbers and wholesale dealers in cigarettes, the court said: 'There is a clear distinction in principle between persons engaged in selling cigarettes generally or at retail, and those engaged in selling by wholesale to customers without the state. They are two entirely distinct occupations. One sells at retail, and the other at wholesale,-one to the public generally, and the other to a particular class; one within the state, the other without. From time out of mind it has been the custom of Congress to impose a special license tax upon wholesale dealers different from that imposed upon retail dealers. A like distinction is observed between brewers and rectifiers, wholesale and retail dealers in leaf tobacco and liquors, manufacturers of tobacco and manufacturers of cigars, as well as peddlers of tobacco. It may be difficult to distinguish these several classes in principle, but the power of Congress to make this discrimination has not, we believe, been questioned.' In Armour Packing Co. v. Lacy, \n200 U.S. 226\n, 50 L. ed. 451, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 232, a state law imposing a license tax on meat-packing houses did not deny the equal protection of the laws to persons or corporations engaged in such business, because a like tax was not imposed on persons engaged in the business of selling the products of such houses, or on those engaged in packing articles of food other than meat.\n In our judgment, the objection that, within the true meaning of the 14th Amendment, the statute of Texas has the effect to deny to the Oil Company the equal protection \n\n[217 U.S. 114, 126]\n\u00a0\n of the laws, does not rest upon any solid basis. The statute makes no distinction among such wholesale dealers as handle the particular articles specified in  9. The state had the right to classify such dealers separately from those who sold, by wholesale, other articles than those mentioned in that section. The statute puts the constituents of each of those separate classes on the same plane of equality. It is not arbitrary legislation, except in the sense that all legislation is arbitrary. If it be within the power of the legislature to enact the statute, then arbitrariness cannot be predicated of it in a court of law. And it cannot be held to be beyond legislative power simply because of its classification of occupations. What were the special reasons or motives inducing the state to adopt the classification of which the Oil Company complains, we do not certainly know. Nor is it important that we should certainly know. It may be that the main purpose of the state was to encourage retail dealing in the particular articles mentioned in  9. If the statute had its origin in such a view, we do not perceive that this court can deny the power of the state to proceed on that ground. We may repeat what was said in Delaware Railroad Tax, 18 Wall. 206, 231, 21 L. ed. 888, 896, that 'it is not for us to suggest in any case that a more equitable mode of assessment or rate of taxation might be adopted than the one prescribed by the legislature of the state; our only concern is with the validity of the tax; all else lies beyond the domain of our jurisdiction.' But we will not speculate as to the motives of the state, and will assume-the statute, neither upon its face nor by its necessary operation, not suggesting a contrary assumption-that the state has in good faith sought, by its legislation, to protect or promote the interests of its people. It is sufficient for the disposition of this case to say that, except as restrained by its own Constitution or by the Constitution of the United States, the state of Texas, by its legislature, has full power to prescribe any system of taxation which, in its judgment, is best or necessary for its people and government; that, so far as the \n\n[217 U.S. 114, 127]\n\u00a0\n power of the United States is concerned, the state has the right, by any rule it deems proper, to classify persons or businesses for the purposes of taxation, subject to the condition that such classification shall not be in violation of the Constitution of the United States; that the requirement by the state, that all wholesale dealers in specified articles shall pay a tax of a given amount on their occupation, without exacting a similar tax on the occupations of wholesale dealers in other articles, cannot, on the face of the statute or by reason of any facts within the judicial knowledge of the court, be held, within the meaning of the 14th Amendment, to deprive the taxpayer of his property without due process of law, or to deny him the equal protection of the laws; and that the Federal court cannot interfere with the enforcement of the statute simply because it may disapprove its terms, or question the wisdom of its enactment, or because it cannot be sure as to the precise reasons inducing the state to enact it.\n For the reasons herein stated, the judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","154":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nST LOUIS SOUTHWESTERN R. CO. v. STATE OF ARKANSAS(1910)\nNo. 111\nArgued: Decided: April 4, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 136, 137]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Roy F. Britton, Nicholas J. Gantt, Jr., William T. Wooldridge, Frank G. Bridges, and Samuel H. West for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 136, 138]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Hal L. Norwood, F. E. Brown, and Pettit & Pettit for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 136, 140]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n Prior to October, 1905, the railroad commission of Arkansas promulgated a rule by which, within five days after written application by a shipper, it was made the duty of a railway company, under the conditions prescribed in the rule, to deliver freight cars to such shipper, for the purpose of enabling him to load freight. The rule in question, known as order No. 305, is in the margin. \n It is ordered by the commission that its rules be so amended that when a shipper makes written application to a railroad company for a car or cars, to be loaded with any kind of freight embraced in the tariff of said company, stating in said application the character of the freight, and its final destination, the railroad company shall furnish same within five days from 7 o'clock A. M. the day following such application. Provided, that when a shipper orders a car or cars and does not use the same, he shall pay demurrage for such time as he holds the car or cars, at the rate of $1 per car per day, dating from 7 o'clock A. M. after the car or cars are placed.\n Or, when the shipper making such application specifies a future day on which he desires to make a shipment, giving not less than five days' notice thereof, computing from 7 o'clock A. M. the day following such application, the railroad company shall furnish such car or cars on the day specified in the application.\n When freight in car loads or less is tendered to a railroad company, and correct shipping instructions given, the railroad agent must immediately receive the same for shipment, and issue bills of lading therefor; and whenever such shipments have been so received by any railroad company, they must be carried forward at the rate of not less than 50 miles per day of twenty-four hours, computing from 7 o'clock A. M. the second day following the receipt of shipment. Provided, that in computing the time of freight in transit there shall be allowed twenty- four hours at each point where transferring from one railroad to another, or rehandling freight is involved.\n The period during which the movement of freight is suspended on account of accident, or any cause not within the power of the railroad company to prevent, shall be added to the free time allowed in this rule, and counted as additional free time.\n The commission reserves the right, on its own motion, to suspend the operation of these rules, or any one or more of them, in whole or in part, whenever it shall appear that justice demands such action, and the commission will, upon complaint, hear and act upon application for a like suspension.\n Nothing in these rules shall apply to shipment of live stock and perishable freight where the rules of this commission or the laws of the state require the more prompt furnishing of cars or movement of freight than provided for by these rules. \n\n[217 U.S. 136, 141]\n\u00a0\n Complaint was made by Philip Reinsch before the commission, charging the St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company with having violated this rule, in that it was fifty-one freight cars short in complying with written applications made at various times in October, November, and December, 1905, and January, 1906, for the delivery at a station called Stutt- \n\n[217 U.S. 136, 142]\n\u00a0\n gart, of a much larger number of freight cars. The commission found that the railway company was short in the delivery of cars, as alleged, and that its failures in that respect not only violated order No. 305, previously referred to, but also  10 of an act of March 11, 1899, embodied in Kirby's Digest as  6803. It also declared that by these violations of the statute and rule of the commission the railway company had become subject to penalties in favor of the state of Arkansas, as provided in  18 of the act of 1899, being  6813 of Kirby's Digest, which penalties were to be enforced as therein provided. Conformably to the section in question, the prosecuting attorney for the proper county commenced this action in the mane of the state against the railway company, to recover penalties to the amount of $1,950. Rule No. 305 of the commission was recited, the proceedings before the commission were detailed, and the order made by the commission, finding the defaults on the part of the railway company, was set out, and upon these considerations the prayer for the statutory penalty was based.\n A demurrer having been overruled, an answer was filed on behalf of the railway company. By that answer it was alleged that the company was engaged in the transportation of interstate shipments of freight over its line of railroad in the states of Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, and Missouri, and that its equipment of freight cars for the transaction of its business, both interstate and state, was ample. That, anticipating the possible increase of business, both interstate and state, and as a precautionary measure, the company had, prior to the autumn of 1905, endeavored to contract for the construction of a large number of additional freight cars, but failed to do so, because the car manufacturers had such a press of work that they were unable to take the order. That thereupon, in an effort to provide for every future contingency, the corporation had, at a very large expense, commenced the construction of a plant of large capacity to enable it to manufacture its own cars, and was pressing the same to completion in the \n\n[217 U.S. 136, 143]\n\u00a0\n shortest possible time. It was alleged that at the time of the alleged defaults there was an extraordinary demand for cars, both for the movement of interstate and local traffic; and when, as the result of this condition, the shortage developed, the company had equally distributed its cars to the shippers along its line, giving no preference to interstate over local shippers, or to local over those desiring cars for interstate shipments. It was alleged that it would have been impossible for the company to comply with rule No. 305 without discriminating against its interstate commerce shippers, and therefore obedience to the rule would have resulted in a direct burden upon interstate commerce. Referring to the interstate commerce business of the company, which it was alleged moved over its own line through the states of Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, and Missouri, and thence by connecting roads throughout the United States and Canada, it was charged the burden imposed upon the company to deliver cars to local shippers without reference to the effect and operation of such delivery upon the interstate commerce business of the company would be a direct burden upon interstate commerce, and therefore repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, and that the same result would flow from enforcing the command of the commission as embodied in its rule No. 305. The rule, moreover, was especially assailed as being repugnant not only to the commerce clause, but to the 14th Amendment, both because of the inherent nature of the duty which the rule sought to impose, and also because of the unreasonable conditions which were expressed therein.\n There was a trial to a jury. Without going into detail it suffices to say that specific instructions were asked, in reiterated form, by the defendant company, concerning its asserted defenses under the Constitution of the United States; that is, the repugnancy to the Constitution of the rule of the commission and of the statute imposing penalties upon it for its failure to furnish cars. After verdict against the company for $1,350, and judgment thereon, the cause was taken to the \n\n[217 U.S. 136, 144]\n\u00a0\n supreme court of the state of Arkansas, and from the action of that court in affirming the judgment (85 Ark. 311, -- L.R.A.(N.S.) --, 122 Am. St. Rep. 33, 107 S. W. 1180) this writ of error is prosecuted.\n The question for decision will be simplified by analyzing the action of the court below,-that is, by stating the facts which it deemed were established, and by precisely fixing the issues and principles governing the same which the court stated and applied. Clearing the way to consider the proposition which it conceived the case involved in its fundamental aspect, the supreme court of Arkansas at once disposed of the contention that the commission was without power to adopt rule No. 305 by the statement that the power to do so was expressly conferred by statutes of the state. The court did not pass on the contentions concerning the alleged conflict between the rule and the Constitution of the United States, because it was expressly declared that it was not at all necessary to do so. This was based upon the conclusion that the duty to furnish the cars which had been demanded arose from statutory provisions (Kirby's Dig .  6803, 6804) which were but expressive of the common law, and that the liability for the penalty which was imposed by the judgment below equally resulted, considering the default as alone arising from violations of the statutory duty.\n The statutory duty to supply cars on application having been thus ascertained, and the failure of the company to furnish after demand not being disputed, the court was brought to consider what it declared to be the only question in the case; that is, 'Whether the undisputed evidence introduced by appellant presented a sufficient excuse for the failure to furnish the cars.' In so far as adequate excuse could arise from the complete discharge by the company of the duty to equip its road with a sufficient number of cars, it was recognized that the proof was ample; indeed, the court said:\n'In fact, the appellant was shown to have a larger car equipment than the average freight-carrying road, and the failure to furnish cars was wholly due to an inability to regain \n\n[217 U.S. 136, 145]\n\u00a0\n its cars which were sent to other roads carrying freight from its own line.'\n\n Coming, then, to state the facts concerning the cause which the court expressly found was wholly responsible for the failure to deliver all the cars asked for, it was pointed out:\n'The appellant is an originating line, originating about 70 per cent of its traffic and receiving about 30 per cent. To illustrate its situation, during the month of November, 1905, it had in revenue service 9, 517 cars, of which it averaged daily 3,982 in use on its own lines, 5,525 off its line, and 2,519 foreign cars in use. In other words, a daily balance of exchange of 1,473 cars was against it, and its shortage in cars was only about 650 per day.'\n\n Directing attention to the fact that the preponderant originating business of the road led to a preponderance of interstate over domestic or local traffic, and that such interstate traffic would be greatly impeded, if not paralyzed, by breaking bulk at the state line and refusing to give continuous transportation, by not allowing its cars, when loaded, to move beyond its line to the roads of connecting carriers, the court was brought to consider whether thus permitting the cars to move for the purpose of continuous interstate commerce traffic was, in and of itself, a fault entailing legal responsibility under the statute for a refusal to deliver cars for local traffic when requested. In holding the negative of this proposition the court said:\n'The evidence indisputably establishes that it is a benefit to the shipping public to interchange cars, and not to refuse to send cars off the line. . . . It is unquestionably good for the public that the railroads of the United States have a system of interchange of cars, instead of each road hauling to its termini only, and thereby force reloading and reshipment. The inconvenience and expense of such a system would at once condemn it as failing to meet public requirements. It is unquestionably the policy of both state and Federal legislation to facilitate, if not require, an interchange \n\n[217 U.S. 136, 146]\n\u00a0\n of cars. The most recent illustration of this policy is found in  17 of the act of April 19, 1907 (Acts 1907, p. 463). For one railroad company to be an Ishmaelite among its associates would operate disastrously to its shippers. The shippers of Arkansas expect the public carriers to put their cotton to the spinners in New England, and their fruit to the North and their lumber and coal to the four quarters of the Union, without change from consignor to consignee.'\n\n Thus deciding that the mere delivery of cars for through transportation was not a factor in determining whether there was legal fault, the court came to consider whether there was anything in the arrangement by which the cars in question were permitted to go off the line, which in and of itself constituted fault and consequent responsibility for failure to furnish all the cars required in time of shortage. Reviewing the evidence on this subject, it was found that the company was a member of an association known as the American Railway Association, which had adopted rules governing the interchange of cars from one road to another, with provisions for the return thereof and for compensation therefore, the association embracing and its rules governing 90 per cent of the railroads of the United States. Fixing thus the system which controlled the company in the interchange of its cars, it was determined that the mere formation of an association for such purpose was not repugnant to the laws against combinations in restraint of trade, the court, after referring to various state decisions to that effect, saying:\n'The result of these and other decisions, as summed up in an excellent text-book, is that these associations are lawful, and their rules and regulations, when reasonable, will be upheld. 2 Hutchinson, Carr. 3d ed.  861. Mr. Elliott says that such associations formed for the purpose of making and enforcing reasonable regulations to facilitate business and secure the prompt loading, unloading, and return of cars, cannot be held illegal, upon the ground that the constituent companies, by becoming members, surrender their corporate \n\n[217 U.S. 136, 147]\n\u00a0\n functions and control to the association. 4 Elliott, Railroads,  1568.'\n\n Having thus sustained the right of the road to deliver its cars for the purpose of continuous transportation beyond its line in interstate commerce, and sanctioned the general method by which it was sought to regulate and control the transmission and return of such cars, that is, by membership in the American Railway Association, the nature and character of the rules of the association were considered. Without going into detail, or following the statements of the court on the subject, it suffices to say that, analyzing the rules of the association, the court concluded that the regulations were inefficient in many respects, did not provide sufficient penalties to secure the prompt return of cars by roads which might receive the same, but, on the contrary, afforded a temptation in time of car shortage, inducing a road having the cars of another road to retain and use them, paying the penalty, as to do so would afford it an advantage. Pointing out that the general result of the operation of the rules of the American Railway Association for the interchange of cars had proven ineffective in the past, it was held that the company was at fault for delivering its cars to other roads for the movement of interstate commerce subject to the regulations of the American Railway Association, and therefore the penalty imposed in the judgment was rightly assessed.\n As the penalty, which the court sustained, was enforced solely because of its conclusion as to the inefficiency of the rules and regulations of the American Railway Association, which governed 90 per cent of the railroads in the United States, the court was evidently not unmindful that the carrier before it was powerless, of its own motion, to change the rules thus generally prevailing, and therefore was necessarily either compelled to desist from the interchange of cars with connecting carriers for the purpose of the movement of interstate commerce, or to conduct such business with the certainty of being subjected to the penalties which the state statute pro- \n\n[217 U.S. 136, 148]\n\u00a0\n vided for. We say this, since the court said: 'It may be better for the appellant to suffer these ills than to sail under a black flag, and refuse to send its cars beyond its line. That is not a question for the court. Until the appellant carrier shows reasonable rules and regulations for the interchange of cars, it cannot avail itself of these rules of interchange as causing and excusing its default to the public, for the rules here shown have proved unreasonable and inefficient before this default occurred.' And the gravity of the ban on interstate commerce which it was thus recognized would result from the ruling made cannot be more vividly portrayed than by once again quoting the statement of the court on the subject, saying: 'For one railroad company to be an Ishmaelite among its associates would be disastrous to its shippers.' If the railroad company, compelled to be a law unto itself because of its inability to change, by its own isolated will, the rules of the American Railway Association, should prefer to subject itself to the penalties inflicted by the state statute rather than bring disaster to its shippers, the seriousness of the burden to which interstate commerce would be subjected cannot be better illustrated than by saying that, by the provisions of the state statute, the penalty upon the carrier for each violation of the act or of the rules and regulations of the commission was not less than five hundred nor more than three thousand dollars.\n When, by thus following the careful analysis made by the court below, the contentions which the case present are circumscribed and the issues to which all the controversies are reducible are accurately defind, we think no serious difficulty is involved in their solution. In the first place, it is suggested by the defendant in error that no Federal question arises for decision, and therefore the writ of error should be dismissed. This rests upon the theory that, as the court below put the rule of the commission, No. 305, out of view, and declared in its statement of the case that no extraordinary or unusual rush of business on the line of the defendant com- \n\n[217 U.S. 136, 149]\n\u00a0\n pany occasioned the car shortage, therefore no ground of Federal cognizance remained; as, in other respects, the action of the court below was, in effect, placed purely upon matters of local concern broad enough to sustain its judgment. The contention is plainly without merit. It is to be conceded that the ruling of the court as to the irrelevancy of the rule adopted by the commission eliminates from consideration so much of the answer and of the instructions asked by the company and refused, relating to the repugnancy of the order to the commerce clause of the Constitution, both on account of its inherent operation and because of unreasonable provisions, which, it was alleged, it contained. But the constitutional defenses which were asserted by the answer, and which were embraced in the instructions asked and refused, were not confined to the mere order as such, but plainly challenged the power of the state to inflict the penalty for the failure to furnish the cars under the circumstances disclosed by the answer. And the ruling of the court, that the asserted power arose from the statute instead of from the rule adopted by the commission, but changed the form without in any way minimizing or obscuring the completeness of the Federal defense which was made in the pleading and necessarily passed upon by the court below.\n Coming to the merits, we think it needs but statement to demonstrate that the ruling of the court below involved necessarily the assertion of power in the state to absolutely forbid the efficacious carrying on of interstate commerce, or, what is equivalent thereto, to cause the right to efficiently conduct such commerce to depend upon the willingness of the company to be subjected to enormous pecuniary penalties as a condition of the exercise of the right. It is to be observed that there is no question here of a regulation of a state forbidding an unequal distribution of cars by a carrier for the benefit of interstate to the detriment of local commerce. This is the clear result of the finding below as to the proportion of the originating traffic of the road, and the extent of \n\n[217 U.S. 136, 150]\n\u00a0\n the cars retained and those permitted to go beyond the line of the road for the purposes of interstate commerce. If it be that the court below was right in its assumption that the rules of the American Railway Association, governing, as was conceded by the court, 90 per cent of the railroads, and hence a vast proportion of the interstate commerce of the country, are inefficient to secure just dealing as to cars moved by the carriers engaged in interstate commerce, that fact affords no ground for conceding that such subject was within the final cognizance of the court below, and could by it be made the basis of prohibiting interstate commerce or unlawfully burdening the right to carry it on. In the nature of things, as the rules and regulations of the association concern matters of interstate commerce inherently within Federal control, the power to determine their sufficiency, we think, was primarily vested in the body upon whom Congress has conferred authority in that regard.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Arkansas is reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller dissents. \n\n\n\n","155":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nST LOUIS, K C & C R.

In that suit, before the execution of the deeds to the purchasing committee, a railway corporation known as the St. Louis, Kansas City, & Colorado Railroad Company (hereinafter called the Colorado Company) and the city of St. Louis intervened to compel the Wabash Company to give to the Colorado Company the use of its tracks and a right of entrance over them to the Union depot of that city. On that intervention a decree was entered finding the equities in favor of the interveners, and granting the Colorado Company the use of the tracks and right of way. 29 Fed. 546. On appeal to this court the decree of the circuit court on the intervention was, on January 19, 1891, sustained. Joy v. St. Louis, \n138 U.S. 1\n, 34 L. ed. 843, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 243.\n A dispute having arisen as to the rights granted by that decree, a petition was filed at the March term, 1902, of the circuit court in the original foreclosure case to enforce those rights as the Colorado Company claimed they existed. A large amount of testimony was taken upon this application, and a decree entered April 2, 1906. Thereupon an appeal was taken to the circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit, which, on April 3, 1907, reversed the decree and remanded the case 'with directions to enter a decree not inconsistent with the views' expressed in the opinion of the court. 81 C. C. A. 643, 152 Fed. 849. The case went back to the circuit court, and after an amendment to the petition, which was allowed by the court, a decree was entered in obedience to the mandate, from which decree an appeal was again taken to the circuit court of appeals, and also to this court. On the appeal to the circuit court of appeals the record was filed in that court, and thereupon an application for a certiorari was made to this court, so that two cases are before us with records precisely alike, one the appeal from the circuit court directly to this court (being case No. 57) and the other the petition for a certiorari to the \n\n[217 U.S. 247, 250]\n\u00a0\n court of appeals (being case No. 301). [This petition was filed and presented to the court November 30, 1908, and on December 7, 1908, consideration of the petition was postponed to be heard with No. 57.]\n The Wabash Company has filed a motion to dismiss No. 57, the case appealed directly to this court. The jurisdiction of the original foreclosure suit was based solely upon diverse citizenship, and it has been repeatedly decided that the jurisdiction in the case of an intervention is determined by that of the main cause. Rouse v. Letcher, \n156 U.S. 47\n, 39 L. ed. 341, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 266; Gregory v. Van Ee, \n160 U.S. 643\n, 40 L. ed. 566, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 431; Carey v. Houston & T. C. R.

Co. \n173 U.S. 573\n, 43 L. ed. 814, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 500.\n If this be true in respect to an intervention, a fortiori must it be true in respect to a petition to enforce rights granted by the decree in the intervention. Nor is this rule changed by the fact that when this case went back from the circuit court of appeals to the circuit court, the latter court authorized an amendment to the petition, alleging that the decree ordered by the court of appeals failed to give full faith and credit to the original decree in the intervention proceedings, for, as said in Pope v. Louisville, N. A. & C. R. Co. supra (p. 578):\n'And this is true although another ground of jurisdiction might be developed in the course of the proceedings, as it must appear at the outset that the suit is one of that character of which the circuit court could properly take cognizance at the time its jurisdiction is invoked.

L. ed. 892, 897, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 601, and cases cited in the opinion.\n The motion to dismiss No. 57 must therefore be sustained with costs.\n With reference to the application for a certiorari, the power of this court cannot be doubted. As said in Forsyth v. Hammond, \n166 \nU.S. 506, 514\n, 41 S. L. ed. 1095, 1098, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 665, 669:\n'We reaffirm in this case the propositions heretofore announced; to wit, that the power of this court in certiorari extends to every case pending in the circuit courts of appeal, and may be exercised at any time during such pendency, provided the case is one which, but for this provision of the statute, would be finally determined in that court.'\n\n On the appeal to the circuit court of appeals the case was there pending for consideration and decree, and as, for reasons heretofore stated, an appeal to this court would not lie, the case can be brought here by certiorari.\n The question, then, is whether the writ of certiorari ought to be granted. That question involves the construction of a prior decree of a United States circuit court, affirmed by this court. It is not a question of the payment of money, but of the extent of the use belonging to one railroad company in the tracks, right of way, and terminal facilities of another, as well as the rights of access by the one company to industries established along the line of the other. This, in view of the increasing number of industries in a great and growing city like St. Louis, is of constantly enlarging importance, and ought, so far as possible, to be settled. It seems to us that both the private interests of the railroad companies and of the separate industries and the greater interests of the public call for the granting of the writ of certiorari, and it is therefore so ordered.\n This brings before us the original decree on the intervention. That decree, and the facts upon which the original controversy arose, as well as those upon which the present dispute rests, will be found fully stated in 29 Fed. 546, \n\n[217 U.S. 247, 252]\n\u00a0\n \n138 U.S. 1\n, and 81 C. C. A. 643, supra, need not be repeated. It is sufficient to say that the decree was founded upon contracts to which the railroad companies, or their predecessors, were parties, by which the Wabash Company agreed to 'permit, under such reasonable regulations and terms as may be agreed upon, other railroads to use its right of way through the park, and up to the terminus of its road in the city of St. Louis, upon such terms, and for such fair and equitable compensation, to be paid to it therefor, as may be agreed upon by such companies.' It provided that the Colorado Company should pay $2,500 a month 'for the use of the right of way, and tracks, side tracks, switches, turn-outs, turntables, and other terminal facilities of the said Wabash, St. Louis, & Pacific Railway at and between the north line of Forest park and Eighteenth street in the city of St. Louis,' and that of these properties it should 'enjoy the equal use and benefit.' It apportioned the expense of maintaining on a wheelage basis this right of way and other property during such joint use.\n Two principal questions are presented, each having reference to the existence of the rights granted by the intervention decree. The eastern line of Forest park is about 3 miles west of Eighteenth street, and at the time the decree was entered the Wabash Company owned a strip of land varying in width from 28 to over 200 feet, and extending from Eighteenth street to the east line of the park, and also had an easement for the passage of its trains and engines through the park upon a strip of land 42 feet wide from the east to the north side thereof. The ground owned by the Wabash is not, as stated, of equal width, portions having been obtained by deeds from different owners, some being only 28 feet in width and others extending quite a distance, so as to furnish room for roundhouses and other terminal facilities. Now, it is contended that the only effect of this decree was to give to the Colorado Company the right to use the two continuous tracks from the north line of Forest \n\n[217 U.S. 247, 253]\n\u00a0\n park into the Union station; while, on the other hand, it is contended that it gave to the Colorado Company the equal use and benefit of the entire ground owned by the Wabash and used for its terminal facilities. Both the circuit court and the circuit court of appeals sustained the latter construction, and with that conclusion we concur. The terminal facilities, and not simply a right of way over the tracks of the Wabash running to the Union station, were granted by the decree. As said by Circuit Judge Sanborn, delivering the opinion of the court of appeals (p. 646):\n'The ordinary signification of the term 'right of way,' when used to describe land which a railroad corporation owns or is entitled to use for railroad purposes, is the entire strip or tract it owns or is entitled to use for this purpose, and not any specific or limited part thereof upon which its main track or other specified improvements are located. Joy v. St. Louis, \n138 U.S. 1\n, 44-46, 34 L. ed. 843, 857, 858, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 243; New Mexico v. United States Trust Co. \n172 \nU.S. 171, 181\n, 182 S., 43 L. ed. 407, 410, 411, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 128, id., \n174 \nU.S. 545, 546\n, 43 S. L. ed. 1079, 1080, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 784; Chicago & A. R. Co. v. People, 98 Ill. 350, 356, 357; Lake Erie & W. R. Co. v. Middlecoff, 150 Ill. 27, 37 N. E. 660, 663; Pfaff v. Terre Haute & I. R. Co. 108 Ind. 144, 148, 9 N. E, 93, 95.\n\n'To one ignorant of the origin and history of the rights of the contending parties, and unaware of the persuasive arguments of counsel, the reading of this decree would suggest, no doubt, that it granted the joint use of the entire strip owned by the Wabash Company, and of all the railroad facilities thereon between the east line of the park and Eighteenth street. Upon its face there is no ambiguity in its terms. They suggest no limitation or exception, and when the terms of a decree are plain and clear, their ordinary meaning and effect may not be lawfully contracted or extended unless it appears with reasonable certainty that such was the purpose of the court; for the legal presumption is that the judge carefully and thoughtfully expressed therein his deliberate intention. The Wabash Company, therefore, assumed no light burden when it essayed to \n\n[217 U.S. 247, 254]\n\u00a0\n prove that the court intended by this decree to grant to the Colorado Company the joint use of a strip only 30 feet in width out of the wider strip the Wabash Company owned between the east line of the park and Eighteenth street.'\n\n The other matter involves the question of the right of access to industrial establishments which have been built up near to the line of the Wabash road. As might be expected in a growing city like St. Louis, there are now many such establishments, access to which has been obtained by the construction of tracks connecting them with the main tracks of the railway. The use of these connecting tracks, which were constructed under different arrangements with the various establishments, is claimed by the intervener, thus making itself a close and active competitor with the Wabash Company for their transportation business.\n The general conclusion of the court of appeals is stated in these words (p. 657):\n'The conclusion is that the Colorado Company is entitled to enjoy the joint and equal use of the entire strip of land between the east line of the park and Eighteenth street, which the Wabash owned or had acquired the right to use when the decree of 1886 was rendered, and of the tracks, side tracks, turn-outs, turntables, and terminal facilities now thereon. But it is not entitled to the use under that decree of any of the property, industrial or railway facilities of the Wabash Company, beyond the limits of that strip. Union P. R. Co v. Mason City & Ft. D. R. Co. \n199 U.S. 171\n, 50 L. ed. 139, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 19.'\n\n From the latter part of this conclusion Circuit Judge Hook dissented, and that presents the question now to be considered. We are of opinion that the circuit court of appeals erred, and that the views of Judge Hook are correct. That the matter was considered by the circuit court at the time of the original decree is evident from the opinion of the circuit judge, in which it was said (29 Fed. 559):\n'The final matter is that of compensation. In this I think \n\n[217 U.S. 247, 255]\n\u00a0\n the master erred. He fixed the value of the right of way at a million of dollars; and reported that, in his judgment, the share of the interest on this value and in the expenses of keeping up the track, which the intervener company should pay, should be fixed upon a wheelage basis. So far as respects the mere matter of keeping up the track, I see no reason to doubt the justice of the rule fixed by the master; but in regard to the interest on the value, I think the intervener should pay one half of that, and for these reasons: It is a familiar fact that in a large city like St. Louis, along the track of an important railroad, within the city limits, are built large manufacturing establishments, warehouses, and other buildings for the convenient transaction of business between the carrier, on the one hand, and the manufacturer and the merchant on the other. Another road coming over the same track not only uses the property, of great value, which the company owner has in the first instance paid for, but also shares in the benefit of access to all these manufacturies, warehouses, etc. It thus places itself in competition with the original company for this valuable business Such competition may operate to diminish the business of the original company, or compel it to lower its rates to preserve the business. In either way it operates to the serious detriment of the original company. The new company comes in as an equal competitor. It shares in all the benefits of this business, and it may share equally. Under those circumstances it seems to me no more than fair that a new company, which crowds itself into an equal access to such benefits and such privileges, should pay an equal share of the interest on the value of the property. Hence I shall sustain the objections of the respondent to the report of the master, so far as concerns the amount of compensation, and I think that the intervener company must pay one half the interest on the value, and its share of the cost of keeping up the track, determined upon a wheelage basis. In other respects the report of the master will be confirmed.' \n\n[217 U.S. 247, 256]\n\u00a0\n That is an interpretation of the language of the intervention decree giving the use of the right of way, side tracks, switches, turnouts, turntables, and other terminal facilities. It is doubtless true that a connection with these industrial establishments has become a matter of far greater importance than at the time of the decree. If it be said that this has cast an unexpected burden upon the Wabash, it must also be remembered that provision was made for such unexpected changes. As said in the opinion (p. 558):\n\n'An act of the legislature might be passed, giving to one company the right to use the tracks of another, and prescribing all the terms and conditions,-the details for the use. I take it, an act of the legislature would also be valid which simply declared that one company should have the right to use the tracks of another upon such terms and conditions as the parties might agree upon, or should be prescribed by the courts; and if such a legislative act would have to be adjudged valid and complete, I see no satisfactory reason why courts may not also hold sufficient and valid a mere contract for the right, and, determining the right, also settle and prescribe the terms of the use. It is true that such a decree cannot be executed by the performance of a single act. It is continuous in its operation. It requires the constant exercise of judgment and skill by the officers of the corporation defendant; and therefore, in a qualified sense, it may be true that the case never is ended, but remains a permanent case in the court, performance of whose decree may be the subject of repeated inquiry by proceedings in the nature of contempt. It is also true that, in the changing conditions of business, the details of the use may require change. The time may come when the respondent's business may demand the entire use of its tracks, and the intervener's right wholly cease. But other decrees are subject to modification and change, as in decrees for alimony. The courts are not infrequently called to modify them by reason of the changed condition of the parties thereto. So, when a decree passes in a case of this kind, it \n\n[217 U.S. 247, 257]\n\u00a0\n remains as a permanent determination of the respective rights of the parties, subject only to the further right of either party to apply for a modification upon any changed condition of affairs; and, so far as any matter of supervision of the personal skill and judgment of the officers of the respondent corporation, the contract, in terms, provides that the regulation of the running of trains shall be subject to the control of the officers of the respondent.'\n\n See also the opinion of this court in \n138 U.S. 1\n, 47.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of December 20, 1907, is therefore modified in accordance with the views we have expressed as to terminal facilities in connection with the industrial establishments now existing near the right of way of the Wabash Company. If that company shall desire, it may apply for a valuation of the additional properties of which the equal use and enjoyment is given to the intervener, and upon that valuation the same per cent shall be paid by the intervener. The costs, except so far as they have been already taxed, shall be charged against the respondents. \n\n\n\n","156":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTANDARD OIL CO. OF NEW JERSEY v.

Rockefeller, William Rockefeller, and five other individual defendants, prosecute this appeal to reverse a decree of the court below. Such decree was entered upon a bill filed by the United States under authority of  4 of the act of July 2, 1890 [26 Stat. at L. 209, chap. 647, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3201], known as the antitrust act, and had for its object the enforcement of the provisions of that act. The record is inordinately voluminous, consisting of twenty-three volumes of printed matter, aggregating about 12,000 pages, containing a vast amount of confusing and conflicting testi- \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 31]\n\u00a0\n mony relating to innumerable, complex, and varied business transactions, extending over a period of nearly forty years. In an effort to pave the way to reach the subjects which we are called upon to consider, we propose at the outset, following the order of the bill, to give the merest possible outline of its contents, to summarize the answer, to indicate the course of the trial, and point out briefly the decision below rendered.\n The bill and exhibits, covering 170 pages of the printed record, was filed on November 15. 1906. Corporations known as Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, Standard Oil Company of California, Standard Oil Company of Indiana, Standard Oil Company of Iowa, Standard Oil Company of Kansas, Standard Oil Company of Kentucky, Standard Oil Company of Nebraska, Standard Oil Company of New York, Standard Oil Company of Ohio, and sixty- two other corporations and partnerships, as also seven individuals, were named as defendants. The bill was divided into thirty numbered sections, and sought relief upon the theory that the various defendants were engaged in conspiring 'to restrain the trade and commerce in petroleum, commonly called 'crude oil,' in refined oil, and in the other products of petroleum, among the several states and territories of the United States and the District of Columbia and with foreign nations, and to monopolize the said commerce.' The conspiracy was alleged to have been formed in or about the year 1870 by three of the individual defendants, viz.: John D. Rockefeller, William Rockefeller, and Henry M. Flagler. The detailed averments concerning the alleged conspiracy were arranged with reference to three periods, the first from 870 to 1882, the second from 1882 to 1899, and the third from 1899 to the time of the filing of the bill.\n The general charge concerning the period from 1870 to 1882 was as follows: \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 32]\n\u00a0\n 'That during said first period the said individual defendants, in connection with the Standard Oil Company of Ohio, purchased and obtained interests through stock ownership and otherwise in, and entered into agreements with, various persons, firms, corporations, and limited partnerships engaged in purchasing, shipping, refining, and selling petroleum and its products among the various states, for the purpose of fixing the price of crude and refined oil and the products thereof, limiting the production thereof, and controlling the transportation therein, and thereby restraining trade and commerce among the several states, and monopolizing the said commerce.'\n To establish this charge it was averred that John D. and William Rockefeller and several other named individuals, who, prior to 1870, composed three separate partnerships engaged in the business of refining crude oil and shipping its products in interstate commerce, organized in the year 1870 a corporation known as the Standard Oil Company of Ohio, and transferred to that company the business of the said partnerships, the members thereof becoming, in proportion to their prior ownership, stockholders in the corporation. It was averred that the other individual defendants soon afterwards became participants in the illegal combination, and either transferred property to the corporation or to individuals, to be held for the benefit of all parties in interest in proportion to their respective interests in the combination; that is, in proportion to their stock ownership in the Standard Oil Company of Ohio. By the means thus stated, it was charged that by the year 1872, the combination had acquired substantially all but three or four of the thirty-five or forty oil refineries located in Cleveland, Ohio. By reason of the power thus obtained, and in further execution of the intent and purpose to restrain trade and to monopolize the commerce, interestate as well as intrastate, in petroleum and its products, the bill alleged that the combination and its mem- \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 33]\n\u00a0\n bers obtained large preferential rates and rebates in many and devious ways over their competitors from various railroad companies, and that by means of the advantage thus obtained many, if not virtually all, competitors were forced either to become members of the combination or were driven out of business; and thus, it was alleged, during the period in question, the following results were brought about: (a) That the combination, in addition to the refineries in Cleveland which it had acquired, as previously stated, and which it had either dismantled to limit production, or continued to operate, also from time to time acquired a large number of refineries of crude petroleum, situated in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and elsewhere. The properties thus acquired, like those previously obtained, although belonging to and being held for the benefit of the combination, were ostensibly divergently controlled, some of them being put in the name of the Standard Oil Company of Ohio, some in the name of corporations or limited partnerships affiliated therewith, or some being left in the name of the original owners, who had become stockholders in the Standard Oil Company of Ohio, and thus members of the alleged illegal combination. (b) That the combination had obtained control of the pipe lines available for transporting oil from the oil fields to the refineries in Cleveland, Pittsburg, Titusville, Philadelphia, New York, and New Jersey. (c) That the combination during the period named had obtained a complete mastery over the Oil industry, controlling 90 per cent of the business of producing, shipping, refining, and selling petroleum and its products, and thus was able to fix the price of crude and refined petroleum, and to restrain and monopolize all interstate commerce in those products.\n The averments bearing upon the second period (1882 to 1899) had relation to the claim:\n'That during the said second period of conspiracy the defendants entered into a contract and trust agreement, \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 34]\n\u00a0\n by which various independent firms, corporations, limited partnerships, and individuals engaged in purchasing, transporting, refining, shipping, and selling oil and the products thereof among the various states, turned over the management of their said business, corporations, and limited partnerships to nine trustees, composed chiefly of certain individuals defendant herein, which said trust agreement was in restraint of trade and commerce, and in violation of law, as hereinafter more particularly alleged.'\n\n The trust agreement thus referred to was set out in the bill. It was made in January, 1882. By its terms the stock of forty corporations, including the Standard Oil Company of Ohio, and a large quantity of various properties which had been previously acquired by the alleged combination, and which was held in diverse forms, as we have previously indicated, for the benefit of the members of the combination, was vested in the trustees and their successors, 'to the held for all parties in interest jointly.' In the body of the trust agreement was contained a list of the various individuals and corporations and limited partnerships whose stockholders and members, or a portion thereof, became parties to the agreement. This list is in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[221 U.S. 1, 35]\n\u00a0\n The agreement made provision for the method of controlling and managing the property by the trustees, for the formation of additional manufacturing, etc., corpora- \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 36]\n\u00a0\n tions in various states, and the trust, unless terminated by a mode specified, was to continue 'during the lives of the survivors and survivor of the trustees named in the agreement and for twenty-one years thereafter.' The agreement provided for the issue of Standard Oil Trust certificates to represent the interest arising under the trust in the properties affected by the trust, which, of course, in view of the provisions of the agreement and the subject to which it related caused the interest in the certificates to be coincident with and the exact representative of the interest in the combination, that is, in the Standard Oil Company of Ohio. Soon afterwards it was alleged the trustees organized the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and the Standard Oil Company of New York, the former having a capital stock of $3,000,000 and the latter a capital stock of $5, 000,000, subsequently increased to $10,000,000 and $15,000,000, respectively. The bill alleged 'that pursuant to said trust agreement the said trustees caused to be transferred to themselves the stocks of all corporations and limited partnerships named in said trust agreement, and caused various of the individuals and copartnerships who owned apparently independent refineries and other properties employed in the business of refining and transporting and selling oil in and among said various states and terri- \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 37]\n\u00a0\n tories of the United States, as aforesaid, to transfer their property situated in said several states to the respective Standard Oil Companies of said states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, and other corporations organized or acquired by said trustees from time to time. . . . ' For the stocks and property so acquired the trustees issued trust certificates. It was alleged that in 1888 the trustees 'unlawfully controlled the stock and ownership of various corporations and limited partnerships engaged in such purchase and transportation, refining, selling, and shipping of oil,' as per a list which is excerpted in the margin. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[221 U.S. 1, 38]\n\u00a0\n The bill charged that during the second period quo warranto proceedings were commenced against the Standard Oil Company of Ohio, which resulted in the entry by the supreme court of Ohio, on March 2, 1892, of a decree\n\n Capital S.

It was alleged that shortly after this decision, seemingly for the purpose of complying therewith, voluntary proceedings were had apparently to dissolve the trust, but that these proceedings were a subterfuge and a sham because they simply amounted to a transfer of the stock held by the trust in sixty-four of the companies which it controlled to some of the remaining twenty companies, it having controlled before the decree eighty-four in all, thereby, while seemingly in part giving up its dominion, yet in reality preserving the same by means of the control of the companies as to which it had retained complete authority. It was charged that especially was this the case, as the stock in the companies selected for transfer was virtually owned by the nine trustees or the members of their immediate families or associates. The bill further alleged that in 1897 the attorney general of Ohio instituted contempt proceedings in the quo warranto case, based upon the claim that the trust had not been dissolved as required by the decree in that case. About the same time, also, proceedings in quo warranto were commenced to forfeit the charter of a pipe line known as the Buckeye Pipe Line Company, an\n Capital S.

The bill contained allegations referring to the development of new oil fields; for example, in California, southeastern Kansas, northern Indian territory, and northern Oklahoma, and made reference to the building or otherwise acquiring by the combination of refineries and pipe lines in the new fields for the purpose of restraining straining and monopolizing the interstate trade in petroleum and its products.\n Reiterating in substance the averments that both the Standard Oil Trust from 1882 to 1899, and the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, since 1899, had monopolized and restrained interstate commerce in petroleum and its products, the bill at great length additionally set forth various means by which, during the second and third periods, in addition to the effect occasioned by the combination of alleged previously independent concerns, the monopoly and restraint complained of were continued. Without attempting to follow the elaborate averments on these subjects, spread over fifty-seven pages of the printed record, it suffices to say that such averments may properly be grouped under the following heads: Rebates, preferences, and other discriminatory practices in favor of the combination by railroad companies; restraint and monopolization by control of pipe lines, and unfair practices against com- \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 43]\n\u00a0\n peting pipe lines; contracts with competitors in restraint of trade; unfair methods of competition, such as local price cutting at the points where necessary to suppress competition; espionage of the business of competitors, the operation of bogus independent companies, and payment of rebates on oil, with the like intent; the division of the United States into districts, and the limiting the operations of the various subsidiary corporations as to such districts so that competition in the sale of petroleum products between such corporations had been entirely eliminated and destroyed; and finally reference was made to what was alleged to be the 'enormous and unreasonable profits' earned by the Standard Oil Trust and the Standard Oil Company as a result of the alleged monopoly; which presumably was averred as a means of reflexly inferring the scope and power acquired by the alleged combination.\n Coming to the prayer of the bill, it suffices to say that in general terms the substantial relief asked was, first, that the combination in restraint of interstate trade and commerce, and which had monopolized the same, as alleged in the bill, be found to have existence, and that the parties thereto be perpetually enjoined from doing any further act to give effect to it; second, that the transfer of the stocks of the various corporations to the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, as alleged in the bill, be held to be in violation of the 1st and 2d sections of the anti- trust act, and that the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey be enjoined and restrained from in any manner continuing to exert control over the subsidiary corporations by means of ownership of said stock or otherwise; third, that specific relief by injunction be awarded against further violation of the statute by any of the acts specifically complained of in the bill. There was also a prayer for general relief.\n Of the numerous defendants named in the bill, the Waters-Pierce Oil Company was the only resident of the \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 44]\n\u00a0\n district in which the suit was commenced and the only defendant served with process therein. Contemporaneous with the filing of the bill the court made an order, under  5 of the anti-trust act, for the service of process upon all the other defendants, wherever they could be found. Thereafter the various defendants unsuccessfully moved to vacate the order for service on nonresident defendants or filed pleas to the jurisdiction. Joint exceptions were likewise unsuccessfully filed, upon the ground of impertinence, to many of the averments of the bill of complaint, particularly those which related to acts alleged to have been done by the combination prior to the passage of the anti-trust act, and prior to the year 1899.\n Certain of the defendants filed separate answers, and a joint answer was filed on behalf of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and numerous of the other defendants. The scope of the answers will be adequately indicated by quoting a summary on the subject, made in the brief for the appellants.\n'It is sufficient to say that, whilst admitting many of the alleged acquisitions of property, the formation of the so-called trust of 1882, its dissolution in 1892, and the acquisition by the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey of the stocks of the various corporations in 1899, they deny all the allegations respecting combinations or conspiracies to restrain or monopolize the oil trade; and particularly that the socalled trust of 1882, or the acquisition of the shares of the defendant companies by the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey in 1899, was a combination of independent or competing concerns or corporations. The averments of the petition respecting the means adopted to monopolize the oil trade are traversed either by a denial of the acts alleged, or of their purpose, intent, or effect.'\n\n On June 24, 1907, the cause being at issue, a special examiner was appointed to take the evidence, and his report was filed March 22, 1909. It was heard on April 5 \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 45]\n\u00a0\n to 10, 1909, under the expediting act of February 11, 1903 [32 Stat. at L. 823, chap. 544, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 1211], before a circuit court consisting of four judges.\n The court decided in favor of the United States. In the opinion delivered, all the multitude of acts of wrongdoing charged in the bill were put aside, in so far as they were alleged to have been committel prior to the passage of the anti-trust act, 'except as evidence of their ( the defendants') purpose, of their continuing conduct, and of its effect.' ( 173 Fed. 177.)\n By the decree which was entered it was adjudged that the sombining of the stocks of various companies in the hands of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey in 1899 constituted a combination in restraint of trade and also an attempt to monopolize and a monopolization under  2 of the anti- trust act. The decree was against seven individual defendants, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, thirty-six domestic companies, and one foreign company which the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey controls by stock ownership; these thirty-eight corporate defendants being held to be parties to the combination found to exist. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The bill was dismissed as to all other corporate defendants, thirty- three in number, it being adjudged by  3 of the decree that they 'have not been proved to be engaged in the operation or carrying out of the combination.' \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[221 U.S. 1, 46]\n\u00a0\n The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey was enjoined from voting the stocks or exerting any control over the said thirty-seven subsidiary companies, and the subsidiary companies were enjoined from paying any dividends as to the Standard Company, or permitting it to exercise any control over them by virtue of the stock ownership or power acquired by means of the combination. The individuals and corporations were also enjoined from entering into or carrying into effect any like combination which would evade the decree. Further, the individual defendants, the Standard Company, and the thirty-seven subsidiary corporations, were enjoined from engaging or continuing in interstate commerce in petroleum or its products during the continuance of the illegal combination.\n At the outset a question of jurisdiction requires consideration, and we shall, also, as a preliminary, dispose of another question, to the end that our attention may be completely concentrated upon the merits of the controversy when we come to consider them.\n First. We are of opinion that, in consequence of the presence within the district of the Waters-Pierce Oil Company, the court, under the authority of  5 of the anti-trust act, rightly took jurisdiction over the cause, and properly ordered notice to be served upon the nonresident defendants.\n Second. The overruling of the exceptions taken to so much of the bill as counted upon facts occurring prior to the passage of the anti-trust act,- whatever may be the view as an original question of the duty to restrict the controversy to a much narower area than that propounded by the bill,- we think by no possibility, in the present stage of the case, can the action of the court be treated as prejudicial error justifying reversal. We say this because the court, as we shall do, gave no weight to the testimony adduced under the averments complained of except in so far as it tended to throw light upon the acts done after the \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 47]\n\u00a0\n passage of the anti-trust act and the results of which it was charged were being participated in and enjoyed by the alleged combination at the time of the filing of the bill.\n We are thus brought fact to face with the merits of the controversy.\n Both as to the law and as to the facts, the opposing contentions pressed in the argument are numerous, and in all their aspects are so irreconcilable that it is difficult to reduce them to some fundamental generalization, which, by being disposed of, would decide them all. For instance, as to the law. While both sides agree that the determination of the controversy rests upon the correct construction and application of the 1st and 2d sections of the anti-trust act, yet the views as to the meaning of the act are as wide apart as the poles, since there is no real point of agreement on any view of the act. And this also is the case as to the scope and effect of authorities relied upon, even although in some instances one and the same authority is asserted to be controlling.\n So also is it as to the facts. Thus, on the one hand, with relentless pertinacity and minuteness of analysis, it is insisted that the facts establish that the assailed combination took its birth in a purpose to unlawfully acquire wealth by oppressing the public and destroying the just rights of others, and that its entire career exemplifies an inexorable carrying out of such wrongful intents, since, it is asserted, the pathway of the combination from the beginning to the time of the filing of the bill is marked with constant proofs of wrong inflicted upon the public, and is strewn with the wrecks resulting from crushing out, without regard to law, the individual rights of others. Indeed, so convlusive, it is urged, is the proof on these subjects, that it is asserted that the existence of the principal corporate defendant,-the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey,-with the vast accumulation of property which it owns or controls, because of its infinite potency \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 48]\n\u00a0\n for harm and the dangerous example which its continued existence affords, is an open and enduring menace to all freedom of trade, and is a byword and reproach to modern economic methods. On the other hand, in a powerful analysis of the facts, it is insisted that they demonstrate that the origin and development of the vast business which the defendants control was but the result of lawful competitive methods, guided by economic genius of the highest order, sustained by courage, by a keen insight into commercial situations, resulting in the acquisition of great wealth, but at the same time serving to stimulate and increase production, to widely extend the distribution of the products of petroleum at a cost largely below that which would have otherwise prevailed, thus proving to be at one and the same time a benefaction to the general public as well as of enormous advantage to individuals. It is not denied that in the enormous volume of proof contained in the record in the period of almost a lifetime, to which that proof is addressed, there may be found acts of wrongdoing, but the insistence is that they were rather the exception than the rule, and in most cases were either the result of too great individual zeal in the keen rivalries of business, or of the methods and habits of dealing which, even if wrong, were commonly practised at the time. And to discover and state the truth concerning these contentions both arguments call for the analysis and weighing, as we have said at the outset, of a jungle of conflicting testimony covering a period of forty years,-a duty difficult to rightly perform, and, even if satisfactorily accomplished, almost impossible to state with any reasonable regard to brevity.\n Duly appreciating the situation just stated, it is certain that only one point of concord between the parties is discernible, which is, that the controversy in every aspect is controlled by a correct conception of the meaning of the 1st and 2d sections of the anti-trust act. We shall \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 49]\n\u00a0\n therefor-departing from what otherwise would be the natural order of analysis-make this one opint of harmony the initial basis of our examination of the contentions, relying upon the conception that by doing so some harmonious resonance may result adequate to dominate and control the discord with which the case abounds. That is to say, we shall first come to consider the meaning of the 1st and 2d sections of the anti-trust act by the text, and after discerning what by that process appears to be its true meaning, we shall proceed to consider the respective contentions of the parties concerning the act, the strength or weakness of those contentions, as well as the accuracy of the meaning of the act as deduced from the text in the light of the prior decisions of this court concerning it. When we have done this, we shall then approach the facts. Following this course, we shall make our investigation under four separate headings: First. The text of the 1st and 2d sections of the act, originally considered, and its meaning in the light of the common law and the law of this country at the time of its adoption. Second. The contentions of the parties concerning the act, and the scope and effect of the decisions of this court upon which they rely. Third. The application of the statute to facts; and, Fourth. The remedy, if any, to be afforded as the result of such application.\n First. The text of the act and its meaning.\n We quote the text of the 1st and 2d sections of the act, as follows:\n'Section 1. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any such contract, or engage in any such combination or conspiracy, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $5,000, or by \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 50]\n\u00a0\n imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court.\n\n'Sec. 2. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons to monopolize, any part of the trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $5,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court.' [26 Stat. at L. 209, chap. 647, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3200.]\n\n The debates show that doubt as to whether there was a common law of the United States which governed that subject in the absence of legislation was among the influences leading to the passage of the act. They conclusively show, however, that the main cause which led to the legislation was the thought that it was required by the economic condition of the times; that is, the vast accumulation of wealth in the hands of corporations and individuals, the enormous development of corporate organization, the facility for combination which such organizations afforded, the fact that the facility was being used, and that combinations known as trusts were being multiplied, and the widespread impression that their power had been and would be exerted to oppress individuals and injure the public generally. Although debates may not be used as a means for interpreting a statute (United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Asso. \n166 U.S. 318\n, 41 L. ed. 1019, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 548, and cases cited), that rule, in the nature of things, is not violated by resorting to debtates as a means of ascertaining the environment at the time of the enactment of a particular law; that is, the history of the period when it was adopted.\n There can be no doubt that the sole subject with which the 1st section deals is restraint of trade as therein contemplated, and that the attempt to monopolize and monopolization is the subject with which the 2d sec- \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 51]\n\u00a0\n tion is concerned. It is certain that those terms, at least in their rudimentary meaning, took their origin in the common law, and were also familiar in the law of this country prior to and at the time of the adoption of the act in question.\n We shall endeavor, then first, to seek their meaning, not by indulging in an elaborate and learned analysis of the English law and of the law of this country, but by making a very brief reference to the elementary and indisputable conceptions of both the English and American law on the subject prior to the passage of the antitrust act.\n a. It is certain that at a very remote period the words 'contract in restraint of trade' in England came to refer to some voluntary restraint put by contract by an individual on his right to carry on his trade or calling. Originally all such contracts were considered to be illegal, because it was deemed they were injurious to the public as well as to the individuals who made them. In the interest of the freedom of individuals to contract, this doctrine was modified so that it was only when a restraint by contract was so general as to be conterminos with the kingdom that it was treated as void. That is to say, if the restraint was partial in its operation, and was otherwise reasonable, the contract was held to be valid:\n b. Monopolies were defined by Lord Coke as follows:\n\"A monopoly is an institution or allowance by the King by his grant, commission, or otherwise, to any person or persons, bodies politic or corporate, of or for the sole buying, selling, making,* working, or using of anything, whereby any person or persons, bodies politic or corporate, are sought to be restrained of any freedom or liberty that they had before, or hindered in their lawful trade.' (3 Inst. 181.)'\n\n Hawkins thus defined them:\n\"A monopoly is an allowance by the King to a particular person or persons of the sole buying, selling, making, \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 52]\n\u00a0\n working, or using of anything whereby any person is sought to be restrained from any freedom [of manufacturing or trading] which he had before.' (Hawk. P. C. bk. 1, chap. 79.)'\n\n The frequent granting of monopolies and the struggle which led to a denial of the power to create them, that is to say, to the establishment that they were incompatible with the English Constitution, is known to all and need not be reviewed. The evils which led to the public outcry against monopolies and to the final denial of the power to make them may be thus summarily stated: (1) The power which the monopoly gave to the one who enjoyed it, to fix the price and thereby injure the public; (2) The power which it engendered of enabling a limitation on productin; and (3) The danger of deterioration in quality of the monopolized article which it was deemed was the inevitable resultant of the monopolistic control over its production and sale. As monopoly, as thus conceived, embraced only a consequence arising from an exertion of sovereign power, no express restrictions or prohibitions obtained against the creating by an individual of a monopoly as such. But as it was considered, at least, so far as the necessaries of life were concerned, that individuals, by the abuse of their right to contract, might be able to usurp the power arbitrarily to enhance prices (one of the wrongs arising from monopoly), it came to be that laws were passed relating to offenses such as forestalling, regrating, and engrossing by which prohibitions were placed upon the power of individuals to deal under such circumstances and conditions as, according to the conception of the times, created a presumption that the dealings were not simply the honest exertion of one's right to contract for his own benefit, unaccompanied by a wrongful motive to injure others, but were the consequence of a contract or course of dealing of such a character as to give rise to the presumption of an intent to injure others through the means, for instance, of a monopolistic increase of prices. \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 53]\n\u00a0\n This is illustrated by the definition of engrossing found in the statute, 5 and 6 Edw. VI., chap. 14, as follows:\n'Whatsoever person or persons . . . shall engross or get into his or their hands by buying, contracting, or promise-taking, other than by demise, grant, or lease of land, or tithe, any corn growing in the fields, or any other corn or grain, butter, cheese, fish, or other dead victuals whatsoever, within the realm of England, to the intent to sell the same again, shall be accepted, reputed, and taken an unlawful engrosser or engrossers.'\n\n As by the statutes providing against engrossing the quantity engrossed was not required to be the whole or a proximate part of the whole of an article, it is clear that there was a wide difference between monopoly and engrossing, etc. But as the principal wrong which it was deemed would result from monopoly, that is, an enhancement of the price, was the same wrong to which it was thought the prohibited engrossment would give rise, it came to pass that monopoly and engrossing were regarded as virtually one and the same thing. In other words, the prohibited act of engrossing, because of its inevitable accomplishment of one of the evils deemed to be engendered by monopoly, came to be referred to as being a monopoly or constituting an attempt to monopolize. Thus Pollexfen, in his argument in East India Co. v. Sandys, Skinner, 165, 169, said:\n'By common law, he said that trade is free, and for that cited 3 Co. Inst. 181; F. B. 65; Taylors de Ipswich v. Sherring, 1 Rolle, Rep. 4; that the common law is as much against monopoly as engrossing; and that they differ only that a monopoly is by patent from the King, the other is by the act of the subject between party and party; but that the michiefs are the same from both, and there is the same law against both. Darcy v. Allen, F. Moore, 673, 11 Coke, 84. The sole trade of anything is engrossing ex rei natura, for whosoever hath the sale trade of buying and selling hath engrossed that trade; and who- \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 54]\n\u00a0\n soever hath the sole trade to any country hath the sole trade of buying and selling the produce of that country, at his own price, which is an engrossing.'\n\n And by operation of the mental process which led to considering as a monopoly acts which, although they did not constitute a monopoly, were thought to produce some of its baneful effects, so also because of the impediment or burden to the due course of trade which they produced, such acts came to be referred to as in restraint of trade. This is shown by my Lord Coke's definition of monopoly as being 'an institution or allowance . . . whereby any person or persons, bodies politic or corporate, are sought to be restrained of any freedom or liberty that they had before, or hindered in their lawful trade.' It is illustrated also by the definition which Hawkins gives of monopoly wherein it is said that the effect of monopoly is to restrain the citizen 'from the freedom of manufacturing or trading which he had before.' And see especially the opinion of Parker, C. J., in Mitchel v. Reynolds (1711) 1 P. Ws. 181, where a classification is made of monopoly which brings it generically within the description of restraint of trade.\n Generalizing these considerations, the situation is this: 1. That by the common law, monopolies were unlawful because of their restriction upon individual freedom of contract and their injury to the public. 2. That as to necessaries of life, the freedom of the individual to deal was restricted where the nature and character of the dealing was such as to engender the presumption of intent to bring about at least one of the injuries which it was deemed would result from monopoly,-that is, an undue enhancement of price. 3. That to protect the freedom of contract of the individual, not only in his own interest, but principally in the interest of the common weal, a contract of an individual by which he put an unreasonable restraint upon himself as to carrying on his trade or busi- \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 55]\n\u00a0\n ness was void. And that at common law the evils consequent upon engrossing, etc., caused those things to be treated as coming within monopoly and sometimes to be called monopoly, and the same considerations caused monopoly, because of its operation and effect, to be brought within and spoken of generally as impeding the due course of, or being in restraint of, trade.\n From the development of more accurate enonomic conceptions and the changes in conditions of society, it came to be recognized that the acts prohibited by the engrossing, forestalling, etc., statutes did not have the harmful tendency which they were presumed to have when the legislation concerning them was enacted, and therefore did not justify the presumption which had previously been deduced from them, but, on the contrary, such acts tended to fructify and develop trade. See the statutes of 12th George III., chap. 71, enacted in 1772, and statute of 7 and 8 Victoria, chap. 24, enacted in 1844, repealing the prohibitions against engrossing, forestalling, etc., upon the express ground that the prohibited acts had come to be considered as favorable to the development of, and not in restraint of, trade. It is remarkable that nowhere at common law can there be found a prohibition against the creation of monopoly by an individual. This would seem to manifest, either consciously or intuitively, a profound conception as to the inevitable operation of economic forces and the equipoise or balance in favor of the protection of the rights of individuals which resulted. That is to say, as it was deemed that monopoly in the concrete could only arise from an act of sovereign power, and, such sovereign power being restrained, prohibitions as to individuals were directed not against the creation of monopoly, but were only applied to such acts in relation to particular subjects as to which it was deemed, if not restrained, some of the consequences of monopoly might result. After all, this was but an instinctive recognition \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 56]\n\u00a0\n of the truisms that the course of trade could not be made free by obstructing it, and that an individual's right to trade could not be protected by destroying such right.\n From the review just made it clearly results that outside of the restrictions resulting from the want of power in an individual to voluntarily and unreasonably restrain his right to carry on his trade or business, and outside of the want of right to restrain the free course of trade by contracts or acts which implied a wrongful purpose, freedom to contract and to abstain from contracting, and to exercise every reasonable right incident thereto, became the rule in the English law. The scope and effect of this freedom to trade and contract is clearly shown by the decision in Mogul S. S. Co. v. McGregor \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 1891]\n\u00a0\n A. C. 25, 61 L. J. Q. B. N. S. 295, 66 L. T. N. S. 1, 40 Week. Rep. 337, 7 Asp. Mar. L. Cas. 120, 56 J. P. 101. While it is true that the decision of the House of Lords in the case in question was announced shortly after the passage of the anti-trust act, it serves reflexly to show the exact state of the law in England at the time the anti-trust statute was enacted.\n In this country also the acts from which it was deemed there resulted a part, if not all, of the injurious consequences ascribed to monopoly, came to be referred to as a monopoly itself. In other words, here as had been the case in England, practical common sense caused attention to be concentrated centrated not upon the theoretically correct name to be given to the condition or acts which gave rise to a harmful result, but to the result itself and to the remedying of the evils which it produced. The statement just made is illustrated by an early statute of the province of Massachusetts, that is, chap. 31 of the Laws of 1778-1779, by which monopoly and forestalling were expressly treated as one and the same thing.\n It is also true that while the principles concerning contracts in restraint of trade, that is, voluntary restraint put by a person on his right to pursue his calling, hence only operating subjectively, came generally to be recognized \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 57]\n\u00a0\n in accordance with the English rule, it came moreover to pass that contracts or acts which it was considered had a monopolistic tendency, especially those which were thought to unduly diminish competition and hence to enhance prices-in other words, to monopolize-came also in a generic sense to be spoken of and treated as they had been in England, as restricting the due course of trade, and therefore as being in restraint of trade. The dread of monopoly as an emanation of governmental power, while it passed at an early date out of mind in this country, as a result of the structure of our government, did not serve to assuage the fear as to the evil consequences which might arise from the acts of individuals producing or tending to produce the consequences of monopoly. It resulted that treating such acts as we have said as amounting to monopoly, sometimes constitutional restrictions, again legislative enactments or judicial decisions, served to enforce and illustrate the purpose to prevent the occurrence of the evils recognized in the mother country as consequent upon monopoly, by providing against contracts or acts of individuals or combinations of individuals or corporations deemed to be conducive to such results. To refer to the constitutional or legislative provisions on the subject, or the many judicial decisions which illustrate it, would unnecessarily prolong this opinion. We append in the margin a note to treaties, etc., wherein are contained references to constitutional and statutory provisions and to numerous decisions, etc., relating to the subject. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n It will be found that, as modern conditions arose, the trend of legislation and judicial decision came more and more to adapt the recognized restrictions to new manifestations of conduct or of dealing which it was thought \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 58]\n\u00a0\n justified the inference of intent to do the wrong which it had been the purpose to prevent from the beginning. The evolution is clearly pointed out in National Cotton Oil Co. v. Texas, \n197 U.S. 115\n, 49 L. ed. 689, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 379, and Shawnee Compress Co. v. Anderson, \n209 U.S. 423\n, 52 L. ed. 865, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 572; and, indeed, will be found to be illustrated in various aspects by the decisions of this court which have been concerned with the enforcement of the act we are now considering.\n Without going into detail, and but very briefly surveying the whole field, it may be with accuracy said that the dread of enhancement of prices and of other wrongs which it was thought would flow from the undue limitation on competitive conditions caused by contracts or other acts of individuals or corporations led, as a matter of public policy, to the prohibition or treating as illegal all contracts or acts which were unreasonably restrictive of competitive conditions, either from the nature or character of the contract or act, or where the surrounding circumstances were such as to justify the conclusion that they had not been entered into or performed with the legitimate purpose of reasonably forwarding personal interest and developing, trade, but, on the contrary, were of such a character as to give rise to the inference or presumption that they had been entered into or done with the intent to do wrong to the general public and to limit the right of individuals, thus restraining the free flow of commerce and tending to bring about the evils, such as enhancement of prices, which were considered to be against public policy. It is equally true to say that the survey of the legislation in this country on this subject from the beginning will show, depending, as it did, upon the economic conceptions which obtained at the time when the legislation was adopted or judicial decision was rendered, that contracts or acts were at one time deemed to be of such a character as to justify the inference of wrongful intent which were at another period thought not to be \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 59]\n\u00a0\n of that character. But this again, as we have seen, simply followed the line of development of the law of England.\n Let us consider the language of the 1st and 2d sections, guided by the principle that where words are employed in a statute which had at the time a well-known meaning at common law or in the law of this country, they are presumed to have been used in that sense unless the context compels to the contrary. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n As to the 1st section, the words to be interpreted are: 'Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce . . . is hereby declared to be illegal.' As there is no room for dispute that the statute was intended to formulate a rule for the regulation of interstate and foreign commerce, the question is, What was the rule which it adopted?\n In view of the common law and the law in this country as to restraint of trade, which we have reviewed, and the illuminating effect which that history must have under the rule to which we have referred, we think it results:\n a. That the context manifests that the statute was drawn in the light of the existing practical conception of the law of restraint of trade, because it groups as within that class, not only contracts which were in restraint of trade in the subjective sense, but all contracts or acts which theoretically were attempts to monopolize, yet which in practice had come to be considered as in restraint of trade in a broad sense.\n b. That in view of the many new forms of contracts and combinations which were being evolved from existing economic conditions, it was deemed essential by an all-embracing enumeration to make sure that no form of contract or combination by which an undue restraint of \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 60]\n\u00a0\n interstate or foreign commerce was brought about could save such restraint from condemnation. The statute under this view evidenced the intent not to restrain the right to make and enforce contracts, whether resulting from combinations or otherwise, which did not unduly restrain interstate or foreign commerce, but to protect that commerce from being restrained by methods, whether old or new, which would constitute an interference,-that is, an undue restraint.\n c. And as the contracts or acts embraced in the provision were not expressly defined, since the enumeration addressed itself simply to classes of acts, those classes being broad enough to embrace every conceivable contract or combination which could be made concerning trade or commerce or the subjects of such commerce, and thus caused any act done by any of the enumerated methods anywhere in the whole field of human activity to be illegal if in restraint of trade, it inevitably follows that the provision necessarily called for the exercise of judgment which required that some standard should be resorted to for the purpose of determining whether the prohibition contained in the statute had or had not in any given case been violated. Thus not specifying, but indubitably contemplating and requiring a standard, it follows that it was intended that the standard of reason which had been applied at the common law and in this country in dealing with subjects of the character embraced by the statute was intended to be the measure used for the purpose of determining whether, in a given case, a particular act had or had not brought about the wrong against which the statute provided.\n And a consideration of the text of the 2d section serves to establish that it was intended to supplement the 1st, and to make sure that by no possible guise could the public policy embodied in the 1st section be frustrated or evaded. The prohibition of the 2d embrace \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 61]\n\u00a0\n 'every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons to monopolize, any part of the trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations . . . ' By reference to the terms of  8 it is certain that the word 'person' clearly implies a corporation as well as an individual.\n The commerce referred to by the words 'in part,' construed in the light of the manifest purpose of the statute, has both a geographical and a distributive significance; that is, it includes any portion of the United States and any one of the classes of things forming a part of interstate or foreign commerce.'\n Undoubtedly, the words 'to monopolize' and 'monopolize,' as used in the section, reach every act bringing about the prohibited results. The ambiguity, if any, is involved in determining what is intended by monopolize. But this ambiguity is readily dispelled in the light of the previous history of the law of restraint of trade to which we have referred and the indication which it gives of the practical evolution by which monopoly and the acts which produce the same result as monopoly, that is, an undue restraint of the course of trade, all came to be spoken of as, and to be indeed synonymous with, restraint of trade. In other words, having by the 1st section forbidden all means of monopolizing trade, that is, unduly restraining it by means of every contract, combination, etc., the 2d section seeks, if possible, to make the prohibitions of the act all the more complete and perfect by embracing all attempts to reach the end prohibited by the 1st section, that is, restraints of trade, by any attempt to monopolize, or monopolization thereof, even although the acts by which such results are attempted to be brought about or are brought about be not embraced within the general enumeration of the 1st section. And, of course, when the 2d section is thus harmonized with and made, as it \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 62]\n\u00a0\n was intended to be, the complement of the 1st, it becomes obvious that the criteria to be resorted to in any given case for the purpose of ascertaining whether violations of the section have been committed is the rule of reason guided by the established law and by the plain duty to enforce the prohibitions of the act, and thus the public policy which its restrictions were obviously enacted to subserve. And it is worthy of observation, as we have previously remarked concerning the common law, that although the statute, by the comprehensiveness of the enumerations embodied in both the 1st and 2d sections, makes it certain that its purpose was to prevent undue restraints of every kind or nature, nevertheless by the omission of any direct prohibition against monopoly in the concrete, it indicates a consciousness that the freedom of the individual right to contract, when not unduly or improperly exercised, was the most efficient means for the prevention of monopoly, since the operation of the centrifugal and centripetal forces resulting from the right to freely contract was the means by which monopoly would be inevitably prevented if no extraneoous or sovereign power imposed it and no right to make unlawful contracts having a monopolistic tendency were permitted. In other words, that freedom to contract was the essence of freedom from undue restraint on the right to contract.\n Clear as it seems to us is the meaning of the provisions of the statute in the light of the review which we have made, nevertheless, before definitively applying that meaning, it behooves us to consider the contentions urged on one side or the other concerning the meaning of the statute, which, if maintained, would give to it, in some aspects, a much wider and in every view, at least, a somewhat different, significance. And to do this brings us to the second question, which, at the outset, we have stated it was our purpose to consider and dispose of. \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 63]\n\u00a0\n Second. The contentions of the parties as to the meaning of the statute, and the decisions of this court relied upon concerning those contentions.\n In substance, the propositions urged by the government are reducible to this: That the language of the statute embraces every contract, combination, etc., in restraint of trade, and hence its text leaves no room for the exercise of judgment, but simply imposes the plain duty of applying its prohibitions to every case within its literal language. The error involved lies in assuming the matter to be decided. This is true, because, as the acts which may come under the classes stated in the 1st section and the restraint of trade to which that section applies are not specifically enumerated or defined, it is obvious that judgment must in every case be called into play in order to determine whether a particular act is embraced within the statutory classes, and whether, if the act is within such classes, its nature or effect causes it to be a restraint of trade within the intendment of the act. To hold to the contrary would require the conclusion either that every contract, act, or combination of any kind or nature, whether it operated a restraint on trade or not, was within the statute, and thus the statute would be destructive of all right to contract or agree combine in any respect whatever as to subjects embraced in interstate trade or commerce, or, if this conclusion were not reached, then the contention would require it to be held that, as the statute did not define the things to which it related, and excluded resort to the only means by which the acts to which it relates could be ascertained,-the light of reason,-the enforcement of the statute was impossible because of its uncertainty. The merely generic enumeration which the statute makes of the acts to which it refers, and the absence of any definition of restraint of trade as used in the statute, leaves room for but one conclusion, which is, that it was expressly designed not to unduly limit the appli- \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 64]\n\u00a0\n cation of the act by precise definition, but, while clearly fixing a standard, that is, by defining the ulterior boundaries which could not be transgressed with impunity, to leave it to be determined by the light of reason, guided by the principles of law and the duty to apply and enforce the public policy embodied in the statute, in every given case whether any particular act or contract was within the contemplation of the statute.\n But, it is said, persuasive as these views may be, they may not be here applied, because the previous decisions of this court have given to the statute a meaning which expressly excludes the construction which must result from the reasoning stated. The cases are United States v. Trans- Missouri Freight Asso. \n166 U.S. 290\n, 41 L. ed. 1007, 17 Sup. Ct. rep. 540, and United States v. Joint Traffic Asso. \n171 U.S. 505\n, 43 L. ed. 259, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 25. Both the cases involved the legality of combinations or associations of railroads engaged in interstate commerce for the purpose of controlling the conduct of the parties to the association or combination in many particulars. The association or combination was assailed in each case as being in violation of the statute. It was held that they were. It is undoubted that, in the opinion in each case, general language was made use of, which, when separated from its context, would justify the conclusion that it was decided that reason could not be resorted to for the purpose of determining whether the acts complained of were within the statute. It is, however, also true that the nature and character of the contract or agreement in each case was fully referred to, and suggestions as to their unreasonableness pointed out in order to indicate that they were within the prohibitions of the statute. As the cases cannot, by any possible conception, be treated as authoritative without the certitude that reason was resorted to for the purpose of deciding them, it follows as a matter of course that it must have been held by the light of reason, since the conclusion could not have been otherwise reached, that the assailed \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 65]\n\u00a0\n contracts or agreements were within the general enumeration of the statute, and that their operation and effect brought about the restraint of trade which the statute prohibited. This being inevitable, the deduction can in reason only be this: That in the cases relied upon, it having been found that the acts complained of were within the statute, and operated to produce the injuries which the statute forbade, that resort to reason was not permissible in order to allow that to be done which the statute prohibited. This being true, the rulings in the case relied upon, when rightly appreciated, were therefore this, and nothing more: That as considering the contracts and agreements, their necessary effect, and the character of the parties by whom they were made, they were clearly restraints of trade within the purview of the statute, they could not be taken out of that category by indulging in general reasoning as to the expediency or nonexpediency of having made the contracts, or the wisdom or want of wisdom of the statute which prohibited their being made. That is to say, the cases but decided that the nature and character of the contracts, creating, as they did, a conclusive presumption which brought them within the statute, such result was not to be disregarded by the substitution of a judicial appreciation of what the law ought to be for the plain judicial duty of enforcing the law as it was made.\n But aside from reasoning, it is true to say that the cases relied upon do not, when rightly construed, sustain the doctrine contended for, is established by all of the numerous decisions of this court which have applied and enforced the anti-trust act, since they all, in the very nature of things, rest upon the premise that reason was the guide by which the provisions of the act were in every case interpreted. Indeed, intermediate the decision of the two cases, that is, after the decision in the Freight Association Case, and before the decision in the Joint Traffic Case, the case of Hopkins v. United States, \n171 U.S. 578\n, 43 L. ed. 290, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 40, was de- \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 66]\n\u00a0\n cided, the opinion being delivered by Mr. Justice Peckham, who wrote both the opinions in the Freight Association and in the Joint Traffic Cases. And, referring in the Hopkins Case to the broad claim made as to the rule of interpretation announced in the Freight Association Case, it was said ( p. 592): 'To treat as condemned by the act all agreements under which, as a result, the cost of conducting an interstate commercial business may be increased, would enlarge the application of the act far beyond the fair meaning of the language used. There must be some direct and immediate effect upon interstate commerce in order to come within the act.' And in the Joint Traffic Case this statement was expressly reiterated and approved and illustrated by example. Like limitation on the general language used in Freight Association and Joint Traffic Cases is also the clear result of E. Bement & Sons v. National Harrow Co. \n186 \nU.S. 70, 92\n, 46 S. L. ed. 1058, 1069, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 747, and especially of Cincinnati, P. B. S. & P. Packet Co. v. Bay, \n200 U.S. 179\n, 50 L. ed. 428, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 208.\n If the criterion by which it is to be determined in all cases whether every contract, combination, etc., is a restraint of trade within the intendment of the law, is the direct or indirect effect of the acts involved, then of course the rule of reason becomes the guide, and the construction which we have given the statute, instead of being refuted by the cases relied upon, is by those cases demonstrated to be correct. This is true, because the construction which we have deduced from the history of the act and the analysis of its text is simply that in every case where it is claimed that an act or acts are in violation of the statute, the rule of reason, in the light of the principles of law and the public policy which the act embodies, must be applied. From this it follows, since that rule and the result of the test as to direct or indirect, in their ultimate aspect, come to one and the same thing, that the difference between the two is therefore only that which obtains between things which do not differ at all. \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 67]\n\u00a0\n If it be true that there is this identity of result between the rule intended to be applied in the Freight Association Case, that is, the rule of direct and indirect, and the rule of reason which, under the statute as we construe it, should be here applied, it may be asked how was it that, in the opinion in the Freight Association Case, much consideration was given to the subject of whether the agreement or combination which was involved in that case could be taken out of the prohibitions of the statute upon the theory of its reasonableness. The question is pertinent and must be fully and frankly met; for if it be now deemed that the Freight Association Case was mistakenly decided or too broadly stated, the doctrine which it announced should be either expressly overruled or limited.\n The confusion which gives rise to the question results from failing to distinguish between the want of power to take a case which, by its terms or the circumstances which surrounded it, considering among such circumstances the character of the parties, is plainly within the statute, out of the operation of the statute by resort to reason in effect to establish that the contract ought not to be treated as within the statute, and the duty in every case where it becomes necessary from the nature and character of the parties to decide whether it was within the statute, to pass upon that question by the light of reason. This distinction, we think, serves to point out what, in its ultimate conception, was the thought underlying the reference to the rule of reason made in the Freight Association Case,-especially when such reference is interpreted by the context of the opinion and in the light of the subsequent opinion in the Hopkins Case and in Cincinnati, P. B. S. & P. Packet Co. v. Bay.\n And in order not in the slightest degree to be wanting in frankness, we say that in so far, however, as by separating the general language used in the opinions in the Freight Association and Joint Traffic Cases from the con- \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 68]\n\u00a0\n text and the subject and parties with which the cases were concerned, it may be conceived that the language referred to conflicts with the construction which we give the statute, they are necessarily now limited and qualified. We see no possible escape from this conclusion if we are to adhere to the many cases decided in this court in which the anti-trust law has been applied and enforced, and if the duty to apply and enforce that law in the future is to continue to exist. The first is true, because the construction which we now give the statute does not in the slightest degree conflict with a single previous case decided concerning the anti- trust law, aside from the contention as to the Freight Association and Joint Traffic Cases, and because every one of those cases applied the rule of reason for the purpose of determining whether the subject before the court was within the statute. The second is also true, since, as we have already pointed out, unaided by the light of reason it is impossible to understand how the statute may in the future be enforced and the public policy which it establishes be made efficacious.\n So far as the objections of the appellants are concerned, they are all embraced under two headings:--\n a. That the act, even if the averments of the bill be true, cannot be constitutionally applied, because to do so would extend the power of Congress to subjects dehors the reach of its authority to regulate commerce, by enabling that body to deal with mere questions of production of commodities within the states. But all the structure upon which this argument proceeds is based upon the decision in United States v. E. C. Knight Co. \n156 U.S. 1\n, 39 L. ed. 325, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 249. The view, however, which the argument takes of that case, and the arguments based upon that view, have been so repeatedly pressed upon this court in connection with the interpretation and enforcement of the anti-trust act, and have been so necessarily and expressly decided to be unsound, as to cause the contentions to be plainly foreclosed and to require no ex- \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 69]\n\u00a0\n press notice. Northern Securities Co. v. United States, \n193 U.S. 334\n, 48 L. ed. 699, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 436; Loewe v. Lawler, \n208 U.S. 274\n, 52 L. ed. 488, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 301, 13 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 815; Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 U.S. 375\n, 49 L. ed. 518, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 276; W. W. Montague & Co. v. Lowry, \n193 U.S. 38\n, 48 L. ed. 608, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 307; Shawnee Compress Co. v. Anderson, \n209 U.S. 423\n, 52 L. ed. 865, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 572.\n b. Many arguments are pressed in various forms of statement which in substance amount to contending that the statute cannot be applied under the facts of this case without impairing rights of property and destroying the freedom of contract or trade which is essentially necessary to the well-being of society, and which, it is insisted, is protected by the constitutional guaranty of due process of law. But the ultimate foundation of all these arguments is the assumption that reason may not be resorted to in interpreting and applying the statute, and therefore that the statute unreasonably restricts the right to contract, and unreasonably operates upon the right to acquire and hold property. As the premise is demonstrated to be unsound by the construction we have given the statute, of course the propositions which rest upon that premise need not be further noticed.\n So far as the arguments proceed upon the conception that, in view of the generality of the statute, it is not susceptible of being enforced by the courts because it cannot be carried out without a judicial exertion of legislative power, they are clearly unsound. The statute certainly generically enumerates the character of acts which it prohibits and the wrong which it was intended to prevent. The propositions therefore insist that, consistently with the fundamental principles of due process of law, it never can be left to the judiciary to decide whether, in a given case, particular acts come within a generic statutory provision. But to reduce the propositions, however, to this, their final meaning, makes it clear that in substance they deny the existence of essential legislative authority, and challenge the right of the judiciary to perform duties which that department of the government has exerted from \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 70]\n\u00a0\n the beginning. This is so clear as to require no elaboration. Yet, let us demonstrate that which needs no demonstration, by a few obvious examples. Take, for instance, the familiar cases where the judiciary is called upon to determine whether a particular act or acts are within a given prohibition, depending upon wrongful intent. Take questions of fraud. Consider the power which must be exercised in every case where the courts are called upon to determine whether particular acts are invalid which are, abstractly speaking, in and of themselves valid, but which are asserted to be invalid because of their direct effect upon interestate commerce.\n We come, then, to the third proposition requiring consideration, viz.:\n Third. The facts and the application of the statute to them.\n Beyond dispute the proofs establish substantially as alleged in the bill the following facts:\n\n 1. \nThe creation of the Standard Oil Company of Ohio.\n\n 2. \nThe organization of the Standard Oil Trust of 1882, and also a previous one of 1879, not referred to in the bill, and the proceedings in the supreme court of Ohio, culminating in a decree based upon the finding that the company was unlawfully a party to that trust; the transfer by the trustees of stocks in certain of the companies; the contempt proceedings; and, finally, the increase of the capital of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and the acquisition by that company of the shares of the stock of the other corporations in exchange for its certificates.\n The vast amount of property and the possibilities of far-reaching control which resulted from the facts last stated are shown by the statement which we have previously annexed concerning the parties to the trust agreement of 1882, and the corporations whose stock was held by the trustees under the trust, and which came therefore to be held by the New Jersey corporation. But these statements do not with accuracy convey an appreciation of the \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 71]\n\u00a0\n situation as it existed at the time of the entry of the decree below, since, during the more than ten years which elapsed between the acquiring by the New Jersey corporation of the stock and other property which was formerly held by the trustees under the trust agreement, the situation, of course, had somewhat changed,-a change which, when analyzed in the light of the proof, we think establishes that the result of enlarging the capital stock of the New Jersey company and giving it the vast power to which we have referred produced its normal consequence; that is, it gave to the corporation, despite enormous dividends and despite the dropping out of dertain corporations enumerated in the decree of the court below, an enlarged and more perfect sway and control over the trade and commerce in petroleum and its products. The ultimate situation referred to will be made manifest by an examination of  2 and 4 of the decree below, which are excerpted in the margin. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[221 U.S. 1, 72]\n\u00a0\n Giving to the facts just stated the weight which it was deemed they were entitled to, in the light afforded by the\n Colonial Oil Company 250,000 249,300 Continental Oil Company 300,000 300,000 Crescent Pipe Line Company 3,000,000 3,000,000 Eureka Pipe Line Company 5,000,000 4,999,400 Galena-Signal Oil Company 10,000,000 7,079,500 Indiana Pipe Line Company 1,000,000 999,700 Lawrence Natural Gas Company 450,000 450,000 Mahoning Gas Fuel Company 150,000 149,900 Mountain State Gas Company 500,000 500,000 National Transit Company 25,455,200 25,451,650 New York Transit Company 5,000,000 5,000,000 Northern Pipe Line Company 4,000,000 4,000,000 Northwestern Ohio Natural Gas Company 2,775,250 1,649,450 Ohio Oil Company 10,000,000 9,999,850 People's Natural Gas Company 1,000,000 1,000,000 Pittsburg Natural Gas Company 310,000 310,000 Solar Refining Company 500,000 499,400 Southern Pipe Line Company 10,000,000 10,000,000 South Penn Oil Company 2,500,000 2,500,000 Southwest Pennsylavania Pipe Lines 3,500,000 3,500,000 Standard Oil Company (of California) 17,000,000 16,999,500 Standard Oil Company (of Indiana) 1,000,000 999,000 Standard Oil Company (of Iowa) 1,000,000 1,000,000 Standard Oil Company (of Kansas) 1,000,000 999,300 Standard Oil Company (of Kentucky) 1,000,000 997,200 Standard Oil Company (of Nebraska) 600,000 599,500 Standard Oil Company of New York 15,000,000 15,000,000 Standard Oil Company (of Ohio) 3,500,000 3,499,400 Swan & Finch Company 100,000 100,000 Union Tank Line Company 3,500,000 3,499,400 Vacuum Oil Company 2,500,000 2,500,000 Washington Oil Company 100,000 71,480 Waters-Pierce Oil Company 400,000 274,700\n That the defendant National Transit Company, which is owned and controlled by the Standard Oil Company as aforesaid, owns and controls the amounts of the capital stocks of the following-named corporations and limited partnerships stated opposite each, respectively, as follows: Total Owned by Name of company. capital National stock.

Because the unification of power and control over petroleum and its products which was the inevitable result of the combining in the New Jersey corporation by the increase of its stock and the transfer to it of the stocks of so many other corporations, aggregating so vast a capital, gives rise, in and of itself, in the absence of countervailing circumstances, to say the least, to the prima facie presumption of intent and purpose to maintain the dominancy over the oil industry, not as a result of normal methods of industrial development, but by new means of combination which were resorted to in order that greater power might be added than would otherwise have arisen had normal methods been followed, the whole with the purpose of excluding others from the trade, and thus centralizing in the combination a perpetual control of the movements of petroleum and its products in the channels of interstate commerce.\n b. Because the prima facie presumption of intent to restrain trade, to monopolize and to bring about monopolization, resulting from the act of expanding the stock of the New Jersey corporation and vesting it with such vast control of the oil industry, is made conclusive by considering (1) the conduct of the persons or corporations who were mainly instrumental in bringing about the extension of power in the New Jersey corporation before the consummation of that result and prior to the formation of the trust agreements of 1879 and 1882; (2) by considering the proof as to what was done under those agreements and the acts which immediately preceded the vesting of power in the New Jersey corporation, as well as by weighing the modes in which the power vested in that corporation has been exerted and the results which have arisen from it.\n Recurring to the acts done by the individuals or corporations who were mainly instrumental in bringing about the \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 76]\n\u00a0\n expansion of the New Jersey corporation during the period prior to the formation of the trust agreements of 1879 and 1882, including those agreements, not for the purpose of weighing the substantial merit of the numerous charges of wrongdoing made during such period, but solely as an aid for discovering intent and purpose, we think no disinterested mind can survey the period in question without being irresistibly driven to the conclusion that the very genius for commercial development and organization which it would seem was manifested from the beginning soon begot and intent and purpose to exclude others which was frequently manifested by acts and dealings wholly inconsistent with the theory that they were made with the single conception of advancing the development of business power by usual methods, but which, on the contrary, necessarily involved the intent to drive others from the field and to exclude them from their right to trade, and thus accomplish the mastery which was the end in view. And, considering the period from the date of the trust agreements of 1879 and 1882, up to the time of the expansion of the New Jersey corporation, the gradual extension of the power over the commerce in oil which ensued, the decision of the supreme court of Ohio, the tardiness or reluctance in conforming to the commands of that decision, the methods first adopted and that which finally culminated in the plan of the New Jersey corporation, all additionally serve to make manifest the continued existence of the intent which we have previously indicated, and which, among other things, impelled the expansion of the New Jersey corporation. The exercise of the power which resulted from that organization fortifies the foregoing conclusions, since the development which came, the acquisition here and there which ensued of every efficient means by which competition could have been asserted, the slow but resistless methods which followed by which means of transportation were absorbed and brought under control, \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 77]\n\u00a0\n the system of marketing which was adopted by which the country was divided into districts and the trade in each district in oil was turned over to a designated corporation within the combination, and all others were excluded, all lead the mind up to a conviction of a purpose and intent which we think is so certain as practically to cause the subject not to be within the domain of reasonable contention.\n The inference that no attempt to monopolize could have been intended, and that no monopolization resulted from the acts complained of, since it is established that a very small percentage of the crude oil produced was controlled by the combination, in unwarranted. As substantial power over the crude product was the inevitable result of the absolute control which existed over the refined product, the monopolization of the one carried with it the power to control the other; and if the inferences which this situation suggests were developed, which we deem it unnecessary to do, they might well serve to add additional cogency to the presumption of intent to monopolize which we have found arises from the unquestioned proof on other subjects.\n We are thus brought to the last subject which we are called upon to consider, viz.:\n Fourth. The remedy to be administered.\n It may be conceded that ordinarily where it was found that acts had been done in violation of the statute, adequate measure of relief would result from restraining the doing of such acts in the future. Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 U.S. 375\n, 49 L. ed. 518, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 276. But in a case like this, where the condition which has been brought about in violation of the statute, in and of itself is not only a continued attempt to monopolize, but also a monopolization, the duty to enforce the statute requires the application of broader and more controlling remedies. As penalties which are not authorized by law may not be inflicted by judicial authority, it follows that to meet the situation with which we are confronted \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 78]\n\u00a0\n the application of remedies two-fold in character becomes essential: 1st. To forbid the doing in the future of acts like those which we have found to have been done in the past which would be violative of the statute. 2d. The exertion of such measure of relief as will effectually dissolve the combination found to exist in violation of the statute, and thus neutralize the extension and continually operating force which the possession of the power unlawfully obtained has brought and will continue to bring about.\n In applying remedies for this purpose, however, the fact must not be overlooked that injury to the public by the prevention of an undue restraint on, or the monopolization of, trade or commerce, is the foundation upon which the prohibitions of the statute rest, and moreover that one of the fundamental purposes of the statute is to protect, not to destroy, rights of property.\n Let us, then, as a means of accurately determining what relief we are to afford, first come to consider what relief was afforded by the court below, in order to fix how far it is necessary to take from or add to that relief, to the end that the prohibitions of the statute may have complete and operative force.\n The court below, by virtue of  1, 2, and 4 of its decree, which we have in part previously excerpted in the margin, adjudged that the New Jersey corporation, in so far as it held the stock of the various corporations recited in  2 and 4 of the decree, or controlled the same, was a combination in violation of the 1st section of the act, and an attempt to monopolize or a monopolization contrary to the 2d section of the act. It commanded the dissolution of the combination, and therefore in effect directed the transfer by the New Jersey corporation back to the stockholders of the various subsidiary corporations entitled to the same of the stock which had been turned over to the New Jersey company in exchange for its stock. To \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 79]\n\u00a0\n make this command effective,  5 of the decree forbade the New Jersey corporation from in any form or manner exercising any ownership or exerting any power directly or indirectly in virtue of its apparent title to the stocks of the subsidiary corporations, and prohibited those subsidiary corporations from paying any dividends to the New Jersey corporations, or doing any act which would recognize further power in that company, except to the extent that it was necessary to enable that company to transfer the stock. So far as the owners of the stock of the subsidiary corporations and the corporations themselves were concerned after the stock had been transferred,  6 of the decree enjoined them from in any way conspiring or combining to violate the act, or to monopolize or attempt to monopolize in virtue of their ownership of the stock transferred to them, and prohibited all agreements between the subsidiary corporations or other stockholders in the future, tending to produce or bring about further violations of the act.\n By  7, pending the accomplishment of the dissolution of the combination by the transfer of stock, and until it was consummated, the defendants named in  1, constituting all the corporations to which we have referred, were enjoined from engaging in or carrying on interstate commerce. And by  9, among other things, a delay of thirty days was granted for the carrying into effect of the directions of the decree.\n So far as the decree held that the ownership of the stock of the New Jersey corporation constituted a combination in violation of the 1st section and an attempt to create a monopoly or to monopolize under the 2d section, and commanded the dissolution of the combination, the decree was clearly appropriate. And this also is true of  5 of the decree, which restrained both the New Jersey corporation and the subsidiary corporations from doing anything which would recognize or give effect to further ownership \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 80]\n\u00a0\n in the New Jersey corporation of the stocks which were ordered to be retransferred.\n But the contention is that, in so far as the relief by way of injunction which was awarded by  6 against the stockholders of the subsidiary corporations or the subsidiary corporations themselves after the transfer of stock by the New Jersey corporation was completed in conformity to the decree, that the relief awarded was too broad: a. Because it was not sufficiently specific, and tended to cause those who were within the embrace of the order to cease to be under the protection of the law of the land and required them to thereafter conduct their business under the jeopardy of punishments for contempt for violating a general injunction. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n200 U.S. 404\n, 50 L. ed. 526, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 272. Besides it is said that the restraint imposed by  6-even putting out of view the consideration just stated-was, moverover, calculated to do injury to the public, and it may be in and of itself to produce the very restraint on the due course of trade which it was intended to prevent. We say this since it does not necessarily follow because an illegal restraint of trade or an attempt to monopolize or a monopolization resulted from the combination and the transfer of the stocks of the subsidiary corporations to the New Jersey corporation that a like restraint or attempt to monopolize or monopolization would necessarily arise from agreements between one or more of the subsidiary corporations after the transfer of the stock by the New Jersey corporation. For illustration, take the pipe lines. By the effect of the transfer of the stock, the pipe lines would come under the control of various corporations instead of being subjected to a uniform control. If various corporations owning the lines determined in the public interests to so combine as to make a continuous line, such agreement or combination would not be repugnant to the act, and yet it might be restrained by the decree. As another example, take the \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 81]\n\u00a0\n Union Tank Line Company, one of the subsidiary corporations, the owner practically of all the tank cars in use by the combination. If no possibility existed of agreements for the distribution of these cars among the subsidiary corporations, the most serious detriment to the public interest might result. Conceding the merit, abstractly considered, of these contentions, they are irrelevant. We so think, since we construe the sixth paragraph of the decree, not as depriving the stockholders or the corporations, after the dissolution of the combination, of the power to make normal and lawful contracts or agreements, but as restraining them from, by any device whatever, recreating, directly or indirectly, the illegal combination which the decree dissolved. In other words, we construe the sixth paragraph of the decree, not as depriving the stockholders or corporations of the right to live under the law of the land, but as compelling obedience to that law. As therefore the sixth paragraph as thus construed is not amenable to the criticism directed against it and cannot produce the harmful results which the arguments suggest, it was obviously right. We think that, in view of the magnitude of the interests involved and their complexity, the delay of thirty days allowed for executing the decree was too short and should be extended so as to embrace a period of at least six months. So also, in view of the possible serious injury to result to the public from an absolute cessation of interstate commerce in petroleum and its products by such vast agencies as are embraced in the combination, a result which might arise from that portion of the decree which enjoined carrying on of interstate commerce not only by the New Jersey corporation, but by all the subsidiary companies, until the dissolution of the combination by the transfer of the stocks in accordance with the decree, should not have been awarded.\n Our conclusion is that the decree below was right and \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 82]\n\u00a0\n should be affirmed, except as to the minor matters concerning which we have indicated the decree should be modified. Our order will therefore be one of affirmance, with directions, however, to modify the decree in accordance with this opinion. The court below to retain jurisdiction to the extent necessary to compel compliance in every respect with its decree.\n And it is so ordered.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n A sense of duty constrains me to express the objections which I have to certain declarations in the opinion just delivered on behalf of the court.\n I concur in holding that the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and its subsidiary companies constitute a combination in restraint of interstate commerce, and that they have attempted to monopolize and have monopolized parts of such commerce,-all in violation of what is known as the anti-trust act of 1890. 26 Stat. at L. 209, chap. 647, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3200. The evidence in this case overwhelmingly sustained that view and led the circuit court, by its final decree, to order the dissolution of the New Jersey corporation and the discontinuance of the illegal combination between that corporation and its subsidiary companies.\n In my judgment, the decree below should have been affirmed without qualification. But the court, while affirming the decree, directs some modifications in respect of what it characterizes as 'minor matters.' It is to be apprehended that those modifications may prove to be mischievous. In saying this, I have particularly in view the statement in the opinion that 'it does not necessarily follow because an illegal restraint of trade or an attempt to monopolize or a monopolization resulted from the combination and the transfer of the stocks of the subsidiary corporations to the New Jersey corporation \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 83]\n\u00a0\n that a like restraint of trade or attempt to monopolize or monopolization would necessarily arise from agreements between one or more of the subsidiary corporations after the transfer of the stock by the New Jersey corporation.' Taking this language, in connection with other parts of the opinion, the subsidiary companies are thus, in effect, informed-unwisely, I think-that although the New Jersey corporation, being and illegal combination, must go out of existence, they may join in an agreement to restrain commerce among the states if such restraint be not 'undue.'\n In order that my objections to certain parts of the court's opinion may distinctly appear, I must state the circumstances under which Congress passed the anti-trust act, and trace the course of judicial decisions as to its meaning and scope. This is the more necessary because the court by its decision, when interpreted by the language of its opinion, has not only upset the long-settled interpretation of the act, but has usurped the constitutional functions of the legislative branch of the government. With all due respect for the opinions of others, I feel bound to say that what the court has said may well cause some alarm for the integrity of our institutions. Let us see how the matter stands.\n All who recall the condition of the country in 1890 will remember that there was everywhere, among the people generally, a deep feeling of unrest. The nation had been rid of human slavery,-fortunately, as all now feel,-but the conviction was universal that the country was in real danger from another kind of slavery sought to be fastened on the American people; namely, the slavery that would result from aggregations of capital in the hands of a few individuals and corporations controlling, for their own profit and advantage exclusively, the entire business of the country, including the production and sale of the necessaries of life. Such a danger was thought to be then \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 84]\n\u00a0\n mminent, and all felt that it must be met firmly and by such statutory regulations as would adequately protect the people against oppression and wrong. Congress therefore took up the matter and gave the whole subject the fullest consideration. All agreed that the national government could not, by legislation, regulate the domestic trade carried on wholly within the several states; for power to regulate such trade remained with, because never surrendered by, the states. But, under authority expressly granted to it by the Constitution, Congress could regulate commerce among the several states and with foreign states. Its authority to regulate such commerce was and is paramount, due force being given to other provisions of the fundamental law, devised by the fathers for the safety of the government and for the protection and security of the essential rights inhering in life, liberty, and property.\n Guided by these considerations, and to the end that the people, so far as interstate commerce was concerned, might not be dominated by vast combinations and monopolies, having power to advance their own selfish ends, regardless of the general interests and welfare, Congress passed the anti-trust act of 1890 in these words (the italics here and elsewhere in this opinion are mine):\n' 1. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any such contract or engage in any such combination or conspiracy shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court.  2. Every person who shall monopolize or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 85]\n\u00a0\n to monopolize, any part of the trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court.  3. Every contract, combination in form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce in any territory of the United States or of the District of Columbia, or in restraint of trade or commerce between any such territory and another, or between any such territory or territories and any state or states or the District of Columbia, or with foreign nations, or between the District of Columbia and any state or states or foreign nations, is hereby declared illegal. Every person who shall make any such contract or engage in any such combination or conspiracy shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court.' 26 Stat. at L. 209, chap. 647, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3200.\n\n The important inquiry in the present case is as to the meaning and scope of that act in its application to interstate commerce.\n In 1896 this court had occasion to determine the meaning and scope of the act in an important case known as the Trans-Missouri Freight Case, \n166 U.S. 290\n, 41 L. ed. 1007, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 540. The question there was as to the validity under the antitrust act of a certain agreement between numerous railroad companies, whereby they formed an association for the purpose of establishing and maintaining rates, rules, and regulations in respect of freight traffic over specified routes. Two questions were involved: first, whether the act applied to railroad carriers; second, whether the agreement which was the basis of the suit which the United States brought to have the agreement annulled was illegal. The court \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 86]\n\u00a0\n held that railroad carriers were embraced by the act. In determining that question, the court, among other things, said:\n'The language of the act includes every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations. So far as the very terms of the statute go, they apply to any contract of the nature described. A contract, therefore, that is in restraint of trade or commerce, is, by the strict language of the act, prohibited, even though such contract is entered into between competing common carriers by railroad, and only for the purposes of thereby affecting traffic rates for the transportation of persons and property. If such an agreement restrains trade or commerce, it is prohibited by the statute, unless it can be said that an agreement, no matter what its terms, relating only to transportation, cannot restrain trade or commerce. We see no escape from the conclusion that if an agreement of such a nature does restrain it, the agreement is condemned by this act. . . . Nor is it for the substantial interests of the country that any one commodity should be within the sole power and subject to the sole will of one powerful combination of capital. Congress has, so far as its jurisdiction extends, prohibited all contracts or combinations in the form of trusts entered into for the purpose or restraining trade and commerce. . . . While the statute prohibits all combinations in the form of trusts or otherwise, the limitation is not confined to that form alone. All combinations which are in restraint of trade or commerce are prohibited, whether in the form of trusts or in any other form whatever.' \n166 \nU.S. 290, 312\n, 324 S., 326.\n\n The court then proceeded to consider the second of the above questions, saying: 'The next question to be discussed is as to what is the true construction of the statute, \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 87]\n\u00a0\n assuming that it applies to common carriers by railroad. What is the meaning of the language as used in the statute, that 'every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal?' Is it confined to a contract or combination which is only in unreasonable restraint of trade or commerce, or does it include what the language of the act plainly and in terms covers,-all contracts of that nature? . . . It is now with much amplification of argument urged that the statute, in declaring illegal every combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce, does not mean what the language used therein plainly imports, but that it only means to declare illegal any such contract which is in unreasonable restraint of trade, while leaving all others unaffected by the provisions of the act; that the common-law meaning of the term 'contract in restraint of trade' includes only such contracts as are in unreasonable restraint of trade; and when that term is used in the Federal statute it is not intended to include all contracts in restraint of trade, but only those which are in unreasonable restraint thereof. . . . By the simple use of the term 'contract in restraint of trade,' all contracts of that nature, whether valid or otherwise would be included, and not alone that kind of contract which was invalid and unenforceable as being in unreasonalbe restraint of trade. When, therefore, the body of an act pronounces as illegal every contract or combination in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states, etc., the plain and ordinary meaning of such language is not limited to that kind of contract alone which is in unreasonable restraint of trade, but all contracts are included in such language, and no exception or limitation can be added without placing in the act that which has been omitted by Congress. . . . If only that kind of contract \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 88]\n\u00a0\n which is in unreasonable restraint of trade be within the meaning of the statute, and declared therein to be illegal, it is at once apparent that the subject of what is a reasonable rate is attended with great uncertainty. . . . To say, therefore, that the act excludes agreements which are not in unreasonable restraint of trade, and which tend simply to keep up reasonable rates for transportation, is substantially to leave the question of reasonableness to the companies themselves. . . . But assuming that agreements of this nature are not void at common law, and that the various cases cited by the learned courts below show it, the answer to the statement of their validity now is to be found in the terms of the statute under consideration. . . . The arguments which have been addressed to us against the inclusion of all contracts in restraint of trade, as provided for by the language of the act, have been based upon the alleged presumption that Congress notwithstanding the language of the act, could not have intended to embrace all contracts, but only such contracts as were in unreasonable restraint of trade. Under these circumstances we are, therefore, asked to hold that the act of Congress excepts contracts which are not in unreasonable restraint of trade, and which only keep rates up to a reasonable price, notwithstanding the language of the act makes no such exception. In other words, we are asked to read into the act by way of judicial legislation an exception that is not placed there by the lawmaking branch of the government, and this is to be done upon the theory that the impolicy of such legislation is so clear that it cannot be supposed Congress intended the natural import of the language it used. This we cannot and ought not to do. . . .\n'If the act ought to read, as contended for by defendants, Congress is the body to amend it, and not this court, by a process of judicial legislation wholly unjustifiable. Large numbers do not agree that the view taken by defendants \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 89]\n\u00a0\n is sound or true in substance, and Congress may and very probably did share in that belief in passing the act. The public policy of the government is to be found in its statutes, and when they have not directly spoken, then in the decisions of the courts and the constant practice of the government officials; but when the lawmaking power speaks upon a particular subject, over which it has constitutional power to legislate, public policy in such a case is what the statute enacts. If the law prohibit any contract or combination in restraint of trade or commerce, a contract or combination made in violation of such law is void, whatever may have been theretofore decided by the courts to have been the public policy of the county on that subject. The conclusion which we have drawn from the examination above made into the question before us is that the anti-trust act applies to railroads, and that it renders illegal all agreements which are in restraint of trade or commerce as we have above defined that expression, and the question then arises whether the agreement before us is of that nature.'\n\n I have made these extended extracts from the opinion of the court in the Trans-Missouri Freight Case in order to show beyond question that the point was there urged by counsel that the anti-trust act condemned only contracts, combinations, trusts, and conspiracies that were in unreasonable restraint of interstate commerce, and that the court in clear and decisive language met that point. It adjudged that Congress had in unequivocal words declared that 'every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of commerce among the several states,' shall be illegal, and that no distinction, so far as interstate commerce was concerned, was to be tolerated between restraints of such commerce as were undue or unreasonable, and restraints that were due or reasonable. With full knowledge of the then condition of the country and of its business, Congress deter- \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 90]\n\u00a0\n mined to meet, and did meet, the situation by an absolute, statutory prohibition of 'every contract, combination in the form of trusts or otherwise, in restraint of trade or commerce.' Still more; in response to the suggestion by able counsel that Congress intended only to strike down such contracts, combinations, and monopolies as unreasonably restrained interstate commerce, this court, in words too clear to be misunderstood, said that to so hold was 'to read into the act by way of judicial legislation, an exception not placed there by the lawmaking branch of the government.' 'This,' the court said, as we have seen, 'we cannot and ought not to do.'\n It thus appears that fifteen years ago, when the purpose of Congress in passing the anti-trust act was fresh in the minds of courts, lawyers, statesmen, and the general public, this court expressly declined to indulge in judicial legislation, by inserting in the act the word 'unreasonable' or any other word of like import. It may be stated here that the country at large accepted this view of the act, and the Federal courts throughout the entire country enforced its provisions according to the interpretation given in the Freight Association Case. What, then, was to be done by those who questioned the soundness of the interpretation placed on the act by this court in that case? As the court had decided that to insert the word 'unreasonable' in the act would be 'judicial legislation' on its part, the only alternative left to those who opposed the decision in that case was to induce Congress to so amend the act as to recognize the right to restrain interstate commerce to a reasonable extent. The public press, magazines, and law journals, the debates in Congress, speeches and addresses by public men and jurists, all contain abundant evidence of the general understanding that the meaning, extent, and scope of the anti-trust act had been judicially determined by this court, and that the only question remaining open for discussion was the \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 91]\n\u00a0\n wisdom of the policy declared by the act,-a matter that was exclusively within the cognizance of Congress. But at every session of Congress since the decision of 1896, the lawmaking branch of the government, with full knowledge of that decision, has refused to change the policy it had declared, or to so amend the act of 1990 as to except from its operation contracts, combinations, and trusts that reasonably restrain interstate commerce.\n But those who were in combinations that were illegal did not despair. They at once set up the baseless claim that the decision of 1896 disturbed the 'business interests of the country,' and let it be known that they would never be content until the rule was established that would permit interstate commerce to be subjected to reasonable restraints. Finally, an opportunity came again to raise the same question which this court had, upon full consideration, determined in 1896. I now allude to the case of United States v. Joint Traffic Asso. \n171 U.S. 505\n, 43 L. ed. 259, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 25, decided in 1898. What was that case?\n It was a suit by the United States against more than thirty railroad companies, to have the court declare illegal, under the anti-trust act, a certain agreement between these companies. The relief asked was denied in the subordinate Federal courts and the government brought the case here.\n It is important to state the points urged in that case by the defendant companies charged with violating the anti-trust act, and to show that the court promptly met them. To that end I make a copious extract from the opinion in the Joint Traffic Case. Among other things, the court said: 'Upon comparing that agreement [the one in the Joint Traffic Case, then under consideration (\n171 U.S. 505\n)] with the one set forth in the case of United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Asso. \n166 U.S. 290\n, 41 L. ed. 1007, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 540, the great similarity between them suggests that a similar result should be reached in the two cases.' (P. 558.) \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 92]\n\u00a0\n Learned counsel in the Joint Traffic Case urged a reconsideration of the question decided in the Trans-Missouri Case, contending that 'the decision in that case [the Trans-Missouri Freight Case] is quite plainly erroneous, and the consequences of such error are farreaching and disastrous, and clearly at war with justice and sound policy, and the construction placed upon the anti-trust statute has been received by the public with surprise and alarm.' They suggested that the point made in the Joint Traffic Case as to the meaning and scope of the act might have been, but was not, made in the previous case. The court said (\n171 U.S. 559\n) that 'the report of the Trans-Missouri Case clearly shows not only that the point now taken was there urged upon the attention of the court, but it was then intentionally and necessarily decided.'\n The question whether the court should again consider the point decided in the Trans-Missouri Case was disposed of in the most decisive language, as follows: 'Finally, we are asked to reconsider the question decided in the Trans-Missouri Case, and to retrace the steps taken therein, because of the plain error contained in that decision and the widespread alarm with which it was received, and the serious consequences which have resulted, or may soon result, from the law as interpreted in that case. It is proper to remark that an application for a reconsideration of a question but lately decided by this court is usually based upon a statement that some of the arguments employed on the original hearing of the question have been overlooked or misunderstood, or that some controlling authority has been either misapplied by the court or passed over without discussion or notice. While this is not strictly an application for a rehearing in the same case, yet in substance it is the same thing. The court is asked to reconsider a question but just decided after a careful investigation of the matter involved. There have heretofore been in effect two arguments of precisely the same \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 93]\n\u00a0\n questions now before the court, and the same arguments were addressed to us on both those occasions. The report of the Trans-Missouri Case shows a dissenting opinion delivered in that case, and that the opinion was concurred in by three other members of the court. That opinion, it will be seen, gives with great force and ability the arguments against the decision which was finally arrived at by the court. It was after a full discussion of the questions involved, and with the knowledge of the views entertained by the minority, as expressed in the dissenting opinion, that the majority of the court came to the conclusion it did. Soon after the decision a petition for a rehearing of the case was made, supported by a printed argument in its favor, and pressed with an earnestness and vigor and at a length which were certainly commensurate with the importance of the case. This court, with care and deliberation and also with a full appreciation of their importance, again considered the questions involved in its former decision. A majority of the court once more arrived at the conclusion it had first announced, and accordingly it denied the application. And now for the third time the same arguments are employed, and the court is again asked to recant its former opinion, and to decide the same question in direct opposition to the conclusion arrived at in the Trans-Missouri Case. The learned counsel, while making the application, frankly confess that the argument in opposition to the decision in the case above named has been so fully, so clearly, and so forcibly presented in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice White [in the Freight Case] that it is hardly possible to add to it, nor is it necessary to repeat it. The fact that there was so close a division of opinion in this court when the matter was first under advisement, together with the different views taken by some of the judges of the lower courts, led us to the most careful and scrutinizing examination of the arguments advanced by both sides, and it was after such an examination that the majority of \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 94]\n\u00a0\n the court came to the conclusion it did. It is not now alleged that the court on the former occasion overlooked any argument for the respondents or misapplied any controlling authority. It is simply insisted that the court, notwithstanding the arguments for an opposite view, arrived at an erroneous result, which, for reasons already stated, ought to be reconsidered and reversed. As we have twice already deliberately and earnestly considered the same arguments which are now for a third time pressed upon our attention, it could hardly be expected that our opinion should now change from that already expressed.'\n These utterances, taken in connection with what was previously said in the Trans-Missouri Freight Case, show so clearly and affirmatively as to admit of no doubt that this court, many years ago, upon the fullest consideration, interpreted the antitrust act as prohibiting and making illegal not only every contract or combination, in whatever form, which was in restraint of interstate commerce, without regard to its reasonableness or unreasonableness, but all monopolies or attempt to monopolize 'any part' of such trade or commerce. Let me refer to a few other cases in which the scope of the decision in the Freight Association Case was referred to: In E. Bement & Sons v. National Harrow Co. \n186 \nU.S. 70, 92\n, 46 S. L. ed. 1058, 1069, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 747, the court said: 'It is true that it has been held by this court that the act (anti-trust act) included any restraint of commerce, whether reasonable or unreasonable,'- citing United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Asso. \n166 U.S. 290\n, 41 L. ed. 1007, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 540; United States v. Joint Traffic Asso. \n171 U.S. 505\n, 43 L. ed. 259, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 25; Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, \n175 U.S. 211\n, 44 L. ed. 136, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 96. In W. Y. Montague & Co. v. Lowry, \n193 \nU.S. 38, 46\n, 48 S. L. ed. 608, 611, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 307, which involved the validity, under the anti-trust act, of a certain association formed for the sale of tiles, mantels, and grates, the court, referring to the contention that the sale of tiles in San Francisco was so small 'as to be a negligible quantity,' held that the association was nevertheless a conbination in restraint of interstate trade or com- \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 95]\n\u00a0\n merce, in violation of the anti-trust act. In Loewe v. Lawlor, \n208 \nU.S. 274, 297\n, 52 S. L. ed. 488, 498, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 301, 13 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 815, all the members of this court concurred in saying that the Trans- Missouri, Joint Traffic, and Northern Securities [\n193 U.S. 197\n, 48 L. ed. 679, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 436] Cases 'hold in effect that the anti-trust law has a broader application than the prohibition of restraints of trade unlawful at common law.' In Shawnee Compress Co. v. Anderson (1908) \n209 \nU.S. 423, 432\n, 52 S. L. ed. 865, 874, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 572, all the members of the court again concurred in declaring that 'it has been decided that not only unreasonable but all direct restraints of trade are prohibited, the law being thereby distinguished from the common law.' In United States v. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. 46 L.R.A. 122, 29 C. C. A. 141, 54 U. S. App. 723, 85 Fed. 278, Judge Taft, speaking for the circuit court of appeals of the sixth circuit, said that according to the decision of this court in the Freight Association Case, 'contracts in restraint of interstate transportation were within the statute, whether the restraints could be regarded as reasonable at common law or not.' In Chesapeake & O. Fuel Co. v. United States (1902) 53 C. C. A. 256, 115 Fed. 610, 619, the circuit court of appeals for the sixth circuit, after referring to the right of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, thus interpreted the prior decisions of this court in the Trans-Missouri, the Joint Traffic, and the Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. Cases: 'In the exercise of this right, Congress has seen fit to prohibit all contracts in restraint of trade. It has not left to the courts the consideration of the question whether such restraint is reasonable or unreasonable, or whether the contract would have been illegal at the common law or not. The act leaves for consideration by judicial authority no question of this character, but all contracts and combinations are declared illegal it in restraint of trade or commerce among the states.' As far back as Robbins v. Taxing District, \n120 \nU.S. 489, 497\n, 30 S. L. ed. 694, 697, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 45, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 592, it was held that certain local regulations subjecting drummers engaged in both interstate and domestic trade could not be sustained by reason of the fact that no discrimination \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 96]\n\u00a0\n was made among citizens of the different states. The court observed that this did not meet the difficulty, for the reason that 'interstate commerce cannot be taxed at all.' Under this view Congress no doubt acted when by the anti-trust act it forbadeany restraint whatever upon interstate commerce. It manifestly proceeded upon the theory that interstate commerce could not be restrained at all by combinations, trusts, or monopolies, but must be allowed to flow in its accustomed channels, wholly unvexed and unobstructed by anything that would restrain its ordinary movement. See also Minnesota v. Barber, \n136 \nU.S. 313, 326\n, 34 S. L. ed. 455, 460, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 185, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 862; Brimmer v. Rebman, \n138 \nU.S. 78, 82\n, 83 S., 34 L. ed. 862, 864, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 485, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 213.\n In the opinion delivered on behalf of the minority in the Northern Securities Case, 193 U. S. our present chief justice referred to the contentions made by the defendants in the Freight Association Case, namely, one of which was that the agreement there involved did not unreasonably restrain interstate commerce, and said: 'Both these contentions were decided against the association, the court holding that the antitrust act did embrace interstate carriage by railroad corporations, and as that act prohibited any contract in restraint of interstate commerce, it hence embraced all contracts of that character, whether they were reasonable or unreasonable.' One of the justices who dissented in the Northern Securities Case in a separate opinion, concurred in by the minority, thus referred to the Freight and Joint Traffic Cases: 'For it cannot be too carefully remembered that that clause applies to 'every' contract of the forbidden kind,-a consideration which was the turning point of the Trans- Missouri Freight Association Case. . . . Size has nothing to do with the matter. A monopoly of 'any part' of commerce among the states is unlawful.' In this connection it may be well to refer to the adverse report made in 1909, by Senator Nelson, on behalf of the Senate Judiciary Committee, in reference to a certain bill \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 97]\n\u00a0\n offered in the Senate, and which proposed to amend the antitrust act in various particulars. That report contains a full, careful, and able analysis of judicial decisions relating to combinations and monopolies in restraint of trade and commerce. Among other things said in it which bear on the questions involved in the present case are these: 'The anti-trust act makes it a criminal offense to violate the law, and provides a punishment both by fine and imprisonment. To inject into the act the question of whether an agreement or combination is reasonable or unreasonable would render the act as a criminal or penal statute indefinite and uncertain, and hence, to that extent, utterly nugatory and void, and would practically amount to a repeal of that part of the act . . . . And while the same technical objection does not apply to civil prosecutions, the injection of the rule of reasonableness or unreasonableness would lead to the greatest variableness and uncertainty in the enforcement of the law. The defense of reasonable restraint would be made in every case, and there would be as many different rules of reasonableness as cases, courts, and juries. What one court or jury might deem unreasonable another court or jury might deem reasonable. A court or jury in Ohio might find a given agreement or combination reasonable, while a court and jury in Wisconsin might find the same agreement and combination unreasonable. In the case of the People v. Sheldon, 139 N. Y. 264, 23 L.R.A. 221, 36 Am. St. Rep. 690, 34 N. E. 785, Chief Justice Andrews remarks: 'If agreements and combinations to prevent competition in prices are or may be hurtful to trade, the only sure remedy is to prohibit all agreements of that character. If the validity of such an agreement was made to depend upon actual proof of public prejudice or injury, it would be very difficult in any case to establish the invalidity, although the moral evidence might be very convincing.' . . . To amend the antitrust act, as suggested by this bill, would be to entirely emasculate it, and for all practical purposes render it nugatory as a reme- \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 98]\n\u00a0\n dial statute. Criminal prosecutions would not lie, and civil remedies would labor under the greatest doubt and uncertainty. The act as it exists is clear, comprehensive, certain, and highly remedial. It practically covers the field of Federal jurisdiction, and is in every respect a model law. To destroy or undermine it at the present juncture, when combinations are on the increase, and appear to be as oblivious as ever of the rights of the public, would be a calamity.' The result was the indefinite postponement by the Senate of any further consideration of the proposed amendments of the anti-trust act.\n After what has been adjudged, upon full consideration, as to the meaning and scope of the anti-trust act, and in view of the usages of this court when attorneys for litigants have attempted to reopen questions that have been deliberately decided, I confess to no little surprise as to what has occurred in the present case. The court says that the previous cases, above cited, 'cannot by any possible conception be treated as authoritative without the certitude that reason was resorted to for the purpose of deciding them.' And its opinion is full of intimations that this court proceeded in those cases, so far as the present question is concerned, without being guided by the 'rule of reason' or 'the light of reason.' It is more than once intimated, if not suggested, that if the anti-trust act is to be construed as prohibiting every contract or combination, of whatever nature, which is in fact in restraint of commerce, regardless of the reasonableness or unreasonableness of such restraint, that fact would show that the court had not proceeded, in its decision, according to 'the light of reason,' but had disregarded the 'rule of reason.' If the court, in those cases, was wrong in its construction of the act, it is certain that it fully apprehended the views advanced by learned counsel in previous cases and pronounced them to be untenable. The published reports place this beyond all question. The opinion of the court \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 99]\n\u00a0\n was delivered by a justice of wide experience as a judicial officer, and the court had before it the Attorney General of the United States and lawyers who were recognized, on all sides, as great leaders in their profession. The same eminent jurist who delivered the opinion in the Trans- Missouri Case delivered the opinion in the Joint Traffic Case, while the Association in the latter case was represented by lawyers whose ability was universally recognized. Is it to be supposed that any point escaped notice in those cases when we think of the sagacity of the justice who expressed the views of the court, or of the ability of the profound, astute lawyers who sought such an interpretation of the act as would compel the court to insert words in the statute which Congress had not put there, and the insertion of which words would amount to 'judicial legislation?' Now this court is asked to do that which it has distinctly declared it could not and would not do, and has now done what it then said it could not constitutionally do. It has, by mere interpretation, modified the act of Congress, and deprived it of practical value as a defensive measure against the evils to be remedied. On reading the opinion just delivered, the first inquiry will be, that as the court is unanimous in holding that the particular things done by the Standard Oil Company and its subsidiary companies, in this case, were illegal under the anti-trust act, whether those things were in reasonable or unreasonable restraint of interstate commerce, why was it necessary to make an elaborate argument, as is done in the opinion, to show that according to the 'rule of reason' the act as passed by Congress should be interpreted as if it contained the word 'unreasonable' or the word 'undue?' The only answer which, in frankness, can be given to this question, is, that the court intends to decide that its deliberate judgment, fifteen years ago, to the effect that the act permitted no restraint whatever of interstate commerce, whether reasonable or unreasonable, was not in accordance with \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 100]\n\u00a0\n the 'rule of reason.' In effect the court says that it will now, for the first time, bring the discussion under the 'light of reason,' and apply the 'rule of reason' to the questions to be decided. I have the authority of this court for saying that such a course of proceeding on its part would be 'judicial legislation.'\n Still more, what is now done involves a serious departure from the settled usages of this court. Counsel have not ordinarily been allowed to discuss questions already settled by previous decisions. More than once at the present term, that rule has been applied. In St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Taylor, \n210 U.S. 281\n, 52 L. ed. 1061, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 616, the court had occasion to determine the meaning and scope of the original safety appliance act of Congress, passed for the protection of railroad employees and passengers on interstate trains. 27 Stat. at L. 531, chap. 196, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3174. A particular construction of that act was insisted upon by the interstate carrier which was sued under the safety appliance act; and the contention was that a different construction than the one insisted upon by the carrier would be a harsh one. After quoting the words of the act, Mr. Justice Moody said for the court: 'There is no escape from the meaning of these words. Explanation cannot clarify them, and ought not to be employed to confuse them or lessen their significance. The obvious purpose of the legislature was to supplant the qualified duty of the common law with an absolute duty deemed by it more just. If the railroad does, in point of fact, use cars which do not comply with the standard, it violates the plain prohibitions of the law, and there arises from that violation the liability to make compensation to one who is injured by it. It is urged that this is a harsh construction. To this we reply that, if it be the true construction, its harshness is no concern of the courts. They have no responsibility for the justice or wisdom of legislation, and no duty except to enforce the law as it is written, unless it is clearly beyond the constitutional power of the lawmaking \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 101]\n\u00a0\n body. . . . It is quite conceivable that Congress, contemplating the inevitable hardship of such injuries, and hoping to diminish the economic loss to the community resulting from them, should deem it wise to impose their burdens upon those who could measurably control their causes, instead of upon those who are, in the main, helpess in that regard. Such a policy would be intelligible, and, to say the least, not so unreasonable as to require us to doubt that it was intended, and to seek some unnatural interpretation of common words. We see no error in this part of the case.' And at the present term of this court we were asked, in a case arising under the safety appliance act, to reconsider the question decided in the Taylor Case. We declined to do so, saying in an opinion just now handed down: 'In view of these facts, we are unwilling to regard the question as to the meaning and scope of the safety appliance act, so far as it relates to automatic couplers on trains moving interstate traffic, as open to further discussion here. If the court was wrong in the Taylor Case, the way is open for such an amendment of the statute as Congress may, in its discretion, deem proper. This court ought not now disturb what has been so widely accepted and acted upon by the courts as having been decided in that case. A contrary course would cause infinite uncertainty, if not mischief, in the administration of the law in the Federal courts. To avoid misapprehension, it is appropriate to say that we are not to be understood as questioning the soundness of the interpretation heretofore placed by this court upon the safety appliance act. We only mean to say that until Congress, by an amendment of the statute, changes the rule announced in the Taylor Case, this court will adhere to and apply that rule.' Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. United States, \n220 U.S. 559\n, 55 L. ed. --, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 612. When counsel in the present case insisted upon a reversal of the former rulings of this court, and asked such an interpretation of the anti- trust act, as would allow reasonable restraints of interstate commerce, this \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 102]\n\u00a0\n court, in deference to establish practice, should, I submit, have said to them: 'That question, according to our practice, is not open for further discussion here. This court long ago deliberately held (1) that the act, interpreting its words in their ordinary acceptation, prohibits all restraints of interstate commerce by combinations in whatever form, and whether reasonable or unreasonable; (2) the question relates to matters of public policy in reference to commerce among the states and with foreign nations, and Congress alone can deal with the subject; (3) this court would encroach upon the authority of Congress if, under the guise of construction, it should assume to determine a matter of public policy; (4) the parties must go to Congress and obtain an amendment of the anti-trust act if they think this court was wrong in its former decisions; and (5) this court cannot and will not judicially legislate, since its function is to declare the law, while it belongs to the legislative department to make the law.' Such a course, I am sure, would not have offended the 'rule of reason.'\n But my brethren, in their wisdom, have deemed it best to pursue a different course. They have now said to those who condemn our former decisions and who object to all legislative prohibitions of contracts, combinations, and trusts in restraint of interstate commerce, 'You may now restrain such commerce, provided you are reasonable about it; only take care that the restraint is not undue.' The disposition of the case under consideration, according to the views of the defendants, will, it is claimed, quiet and give rest to 'the business of the country.' On the contrary, I have a strong conviction that it will throw the business of the country into confusion and invite widely-extended and harassing litigation, the injurious effects of which will be felt for many years to come. When Congress prohibited every contract, combination, or monopoly, in restraint of commerce, it prescribed a simple, definite rule that all could understand, and which could be easily ap- \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 103]\n\u00a0\n plied by everyone wishing to obey the law, and not to conduct their business in violation of law. But now, it is to be feared, we are to have, in cases without number, the constantly recurring inquiry-difficult to solve by proof-whether the particular contract, combination, or trust involved in each case is or is not an 'unreasonable' or 'undue' restraint of trade. Congress, in effect, said that there should be no restraint of trade, in any form, and this court solemnly adjudged many years ago that Congress meant what it thus said in clear and explicit words, and that it could not add to the words of the act. But those who condemn the action of Congress are now, in effect, informed that the courts will allow such restraint of interstate commerce as are shown not to be unreasonable or undue.\n It remains for me to refer, more fully than I have heretofore done, to another, and, in my judgment,-if we look to the future,-the most important, aspect of this case. That aspect concerns the usurpation by the judicial branch of the government of the functions of the legislative department. The illustrious men who laid the foundations of our institutions deemed no part of the national Constitution of more consequence or more essential to the permanency of our form of government than the provisions under which were distributed the powers of government among three separate, equal, and co-ordinate departments,-legislative, executive, and judicial. This was at that time a new feature of governmental regulation among the nations of the earth, and it is deemed by the people of every section of our own country as most vital in the workings of a representative republic whose Constitution was ordained and established in order to accomplish the objects stated in its Preamble by the means, but only by the means, provided, either expressly or by necessary implication, by the instrument itself. No department of that government can constitutionally exercise the \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 104]\n\u00a0\n powers committed strictly to another and separate department.\n I said at the outset that the action of the court in this case might well alarm thoughtful men who revered the Constitution. I meant by this that many things are intimated and said in the court's opinion which will not be regarded otherwise than as sanctioning an invasion by the judiciary of the constitutional domain of Congress,-an attempt by interpretation to soften or modify what some regard as a harsh public policy. This court, let me repeat, solemnly adjudged many years ago that it could not, except by 'judicial legislation,' read words into the anti-trust act not put there by Congress, and which, being inserted, gives it a meaning which the words of the act, as passed, if properly interpreted, would not justify. The court has decided that it could not thus change a public policy formulated and declared by Congress; that Congress has paramount authority to regulate interstate commerce, and that it alone can change a policy once inaugurated by legislation. The courts have nothing to do with the wisdom or policy of an act of Congress. Their duty is to ascertain the will of Congress, and if the statute embodying the expression of that will is constitutional, the courts must respect it. They have no function to declare a public policy, nor to amend legislative enactments. 'What is termed the policy of the government with reference to any particular legislation,' as this court has said, 'is generally a very uncertain thing, upon which all sorts of opinions, each variant from the other, may be formed by different persons. It is a ground much too unstable upon which to rest the judgment of the court in the interpretation of statutes.' Hadden v. The Collector (Hadden v. Barney) 5 Wall. 107, 18 L. ed. 518. Nevertheless, if I do not misapprehend its opinion, the court has now read into the act of Congress words which are not to be found there, and has thereby done that which it adjudged in 1896 and 1898 could not be done without violating \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 105]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution; namely, by interpretation of a statute changed a public policy declared by the legislative department.\n After many years of public service at the national capital, and after a somewhat close observation of the conduct of public affairs, I am impelled to say that there is abroad in our land a most harmful tendency to bring about the amending of constitutions and legislative enactments by means alone of judicial construction. As a public policy has been declared by the legislative department in respect of interstate commerce, over which Congress has entire control, under the Constitution, all concerned must patiently submit to what has been lawfully done, until the people of the United States-the source of all national power-shall, in their own time, upon reflection and through the legislative department of the government, require a change of that policy. There are some who say that it is a part of one's liberty to conduct commerce among the states without being subject to governmental authority. But that would not be liberty regulated by law, and liberty which cannot be regulated by law is not to be desired. The supreme law of the land, which is binding alike upon all, upon Presidents, Congresses, the courts and the people,-gives to Congress, and to Congress alone, authority to regulate interstate commerce, and when Congress forbids any restraint of such commerce, in any form, all must obey its mandate. To overreach the action of Congress merely by judicial construction, that is, by indirection, is a blow at the integrity of our governmental system, and in the end will prove most dangerous to all. Mr. Justice Bradley wisely said, when on this bench, that illegitimate and unconstitutional practices get their first footing by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes of legal procedure. Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 635\n, 29 S. L. ed. 746, 752, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 524. We shall do well to heed the warnings of that great jurist. \n\n[221 U.S. 1, 106]\n\u00a0\n I do not stop to discuss the merits of the policy embodied in the anti-trust act of 1890; for, as has been often adjudged, the courts, under our constitutional system, have no rightful concern with the wisdom or policy of legislation enacted by that branch of the government which alone can make laws.\n For the reasons stated, while concurring in the general affirmance of the decree of the Circuit Court, I dissent from that part of the judgment of this court which directs the modification of the decree of the Circuit Court, as well as from those parts of the opinion which, in effect, assert authority in this court to insert words in the antitrust act which Congress did not put there, and which, being inserted, Congress is made to declare, as part of the public policy of the country, what it has not chosen to declare. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 1st.

BROWN(1910)\nNo. 168\nArgued: Decided: May 31, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. A. Leftwich Sinclair and Joseph J. Darlington for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[218 U.S. 78, 81]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. Gwynn Gardiner, Creed M. Fulton, A. E. L. Leckie, and Joseph W. Cox for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This action was brought in the supreme court of the District of Columbia for damages for injuries alleged to have been received by defendant in error while in the employment of plaintiff in error and through its negligence\n The case was tried to a jury, which rendered a verdict in favor of the defendant in error in the sum of $6,500, upon which judgment was duly entered. It was affirmed by the court of appeals.\n The assignments of error are based on certain instructions asked by the company which the trial court refused to give, the chief of which requested the court to direct the jury to find a verdict for the company upon the following grounds: (1) There was a fatal variance between the pleadings and the proof. (2) The injury to defendant in error was not caused by the negligence of the company, but by the negligence of a fellow servant or his own contributory negligence.\n The first ground is the principal one discussed by counsel, and turns upon a consideration of the declaration and the proof.\n An outline of the facts contained in the opinion of the court of appeals is as follows: \n\n[218 U.S. 78, 82]\n\u00a0\n 'The plaintiff entered the employ of the defendant in January, 1904, as an oil tank wagon driver. His duties required him to take a team and wagon from defendant's barn in the morning, and, after using it during the day in the delivery of oil, return it to the barn in the evening. The plaintiff was required to groom his team in addition to his duties of delivering oil. The barn in which the horses were kept was 30 feet wide and 50 feet long. It contained two rows of stalls, one on either side, with a space of 12 feet between, extending the full length of the barn. In the ceiling, above the space between the stalls and about the middle of the barn, there was an opening 4 feet square, surrounded on the floor of the loft above by a wooden inclosure or box about 4 feet high. In the loft was stored baled straw, which was used for bedding the horses.\n'It further appears that for about nine years one Coleman had been employed by the defendant, and among his duties was that of bedding the horses; that, during the period of his employment, Coleman had been accustomed to throw bales of straw through the opening in the ceiling from the loft to the floor below. In doing so it was necessary to lift the bale up to the top of the box or inclosure in the loft and push it over, so that it would fall through the opening. Plaintiff received the injuries complained of on February 2, 1904, by being struck by a bale of straw dropped by Coleman from the loft through said opening.\n\n ... * *\n'There was evidence adduced at the trial to show that plaintiff had never been advised by the defendant, or any of the defendant's employees, either of the existence of the opening in the ceiling or the purpose for which it was used. Plaintiff testied to this effect, and further, that during the period of his employment,-less than two weeks,-he was required to leave the barn with his wagon \n\n[218 U.S. 78, 83]\n\u00a0\n to deliver oil at 6 o'clock in the morning, and that he did not complete the delivery of the oil and return to the barn until 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening. At the time of year that he was employed,-in January,-he left the barn before daylight in the morning and returned after dark in the evening. It also appears that the barn was poorly lighted, there being but a small oil lamp at each end of the passageway between the stalls.\n\n'The witness Coleman testified that he not only notified plaintiff of the use made of the opening in the ceiling, but warned him before throwing down the bale of straw that injured him.' [31 App. D. C. 372, 377.]\n\n Defendant in error denied 'that Coleman either called his attention to the hole, or explained its use, or gave him any warning on the evening of the accident. Coleman is not corroborated by any of the employees, as to his custom of calling out to persons before throwing straw through the opening.'\n The declaration contained four counts, in the first three of which, with some verbal variations, it is alleged that it was the company's duty to have the 'hole or opening' in the ceiling of the stable so guarded that the bales of hay in the loft above would not fall or pass through and fall upon defendant in error, or upon those engaged in the performance of their duties in the stable. This duty, it is alleged, was neglected, and a bale of hay was allowed to fall through the hole on the defendant in error.\n Those counts may be dismissed from consideration, as defendant in error does not contend that the proof corresponds to them.\n The fourth count, it is insisted, has such correspondence, and expresses the grounds upon which the case was tried. The following are the pertinent allegations of that count:\n'It became and was also the duty of the said defendant not to permit the said hay and feed to be thus passed through the said hole or opening without proper \n\n[218 U.S. 78, 84]\n\u00a0\n warning or timely notice to those employed in the stable below . . . and to give its employees engaged in handling or placing the hay and feed as aforsaid, as well as to those who were employed in the stable below, such proper and necessary instructions with respect to the dangers of passing the hay and feed through the said hole or opening, and the performance of their respective duties, as to prevent injury and danger to the lives and limbs of the employees engaged in the stable below; yet the defendant . . . did not . . . do any of the duties that it was called upon to discharge in the premises, but, wholly disregarding its said duties in the premises, did carelessly and negligently allow a bale of . . . hay to fall or pass, or be thrown through the said hole or opening, without any notice or warning or signal or instruction of any kind to plaintiff,' etc.\n\n The rule is familiar and elementary that the pleadings and proof must correspond, but a rigid exactitude is not required. In Nash v. Towne, 5 Wall. 689, 698, 18 L. ed. 527, 528, it is said that modern decisions in regard to the correspondence between the pleadings and the proof are more liberal and reasonable than former ones, and states the rele to be by statute in the Federal courts 'to give judgment according to law and the right of the cause.' It was obseved that it is the established 'general rule in the state tribunals that no variance between the allegations of a pleading and the proofs offered to sustain it shall be deemed material, unless it be of a character to mislead the opposite party in maintaining his action or defense on the merits.' The final comment of the court is that irrespective of those statutes, however, no variance ought ever to be regarded as material where the allegation and proof substantially correspond. See also Liverpool & L. & G. Ins. Co. v. Gunther, \n116 U.S. 113\n, 29 L. ed. 575, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 306; Baltimore & P. R. Co. v. Cumberland, \n176 \nU.S. 232, 238\n, 44 S. L. ed. 447, 451, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 380.\n In the case at bar, the company could not have been \n\n[218 U.S. 78, 85]\n\u00a0\n misled. It made no objection to the testimony of the plaintiff (defendant in error here). It replied to it by testimony of like kind. It did not indicate in what way the proof varied from the pleadings, nor move for a continuance. Moreover, we think the pleadings, though inartificially drawn, were sufficient to notify the company that one of the grounds of actions was its omission of duty to inform those whose employment made it necessary to be in the stable, of the danger to them of the use to which the hole was put. And that such use was dangerous is demonstrated. Indeed, it should not have needed the experience of the present case to make the danger clear to the company. The company was familiar with the stable, its construction, and what that construction required. One just employed might not know either, and his time of service might keep both from his knowledge. And such is the contention in this case, which the verdict of the jury sustained. A dimly lighted stable before daylight and a dimly lighted stable after daylight, with a hole in its ceiling, through which bales of hay could be tossed or dropped, seems to us as not to fulfil the duty of a master to those servants who have not been informed of the practice, and the performance of whose duties subjected them to the danger which might result. Let it be granted that Coleman was a fellow servant of defendant in error, and was negligent; it was nevertheless for the jury to say whether the fault of the company contributed to the injury, Kreigh v. Westinghouse, C. K. & Co. \n214 U.S. 249\n, 53 L. ed. 984, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 619. If the plaintiff had had knowledge of the situation and its dangers, he might have needed no warning from Coleman, and might have been protected by the care which such knowledge would have induced.\n The negligence of a fellow servant was sought to excuse the master for his neglect in Grace & H. Co. v. Kennedy, 40 C. C. A. 69, 99 Fed. 679. In reply to it the court said, by Circuit Judge Shipman: \n\n[218 U.S. 78, 86]\n\u00a0\n 'The defect in the argument is a continuance of the omission to recognize the ordinary necessity for the protection of the employees, and that the absolute duty of the master to provide a safe place is not avoided by the neglect of his representative or servants to do the things which will obviously prevent the known original danger.'\n In the discussion so far we have assumed that the company had knowledge of the use to which Coleman had put the hole. Counsel, however, attacks the assumption, and meets it by saying that the company could not anticipate that Coleman would throw down an unopened bale of straw without giving warning to his coemployees, especially, as it is further urged, he had been throwing down straw through the opening without negligence for about six years. But what the facts were in such regard and what conclusions were to be drawn from them were for the jury and cannot be reviewed here.\n Error is assigned upon the refusal of the court to give instructions which presented the following propositions: (1) That the company was not an insurer of the safety of defendant while in its employment, 'nor of the absolute or even reasonable safety of its stable.' (2) That the presumption of law is that plaintiff contracted with reference to the risks, hazards, and dangers ordinarily incident to the business of his employment as the company conducted it at the time he entered its services. And that (this was an independent instruction) the salary or compensation received by the defendant in error was the consideration for such risks. ( 3) There was no evidence that Coleman was incompetent, and that his competency must be presumed.\n It is not necessary to give a detailed attention to these instructions. The court, in its charge to the jury, expressed the legal principles of the case which were applicable to the testimony.\n The company also asked another instruction, the sub- \n\n[218 U.S. 78, 87]\n\u00a0\n stance of which was as follows: That defendant in error assumed the ordinary risks not only actually known to him, but so far as they could ( italics ours) have been known to him by the exercise of ordinary care on his part, and that if he knew, or by the exercise and prudence could have known, of the existence of the hole, then he could not recover. The court gave the instruction, but substituted the word 'would' for 'could.'\n The court was further requested to instruct the jury that they must look to the interest of the witnesses, and that where a witness is interested 'the temptation is strong to color, pervert, or withhold the facts.' An application was made of this to defendant in error, and it was requested that the jury be told that the law permitted him to testify in his own behalf, and that he having availed himself of the privilege, it was for them to determine how far his testimony was credible, and that his personal interest should be considered in weighing his evidence and in determining how far it was worthy of eredit. The instruction was refused.\n But little comment is needed on the contention that there is reversible error in the action of the court. It would be going very far to reverse the judgment on the supposition that the jury would have seen a different meaning in the word 'could' than they saw in the word 'would,' and in consequence would have imputed a greater knowledge to defendant in error of the risks of his employment. And it would be going equally far to reverse the verdict because the jury did not have especially impressed on it, in the language counsel chose to employ, that interest may affect the credibility of witnesses. We are not prepared to say that a party to an action, by testifying, exercises a privilege which may be emphasized as affecting his credibility.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","158":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTANDARD OIL v. TENNESSEE(1910)\nNo. 160\nArgued: April 20, 1910Decided: May 2, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 413, 414]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John J. Vertrees for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 413, 416]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles T. Cates, Jr., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[217 U.S. 413, 419]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff in error is a Kentucky corporation, and seeks to reverse a decree of the supreme court of Tennessee, forbidding it to do business, other than interstate commerce, in the latter state. 120 Tenn. 86, 110 S. W. 565. The ground of the decree is that the corporation and certain named agents entered into an arrangement for the purpose and with the effect of lessening competition in the sale of oil at Gallatin, Tennessee, and with the further result of advancing the price of oil there. The acts proved against the corporation were held to entail the ouster under a statute of Tennessee. Act of March 16, 1903. The corporation brings the case here on the contentions that the statute, as construed by the court, is contrary to the 14th Amendment, and also is an unconstitutional interference with commerce among the states. \n\n[217 U.S. 413, 420]\n\u00a0\n The basis of the former contention is that, by  3 of the act, any violation of it is made a crime, punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both, and that this section has been construed as applicable only to natural persons. Standard Oil Co. v. State, 117 Tenn. 618, 10 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1015, 100 S. W. 705. Hence, it is said, this statute denies to corporations the equal protection of the laws. For although it is addressed generally to the prevention of a certain kind of conduct, whether on the part of corporations or unincorporated men, the latter cannot be tried without a preliminary investigation by a grand jury, an indictment or presentment, a trial by jury, the right to an acquittal unless their guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, and the benefit of a statute of limitations of one year. Corporations, on the other hand, are proceeded against by bill in equity on relation of the attorney general, without any of these advantages, except, perhaps, the right to a jury. Complaint is not made of the difference between fine or imprisonment and ouster, but it is insisted that this is a general criminal statute, that ouster is a punishment as much as a fine, and that it is not a condition attached to the doing of business by foreign corporations (Carroll v. Greenwich Ins. Co. \n199 \nU.S. 401, 409\n, 50 S. L. ed. 246, 249, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 66), or, indeed, a regulation of the conduct of corporations, as such, at all. Therefore the plaintiff in error complains that it is given a wrongful immunity from the procedure of the criminal law. This suit is for the same transaction for which, in the earlier case cited above, an agent of the company was indicted and fined.\n The foregoing argument is one of the many attempts to construe the 14th Amendment as introducing a factitious equality without regard to practical differences that are best met by corresponding differences of treatment. The law of Tennessee sees fit to seek to prevent a certain kind of conduct. To prevent it the threat of fine and imprisonment is likely to be efficient for men, while the latter is impossible and the former less serious to corporations. On the other hand, the threat of extinction or ouster is not \n\n[217 U.S. 413, 421]\n\u00a0\n monstrous, and yet is likely to achieve the result with corporations, while it would be extravagant as applied to men. Hence, this difference is admitted to be justifiable. But the admission goes far to destroy the argument that is made. For if a fundamental distinction may be made in the evils that different delinquents are forced to suffer, surely the less important and ancient distinction between the modes of establishing the delinquency, according to the nature of the evil inflicted, even more easily may be justified. The supreme court of the state says that the present proceeding is of a civil nature; but assuming that nevertheless it ends in punishment, there is nothing novel or unusual about it. We are of opinion that subjection to it, with its concomitant advantages and disadvantages, is not an inequality of which the plaintiff in error can complain, although natural persons are given the benefit of the rules to which we have referred before incurring the possible sentence to prison, which the plaintiff in error escapes.\n The second objection to the statute is that, although construed by the court to apply to domestic business only, nevertheless it is held to warrant turning the defendant out of the state for an interference with interstate trade. The transaction complained of was inducing merchants in Gallatin to revoke orders on a rival company for oil to be shipped from Pennsylvania, by an agreement to give them 300 gallons of oil. It is said that as the only illegal purpose that can be attributed to this agreement is that of protecting the defendants' oil against interstate competition, it could not be made the subject of punishment by the state; that the offense, if any, is against interstate commerce alone.\n The cases that have gone as far as any in favor of this proposition are those that hold invalid taxes upon sales by traveling salesmen, so far as they affect commerce among the states. Robbins v. Taxing Dist. \n120 U.S. 489\n, 30 L. ed. 694, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 45, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 592; Rearick v. Pennsylvania, \n203 U.S. 507\n, 51 L. ed. 295, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 159. These cases fall short of the conclusion to which they are supposed to \n\n[217 U.S. 413, 422]\n\u00a0\n point. Regulations of the kind that they deal with concern the commerce itself, the conduct of the men engaged in it, and as so engaged. The present statute deals with the conduct of third persons, strangers to the business. It does not regulate the business at all. It is not even directed against interference with that business specifically, but against acts of a certain kind that the state disapproves in whatever connection. The mere fact that it may happen to remove an interference with commerce among the states as well with the rest does not invalidate it. It hardly would be an answer to an indictment for forgery that the instrument forged was a foreign bill of lading, or for assault and battery, that the person assaulted was engaged in peddling goods from another state. How far Congress could deal with such cases we need not consider, but certainly there is nothing in the present state of the law, at least, that excludes the states from a familiar exercise of their power. See Field v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co. \n194 \nU.S. 618, 623\n, 48 S. L. ed. 1142, 1154, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 784.\n There is an attempt, also, to bring this case within the statute of limitations. It was permissible for the corporation to contend that it was discriminated against unconstitutionally by being excluded from that defense, and we have dealt with the argument that it was so. But the scope of the state statutes was for the state court to determine, and is not open here.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","159":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTARKWEATHER v. JENNER(1910)\nNo. 114\nArgued: January 28, 1910Decided: February 28, 1910\n\n\n\n Mr. Richard P. Evans for appellant.\n Messrs. B. F. Leighton and R. Golden Donaldson for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Lurton delivered the opinion of the court:\n The appellant, George B. Starkweater, was the owner of a parcel of unimproved land known as the Crescent Heights, in Washington, District of Columbia, composed of two contiguous lots, one of 7 and the other of 3 acres. In January, 1892, pursuant to a plan arranged between himself and certain persons associated with him, and styled herein the syndicate, \n\n[216 U.S. 524, 525]\n\u00a0\n he conveyed this tract to defendants Croissant and Johnson, as trustees, for the benefit of the persons who should contribute to the purchase price, as tenants in common, in the share and proportion in which they respectively contributed, with power to control, manage, lease, sell, and convey, in their discretion, as should be desirable or advantageous to the parties interested. Those contributing or proposing to contribute agreed among themselves, by a separate paper, that the price, including the discharge of encumbrances resting upon the property, should be $75,000, divided into shares of $2,500 each, and each person accordingly subscribed for such number of shares as they elected to take, agreeing that Croissant and Johnson should represent them as trustees in the purchase, with full power to manage, sell, and convey, receiving a commission for their service. Among those so contributing originally, or by substitution, were the trustees Croissant and Johnson, the appellant Starkweather, who was to receive, and did take, eleven shares, fully paid up, as and for part of the purchase price, and the appellee Jenner, who ultimately came to own four of such shares. The full number of thirty shares contemplated were never subscribed, six remaining unsold in the hands of the trustees. This fact, from whatever cause, seems to have led to the inability of the syndicate to pay off the encumbrances which were to be assumed and paid off as part of the price. Among these encumbrances were several deeds in trust or mortgages securing obligations of the vendor appellant.\n The certificates to subscribers were issued by Croissant and Johnson, and recited, among other things, that they held the property in trust, and that the holder was a contributor to the purchase price to the extent of $ 2,500, and the owner of an undivided one-thirtieth interest, and that such interest 'shall at all times be subject to assessment for its proportionate part of money necessary to pay expenses incurred in the execution of the trusts as provided in the deed to said trustee, . . . and in default of such payment the said \n\n[216 U.S. 524, 526]\n\u00a0\n trustees . . . are hereby authorized to sell the interest of such person so in default,' etc.\n Out of the money paid in by the subscribers, a part was used by the trustees in paying off encumbrances, keeping down interest, and in other expenses, but something like $11,000 was paid over in money to or on account of the vendor, Starkweather.\n Among the trusts upon the property was a deed in trust upon the 7- acre parcel to the appellees Duval and Cole, as trustees, to secure an obligation created by Starkweather for $7,553.34 to a Mr. Gaither, executed January 29, 1889, and maturing in four years. In 1893 this debt matured. By agreement, the enforcement of the trust was postponed upon payment of interest. But, finally, there was a default and a sale directed by Gaither. The property was, accordingly, advertised by the trustees and sold at public outcry in 1897 and bid in by one Ricker, acting for and as agent of the appellant. The time for complying with the sale by Ricker was extended upon the payment by appellant of $300 for each of two extensions. Default in complying with the terms of sale was, however, again made, and the property readvertised. Appellant attempted to forbid such resale, and filed a bill for that purpose, which was not dismissed until February, 1898, when the property was again advertised and offered for sale by Duval and Cole, the trustees, and knocked down to one Silver, acting as an agent for Starkweather. The terms of this second sale were not complied with, and the property was at once recried and sold to the appellee Jenner for $ 17,100, acting, as it turned out, for himself and certain others, who, like Jenner, were members of the original purchasing syndicate, or holders of certificates acquired later from those who were. Jenner complied with the terms of sale and paid the full purchase money and accepted a deed from the trustees. After paying off the Gaither debt, the remainder of the price paid by Jenner was distributed to other lienors, under a bill in equity filed for that purpose, under which final \n\n[216 U.S. 524, 527]\n\u00a0\n decrees have long since been made and the trustees exonerated.\n The object of the present bill is to set aside this deed by Duval and Cole to the appellee Jenner, and revest the title in Croissant and Johnson as trustees for the syndicate; or, in the alternative, declare Jenner a trustee holding the 7-acre parcel, after his reimbursement, for the benefit of the syndicate subscribers.\n The charges of the bill abound in accusations of fraudulent collusion between Jenner and the other appellees to bring this 7-acre lot to sale under the Duval and Cole trust, and thereby the elimination of appellant as the largest holder of certificates in the syndicate. It is among other things said that Croissant and Johnson wilfully suffered a default. That they had certificates unsold and money in their hands and power to assess the members of the syndicate to raise means to pay off the encumbrance and thus save the property for the benefit of all concerned; but had wilfully and collusively let the property be brought to sale, and in fact, persuaded Gaither or his trustees to proceed under the trust. These charges of collusion or fraudulent conduct upon the part of either Gaither, the creditor, or his trustees, Duval and Cole, are utterly unsupported. Their course was, from beginning to end, so far as this record shows, dictated by prudent business conduct, and great consideration for appellant in his natural desire to prevent an enforcement of the trust. So far as Croissant and Johnson are concerned, it is not shown that they had in any way colluded with either the creditor, his trustees, or with the purchaser at the Duval and Cole sale, or that they had the slightest interest in the acquisition of this 7-acre tract by Jenner or his associates. They are not shown to have misapplied the funds of the syndicate, or to have had any funds with which to meet and pay off either the principal or interest of the Gaither debt. That they did not assess the shareholders, as they might have done under the terms of the trust, to raise money to \n\n[216 U.S. 524, 528]\n\u00a0\n pay off this and other encumbrances, is true. Their excuse is that most of the members could not pay or be made to pay, and that all were unwilling to pay. That a sale of their certificates would have been unavailing, as it would have been only to sell the property subject to heavy encumbrances, and a sale of a mere equity. But whether they were derelict or not, they are not shown to have acted in collusion with either Gaither, his trustees, or with Jenner and his purchasing associates.\n But it is said that Jenner's relation as tenant in common to appellant and those associated with him as owner of the property sold to pay off this paramount lien, forbade his purchase. That there is such a community of interest between those who hold a common title as to forbid one such cotenant from acquiring any benefit from the acquisition of an outstanding superior title is undeniable. That a court of equity, upon timely application, will convert such a purchasing tenant into a trustee for the common benefit, is true. The doctrine is considered and applied in Rothwell v. Dewees, 2 Black, 613, 17 L. ed. 309, and Turner v. Sawyer, \n150 U.S. 578\n, 37 L. ed. 1189, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 192. For much the same reason, one tenant may not hold adversely the common property against another, though he may do so, if he act openly, and, in that event, the statute will run in his favor. Elder v. McClaskey, 17 C. C. A. 251, 37 U. S. App. 199, 70 Fed. 542.\n But it is plain that the principle which turns a cotenant into a trustee who buys for himself a hostile outstanding title can have no proper application to a public sale of the common property, either under legal process or a power in a trust deed. In such a situation, the sale not being in any wise the result of collusion, nor subject to the control of such a bidder, he is as free, all deceit and fraud out of the way, as any one of the general public.\n Even a trustee has been held competent to purchase the trust property at a judicial sale which he has no interest in, nor any part in bringing about, and which sale he in no way controls. Twin-Lick Oil Co. v. Marbury, \n91 U.S. 587\n, 23 L. ed. 329; Allen v. Gillette, \n127 U.S. 589\n, 32 L. ed. 271, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1331. \n\n[216 U.S. 524, 529]\n\u00a0\n But it is said that if there is no absolute prohibition upon one co- owner buying at an open sale of the common property to satisfy a mortgage or other encumbrance thereon, that at least the fiduciary character and common interest due to such a cotenancy require of one who buys the utmost fairness of conduct. Concede this. It is then said that Jenner, at the bidding, held a power of attorney from three others of the syndicate members, by which he was to bid the property in for their mutual benefit at the lowest price possible, and at a price not exceeding $24,000. That he held this power of attorney, and had undertaken to buy at as low a price as possible, was not known to appellant, and that this 'secret combination,' as it is styled and designated, was a fraud upon him. It is plain from the facts of this case that the scheme for exploiting this Crescent Heights property, according to the agreement exhibited by the share certificates, had practically collapsed, and that for the want of means and harmony among the owners there was no practical way of clearing the property from encumbrances, which had turned out to be about $39,000,- a sum larger than seems to have been originally supposed. There was nothing left but for the members of the syndicate to put their hands into their own pockets and put in a large additional sum or let the encumbrances be enforced. This latter is just what happened. In such circumstances it was plainly the right of each one to take care of himself, and, if he saw fit to buy at the trust sale on the chance of making something, he was free to do so, provided only he took no undue or unfair advantage of his co-owners, and observed the rules concerning fairness at such a sale, which prevail in any circumstances. If two or more of those who had been concerned should choose to unite their fortune in a new purchase, there was no principle of law or morals to forbid. That they should agree to buy at the best price obtainable was their right, if they might buy at all, provided they resorted to no artifice to deter others from bidding. Pewabic Min. Co. v. Mason, \n145 U.S. 349\n, 36 L. ed. 732, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 887. \n\n[216 U.S. 524, 530]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Jenner's attitude at the sale was that of an open bidder, acting in his own interest, and necessarily in opposition to that of the appellant and other cotenants. There were others present at the sale, bidding against him, and chief among them was the appellant himself, who, although he says he intended to give the syndicate the benefit of his purchase, said nothing of it, and seemingly sought to secure himself as best he could in the apparent wreck of the joint enterprise. It was the misfortune of the appellant that he forced the bidding beyond the maximum price to which Jenner was authorized to go, and then was unable to comply with the terms of the sale. This resulted in an immediate reoffering of the property, as was to be expected. That in this second sale the property was knocked down for much less only shows that the former price had been inflated by the competition between these cotenants, each trying to save himself in the same way. That the price at which Jenner bought was probably several thousand dollars less than its then estimated market value may be true. But it is also true that the property was of a speculative character, and at that time and for some time later was difficult of sale and much depressed. But this price was not so grossly inadequate as of itself to justify relief, even if the bill had been promptly filed. That sale was in February, 1898. This bill was filed in the spring of 1903. That appellant did not, at the sale, know that Jenner was buying for himself and certain others of the syndicate, may be true; but he, confessedly, learned that fact when Jenner and his associates fell out and the fact came to light in a bill filed in December, 1898. At most, the sale was voidable, not void, and he who would complain must seasonably elect whether he will avoid it or not. Twin-Lick Oil Co. v. Marbury, supra.\n Appellant did not act with that degree of promptness which equity demands. He has slumbered over the question of whether he should elect to let Jenner hold on to his purchase or require him to give the benefit of his bargain to his con- \n\n[216 U.S. 524, 531]\n\u00a0\n tenants. A delay of not less than four years, during which there has been a large appreciation in the value of the property, is unreasonable. Two courts in succession have failed to find ground for relief, and we see no good reason for reversing the decree from which the appellant has appealed.\n It is therefore affirmed. \n\n\n\n","160":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF MD. v. STATE OF W.VA.(1910)\nNo. 1101\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edward H. sincell, Isaac Lobe straus, and William H. Rawls for complainant.\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George E. Price and William G. Conley for defendant.\n\n\n[217 U.S. 1, 22]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case originates in a bill filed by the state of Maryland, October 12, 1891, against the state of West Virginia, invoking the original jurisdiction of this court, conferred by the Constitution for the settlement of controversies between states. At its January session of 1890 the general assembly of the \n\n[217 U.S. 1, 23]\n\u00a0\n state of Maryland passed an act authorizing and directing its attorney general to take such steps as might be necessary to obtain a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States which would settle the controversy between the states of Maryland and West Virginia concerning the true location of that portion of the boundary line between the two states lying between Garrett county, Maryland, and Preston county, West Virginia.\n Preston county, West Virginia, was erected out of Monongalia county, Virginia, in the year 1818. Garrett county, Maryland, was erected out of the western portion of Alleghany county under chapter 212 of the Acts of the General Assembly of the State of Maryland of 1872\n\n\n The boundary in controversy runs between the two states from the head waters of the Potomac to the Pennsylvania line.\n The bill of complaint states the foundation of the Maryland title to be the charter granted on June 20, 1632, by King Charles I. of England to Cecilius Calvert, Baron of Baltimore, all rights under which, it is averred, have vested in the complainant, the state of Maryland. Virginia, it is alleged, by her first Constitution of June 29, 1776, disclaimed all rights to property, jurisdiction, and government over the territory described in the charter of Maryland and the other colonies, in the following terms:\n'The territories contained within the charters erecting the colonies of Maryland, Pennsylvania, North and South Carolina, are hereby ceded, released, and forever confirmed to the people of those colonies respectively, with all the rights of property, jurisdiction, and government, and all other rights whatsoever which might, at any time heretofore, have been claimed by Virginia, except the free navigation and use of the rivers Potomac and Pokomoke, with the property of the Virginia shores or strands bordering on either of the said rivers, and all improvements which have been or shall be made thereon.' \n\n[217 U.S. 1, 24]\n\u00a0\n The bill also recites complainant's title to the South Branch of the Potomac river. It avers the failure to settle the true location of the boundary line in dispute with West Virginia, which state succeeded to the rights and title of Virginia. The bill charges that the state of West Virginia is wrongly in possession, of, and exercising jurisdiction over, a large part of the territory rightfully belonging to Maryland; that the true line of the western boundary of Maryland is a meridian running south to the first or most distant fountain of the Potomac river, and that such true line is several miles south and west of the line which the state of West Virginia claims, and over which she has attempted to exercise territorial jurisdiction.\n\n The state of West Virginia filed an answer and cross bill, in which she sets up her claim concerning the boundary in dispute between the states, and says that the true boundary line, long recognized and established, is the one known as the 'Deakins' line, and in the answer and cross bill she prays to have that line established as the true line between the states. She also alleges in her cross bill that the north bank of the Potomac river, from above Harper's Ferry to what is known as the Fairfax stone, is the true boundary between the states; that West Virginia should be awarded jurisdiction over that portion of the river to the north bank thereof.\n There is much documentary and other evidence in the record bearing upon the contention that the South Branch of the Potomac river is the true southern boundary of Maryland, but in the briefs and arguments made on behalf of Maryland in this case the claim for the South Branch of the Potomac as the true boundary is not pressed, and the controversy is narrowed to the differences in the location of the boundary, taking the North Branch of the Potomac river as the true southern boundary line of Maryland.\n As we have already said, the contention of the state of Maryland is rested upon the construction of the charter granted by King Charles I., June 20, 1632, to Lord Baltimore. \n\n[217 U.S. 1, 25]\n\u00a0\n The part of the charter necessary to consider is here given in the original Latin, and the translation thereof, as the same is contended for in the brief filed for the state of Maryland:\n Western and Southern Boundaries, Which Calls Are as Follows, to Wit:\n Transuendo a dicto aestuario vocato Delaware Bay recta linea per gradum praedictum usque ad verum Meridianum primi Fontis Fluminis de Pottomack deinde vergendo versus Meridiem ad ulteriorem dicti Fluminis Ripam et eam sequendo qua Plaga occidentalis ad Meridianalis [ qu. plagam occidentalem et meridianalem] spectat usque ad Locum quendam appelatum Cinquack prope ejusdem Fluminis Ostium scituatum ubi in praefatum Sinum de Chessopeake evolvitur ac inde per Lineam brevissimam usque ad praedictum Promontorium sive Locum vocatum Watkin's Point.\n Going from the said estuary called Delaware bay in a right line in the degree aforesaid to the true meridian of the first fountain of the river Potomac, then tending downward towards the south to the farther bank of the said river, and following it to where it faces the western and southern coasts as far as to a certain place called Cinquack, situate near the mouth of the same river, where it discharges itself in the aforenamed bay of Chesapeake, and thence by the shortest line as far as the aforesaid promontory or place called Watkin's Point.\n There is some difference in the record as to the true Latin text and the translation thereof. For our purpose it is sufficient to consider that presented by the state of Maryland in the language above set forth. It is to be observed that the purpose of this part of the grant was to locate the northern line of the state of Maryland from Delaware bay 'to the true meridian of the first fountain of the river Potomac, then tending downward toward the south to the farther bank of said river, and following it to where it faces the western and \n\n[217 U.S. 1, 26]\n\u00a0\n southern coasts as far as to a certain place called Cinquack,' etc.\n It is the contention of the state of Maryland that the controversy between her and the state of West Virginia is narrowed to a proper location of the true meridian from the first fountain head of the Potomac river, which, being located, will effectually settle the boundary line in dispute. The claim of the state of Maryland may be further illustrated by a consideration of the plate exhibited in the brief filed in behalf of that state, which is herewith given:\n It is to be noted in considering this plate that the north and south line at the left is called the Potomac meridian, running from a certain point designated as the Potomac stone. It is insisted for the state of Maryland that the spring at this point most nearly fulfils the terms of the Lord Baltimore charter, in that it properly locates the true meridian of the first fountain head of the Potomac river, and following it according to the description in the grant, embraces said river to its farther bank as the true boundary of Maryland.\n On the other hand, West Virginia contends that the true head of the river Potomac is at the Fairfax stone, and that the boundary should be located by a line from the spring at that point; and that such has long been the recognized boundary line between Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland. The distance from the Fairfax meridian to the Potomac meridian is about 1 1\/4 miles, and the distance to the Pennsylvania line about 37 miles.\n It may be true that the meridian line from the Potomac stone, in the light of what is now known of that region of country, more fully answers the calls in the original charter than does a meridian line starting from the Fairfax stone. But it is to be remembered that the grant to Lord Baltimore was made when the region of the country intended to be conveyed was little known was wild and uninhabited, had never been surveyed or chartered, and the location of the upper part of the Potomac river was only a matter of conjecture. \n\n[217 U.S. 1, 27]\n\u00a0\n It is said, and the record tends to show, that the only map of the country then known to be in existence was one pre-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npared and published by Captain John Smith, upon which only a very small part of the Potomac river is shown, and \n\n[217 U.S. 1, 28]\n\u00a0\n from which we get no light as to the true source and course of the upper reaches of the Potomac river. The so-called Potomac stone was neither set nor located until 1897, six years after the beginning of this suit, when it was put in place by the surveyor in this case, on the part of the state of Maryland. He then set a monument designated as the 'Potomac stone,' and gave the name Potomac to the spring at the origin of that fork of the Potomac river. The so-called Potomac meridian was run by the same engineer, located and named by him in the year 1897.\n The Fairfax stone, which is shown at the beginning of the north and south line in plate No. 1, has a history and importance in this case which renders it necessary to note something of its origin and location. Without going into a history of the prior grants in Virginia, we come directly to the one bearing upon this case. It was made in September, 1688, by King James II. of England, for the northern neck of Virginia, to Thomas (Lord) Culpeper, which subsequently became the property of Lord Fairfax, and is usually spoken of as the Fairfax grant. That grant was under consideration in this court in the case of Morris v. United States, \n174 U.S. 198\n, 43 L. ed. 947, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 649, a case to which we shall have occasion to refer later, and from page 223 of that report we take a description of so much of the grant as is necessary to a consideration of this cause. The northern neck of Virginia is described in that grant as follows:\n'All that entire tract, territory, or parcel of land situate, lying, and being in Virginia in America, and bounded by and within the first heads or springs of the rivers of Tappahannock als Rappahannock and Quiriough als Patowmack rivers, the courses of said rivers from their said first heads or springs, as they are commonly called and known by the inhabitants and description of those parts and the bay of Chesapeake, together with the said rivers themselves and all the islands within the outermost banks thereof, and the soil of all and singular the premises, and all lands, woods, underwood, timber, and trees, wayes, mountains, swamps, marshes, \n\n[217 U.S. 1, 29]\n\u00a0\n waters, rivers, ponds, pools, lakes, water courses, fishings, streams, havens, ports, harbours, bays, creeks, ferries, with all sorts of fish, as well whales, sturgeons, and other royal fish. . . . To have, hold, and enjoy all the said entire tract, territory, or portion of land, and every part and parcel thereof, . . . to the said Thomas, Lord Culpeper, his heirs and assigns forever.'\n\n The territory embraced in this northern neck became subject to the jurisdiction and dominion of Virginia, and the boundary lines fixed for it became important in determining the true boundary between Virginia and adjoining states. In the grant to Lord Culpeper the tract is described as lying in Virginia, in America, and bounded by and within the first heads or springs of the rivers, Rappahannock and Patowmack. Disputes having arisen between the governor and council of Virginia and Lord Fairfax, touching the true boundary of the grant, an order was made on November 29, 1733, by the King in Council, reciting that Lord Fairfax had petitioned for an order to settle the boundaries of his tract, and for a commission to issue, run out, and ascertain the boundaries of the same. The King granted an order, and thereafter the governor of Virginia, on September 7, 1736, appointed certain commissioners to act for the colony of Virginia in the matter; Lord Fairfax appointed certain commissioners to act on his behalf.\n The instructions to the commissioners required them to make a clearer description of the boundaries in controversy, to make exact maps of the rivers Rappahannock and Potomac, and the branches thereof to the head or spring, so-called or known, and the surveys made by them, with correct maps thereof, to be laid before his Majesty. The commission adopted the North Branch of the Potomac river, then known as the Cohaungoruton, and after further proceedings, which are not necessary to recite in detail, and after a reference to the Lords of Trade and Plantations, a report was made which, among other things, stated that a line run from the first head \n\n[217 U.S. 1, 30]\n\u00a0\n or spring of the south or main branch of the Rappahannock river to the first head or spring of the Potomac river is, and ought to be, the boundary line determining the tract or territory of land commonly called the northern neck. Ultimately the matter was laid before the King in Council, and commissioners were appointed to mark and run the line between the head spring of the rivers Rappahannock and Potomac, and the stone called the Fairfax stone was planted in September, 1746, at the head spring of the Potomac river. In 1748, the location of the stone was approved by the Virginia assembly and the King in Council. This Fairfax stone has been an important monument in settling and establishing boundaries since that time.\n It was found still in place in 1859 by Lieutenant Michler, who made a survey on behalf of the boundary commissioners of Maryland and Virginia, to which we shall have occasion to refer later on. In his report, Lieutenant Michler describes the stone as follows:\n'The initial point of the work, the oftmentioned, oft-spoken of 'Fairfax stone,' stands on a spot encircled by several small streams flowing from the springs about it. It consists of a rough piece of sandstone, indifferent and friable, planted to a depth of a few feet in the ground, and raising a foot or more above the surface. Shapeless in form, it would scarcely attract the attention of the passer-by. The finding of it was without difficulty and its recognition and identification, by the inscription 'Ffx,' now almost obliterated by the corroding action of water and air.'\n\n Without stopping to mention the cases in which Virginia has recognized this monument in creating counties and otherwise, it is to be noted that it was recognized as a boundary point by the state of Maryland in erecting Garrett county, the boundary between which and Preston county, West, Virginia, it was the purpose of the act of the legislature of Maryland to have settled by the filing of the bill and proceedings in the present case. \n\n[217 U.S. 1, 31]\n\u00a0\n By the Constitution of Maryland of 1851 it is provided (article 8,  2):\n'When that part of Alleghany county lying south and west of a line beginning at the summit of Big Back Bone or Savage mountain where that mountain is crossed by Mason and Dixon's line, and running thence by a straight line to the middle of Savage river, where it empties into the Potomac river, thence by a straight line to the nearest point or boundary of the state of Virginia, thence with said boundary to the Fairfax stone, shall contain a population of ten thousand, and the majority of electors thereof shall desire to separate and form a new county and make known their desire by petition to the legislature, the legislature shall direct, at the next succeeding election, that the judges shall open a book at each election district in said part of Alleghany county, and have recorded therein the vote of each elector 'for or against' a new county. In case the majority are in favor, then said part of Alleghany county to be declared an independent county, and the inhabitants whereof shall have and enjoy all such rights and privileges as are held and enjoyed by the inhabitants of the other counties in this state.'\n\n In the act of 1872, creating Garrett county, it is provided:\n'That all that part of Alleghany county lying south and west of a line beginning at the summit of Big Back Bone or Savage mountain where that mountain is crossed by Mason and Dixon's line, and running thence by a straight line to the middle of Savage river where it empties into the Potomac river; thence by a straight line to the nearest point or boundary of the state of West Virginia, then with the said boundary to the Fairfax stone, shall be a new county, to be called the county of Garrett, provided,' etc.\n\n It appears that not infrequent attempts have been made to settle the controversy between the states now at the bar of this court. In the years 1795, 1801, and 1810 certain commissioners were provided for by the state of Maryland to meet commissioners to be appointed by the state of Virginia, with \n\n[217 U.S. 1, 32]\n\u00a0\n power to adjust the boundary between the southern and western limits of the state of Maryland and the dividing line between it and Virginia. Nothing seems to have come of these attempts.\n In 1818, the state of Maryland passed an act proposing to Virginia the appointment of a commission, to run a line from the most western source of the North Branch of the Potomac.\n In February, 1822, the legislature of Virginia expressed its willingness to appoint commissioners, who were to locate the western boundary by a stone located by Lord Fairfax at the head waters of the Potomac river. The commissioners met, but the divergency in their instructions prevented any action.\n In 1825, Maryland passed an act for the settlement of the boundary, providing that the governor of Delaware should act as umpire. In 1833, Virginia passed an act providing for commissioners to run the lines from the Fairfax stone, or, at the first fountain of the Cohangoruton or North Branch of the Potomac river. In default of Maryland appointing commissioners, Virginia commissioners were to run and mark the line.\n In October, 1834, the state of Maryland filed a bill in this court against the state of Virginia, which bill was subsequently dismissed without any action being taken thereon. In 1859, a line was run by Lieutenant Michler, of the United States Topographical Engineers, to which we shall have occasion to refer more in detail later on.\n By an act of 1781, the state of Maryland appropriated land within the state in Washington county, west of Fort Cumberland, with certain exceptions, to discharge the engagements of the state to the officers and soldiers thereof, and, by a resolution passed in April, 1787, the governor and council were requested 'to appoint and employ some skilful person to lay out the manors, and such parts of the reserve and vacant lands, belonging to this state, lying to the west of Fort Cumberland, as he may think fit and capable of being settled \n\n[217 U.S. 1, 33]\n\u00a0\n and improved, in lots of 50 acres each, bounded by a fixed beginning and four lines only, unless on the sides adjoining elder surveys; that the beginning of each lot be marked with marking irons, or otherwise, with the number thereof, and that a fair book of such surveys, describing the beginning of each lot by its situation, as well as number, be returned and laid before the next general assembly.'\n Under this resolution, Francis Deakins was appointed to make the survey, and, in 1788, an act of the general assembly of Maryland was passed. It reads, in part, as follows:\n'And whereas, in pursuance of a resolve of the general assembly, at April session, 1787, authorizing the governor and council to appoint and employ some skilful person to lay out the manors and such parts of the reserves and vacant land belonging to this state, lying to the westward of Fort Cumberland, as he might think fit and capable of being settled and improved, in lots of 50 acres each, Francis Deakins was appointed and employed by the governor and council for that purpose, and has finished the said survey, and has returned a general plot of the county westward of Fort Cumberland, on which 4,165 lots of 50 acres each are laid off, besides sundry tracts which have been patented, distinguishing on the plot those lots which have been settled and improved from those which remain uncultivated; and the said Francis Deakins has also returned two books, entitled A and B, in which are entered certificates of all of the lots before-mentioned.'\n\n And further enacted that 2,575 of the aforesaid lots were contained in the following limits: 'Begining at the mouth of Savage river and running with the North Branch of the Potomac river to the head thereof, then with the present supposed boundary line of Maryland until the intersection of an east line to be drawn from said boundary line with a north course from the mouth of Savage river will include the number of lots aforesaid to be distributed by lot among \n\n[217 U.S. 1, 34]\n\u00a0\n the said soldiers and recruiting officers, and their legal representatives,' etc.\n And it further provides that lots granted to officers should be adjacent to those distributed to the soldiers, within the following limits: 'By extending the aforesaid north course from the mouth of Savage river, until its intersection with an east line to be drawn from the aforesaid supposed boundary line of Maryland will include the necessary number, allowing to each officer or his representatives four lots aforesaid.'\n The act also contains the following language:\n'And be it enacted, that the line to which the said Francis Deakins has laid out the said lots is, in the opinion of the general assembly, far within that which this state may rightfully claim as its western boundary; and that at a time of more leisure the considerations of the legislature ought to be drawn to the western boundaries of the state, as objects of very great importance.'\n\n Deakins filed a map, which is in evidence in this case, and which shows a large number of lots laid out, and also certain outlines of deeds and grants. This line in the briefs and records is sometimes mentioned as having been run in 1787, sometimes 1788, and sometimes 1789. In view of the act of 1788, the line was probably run in that year. As, in our view of the case, the action of Deakins in the location of this line, and his evident adoption of the Fairfax stone as a starting point, is an important feature of this controversy, we insert herein a tracing from the original Deakins map, put in evidence on the part of the state of West Virginia. An inspection of this map shows a north and south line upon the west side thereof, and also some of the military lots laid out by Deakins in that part of the tract. It is to be noted that this north and south line is marked: 'The meridian line and the head of the North Branch of the Potowmack river as fixed by Lord Fairfax.' This could mean but one thing, and that is, an attempted meridian line north from the Fairfax stone, located to the Pennsylvania line. [34-Continued]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [34-Continued]\n\n[] \n\n[217 U.S. 1, 35]\n\u00a0\n We shall have occasion to recur to this line.\n In 1852 the legislature of the state of Maryland passed an act concerning the disputed boundary, which act provides:\n'Whereas it is of great importance that the western territorial limit of the state of Maryland be clearly defined and her boundary be permanently established; and whereas, the true location of the western line of Maryland between the states of Maryland and Virginia, beginning at or near the Fairfax stone on the North Branch of the Potomac river, at or near its source, and running in a due north line to the state of Pennsylvania, is now lost and unknown, and all the marks have been destroyed by time or otherwise; and whereas, the states of Virginia and Maryland have both granted patents to the same tracts of land at or near the supposed line, and as suits of ejectment are now pending in the circuit court of Alleghany county, in the state of Maryland, by persons holding under Maryland patents against persons now in possession and holding land under patents granted by the state of Virginia, which cannot be justly settled without establishing said boundary line:\n\n'Therefore, section 1. Be it enacted by the general assembly of Maryland, that the governor be and he is requested to open a correspondence with the governor of Virginia in relation to tracing, establishing, and marking the said line, and in case the legislature of Virginia shall pass an act providing for the appointment of a commissioner to act in conjunction with a commissioner on the part of Maryland in the premises, then and in such case, the governor be and he is hereby authorized and requested to appoint a commissioner who, together with the commissioner who shall be appointed on the part of Virginia, shall cause the said line to be accurately surveyed, traced, and marked with suitable monuments, beginning therefor at the said Fairfax stone, and running thence due north to the line of the state of Pennsylvania.\n\n'Sec. 2. And be it enacted, that it shall be the joint duty \n\n[217 U.S. 1, 36]\n\u00a0\n of the commissioners after running, locating, establishing, and marking the said line, to make a report setting forth all the facts touching, locating, and marking said line; and it shall be the duty of the commissioner of each respective state to forward copies of the joint report to each of their respective legislatures; and upon the ratification of said report by the state of Virginia and the state of Maryland, through their respective legislatures, the said boundary lines shall be fixed and established so to remain forever, unless changed by mutual consent of the two states.'\n\n In 1854, the general assembly of Virginia met this action upon the part of the state of Maryland by the passage of an act which provides:\n'Whereas the general assembly of Maryland has passed an act for running and marking the boundary line between that state and the state of Virginia, beginning therefor at the Fairfax stone on the Potomac river, sometimes called the North Branch of the Potomac river, at or near the source, and running thence due north to the line of the state of Pennsylvania; and whereas the legislature of Maryland has requested the appointment of a commissioner on the part of this state to act in conjunction with the commissioner of Maryland to run and mark said line: therefore, be it enacted,\n\n'1. That the governor appoint a commissioner who, together with the Maryland commissioner, shall cause the said line to be accurately surveyed, traced, and marked with suitable monuments, beginning therefor at the Fairfax stone, situated as aforesaid, and running thence due north to the line of the state of Pennsylvania.'\n\n And the act concludes:\n'Upon the ratification of such report by the legislatures of the states of Virginia and Maryland, the said boundary line shall be fixed and established to remain forever, unless changed by mutual consent of the said states.'\n\n Under these acts of the legislatures of the respective states, commissioners were appointed, who made application to the \n\n[217 U.S. 1, 37]\n\u00a0\n Secretary of War for the services of an officer of the United States Engineers to aid them in carrying out the purposes of the acts. Upon this application, the Secretary of War detailed Lieutenant N. Michler, of the United States Topographical Engineers. As directed in both the acts, Lieutenant Michler commenced his work at the Fairfax stone, and ran a line northwardly, marking it at certain places. This line intersected the Pennsylvania line at a point about three fourths of a mile west from the northern extremity of the Deakins line, which had been run in 1788, as we have already stated. There was a triangle between the Deakins and Michler lines, having its apex at the Fairfax stone, and lines diverging thence, until there was a difference of three fourths of a mile at the base of the triangle at the Pennsylvania line.\n It appears that the commissioners of the two states differed, the commissioner of Virginia contending that by the act of the legislature, above referred to, that state had not adopted the meridian line from the Fairfax stone as the boundary. The commissioner of Maryland contended for that meridian line. On March 5, 1860, the legislature of Maryland passed an act adopting the Michler line, commencing at the Fairfax stone at the head of the North Branch of the Potomac river, and running thence due north to the southern line of Pennsylvania, as surveyed in the year 1859 by commissioners appointed by the states of Maryland and Virginia, and thereafter the state of Maryland provided for the marking of the Michler line.\n Virginia did not approve of the Michler line, but in 1887 West Virginia passed an act confirming the line as run by Lieutenant Michler in 1859 as the true boundary line between West Virginia and Maryland, but the act was not to take effect until and unless Maryland should pass an act or acts confirming and rendering valid all the entries, grants, patents, and titles from the commonwealth of Virginia to any person or persons, to lands situate and lying between the new Maryland line and the old Maryland line heretofore claimed by \n\n[217 U.S. 1, 38]\n\u00a0\n Virginia and West Virginia, to the same extent and with like legal effect as though the said old Maryland line was confirmed and established.\n The divergence between Michler's line and the line shown on Deakins' map probably arises from the fact that Lieutenant Michler ran a true astronomical line, and that his line is a true north and south line, whereas the Deakins line was probably run with a surveyor's compass, and with less accuracy than the Michler line.\n It is the contention of the state of Maryland that Deakins never attempted to run a true north and south line; that he never had any authority from the state of Maryland so to do; and that, in the act confirming the laying out of the lots by Deakins, it was especially declared by the state of Maryland that it did not show the true western boundary of the state; furthermore, that the attempts which have been made to trace the Deakins line show that it is not a true north and south line, but a broken line, having offsets in various places.\n The state of Maryland insists that the evidence shows that a number of old grants made prior to the Deakins survey would extend west of the boundary line, as shown either by Deakins or Michler. It is the contention of the state of Maryland that when these grants were made she indicated a line further to the west than either of these lines, and that the ancient grants of large tracts of land show that fact. But the evidence contained in this record leaves no room to doubt that after the running of the Deakins line the people of that region knew and referred to it as the line between the state of Virginia and the state of Maryland. Lieutenant Michler, in the frank and able report filed with his survey, recognizes this situation, for he says:\n'The meridian as traced by me last summer differs from all previous lines run; some varying too far to the east, others too far to the west. The oldest one, and that generally adopted by the inhabitants as the boundary line, passes to \n\n[217 U.S. 1, 39]\n\u00a0\n the east; and from measurements made to it I found that it was not very correctly run. The surveyor's compass was used for the purpose, and some incorrect variation of the needle allowed. Owing to the thick and heavy growth of timber, it is utterly impossible to run a straight line through it without first opening a line of sight. It could only be approximately done.\n\n'When north of the railroad, and the nearer the Pennsylvania line is approached, the settlements and farms become more numerous; and if the meridian line is adopted as the boundary, it will cause great litigation, as the patents of most of the lands call for the boundary as their limits. On the Pennsylvania boundary the new line is about three quarters of a mile west of the old; on the railroad,-feet; at Weill's filed, 85 feet; on the northwestern turnpike, about 40 feet, and on the backbone, about 20 feet.'\n\n These recitals from Lieutenant Michler's report, if the record were lacking in other evidence, would leave little doubt that there was an old boundary line, generally adopted, and that the adoption of the true meridian line, which Lieutenant Michler ran, would cause great litigation because of the acquiescence of the people in the old boundary line,-the Deakins line.\n The report of the committee of the Maryland Historical Society, an exhibit in this case, contains a history of the boundary dispute, and it is therein said:\n'The provisional line of 1787, or 'Deakins line,' as it was called, had long done duty as a boundary; and as the state granted no lands beyond it, it came to be looked upon, despite the emphatic protest of the assembly of 1788, as the true boundary line of the state. In process of time the marks became obliterated, and conflicts of title and litigation arose between the holders of Maryland and the holders of Virginia patents for lands in the debatable territory. So in May, 1852, the Maryland legislature passed an act reciting these facts, and requesting the governor to open a correspondence with \n\n[217 U.S. 1, 40]\n\u00a0\n the governor of Virginia about the matter; and authorizing him to appoint a commissioner, if the legislature of Virginia would also appoint one, which joint commission should run and mark a line due north from the Fairfax stone, which line, when ratified by both legislatures, should be the boundary between the states.'\n\n The state of Maryland has herself, in sundry grants, recognized this old line. In a grant by the state of Maryland for a tract called 'Maryland,' dated January 23, 1823, among other calls is this one: 'Running thence south 36 degrees west, 86 perches to the Virginia and Maryland line, as run under the directions of Francis Deakins at the time of laying out the lots to the westward of Fort Cumberland, and thence running,' etc.\n In the Deakins description of the first lot north of the Fairfax stone, the following language is used in describing military lot No. 1101:\n'Beginning at a bounded maple marked 1100, standing one mile north from a stone fixed by Lord Fairfax for the head of the North Branch of the Powtomack river, and running north 89 1\/2 perches; east, 89 1\/2 perches; south, 89 1\/2 perches; then to the beginning, containing 50 acres.'\n\n This record leaves no doubt as to the truth of the statement contained in the report of the committee of the Maryland Historical Society, that the Deakins line, before the passage of the act under which the Michler line was run, had long been recognized as a boundary and served as such. Even after the Michler line was run and marked, the testimony shows that the people generally adhered to the old line as the true boundary line. There are numerous Virginia grants and private deeds of land given in the record, which call for this old Maryland line as the boundary.\n The testimony shows that the people living along the Deakins line worked and improved the roads on the Virginia side, as a general rule, up to this line. Correspondingly, Maryland worked the roads on the other side of this line. On the \n\n[217 U.S. 1, 41]\n\u00a0\n west of the line, the people paid taxes on their lands in Preston county, West Virginia. They voted in that county, and with rare exceptions regarded themselves as citizens of West Virginia. As a general rule, the schools established there were West Virginia schools. The allegiance of nearly all these people has been given to West Virginia.\n It is true there has been more or less contention as to the true boundary line between these states. Attempts have been made to settle and adjust the same, some of which we have referred to, and the details of which may be found in the very interesting document to which we have already made reference, the report of the committee of the Maryland Historical Society. In the proposed settlements, for many years, Virginia and West Virginia have consistently adhered to the Fairfax stone as a starting point for the disputed boundary. When West Virginia passed the act of 1887, ratifying the Michler line, it was upon condition that Virginia titles granted between the Michler line and the old Maryland line should be validated. Maryland, in the act of 1852, recognized the same starting point.\n And the fact remains that after the Deakins survey in 1788, the people living along the line generally regarded that line as the boundary line between the states at bar. In the acts of the legislatures of the two states, to which we have already referred, resulting in the survey and running of the Michler line, it is evident from the language used that the purpose was not to establish a new line, but to retrace the old one; and we are strongly inclined to believe that had this been done at that time, the controversy would have been settled.\n A perusal of the record satisfies us that for many years occupation and conveyance of the lands on the Virginia side has been with reference to the Deakins line as the boundary line. The people have generally accepted it and have adopted it, and the facts in this connection cannot be ignored. In the case of Virginia v. Tennessee, \n148 \nU.S. 503, 522\n, 523 S., 37 L. ed. 537, 544, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 728, 736, \n\n[217 U.S. 1, 42]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the court, had occasion to make certain comments which are pertinent in this connection, wherein he said:\n'Independently of any effect due to the compact as such, a boundary line between states or provinces, as between private persons, which has been run out, located, and marked upon the earth, and afterwards recognized and acquiesced in by the parties for a long course of years, is conclusive, even if it be ascertained that it varies somewhat from the courses given in the original grant; and the line so established takes effect, not as an alienation of territory, but as a definition of the true and ancient boundary. Lord Hardwicke in Penn v. Baltimore, 1 Ves. Sr. 444, 448; Boyd v. Graves, 4 Wheat. 513, 4 L. ed. 628; Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, 734, 9 L. ed. 1233, 1264; United States v. Stone, 2 Wall. 525, 537, 17 L. ed. 765, 767; Kellogg v. Smith, 7 Cush. 375, 382; Chenery v. Waltham, 8 Cush. 327; Hunt, Boundaries, 3d ed. 306.\n\n'As said by this court in the recent case of Indiana v. Kentucky, \n136 \nU.S. 479, 510\n, 34 S. L. ed. 329, 332, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1051, 'it is a principle of public law, universally recognized, that long acquiescence in the possession of territory, and in the exercise of dominion and sovereignty over it, is conclusive of the nation's title and rightful authority.' In the case of Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 4 How. 591, 639, 11 L. ed. 1116, 1137, this court, speaking of the long possession of Massachusetts, and the delays in alleging any mistake in the action of the commissioners of the colonies, said: 'Surely this, connected with the lapse of time, must remove all doubts as to the right of the respondent under the agreements of 1711 and 1718. No human transactions are unaffected by time. Its influence is seen on all things subject to change. And this is peculiarly the case in regard to matters which rest in memory, and which consequently fade with the lapse of time and fall with the lives of individuals. For the security of rights, whether of states or individuals, long possession under a claim of title is protected. And there is no controversy in which this great principle may be in- \n\n[217 U.S. 1, 43]\n\u00a0\n voked with greater justice and propriety than in a case of disputed boundary.\"\n\n And quoting from Vattel on the Law of Nations to the same effect:\n'The tranquillity of the people, the safety of states, the happiness of the human race, do not allow that the possessions, empire, and other rights of nations should remain uncertain, subject to dispute and ever ready to occasion bloody wars. Between nations, therefore, it becomes necessary to admit prescription founded on length of time as a valid and incontestable title.' [Bk. 2, chap. 11,  149.]\n\n And adds from Wheaton on International Law:\n'The writers on natural law have questioned how far that peculiar species of presumption arising from the lapse of time, which is called prescription, is justly applicable as between nation and nation; but the constant and approved practice of nations shows that by whatever name it becalled, the uninterrupted possession of territory or other property for a certain length of time by one state excludes the claim of every other in the same manner as, by the law of nature and the municipal code of every civilized nation, a similar possession by an individual excludes the claim of every other person to the article of property in question.' [Pt. 2, chap. 4,  164.]\n\n And it was said:\n'There are also moral considerations which should prevent any disturbance of long-recognized boundary lines; considerations springing from regard to the natural sentiments and affections which grow up for places on which persons have long resided; the attachments to country, to home, and to family, on which is based all that is dearest and most valuable in life.'\n\n In Louisiana v. Mississippi, \n202 \nU.S. 1, 53\n, 50 S. L. ed. 913, 932, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 408, 423, this court said:\n'The question is one of boundary, and this court has many times held that, as between the states of the Union, long acquiescence in the assertion of a particular boundary, and \n\n[217 U.S. 1, 44]\n\u00a0\n the exercise of dominion and sovereignty over the territory within it, should be accepted as conclusive, whatever the international rule might be in respect of the acquisition by prescription of large tracts of country claimed by both.'\n\n An application of these principles cannot permit us to ignore the conduct of the states and the belief of the people concerning the purpose of the boundary line known as the old state, or Deakins, line, and to which their deeds called as the boundary of their farms, in recognition of which they have established their allegiance as citizens of the state of West Virginia, and in accordance to which they have fixed their homes and habitations.\n True it is, that, after the running of the Deakins line, certain steps were taken, intended to provide a more effectual legal settlement and delimitation of the boundary. But none of these steps were effectual, or such as to disturb the continued possession of the people claiming rights up to the boundary line.\n The effect to be given to such facts as long-continued possession 'gradually ripening into that condition which is in conformity with international order' depends upon the merit of individual cases as they arise. 1 Oppenheim, International Law,  243. In this case, we think a right in its nature prescriptive has arisen, practically undisturbed for many years, not to be overthrown without doing violence to principles of established right and justice equally binding upon states and individuals. Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, 9 L. ed. 1233.\n It may be true that an attempt to relocate the Deakins line will show that it is somewhat irregular, and not a uniform, astronomical north and south line; but both surveyors appointed by the states represented in this controversy were able to locate a number of points along the line, and the northern limit thereof is fixed by a mound, and was located by the commissioners who fixed the boundary between West Virginia and Pennsylvania by a monument which was erected at that point, and we think from the evidence in this record \n\n[217 U.S. 1, 45]\n\u00a0\n that it can be located with little difficulty by competent commissioners.\n We think, for the reasons which we have undertaken to state, that the decree in this case should provide for the appointment of commissioners whose duty it shall be to run and permanently mark the old Deakins line, beginning at a point where the north and south line from the Fairfax stone crosses the Potomac river, and running thence northerly along said line to the Pennsylvania border.\n As to the contention made by West Virginia in her cross bill, that she is entitled to the Potomac river to the north bank thereof, we think that claim is disposed of by the case of Morris v. United States, \n174 U.S. 196\n, 43 L. ed. 946, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 649, already referred to. In that case, among other things, there was a controversy between the heirs of James H. Marshall and the heirs of John Marshall as to the ownership of the bed of the Potomac river from shore to shore, including therein certain reclaimed lands. Claim of the one set of heirs was based upon the charter of Lord Baltimore of June, 1632, and that of the others upon the grant of King James II. to Lord Culpeper, afterwards owned by Fairfax, to which we have already referred.\n After making reference to the award of the commission to fix the Virginia and Maryland boundary, appointed in 1877, fixing the line and boundary at low-water mark on the Virginia shore, to which arbitration the state of West Virginia was not a party, this court dispossed of the controversy, irrespective of that award, in the following language, used by Mr. Justice Shiras in delivering the opinion of the court:\n'Whether the result of this arbitration and award is to be regarded as establishing what the true boundary always was, and that therefore the grant to Thomas, Lord Culpeper, never of right included the Potomac river, or as establishing a compromise line, effective only from the date of the award, we need not determine. For, even if the latter be the correct view, we agree with the conclusion of the court below, that, upon all the evidence, the charter granted to Lord \n\n[217 U.S. 1, 46]\n\u00a0\n Baltimore by Charles I., in 1632, of the territory known as the province of Maryland, embraced the Potomac river and the soil under it, and the islands therein, to high-water mark on the southern or Virginia shore; that the territory and title thus granted to Lord Baltimore, his heirs and assigns, were never devested by any valid proceedings prior to the Revolution; nor was such grant affected by the subsequent grant to Lord Culpeper.\n\n'The record discloses no evidence that, at any time, any substantial claim was ever made by Lord Fairfax, heir at law of Lord Culpeper, or by his grantees, to property rights in the Potomac river, or in the soil thereunder, nor does it appear that Virginia ever exercised the power to grant ownership in the islands or soil under the river to private persons. Her claim seems to have been that of political jurisdiction.'\n\n We think this decision disposes of and denies this claim of the state of West Virginia in her cross bill.\n Upon the whole case, the conclusions at which we have arrived, we believe, best meet the facts disclosed in this record, are warranted by the applicable principles of law and equity, and will least disturb rights and titles long regarded as settled and fixed by the people most to be affected. If this decision can possibly have a tendency to disturb titles derived from one state or the other, by grants long acquiesced in, giving the force and right of prescription to the ownership in which they are held, it will no doubt be the pleasure, as it will be the manifest duty, of the lawmaking bodies of the two states, to confirm such private rights upon principles of justice and right applicable to the situation.\n A decree should be entered settling the rights of the states to the western boundary, and fixing the same, as we have hereinbefore indicated, to be run and established along the old line known as the Deakins or old state line; and commissioners should be appointed to locate and establish said line as near as may be. The cross bill of the state of West Virginia should be dismissed in so far as it asks for a decree fix- \n\n[217 U.S. 1, 47]\n\u00a0\n ing the north bank of the Potomac river as her boundary. Counsel for the respective states are given forty days from the entry hereof to agree upon three commissioners, and to present to the court for its approval a decree drawn according to the directions herein given, in default of which agreement and decree this court will appoint commissioners, and itself draw the decree in conformity herewith. Costs to be equally divided between the states.\n Decree accordingly. \n\n\n\n","161":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF MD. v. STATE OF W.VA.(1910)\n\nArgued: Decided: April 20, 1910\n\n\n Decree entered May 31, 1910.\n Mr. Isaac Lobe Straus for complainant.\n Messrs. William G. Conley and George E. Price for defendant.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n In accordance with the opinion of this court handed \n\n[217 U.S. 577, 578]\n\u00a0\n down February 21, 1910 (\n217 U.S. 1\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 268), the learned counsel for the state of Maryland and West Virginia have submitted in accordance with the conclusions announced in accordance with he conclusions announced by this court.\n The differences in the proposed decrees are: First, concerning the boundary of Maryland along the south bank of the Potomac river, from a point at or near Harper's Ferry, westwardly to the point where the north and south line from the Fairfax stone crosses the North Banch of the Potomac river, should that boundary line be located at high-water mark, as contended by counsel for the state of Maryland, or at low-water mark, as contended by counsel for the state of West Virginia? In the opinion heretofore delivered in this case, it was declared that the claim of the state of West Virginia for a location of her boundary line along the north bank of the Potomac river should be denied. This conclusion was reached upon the authority of the case of Morris v. United States, \n174 U.S. 196\n, 43 L. ed. 946, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 649. In the Morris Case it was held, in a contention between a title holder whose rights originated with the grant of 1632 to Lord Baltimore, and one whose rights originated under the grant of James II. to Lord Culpeper, that the grant to Lord Baltimore included the Potomac river to high-water mark on the southern or Virginia shore. As West Virginia is but the successor of Virginia in title, the conclusion thus announced in the Morris Case necessarily denied her claim to the Potomac river to the north bank thereof, and a decree was directed dismissing the cross bill of West Virginia, in which such a claim was made.\n In the former hearing, however, and in the decision rendered, the attention of the court was not directed to the question whether the boundary of Maryland should be at high-water mark or at low-water mark, along the southern bank of the Potomac river. \n\n[217 U.S. 577, 579]\n\u00a0\n As stated in the former opinion, after the state of West Virginia was created, an arbitration was had between the states of Virginia and Maryland, and the Virginia boundary was fixed at low-water mark on the south shore of the Potomac. See Code of Virginia, vol. 1, title 3, chap. 3 ,  13, p. 18. This location of the boundary between Maryland and Virginia was accepted by the state of Maryland, and definitely fixed as the line between herself and the state of Virginia. The arbitration of 1877 was before eminent lawyers, and an elaborate opinion was rendered by them. They reached the conclusion that following the description in the charter of Charles I. to Lord Baltimore, the right or south bank of the Potomac river, at high-water mark, was the boundary between Maryland and Virginia. This conclusion is in accordance with the one reached by this court in the Morris Case, in which case it was declared that the province of Maryland, under the charter of Lord Baltimore, embraced the Potomac river to high- water mark on the southern, or Virginia, shore, and the court then declared that this title had not been devested by any valid proceedings prior to the Revolution, nor was it affected by the subsequent grant to Lord Culpeper; and therefore, as between the claimants under the old grant to Lord Baltimore and the one to Lord Culpeper, that the title of the claimants under the Baltimore grant embraced the Potomac river the high- water mark on the Virginia shore. But the arbitrators proceeding to establish the boundary between the states in the light of subsequent events, after referring to the effect of long occupation upon the rights of states and nations, and declaring that the length of time that raises a right by prescription in private parties likewise raises such a presumption in favor of states, as well as private parties, took up the location of the boundary between the states along the Potomac river, and said:\n'The evidence is sufficient to show that Virginia, from \n\n[217 U.S. 577, 580]\n\u00a0\n the earliest period of her history, used the south bank of the Potomac as if the soil to low-water mark had been her own. She did not give this up by her Constitution of 1776, when she surrendered other claims within the charter limits of Maryland; but, on the contrary, she expressly reserved 'the property of the Virginia shores or strands bordering on either of said rivers (Potomac or Pocomoke) and all improvements which have or will be made thereon.' By the compact of 1785, Maryland assented to this, and declared that 'the citizens of each state respectively shall have full property on the shores of the Potomac, and adjoining their lands, with all emoluments and advantages thereunto belonging, and the privilege of making and carrying out wharves and other improvements.'\n\n ... * *\n'Taking all together, we consider it established that Virginia has a proprietary right on the south shore to low-water mark, and, appurtenant thereto, has a privilege to erect any structures connected with the shore which may be necessary to the full enjoyment of her riparian ownership, and which shall not impede the free navigation or other common use of the river as a public highway.\n\n'To that extent Virginia has shown her rights on the river so clearly as to make them indisputable.'\n\n The compact of 1785 (See Code of Virginia, vol. 1, title 3, chap. 3,  13, p. 16) is set up in this case, and its binding force is preserved in the draft of decrees submitted by counsel for both states. We agree with the arbitrators in the opinion above expressed, that the privileges therein reserved respectively to the citizens of the two states on the shores of the Potomac are inconsistent with the claim that the Maryland boundary on the south side of the Potomac river shall extend to high-water mark. There is no evidence that Maryland has claimed any right to make grants on that side of the river, and the privileges \n\n[217 U.S. 577, 581]\n\u00a0\n reserved to the citizens of the respective states in the compact of 1785, and its subsequent ratifications, indicate the intention of each state to maintain riparian rights and privileges to its citizens on their own side of the river.\n This conclusion gives to Maryland a uniform southern boundary along Virginia and West Virginia, at low-water mark on the south bank of the Potomac river to the intersection of the north and south line between Maryland and West Virginia, established by the decree in this case. This conclusion is also consistent with the previous exercise of political jurisdiction by the states respectively.\n The decree will therefore provide for the south bank of the Potomac river at low-water mark on the West Virginia shore as the true southern boundary line of the state of Maryland.\n The other contention in the case concerns the costs of the surveys made by the surveyors of the respective states. It is the contention of Maryland that they should be equally divided, while West Virginia contends that each state should bear its own expense in this respect. An examination of the record shows that early in the proceedings in this case, on the 26th day of May, 1894, an order was entered by consent of parties, which authorized a survey to be made by surveyors, to be agreed upon in writing by counsel for the respective states, said surveyor or surveyors to return to this court a report and map or maps made by him or them under the order, together with copies of such report, map, or maps. The order provided for notice to be given attorneys for both parties of the time and place of commencing such surveys. Subsequently surveyors were designated, surveys were made, and elaborate reports were filed in this court. Under these circumstances we are of opinion that the order heretofore made concerning the divison of the costs should include the costs of such surveys. As was said by this court in Nebraska v. Iowa, \n143 \nU.S. 359, 370\n, 36 S. L. ed. 186, 190, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 396, \n\n[217 U.S. 577, 582]\n\u00a0\n in making an order for a division of costs between the two states in a boundary dispute, the matter involved is governmental in character, in which each party has a real, and yet not a litigious, interest. The object to be obtained is the settlement of a boundary line between sovereign states in the interest, not only of property rights, but also in promotion of the peace and good order of the communities; and is one which the states have a common interest to bring to a satisfactory and final conclusion. Where such is the nature of the cause we think the expenses should be borne in common, so far as may be, and we therefore adopt so much of the decree proposed by the state of Maryland as makes provision for the costs of the surveys made under the order of this court.\n We append the decree to be entered:\n Decree.\n This cause came on to be heard at this term and was argued by counsel; and thereupon, on consideration thereof, it was adjudged and decreed as follows:\n First. That the true boundary line between the states of Maryland and West Virginia is ascertained and established as follows:\n Beginning at the common corner of the states of Maryland and Virginia, on the southern bank of the Potomac river, at low-water mark, at or near the mouth of the Shenandoah river (near Harper's Ferry), and running thence with the southern bank of the said Potomac river, at low-water mark, and with the southern bank of the North Branch of the Potomac river at low- water mark, to the point where the north and south line from the Fairfax stone crosses the said North Branch of the Potomac, and thence running northerly, as near as may be, with the Deakins or Old State line to the line of the state of Pennsylvania.\n Second. That Julius K. Monroe, William McCulloch \n\n[217 U.S. 577, 583]\n\u00a0\n Brown, and Samuel S. Gannett be, and they are hereby, appointed commissioners to run, locate, and establish, and permanently mark with suitable mounments, the said Deakins or Old State line as the boundary line between the states of Maryland and West Virginia, from said point on the southern bank of the North Branch of the Potomac river to the said Pennsylvania line, in accordance with the opinion of this court, heretofore filed in this case, and with this decree; the said line to be run and located as far as practicable as it has been generally recognized and adopted by the people residing about or near the same, as the boundary line between the said states, and not as conforming, except to a limited extent, to the western boundary of the Maryland military lots, as said lots are now located and held. Said commissioners shall mark said line as run, located, and established by them, with suitable stone monuments, at reasonable and proper intervals, according to the topography of the country.\n It is further ordered that, before entering upon the discharge of their duties, each of said commissioners shall be duly sworn to perform faithfully, impartially, and without prejudice or bias, the duties herein imposed; said oath to be taken before the clerk of this court, or before either of the clerks of the circuit courts of the United States for the district of Maryland or for the northern district of West Virginia, or before an officer authorized by law to administer an oath in the state of Maryland or of West Virginia, and returned with their report; that said commissioners may arrange for their organization, their meetings, and the particular manner of the performance of their duties, and are authorized to adopt all ordinary and legitimate methods in the ascertainment of the true location of said boundary line, including the taking of evidence under oath and calling for papers and documents; but in the event evidence is taken, the parties shall be notified and permitted to be present and cross-examine \n\n[217 U.S. 577, 584]\n\u00a0\n the witnesses; and all evidence taken by the commissioners and all exceptions thereto and action thereon shall be preserved and certified and returned with their report.\n Said commissioners are also at liberty to refer to and consult the printed record in the cause so far as they may think proper to enable them to discharge their duties under this decree.\n It is further ordered that the clerk of this court shall at once forward to the governor of each of said states of Maryland and West Virginia, and to each of the commissioners appointed by this decree, a copy of this decree, duly authenticated. And said commissioners are authorized, if they deem it necessary, to request the co-operation and assistance of the state authorities in the performance of the duties imposed on them by this decree.\n It is further ordered that said commissioners do proceed, with all convenient despatch, to discharge their duties in running, locating, establishing, and marking said line, as herein directed, and make their report thereof and of their proceedings in the premises to this court on or before the 1st day of January, 1911, together with a complete bill of costs and charges annexed.\n It is further ordered that should vacancies occur in said board of commissioners by reason of death, the refusal to act, or inability to perform the duties required by this decree, the chief justice of this court is hereby authorized and empowered to appoint other commissioners to supply such vacancies, and said chief justice is authorized to act on such information in the premises as may be satisfactory to himself.\n It is further ordered that all the costs of the proceedings by said commissioners under this decree, including a remuneration of not exceeding fifteen dollars ($15) per day and his reasonable expenses for each commissioner whilst actually engaged in the performance of his duties \n\n[217 U.S. 577, 585]\n\u00a0\n hereunder, and the other costs incident to the running, locating, establishing, and marking said line, shall be paid by the states of Maryland and West Virginia equally.\n Third. That the cross bill of the state of West Virginia, in so far as it asks for a decree fixing the north bank of the Potomac river as the boundary line between said states, be, and the same is hereby, dismissed.\n Fourth. That this decree shall not be construed as abrogating or setting aside the compact made between commissioners of the state of Maryland and the state of Virginia at Mount Vernon, on the 28th day of March, 1785, and which was confirmed by the general assembly of Maryland, and afterwards by act of the general assembly of Virginia, passed on the 3d day of January, 1786, but the said compact, except so far as it may have been superseded by the provisions of the Constitution of the United States, or may be inconsistent with this decree, shall remain obligatory upon and between the states of Maryland and West Virginia, so far as it is applicable to that part of the Potomac river which extends along the border of said states, as ascertained and established by this decree.\n Fifth. That all the costs in this case and the proceedings therein, as the same shall be taxed by the clerk of this court, and including also the costs of the surveys made by the two states under the order or orders of this court, said costs for said surveys to be ascertained and taxed by the clerk of this court upon vouchers sworn to and exhibited to him, shall be equally divided between the said two states. \n\n\n\n","162":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF NORTH DAKOTA EX REL FLAHERTY v.

S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2100, a special tax of $25 is imposed on retail dealers in liquors, as therein defined, and a tax of $20 on a retail dealer in malt liquors. By Rev. Stat.  3232 and 3233 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2091), a person is forbidden to engage in or carry on any trade or business made subject to a special tax until the tax has been paid; and it is made the duty of one engaging in a trade or business on which a special tax is imposed by law \n\n[215 U.S. 515, 518]\n\u00a0\n to register with the collector of the district 'his name or style, place of residence, trade or business, and the place where such trade or business is to be carried on.'

So also anyone carrying on a business made liable to a special tax without payment of the tax is subject to fine and imprisonment under  16 of the act of 1875\n\n\n By other sections of the Revised Statutes it is provided as follows.\n'Sec. 3240. Each collector of internal revenue shall, under regulations of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, place and keep conspicuously in his office, for public inspection, an alphabetical list of the names of all persons who shall have paid special taxes within his district, and shall state thereon the time, place, and business for which such special taxes have been paid.\n\n ... * *\n'Sec. 3243. The payment of any tax imposed by the internal-revenue laws for carrying on any trade or business shall not be held to exempt any person from any penalty or punishment provided by the laws of any state for carrying on the same within such state, or in any manner to authorize the commencement or continuance of such trade or business contrary to the laws of such state, or in places prohibited by municipal law; nor shall the payment of any such tax be held to prohibit any state from placing a duty or tax on the same trade or business, for state or other purposes.'\n\n The state of North Dakota, on March 13, 1907, enacted a law requiring a registration and publication of any receipt, stamp, or license, showing the payment of the special tax levied under the laws of the United \n\n[215 U.S. 515, 519]\n\u00a0\n States upon the business of selling distilled, malted, and fermented liquor. Briefly, the law provides as follows: A notice of the particulars contained in the receipt or license, and other details respecting the place where the tax receipt or license is posted, etc., is required to be made for three weeks in official newspapers, and the fees for publication are declared to be the same 'as allowed by law for the publication of other legal notices.' The holder of the receipt or license is also required to place and keep posted, at all times, with the government tax receipts or license, an affidavit of the fact of publication and the obtaining of such license, etc., together with a copy of the notices or advertisements. A duly authenticated copy of the tax receipt or license is required to be filed with a named official, to whom a ten-dollar filing fee is to be paid, and such official is required to publish, in certain official newspapers, the first week in each month, a list of all such tax receipts or licenses filed during the previous month, such notice to be published one week in each newspaper.\n Upon complaint made before a committing magistrate for the county of Grand Forks, state of North Dakota, R. E. Flaherty, by the name of R. C. Flarty, was held to answer upon a charge of neglecting to register and publish a government receipt for the payment of an internal revenue tax on the business of a retail dealer in malt liquors. Having been committed to the custody of the sheriff, Flaherty unsuccessfully made application for a writ of habeas corpus to a judge of the state district court. Afterwards a similar application was made to the supreme court of the state, and the writ was granted by that court, but, upon hearing, the writ was quashed. 16 N. D. 347, 113 N. W. 371. This writ of error was thereupon prosecuted.\n The detention complained of was asserted to be illegal upon the ground that the law upon which the prosecution was based was repugnant to the state and Federal Constitutions. We, of course, have to deal solely with the claim of alleged repugnancy to the Constitution of the United States. \n\n[215 U.S. 515, 520]\n\u00a0\n The law of North Dakota, which we have already summarized, is in the margin. \n The state court was of opinion that the law made the person\n An Act Providing for the Publication and Registration of Special Tax Receipts or Licenses from the Government of the United States to Sell Distilled, Malt, and Fermented Liquors, Issued to Persons in North Dakota, the Payment and Collection of Registration Fees and Publication Fees, Regulating the Posting and Exhibiting of Such Tax Receipts of Licenses, Prescribing the Duties of Officials and Owners and Lessors of Property in Relation Thereto, Prescribing Penalties for Failure to Perform the Duties Prescribed, and Other Regulations Pertaining to the Sale of Intoxicating Liquors.\n Be it enacted by the Legislative Assembly of the State of North Dakota:\n Sec. 1. Liquor License. Tax Receipt Must Be Registered.-Every receipt, stamp, or license showing payment of the special tax levied under the laws of the United States upon the business of selling distilled, malt, or fermented liquor, issued to or held by any person, firm, or corporation in this state, shall be registered and published as in this act required.\n Sec. 2. Notice to Be Published. Contains What.-Immediately upon posting or displaying the special tax receipt or license mentioned in said  1 of this act, as required under government regulations, it shall be the duty of the person in whose name such tax receipt or license is issued to cause to be published for three successive weeks in the official newspaper of the county, and for the same period in the official newspaper of the city, within an incorporated city, a notice which shall contain the following information: Name of person to whom the government tax receipt or license is issued; date of special tax receipt or license; description of property where said tax receipt or license is posted, and, if within an incorporated city, the number of the lot and block and street number, and setting forth specifically the room, building, or place where said tax receipt or license is posted; the name of the owner and the name of the lessor of the property in which said tax receipt or license is posted. Upon discontinuance of business or removal of the special tax receipt or license mentioned in  1 of this act to another building or place, a similar notice containing the information prescribed in this section shall be published in the same manner prescribed herein, and setting forth further the fact of removal, giving date and description of place to which such removal is made as fully as in the original notice. \n\n[215 U.S. 515, 521]\n\u00a0\n who had paid the special United States tax and taken a receipt therefor subject to the burdens which the law imposed, wholly without reference to whether such person so paying the tax \n\n[215 U.S. 515, 522]\n\u00a0\n and taking the receipt had posted the same, as required by the laws of the United States, or done any act within the state. The court said:\n'The argument of petitioner's counsel, to the effect that the act applies only to those persons who have complied with the Federal statute with reference to posting the receipts for the payment of such tax is, we think, unsound. While  2 of the act, when given a literal construction, and without considering the other portions of the act, would appear to sustain petitioner's contention in this respect, we think it apparent that when the whole act is construced together, the legislative intent that the same shall apply to all who have paid the Federal tax is apparent, and such intent must be given effect.'\n\n Considering the contention that the sole purpose was to burden the person who made a payment of a tax to the United \n\n[215 U.S. 515, 523]\n\u00a0\n States, and thus in effect hinder the making of such payments, the court said:\n'Such is not the scope nor intent of the act, as we construe it, but, on the contrary, the obvious purpose sought to be accomplished by its enactment was to furnish knowledge to the public and all concerned of the fact that the persons who have paid such tax to the government are or may become engaged in the business of selling intoxicating liquors contrary to the laws of this state. Its purpose, in other words, was solely to furnish knowledge to aid in the enforcement of our statute against the unlawful traffic in intoxicating liquors.\n\n ... * *\n'The legislature, in enacting this law, merely did what it had the unquestioned right to do under the police power of the state. Such power is very broad, and is limited only by the Constitution and laws of the United States and the Constitution of this state. That the legislature has the right, within the police power of the state, to provide that the possession of an internal revenue tax receipt for the payment of the government tax upon the occupation of retail dealer in fermented and distilled liquors shall constitute prima facie evidence that the possessor is violating or has violated the prohibition law of this state is too well settled to admit of serious doubt. 23 Cyc. Law & Proc. p. 255 and cases cited. Yet such a law is no less free from the objection urged by petitioner's counsel than is the act in question. If such a law is constitutional, then why cannot the legislature also enact a law making it a public offense for any citizen of the state to procure such a receipt, and neglect or refuse to furnish a public record thereof, and to give the most complete publicity to the fact of its issuance? Such a law would certainly have a tendency to aid in the better enforcement of the law against such illegal traffic, and we are aware of no provision, either in the Federal Constitution or statutes, or in the Constitution of the state, which directly or impliedly prohibits such legislation.'\n\n As thus interpreted, the law was held not to be repugnant to \n\n[215 U.S. 515, 524]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution of the United States, and to be but a lawful exercise of the police power of the state to regulate the traffic in liquor within the state.\n The errors assigned insist that the statute, as thus construed, is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States: First, because, under the guise of the exertion of the police power of the state, the law really imposes a burden directly upon the exertion by the government of the United States of its lawful power of taxation, and because, even if this be not the case, the conditions and requirements of the statute are so in conflict with the act of Congress concerning the payment of the tax and the issuance of the receipt as to amount to a direct burden upon the constitutional power of Congress to tax.\n The propositions, which are in substance one and the same, we think are well founded. Under the construction placed upon the statute by the court below we see no escape from the conclusion that it immediately and directly places a burden upon the lawful taxing power of the United States, or, what is equivalent thereto, places the burden upon the person who pays the United States tax, solely because of the payment of such tax, and wholly without reference to the doing by the person of any act within the state which is subject to the regulating authority of the state. That the attempted exertion of such a power is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States is so elementary as to require nothing but statement.

Rep. 92. \n\n[215 U.S. 515, 525]\n\u00a0\n But if the mere form in which the burdens imposed by the statute be disregarded and their essence be considered, nevertheless we are of the opinion that the statute must be held to be repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. This follows, because it is clear that, in principle, a state may not so exert its police power as to directly hamper or destroy a lawful authority of the government of the United States. Here, again, the doctrine is elementary, and finds clear and consistent expression in the cases previously cited. Its potentiality, however, as applied to the case in hand, is so pointedly illustrated by the case of United States v. Snyder, \n149 U.S. 210\n, 37 L. ed. 705, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 846, that we briefly refer to that decision. In that case a circuit court of the United States had refused to enforce, in favor of the United States, a lien upon real estate for taxes under the internal revenue laws, on the ground that the lien, or assessment for the tax, had not been recorded in the mortgage records for the parish of Orleans, where the real estate in question was situated, as required by the laws of Louisiana, and that the proceeding to enforce the lien had not been brought within the period fixed by the state law. The circuit court, therefore, in effect, had held that it was in the power of the state to burden, control, or regulate the right of the United States to assess and collect taxes under its constitutional power of taxation. In deciding that this view was unsound, it was said:\n'The power of taxation has always been regarded as a necessary and indispensable incident of sovereignty. A government that cannot, by self- administered methods, collect from its subjects the means necessary to support and maintain itself in the execution of its functions, is a government merely in name. If the United States, proceeding in one of their own courts, in the collection of a tax admitted to be legitimate, can be thwarted by the plea of a state statute prescribing that such a tax must be assessed and recorded under state regulation, and limiting the time within which such tax shall be a lien, it would follow that the potential existence of the \n\n[215 U.S. 515, 526]\n\u00a0\n government of the United States is at the mercy of state legislation.\n\n'Moreover, it scarcely seems necessary to look beyond the Constitution itself for a decisive reply to the question we are now considering. The eight section of the first article declares that 'the Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises . . . but all duties, imposts, and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States.' The power to impose and collect the public burthens is here given in terms as absolute as the language affords. The provision exacting uniformity throughout the United States itself imports a system of assessment and collection under the exclusive control of the general government. And both the grant of the power and its limitation are wholly inconsistent with the proposition that the states can by legislation interfere with the assessment of Federal taxes, or set up a limitation of time within which they must be collected.'\n\n Undoubtedly, as suggested by the court below, there are decisions of state courts holding that, in a proceeding to enforce a penalty or to punish for a violation of a state law as to the sale of liquor, the payment of the special United States tax and taking of a receipt therefor by the defendant may be offered in evidence, and creates a prima facie presumption that the person paying the tax and holding the receipt was engaged in the business of selling liquor. Without in anywise intimating an opinion as to the soundness of the decisions thus referred to, and assuming only for the purpose of the argument their correctness, we yet fail to see how in any respect they can be considered persuasive as to the compatibility of the statute here under consideration with the Constitution of the United States.\n Nor is there merit in the contention that the cases of Allen v. Riley, \n203 U.S. 347\n, 51 L. ed. 216, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 95, 8 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 137, Woods v. Carl, \n203 U.S. 358\n, 51 L. ed. 219, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 99, and Ozan Lumber Co. v. Union County Nat. Bank, \n207 U.S. 251\n, 52 L. ed. 195, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 89, tend to support the proposition that the statute in question was a valid exercise of the police power of the state, and not a \n\n[215 U.S. 515, 527]\n\u00a0\n direct burden upon the taxing power of the government of the United States. In the cases relied upon it was but held that certain state statutes regulating the sale within a state of patent rights or patented articles were valid because but a reasonable exertion of the police powers of the state over acts done in the state, and were hence not inconsistent with the legislation of Congress over the subject. But that, as we have stated, is not the character of the legislation here involved. Indeed, testing the provision of the law under consideration by the criterion of reasonableness which was applied in the cases relied upon, it becomes manifest that the act here in question is directly antagonistic to the legislation of Congress concerning the subject with which the state statute deals, since that statute adds onerous burdens and conditions in addition to those for which the act of Congress provides, and which burdens are, therefore, inconsistent with the paramount right of Congress to exert, within the limits of the Constitution, an untrammeled power of taxation.\n Reversed and remanded.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice McKenna, and Mr. Justice Holmes dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n Sec. 3.

The plaintiff had a decree in the court of appeals for the District of Columbia, and the defendant appealed. 31 App. D. D. 29. defendant appealed. 31 App. D. C. 29. as follows: 'This agreement, made by and between L. A. Griffith, duly authorized agent and attorney, under a certain power of at- \n\n[217 U.S. 323, 327]\n\u00a0\n torney from Alfred W. Ball, both of Prince George's county, Maryland, parties of the first part, and Wm. W. Stewart of Washington, District of Columbia, of the second part. Witnesseth that the said W. W. Stewart has paid to the said L. A. Griffith, agent, the sum of five hundred dollars ($ 500) part purchase price of the total sum to be paid for a certain tract of land, owned by the said Alfred W. Ball,' in Maryland, as described, 'same being sold at the rate of $40 per acre.' 'And the said L. A. Griffith, as the agent and duly authorized attorney of said Alfred W. Ball, hereby grants, bargains, and sells, and agrees to convey by proper deed . . . duly executed by the said Ball to the said Stewart, the said 240 acres of land upon further payments and conditions hereinafter named, to wit: The balance of one half of the purchase price of the said 240 acres, more or less, at the rate of $40 per acre, is to be paid to the party of the first part on the 7th day of November, 1903, and the remaining one half of the total purchase price is to be divided into five equal payments, secured by five promissory mortgage notes, secured by purchase-money mortgage upon the said property, to be given by the said Stewart and wife,' with immaterial details. A burial lot of one acre is reserved, 'conditioned, however, that if the said Ball should desire to abandon the said burial tract. . . . he shall have paid to him therefor by the said party of the second part the sum of ($40) forty dollars,' etc. 'The said land is to be surveyed and a plat made thereof, and the total purchase price is to be at the rate of $40 per acre, as determined by the said survey; the cost of the said survey is to be borne equally by the said parties of the first part and the second parts; the said L. A. Griffith and W. W. Stewart each to pay one half of the total survey costs. Proper deed or deeds of conveyance and abstracts of title of the said land, based upon title search therefor, is to be made and by J. K. Roberts . . . showing clear and unencumbered fee-simple title, in the said land above mentioned and described, in the said Alfred W. Ball, and one half of the total costs for \n\n[217 U.S. 323, 328]\n\u00a0\n same, not exceeding $50, is to be borne equally by the parties hereto. In case the remainder of the first half of the purchase price be not paid on November 7, 1903, then the said $500 so paid to the said Griffith is to be forfeited and the contract of sale and conveyance veyance to be null and void, and of no effect in law, otherwise to be and remain in full force . . . . The possessory right to all of the said premises on the property mentioned herein is to remain in the said Ball, until the one half payment of the total purchase price herein provided for on November 7th, 1903, has been fully paid and satisfied, to the said L. A. Griffith, agent. Witness our hands and seals this 5th day of June, 1903. L. A. Griffith. Wm. W. Stewart.' With seals.\n The first defense is based on this document itself. It is said that the defendant made no covenant, and therefore was free to withdraw if he chose to sacrifice the $500 that he had paid. This contention should be disposed of before we proceed to the other questions in the case. The argument is that the condition of forfeiture just stated and the consequence that the contract is to be void and of no effect in law disclose the only consequences of default on the purchaser's part, much as until well after Lord Coke's time the only consequence of breaking the condition of a bond was an obligation to pay the penalty. The obligor was held to have an election between performing the condition and payment. Bromage v. Genning, 1 Rolle Rep. 368; 1 Inst. 206b; Hulbert v. Hart (1682) 1 Vern. 133. Some circumstances were referred to in aid of this conclusion, but, as we think the meaning of the document plain, we shall not mention them, except in connection with other matters, further than to say that there is nothing that would change or affect our view.\n It sems to have been held within half a century after Hulbert v. Hart, that, under some circumstances, at least, a bond would be construed to import a promise of the event constituting the condition. Hopson v. Trevor ( 1723) 1 Strange, 533, s. c. 2 P. Wms. 191; Anonymous (1728) Mosely, 37; \n\n[217 U.S. 323, 329]\n\u00a0\n Roper v. Bartholomew, 12 Price, 797, 811, 822, 826, 832; Hooker v. Pynchon, 8 Gray, 550, 552. But in this case we are not confined to a mere implication of a promise from the penalty. The tenor of the 'agreement' throughout imports mutual undertakings. The $500 is paid as 'part purchase price of the total sum to be paid;' that is, that the purchaser agrees to pay. The land is described as 'being sold.' There are words of present conveyance, inoperative as such, but implying a concluded bargain, like the word 'sold' just quoted. So one half of the purchase price 'is to be' divided and the notes secured by mortgage 'to be given;' and in the case of the burial lot, Ball 'shall have paid to him' $40 if he elects to abandon it. Here is an absolute promise in terms which it would be unreasonable to make except on the footing of a similar promise as to the main parcel that the purchaser desired to get. We are satisfied that Stewart bound himself to take the land. See Wilcoxson v. Stitt, 65 Cal. 596, 52 Am. Rep. 310, 4 Pac. 629; Dana v. St. Paul Invest. Co. 42 Minn. 194, 44 N. W. 55. The condition plainly is for the benefit of the vendor, and hardly less plainly for his benefit alone, except so far as it may have fixed a time when Stewart might have called for performance if he had chosen to do so, which he did not. This being so, the word 'void' means voidable at the vendor's election, and the condition may be insisted upon or waived, at his choice. Knicker-bocker L. Ins. Co. v. Norton, \n96 U.S. 234\n, 24 L. ed. 689; Oakes v. Manufacturers' F. & M. Ins. Co. 135 Mass. 248, 249; Titus v. Glens Falls Ins. Co. 81 N. Y. 410, 419.\n Ball died on November 5 or 6, 1903, just before the date fixed by the contract for the payments (November 7). He left a will appointing Griffith his executor, and containing provisions to which we shall refer later. Before probate, Griffith wrote to Stewart as follows, on November 10:\n'I have consulted two lawyers and am satisfied that I am fully authorized and empowered to complete sale of land and give deed. It rests with you. Please let me know positively on or before Monday next (16th) what you intend to do. There is a proposition on hand from other sources, and I have under \n\n[217 U.S. 323, 330]\n\u00a0\n this will power to act. I will make private arrangements at once for the disposition of it, if you do not take it. If you do not meet the requirements, and satisfactory arrangements are not made before Monday, 16th, at 12 o'clock, please consider the matter ended. I think you entitled authority of the United States, which would shall get it, but I must do for the best interests of the estate, and I will gladly wait for you until Monday, 16th.' There is a suggestion in argument, not quite unwarranted by the language of this letter, that, so far as in Griffith's power, he then left the choice to Stewart whether to go on with the bargain or not. But apart from Griffith's lack of authority to change rights at that time, we are satisfied that the true import of the letter was politely to apply a spur to Stewart on the assumption that he had a bargain that he would not want to let go. The land was supposed to contain oil.\n\n The stipulations in the contract were performed on the part of the vendor, and it now may be assumed that Stewart's obligation is outstanding, although repudiated by him, and that the only question is whether it can be enforced by Griffith in this action. To be sure, there was some attempt on Stewart's part, earlier, to say that he merely represented an oil company, and that the company alone as bound; but this properly was abandoned at the argument,-Stewart's name is the only one appearing in the instrument, and he signed and sealed it, so that no such escape is open. Glenn v. Allison, 58 Md. 527; M'Ardle v. Irish Iodine & Marine Salts Mfg. Co. 15 Ir. C. L. Rep. 146, 153.\n Coming, then, to the question that remains, it is to be noticed as a preliminary that if Ball's executor could have maintained this suit in Maryland, where the land lies, he can maintain it here, where the defendant resides. D. C. Code,  329 [31 Stat. at L. 1242, chap. 854]. Some technical objections were raised before us as to the proof of the probate proceedings, but it sufficiently appears that Ball's will was proved and that the plaintiff qualified as executor under the same. \n\n[217 U.S. 323, 331]\n\u00a0\n By the Maryland Code, an executor may prosecute any personal action whatever, whether at law or in equity, that the testator might have prosecuted, except an action for slander. Code of 1888, art. 93,  104. And by  81 of the same article, the executor of a person who shall have made sale of real estate, and has died before receiving the purchase money, or conveying the same, may convey said real estate to the purchaser, and his deed shall be good and valid in law, and shall convey all the right, title, claim, and interest of such deceased person in such real estate as effectually as the deed of the party so dying would have conveyed the same; provided, the executor of the person so dying shall satisfy the orphans' court granting him administration that the purchaser has paid the full amount of the purchase money. These seem sufficient to make out the plaintiff's case, if there were nothing more. The proviso in the Maryland statute obviously must create a condition subsequent only, as it is not to be supposed that a purchaser would pay unless he got what he paid for at the same time. In substance, the Code points out the executor as the proper person to enforce the contract, gives him a right of action to that end, and empowers him to make the deed. We do not perceive how a conveyance could be questioned, if made by an executor upon a cotemporaneous payment of the price, in pursuance of a binding contract of his testator, even without obtaining antecedent authority from the orphans' court. Therefore we do not perceive why the executor is not entitled to require specific performance if he is ready to deliver a deed at the moment of receiving the price. In this case the executor obtained an order from the orphans' court, purporting to authorize him to complete the sale, as if it had been an application for leave to sell under  276. This seems to us to have been superfluous, but it did no harm, and it does not narrow the plaintiff's right to recover, by being set out as one of the foundations of the bill.\n Next, apart from statute, it would be going far in search of possible doubts to say that sufficient authority could not be \n\n[217 U.S. 323, 332]\n\u00a0\n derived from the will. The language is, 'I direct, authorize, and empower' the executor 'to have full and complete power and authority over my entire estate, real, personal, and mixed;' and it directs and empowers him to sell the testator's real estate at public sale, after one month's notice, upon such terms as he thinks proper. We are not inclined to disagree with the court of appeals in its opinion that the words, taken with the whole will, imply a devise of the legal title to his executor, and an authority sufficient to warrant his carrying out the sale. It is urged that the probate of the will does not establish it conclusively as to real estate, and that the heirs might attack it hereafter; but it is answered that, by the contract, the land had become personalty as against them, and that therefore, so far as this land is concerned, the will is safe from collateral attack. Moreover, as it is clear that the estate has and is subject to a binding contract, it is hard to see how it matters to the heirs who does the formal acts of accomplishment, so long as he is accountable to the orphans' court.\n No question was raised on either side as to the covenants of Stewart being enforceable only by Griffith personally, because the agreement was under seal, and Griffith alone was party to it. Berkeley v. Hardy, 5 Barn . & C. 355; Frontin v. Small, 2 Ld. Raym. 1418, 1419. It is enough to say that Stewart could not have profited by the suggestion, had it been made.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Harlan concurs in the result. \n\n\n\n","164":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTOFFELA v. NUGENT(1910)\nNo. 179\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 499, 500]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. J. Darlington, John J. Hawkins, and Thomas Armstrong, Jr., for appellant.\n Mr. Engene S. Ives for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a complaint in the nature of a bill in equity, brought by the appellee, Nugent, to set aside a deed and mortgage as a cloud upon his title to certain land. The defendant denied the allegations of the complaint, and filed a cross complaint to set aside the deed to the plaintiff. The case was tried before a judge without a jury, and he made findings of fact of which the following is an abridged statement. The land was subject to two mortgages held by the defendant, upon which a judgment of foreclosure had been rendered, the sum due being $15,700 and interest. Mrs. Heyl, the mortgagor and owner of the equity, sold and conveyed the land to Nugent on January 4, 1905, he agreeing to procure the payment of the mortgage and judgment liens. On January 9, the day before that fixed for the mortgage sale, the defendant, having knowledge of the conveyance to Nugent, and having evaded Nugent's efforts to pay the mortgage debt, induced Mrs. Heyl to convey a part of the premises to him absolutely, in satisfaction of $10,000, and to mortgage the residue for $5,700, and recorded the deeds before Nugent had recorded the deed to him. He also, with fraudulent intent to defeat Nugent's title, it is said, although the possibility is hard to conceive, satisfied of record the former mortgages and judgment liens, the only consideration for his act being the later deed and mortgage given by Mrs. Heyl. On these facts judgment was given for the plaintiff, conditioned upon his paying to the defendant $15,700, without interest, less $600 counsel fees and costs. The plaintiff appealed and the supreme court of the territory gave the plaintiff an unconditional judgment, on the ground that \n\n[217 U.S. 499, 501]\n\u00a0\n the defendant's conduct was voluntary, in pursuance of his fraudulent scheme, and that he had no claim as against Nugent to be relieved from the consequences of a collateral act. It was thought that the debt from Mrs. Heyl to Stoffela was a matter with which Nugent, in spite of his covenant to pay it, had no concern, the only question being the relative validity of the plaintiff's and defendant's titles. The defendant appealed to this court.\n We are of opinion that the judgment appealed from was wrong, and that the judgment of the court of first instance should be affirmed. It is true that the defendant acted fraudulently and knew what he was about. But a man, by committing a fraud, does not become an outlaw and caput lupinum. National Bank & L. Co. v. Petrie, \n189 \nU.S. 423, 425\n, 47 S. L. ed. 879, 880, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 512. He may have no standing to rescind his transaction, but when it is rescinded by one who has the right to do so, the courts will endeavor to do substantial justice, so far as is consistent with adherence to law. See Pullman's Palace Car Co. v. Central Transp. Co. \n171 \nU.S. 138, 150\n, 43 S. L. ed. 108, 113, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 808. If Nugent is allowed to have the land free of all charge, and the defendant's claim is extinguished, Nugent gets much more than he bargained for, and the defendant is deprived of his equitable interest in Nugent's covenant to pay the mortgage debt (Johns v. Wilson, \n180 U.S. 440\n, 40 L. ed. 613, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 445), and is made to lose a large sum rightly due to him, not from any necessity of justice, but simply because he has acted badly, and therefore any treatment is good enough for him. It is said that the discharge of the old mortgages was a collateral matter with which Nugent had no concern. If that were true, still justice might forbid Nugent to rely upon it. But it is not correct. The discharge and the new deeds, although different instruments, were parts of one transaction. Each was consideration for the other. As the plaintiff elects to do away with the consideration for the discharge, he must be taken to elect also to give up the discharge; or, to put it in another way, he must restore the defendant to the condition in which he stood before the re- \n\n[217 U.S. 499, 502]\n\u00a0\n scinded deeds were made.

Sugarman pleaded in bar that the plaintiff had retified his dealings because, with knowledge of all the facts, the plaintiff had taken a judgment against the bankrupt for $17,500, a part or all of which was money remaining in the bankrupt's hands of $30,000, alleged by the bill to have been paid to him by Sugarman in pursuance of the fraudulent scheme. A majority of the circuit court of appeals held the ratification made out, on the ground that, to get the judgment, the trustee had to rely upon a right inconsistent with that now set up. 15 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1267, 85 C.

The plaintiff appealed to this court.\n It is argued that the appeal was too late because not taken within thirty days after the degree, as required by *134 \n\n[218 U.S. 129, 134]\n\u00a0\n general orders in bankruptcy No. 36, for appeals under the act. But this is not an appeal under the act,  25, by authority of which the general order was adopted, and is not governed by that order. The appellate jurisdiction is under or is the same as that under the court of appeals act of March 3, 1891, chap. 517,  6, 26 Stat. at L. 828, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549. Knapp v.

We are quite ready to assume what the court below was at some trouble to establish that an act of election directed toward a third person may operate in rem and establish title as to all parties concerned. But the demand of the trustee on the bankrupt, even when enforced by a resort to the courts and by judgment, had no element of election about it. The legal title to the money had been in the bankrupt, and was transferred by the statute to the trustee. ( 70). He was entitled to have that money in his hands as against the bankrupt in any event, whether he decided to hand it back to Sugarman or to distribute it in dividends. The law had put him in the bankrupt's shoes with additional powers. Therefore to insist that the bankrupt should do what the statute required him to do was as consistent with a subsequent rescission of the bankrupt's fraudulent acquisition of title as with an affirmance of it. It had no relation to that question, except possibly to put the plaintiff in a position better to decide it.\n Decree reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 89 Fed. xiv, 32 C. C.

Kratz, Jr., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case presents a single question, which is involved in the construction of the statutes governing the District of Columbia. That question is, Under that statute may a wife bring an action to recover damages for an assault and battery upon her person by the husband?\n The declaration of the plaintiff is in the ordinary form, and in seven counts charges divers assaults upon her person by her husband, the defendant, for which the wife seeks to recover damages in the sum of $70, 000. An issue of law being made by demurrer to the defendant's pleas, the supreme court of the District of Columbia held that such action would not lie under the statute. Upon writ of error to the court of appeals of the District of Columbia, the judgment of the supreme court was affirmed. 31 App. D. C. 557, -- L.R.A.(N.S.) --, 14 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 879.\n At the common law the husband and wife were regarded as one,-the legal existence of the wife during coverture being merged in that of the husband; and, generally speaking, the wife was incapable of making contracts, of ac- \n\n[218 U.S. 611, 615]\n\u00a0\n quiring property or disposing of the same without her husband's consent. They could not enter into contracts with each other, nor were they liable for torts committed by one against the other. In pursuance of a more liberal policy in favor of the wife, statutes have been passed in many of the states looking to the relief of a married woman from the disabilities imposed upon her as a feme covert by the common law. Under these laws she has been empowered to control and dispose of her own property free from the constraint of the husband, in many instances to carry on trade and business, and to deal with third persons as though she were a single woman. The wife has further been enabled by the passage of such statutes to sue for trespass upon her rights in property, and to protect the security of her person against the wrongs and assaults of other.\n It is unnecessary to review these statutes in detail. Their obvious purpose is, in some respects, to treat the wife as a feme sole, and to a large extent to alter the common-law theory of the unity of husband and wife. These statutes, passed in pursuance of the general policy of emancipation of the wife from the husband's control, differ in terms, and are to be construed with a view to effectuate the legislative purpose which led to their enactment.\n It is insisted that the Code of the District of Columbia has gone so far in the direction of modifying the common-law relation of husband and wife as to give to her an action against him for torts committed by him upon her person or property. The answer to this contention depends upon a construction of  1155 of the District of Columbia Code. [31 Stat. at L. 1374, chap. 854.] That section provides:\n'Sec. 1155. Power of wife to trade and to sue and be sued.-Married women shall have power to engage in any business, and to contract, whether engaged in business or not, and to sue separately upon their contracts, and also \n\n[218 U.S. 611, 616]\n\u00a0\n to sue separately for the recovery, security, or protection of their property, and for torts committed against them, as fully and freely as if they were unmarried; contracts may also be made with them, and they may also be sued separately upon their contracts, whether made before or during marriage, and for wrongs independent of contract, committed by them before or during their marriage, as fully as if they were unmarried; and upon judgments recovered against them execution may be issued as if they were unmarried; nor shall any husband be liable upon any contract made by his wife in her own name and upon her own responsibility, nor for any tort committed separately by her out of his presence, without his participation or sanction: Provided, That no married woman shall have power to make any contract as surety or guarantor, or as accommodation drawer, acceptor, maker, or indorser.'\n\n In construing a statute the courts are to have in mind the old law and the change intended to be effected by the passage of the new. Reading this section, it is apparent that its purposes, among others, were to enable a married woman to engage in business and to make contracts free from the intervention or control of the husband, and to maintain actions separately for the recovery, security, and protection of her property. At the common law, with certain exceptions, not necessary to notice in this connection, the wife could not maintain an action at law except she be joined by her husband. Barber v. Barber, 21 How. 582, 589, 16 L. ed. 226, 228. For injuries suffered by the wife in her person or property, such as would give rise to a cause of action in favor of a feme sole, a suit could be instituted only in the joint name of herself and husband. 1 Cooley, Torts, 3d ed. 472, and cases cited in the note.\n By this District of Columbia statute the common law was changed, and, in view of the additional rights confered upon married women in  1155 and other sections of the Code, she is given the right to sue separately for \n\n[218 U.S. 611, 617]\n\u00a0\n redress of wrongs concerning the same. That this was the purpose of the statute, when attention is given to the very question under consideration, is apparent from the consideration of its terms. Married women are authorized to sue separately for 'the recovery, security, or protection of their property, and for torts committed against them as fully and freely as if they were unmarried.' That is, the limitation upon her right of action imposed in the requirement of the common law that the husband should join her was removed by the statute, and she was permitted to recover separately for such torts, as freely as if she were still unmarried. The statute was not intended to give a right of action as against the husband, but to allow the wife, in her own name, to maintain actions of tort which, at common law, must be brought in the joint names of herself and husband.\n This construction we think is obvious from a reading of the statute in the light of the purpose sought to be accomplished. It gives a reasonable effect to the terms used, and accomplishes, as we believe, the legislative intent, which is the primary object of all construction of statutes.\n It is suggested that the liberal construction insisted for in behalf of the plaintiff in error in this case might well be given, in view of the legislative intent to provide remedies for grievous wrongs to the wife; and an instance is suggested in the wrong to a wife rendered unable to follow the avocation of a seamstress by a cruel assault which might destroy the use of hand or arm; and the justice is suggested of giving a remedy to an artist who might be maimed and suffer great pecuniary damages as the result of injuries inflicted by a brutal husband.\n Apart from the consideration that the perpetration of such atrocious wrongs affords adequate grounds for relief under the statutes of divorce and alimony, this construction would, at the same time, open the doors of the courts to accusations of all sorts of one spouse against the other, \n\n[218 U.S. 611, 618]\n\u00a0\n and bring into public notice complaints for assault, slander, and libel, and alleged injuries to property of the one or the other, by husband against wife, or wife against husband. Whether the exercise of such jurisdiction would be promotive of the public welfare and domestic harmony is at least a debatable question. The possible evils of such legislation might well make the lawmaking power hesitate to enact it. But these and kindred considerations are addressed to the legislative, not the judicial, branch of the government. In cases like the present, interpretation of the law is the only function of the courts.\n An examination of this class of legislation will show that it has gone much further in the direction of giving rights to the wife in the management and control of her separate property than it has in giving rights of action directly against the husband. In no act called to our attention has the right of the wife been carried to the extent of opening the courts to complaints of the character of the one here involved.\n It must be presumed that the legislators who enacted this statute were familiar with the long-established policy of the common law, and were not unmindful of the radical changes in the policy of centuries which such legislation as is here suggested would bring about. Conceding it to be within the power of the legislature to make this alteration in the law, if it saw fit to do so, nevertheless such radical and far-reaching changes should only be wrought by language so clear and plain as to be unmistakable evidence of the legislative intention. Had it been the legislative purpose not only to permit the wife to bring suits free from her husband's participation and control, but to bring actions against him also for injuries to person or property as though they were strangers, thus emphasizing and publishing differences which otherwise might not be serious, it would have been easy to have expressed that intent in terms of irresistible clearness. \n\n[218 U.S. 611, 619]\n\u00a0\n We can but regard this case as another of many attempts which have failed, to obtain by construction radical and far-reaching changes in the policy of the common law, not declared in the terms of the legislation under consideration.\n Some of the cases of that character are: Bandfield v. Bandfield, 117 Mich. 80, 40 L.R.A. 757, 72 Am. St. Rep. 550, 75 N. W. 287; Abbott v. Abbott, 67 Me. 304, 24 Am. Rep. 27; Schultz v. Schultz, 89 N. Y. 644; Freethy v. Freethy, 42 Barb. 641; Peters v. Peters, 42 Iowa, 182.\n Nor is the wife left without remedy for such wrongs. She may resort to the criminal courts, which, it is to be presumed, will inflict punishment commensurate with the offense committed. She may sue for divorce or separation and for alimony. The court, in protecting her rights and awarding relief in such cases, may consider, and, so far as possible, redress her wrongs and protect her rights.\n She may resort to the chancery court for the protection of her separate property rights. 21 How. 582, 590. Whether the wife alone may now bring actions against the husband to protect her separate property, such as are cognizable in a suit in equity when brought through the medium of a next friend (21 How. supra), is a question not made or decided in this case.\n We do not believe it was the intention of Congress, in the enactment of the District of Columbia Code, to revolutionize the law governing the relation of husband and wife as between themselves. We think the construction we have given the statute is in harmony with its language, and is the only one consistent with its purpose.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia will be affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting:\n This is an action by a wife against her husband to recover damages for assault and battery. The declaration \n\n[218 U.S. 611, 620]\n\u00a0\n contains seven counts. The first, second, and third charge assault by the husband upon the wife on three several days. The remaining counts charge assaults by him upon her on different days named,-she being at the time pregnant, as the husband then well knew.\n The defendant filed two pleas,-the first that he was not guilty, the second that, at the time of the causes of action mentioned, the plaintiff and defendant were husband and wife, and living together as such.\n The plaintiff demurred to the second plea, and the demurrer was overruled. She stood by the demurrer, and the action was dismissed.\n The action is based upon  1151 and 1155 of the Code of the District [ 31 Stat. at L. 1373, 1374, chap. 854], which are as follows:\n'Sec. 1151. All the property, real, personal, and mixed, belonging to a woman at the time of her marriage, and all such property which she may acquire or receive after her marriage from any person whomsoever, by purchase, gift, grant, devise, bequest, descent, in the course of distribution, by her own skill, labor, or personal exertions, or as proceeds of a judgment at law or decree in equity, or in any other manner, shall be her own property as absolutely as if she were unmarried, and shall be protected from the debts of the husband, and shall not in any way be liable for the payment thereof: Provided, That no acquisition of property passing to the wife from the husband after coverture shall be valid if the same has been made or granted to her in prejudice of the rights of his subsisting creditors.'\n\n'Sec. 1155. Married women shall have power to engage in any business, and to contract, whether engaged in business or not, and to sue separately upon their contracts, and also to sue separately for the recovery, security, or protection of their property, and for torts committed against them, as fully and freely as if they were unmarried; contracts may \n\n[218 U.S. 611, 621]\n\u00a0\n also be made with them, and they may also be sued separately upon their contracts, whether made before or during marriage, and for wrongs independent of contract, committed by them before or during their marriage, as fully as if they were unmarried; and upon judgments recovered against them execution may be issued as if they were unmarried; nor shall any husband be liable upon any contract made by his wife in her own name and upon her own responsibility, nor for any tort committed separately by her out of his presence without his participation or sanction: Provided, That no married woman shall have power to make any contract as surety or as guarantor, or as accommodation drawer, acceptor, maker, or indorser.'\n\n The court below held that these provisions did not authorize an action for tort committed by the husband against the wife.\n In my opinion these statutory provisions, properly construed, embrace such a case as the present one. If the words used by Congress lead to such a result, and if, as suggested, that result be undesirable on grounds of public policy, it is not within the functions of the court to ward off the dangers feared or the evils threatened simply by a judicial construction that will defeat the plainly-expressed will of the legislative department. With the mere policy, expediency, or justice of legislation the courts, in our system of government, have no rightful concern. Their duty is only to declare what the law is, not what, in their judgment, it ought to be, leaving the responsibility for legislation where it exclusively belongs; that is, with the legislative department, so long as it keeps within constitutional limits. Now, there is not here, as I think, any room whatever for mere construction, so explicit are the words of Congress. Let us follow the clauses of the statute in their order. The statute enables the married woman to take, as her own, property of any kind, no matter how acquired by her, as well as the avails of \n\n[218 U.S. 611, 622]\n\u00a0\n her skill, labor, or personal exertions, 'as absolutely as if she were unmarried.' It then confers upon married women the power to engage in any business, no matter what, and to enter into contracts, whether engaged in business or not, and to sue separately upon those contracts. If the statute stopped here, there would be ground for holding that it did not authorize this suit. But the statute goes much farther. It proceeds to authorize married women 'also' to sue separately for the recovery, security, or protection of their property; still more, they may sue separately 'for torts committed against them, as fully and freely as if they were unmarried.' No discrimination is made, in either case, between the persons charged with committing the tort. No exception is made in reference to the husband, if he happens to be the party charged with transgressing the rights conferred upon the wife by the statute. In other words, Congress, by these statutory provisions, destroys the unity of the marriage association as it had previously existed. It makes a radical change in the relations of man and wife as those relations were at common law in this District. In respect of business and property, the married woman is given absolute control; in respect of the recovery, security, and protection of her property, she may sue separately in tort, as if she were unmarried; and in respect of herself, that is, of her person, she may sue separately as fully and freely as if she were unmarried, 'for torts committed against her.' So the statute expressly reads. But my brethren think that, notwithstanding the destruction by the statute of the unity of the married relation, it could not have been intended to open the doors of the courts to accusations of all sorts by husband and wife against each other; and therefore they are moved to add, by construction, to the provision that married women may 'sue separately. . . . for torts committed against them, as fully and freely as if they were unmarried,' these words: 'Provided, however, that \n\n[218 U.S. 611, 623]\n\u00a0\n the wife shall not be entitled, in any case, to sue her husband separately for a tort committed against her person.' If the husband violently takes possession of his wife's property and withholds it from her, she may, under the statute, sue him, separately, for its recovery. But such a civil action will be one in tort. If he injures or destroys her property, she may, under the statute, sue him, separately, for damages. That action would also be one in tort. If these propositions are disputed, what becomes of the words in the statute to the effect that she may 'sue separately for the recovery, security, and protection' of her property? But if they are conceded,-as I think they must be,-then Congress, under the construction now placed by the court on the statute, is put in the anomalous position of allowing a married woman to sue her husband separately, in tort, for the recovery of her property, but denying her the right or privilege to sue him separately, in tort, for damages arising from his brutal assaults upon her person. I will not assume that Congress intended to bring about any such result. I cannot believe that it intended to permit the wife to sue the husband separately, in tort, for the recovery, including damages for the detention, of her property, and at the same time deny her the right to sue him, separately, for a tort committed against her person.\n I repeat that with the policy, wisdom, or justice of the legislation in question this court can have no rightful concern. It must take the law as it has been established by competent legislative authority. It cannot, in any legal sense, make law, but only declare what the law is, as established by competent authority.\n My brethren feel constrained to say that the present case illustrates the attempt, often made, to effect radical changes in the common law by mere construction. On the contrary, the judgment just rendered will have, as I think, the effect to defeat the clearly expressed will of \n\n[218 U.S. 611, 624]\n\u00a0\n the legislature by a construction of its words that cannot be reconciled with their ordinary meaning.\n I dissent from the opinion and judgment of the court, and am authorized to say that Mr. Justice Holmes and Mr. Justice Hughes concur in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","168":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTIGLAO v. INSULAR GOVERNMENT OF PHILIPPINE ISLANDS(1910)\nNo. 37\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. Aldis B. Browne, Alexander Britton, J. H. Blount, and Evans Browne for plaintiff in error and appellant.\n\n\n\n[215 U.S. 410, 411]\n\u00a0\n Solicitor General Bowers and Mr. Paul Charlton for defendants in error and appellees.\n\n\n\n[215 U.S. 410, 414]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case comes by writ of error and appeal from a judgment of the supreme court of the Philippine Islands, affirming a judgment of the court of land registration, which denied registration of a tract of land. It is admitted that the facts as found by the two courts may be assumed to be true (Reavis v. Fianza, \n215 U.S. 16\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1); but apart from the concurrence of the courts below, the proper proceeding in a case of this kind is by writ of error, and therefore the appeal is dismissed (Carifio v. Insular Government, \n212 U.S. 449\n, 53 L. ed. 594, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 334). So much being established, the grounds on which the plaintiff in error can claim title may be stated in a few words. On July 13, 1873, the gobernadorcillo and principles of the town of Mabalacat, in the province of Pampanga, Luzon, executed an instrument, marked O. K. by the parish priest, purporting to grant the land, with qualifications not needing to be noticed, to one Rafael Lacson, under whom the plaintiff in error claims. Possession was held until 1885, and since then has been abandoned. The land was public land. The questions brought here were whether the original grant was valid, or, if not, whether the possession that followed it without interruption for ten years and more conferred title by prescription under the royal decree of June 25, 1880. This decree states the rule of prescription in the usual terms of the civil law. It confers ownership on those who shall establish that they have possessed the lands in question for the requisite time under just title and in good faith. See Civil Code, arts. 1957, 1952, 1953. \n\n[215 U.S. 410, 415]\n\u00a0\n As we understand the later briefs filed in behalf of the plaintiff in error, the vain attempt to justify the grant under the Recopilacion de Leyes de las Indias, bk. 4, title 12, Law 1, is given up, and therefore we shall spend no time upon that. There is, however, an effort to support it under a decree of January 4, 1813. I Reynolds, Spanish & Mexican Land Laws, 83. This was a scheme of the Cortes to reduce public and Crown lands to private ownership, after reserving one half for the public debt. When certain preliminaries had been accomplished, as to which we have no information, the other half was to be allotted in the first place to retired officers and soldiers who had served in the present war, etc., as a patriotrc reward. Of the remaining land, there was to be given, gratuitously and by lot, to every resident of the respective towns who applied, a tract, under certain limitations. The proceedings on these grants were to be had by the constitutional common councils, and the provincial deputations were to approve them. Although this decree purported to apply to Crown lands 'in the provinces beyond the sea' as well as to those in the Peninsula, it would seem, on the face of it, to have been intended for Spaniards, and to have had but doubtful reference to the antives of conquered territory.\n But there are other answers to the suggestion that are free from doubt. The decree has been said to have been repealed in the following year. United States v. Clarke, 8 Pet. 436, 455; 8 L. ed. 1001, 1008; Hall, Mexican Law, 48. But compare United States v. Vallejo, 1 Black, 541, 17 L. ed. 232; Hayes v. United States, \n170 \nU.S. 637, 653\n, 654 S., 42 L. ed. 1174, 1180, 1181, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 735. But even if it be assumed, as it is by the argument for the plaintiff in error, that either that or later legislation to similar effect instituted a working system in the Philippines,-a large assumption,-it is admitted that the conditions of the supposed gratuity were not fulfilled. Our attention has not been called to any law giving authority to the ill-defined body that attempted to make the grant. The land was not distributed by lot, and the essential requirement of approval \n\n[215 U.S. 410, 416]\n\u00a0\n by a higher authority was wholly neglected. In view of the admission to which we have referred, we find it unnecessary to follow the learned and able argument of the Solicitor-General. There is a hint, to be sure, that the grant may be presumed to have satisfied native custom, and may be sustained upon that ground. But such a notion would be a mongrel offspring of Spanish law and ignorance, and no reason is given for making the presumption other than a guess. Unauthorized grants of public lands by subordinate officials seem to have been a noticeable feature in other Spanish colonies. Whitney v. United States, \n181 \nU.S. 104, 114\n, 115 S., 45 L. ed. 771, 775, 776, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 565. The real object of the reference to the decree of 1813 is to found a claim of prescription by showing a just title for the possession which is proved to have been maintained for ten years.\n Lacson, the original grantee, held the land until 1881, when he conveyed it to Pedro Carrillo and his wife. Possession was abandoned in 1885 without further change of title. Therefore the only 'just title' to which the possession can be referred is the original grant. The phrase justo titulo is explained to mean a title such as to transfer the property,- Schmidt, Civil Law of Spain and Mexico, 289, 290; see Partidas, 1. 18, t. 29, p. 3; or, as it is defined in the Civil Code of a few years later than the decree of 1880, 'that which legally suffices to transfer the ownership or property right, the prescription of which is in question.'  1952. Of course, this does not mean that the titulo must have been effective in the particular case, for then prescription would be unnecessary. We assume, for instance, that if a private person in possession of Crown lands, seeming to be the owner, executed a formally valid conveyance under which his grantee held, supposing his title good, possession for ten years might create an indisputable right. But if the public facts known by the grantees showed that the conveyance to him was void, we understand that it would not constitute a starting point for the running of time, and that the grantee's actual belief \n\n[215 U.S. 410, 417]\n\u00a0\n would not help his case. Indeed, in such a case he would not be regarded as holding in good faith, within the requirement of the decree, because a man is not allowed to take advantage of his ignorance of law. The subject is fully expounded in Hayes v. United States, \n170 U.S. 637\n, 650, et seq., 42 L. ed. 1174, 1179, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 735.\n All that was done to give Lacson a lawful title was insufficient on its face. Therefore, on the facts known to him he was chargeable with knowledge that he had acquired no legal rights, and it was impossible that the period of prescription should begin to run from the date of the instrument under which he claimed. The possession of Carrillo and his successors, after the conveyance to him in 1881, was not maintained for ten years, and therefore the claim of the plaintiff in error must fail.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","169":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTITLE GUARANTY & TRUST CO.

Supp. 1909, p. 948, upon a bond given to the United States, as required by that act. The contract to secure which the bond was given was a contract by the Puget Sound Engine Works to build and deliver a single screw wooden steamer for the United States, and the main question in the case is whether the statute applies to a contract for such a chattel. If not, parties like the plaintiffs, who furnished labor or materials for the work, have no standing to maintain the suit. We proceed, as soon as may be, to dispose of that question, leaving details and minor objections to be taken up later in turn. It was raised by demurrer to the declaration, and subsequently by what was entitled an affirmative defense pleaded by the surety and a demurrer by the plaintiffs. The decision was for the plaintiffs, against the surety, in the circuit court of appeals. 89 C. C. A. 618, 163 Fed. 168.\n The amended statute requires any person 'entering into a formal contract with the United States for the construction of any public building, or the prosecution and completion of any public work, or for repairs upon any public building or public work, . . . to execute the usual penal bond . . . with the additional obligation that such contractor or contractors shall promptly make payments to all persons supplying him or them with labor and materials in the prosecution of the work.' It gives any person who has furnished labor or materials used in the construction or repair of any public work, which have not been paid for, the right to intervene in a suit upon the bond. In short, besides securing the United States, the act is intended to protect persons furnishing materials or labor 'for the construction of public works,' as the title \n\n[219 U.S. 24, 32]\n\u00a0\n declares. The question narrows itself accordingly to whether the steamer was a 'public work' within the meaning of the words as used.\n As a preliminary to the answer, it is relevant to mention that by article 3 of the contract, partial payments are provided for as the 'labor and materials furnished' equal certain percentages of the total, and that by article 4 'the portion of the vessel completed and paid for under said method of partial payments shall become the property of the United States,' although the contractor remains responsible for the care of the portion paid for, and by article 2 there is to be a final test of the vessel when completed. The vessel has been built and accepted, and is now in possession of the United States. Notwithstanding these facts, it was argued that the statute did not apply to the contract, because the laborers and materials had a lien by the state law; and that, even if the statute applied, they had lost their rights by not asserting them before the delivery of the vessel, as before that, it is said, the title did not pass to the United States. Among other things, this ended the right to subrogation that the surety might have claimed. But the very recent decision in United States v. Ansonia Brass & Copper Co. \n218 U.S. 452\n, 54 L. ed. 1107, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 49 [Nov. 28, 1910] establishes that the title to the completed portion of the vessel passed, as provided in article 4, and that the laborers and materialmen could not have asserted the lien supposed to exist.\n The case cited shows, therefore, that such claimants are within the policy of the statute. It also contains a strong intimation that they are within the meaning of its words. For it refers to the statute, and says that it was in recognition of the inability of such persons to take liens upon the public property of the United States that Congress passed the act, and adds that, in view of this purpose to provide protection for those who could not protect themselves, the statute has been given liberal construction by this court. \n\n[219 U.S. 24, 33]\n\u00a0\n See also United States use of Hill v. American Surety Co. \n200 U.S. 197\n, 50 L. ed. 437, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 168. The reference and comment when the attempt was made to enforce a lien under state laws would have had no relevance unless they had been intended to point out the true remedy available in such a case. The argument that the vessel was not a public work loses most of its force when it appears that the title was in the United States as soon as the first payment was made. Of course, public works usually are of a permanent nature, and that fact leads to a certain degree of association between the notion of permanence and the phrase. But the association is only empirical, not one of logic. Whether a work is public or not does not depend upon its being attached to the soil; if it belongs to the representative of the public, it is public, and we do not think that the arbitrary association that we have mentioned amounts to a coalescence of the more limited idea with speech so absolute that we are bound to read 'any public work' as confined to work on land. It is not necessary to discuss in detail some opinions from the Attorney General's office in cases where the title to the vessel did not pass that looked rather in the opposite direction. It is enough to say that there has been no such clear and established construction as to cause us to yield our own view. On the other hand, the decision of some other courts has been in accord with the judgment below and with what we now decide. United States use of Tidewater Steel Co. v. Perth Amboy Shipbuilding & Engineering Co. 137 Fed. 689, 693; American Surety Co. v. Lawrenceville Cement Co. 110 Fed. 717, 719; United States use of Standard Furniture Co. v. AEtna Indemnity Co. 40 Wash. 87, 82 Pac. 171.\n Another defense, set up in the same manner as the first, is that the United States should have been made a party; and, in connection with this, a further one, that the suit cannot be maintained unless the plaintiff has applied, as provided in the statute, for a copy of the bond, and furnished an affidavit that labor or materials have been supplied \n\n[219 U.S. 24, 34]\n\u00a0\n by him for the prosecution of the work. The latter is the more substantial, as, of course, the suit was begun in the name of the United States, to the real plaintiffs use. But the objection is not serious in either form. No suit had been brought by the United States for more than six months from the completion of the work, affidavits were made and copies filed by interveners, and in the circumstances the omission was only a formal defect. The language of the statute that, after giving the affidavit, the party should be furnished with a certified copy of the contract and bond, 'upon which he or they shall have a right of action,' etc., may be read as meaning 'upon which bond' as easily as 'upon doing which,' and hardly can be construed as making a condition precedent. The conditions are attached in the form of provisos by later words.\n Next it is objected that certain claimants are not entitled to the benefit of the bond, either because they had a lien or because the service was too remote. Of the former class are claims for cartage and towage to the spot where the work was going on. We agree with Judge Putnam in American Surety Co. v. Lawrenceville Cement Co. 110 Fed. 717, that in these smaller matters the objection, if carried to an extreme, would defeat the purpose of the statute, that such liens ordinarily are not insisted upon, and that it would be unreasonable to let the statute 'interfere with the convenience of minor dealings in such methods as the usual practices establish.' Of the other class are the claims for patterns furnished to the molding department of the Puget Sound Engine Works. As was said by the judge below, those who furnish the patterns have as fair a claim to be protected as those who erect the scaffolding upon which the carpenters stand in doing their work upon the ship.\n Next it is said that the bond was without consideration because the contract was made on February 17, and the bond not executed until February 27, ten days later. But \n\n[219 U.S. 24, 35]\n\u00a0\n the transactions may be regarded as simultaneous in a practical sense, and the bond being under seal, consideration is presumed.\n The assignment of some of the claims did not affect the remedy. United States use of Fidelity Nat. Bank v. Rundle, 40 C. C. A. 450, 100 Fed. 400.\n The allowance of a docket fee of $10 to each claimant appears to us to be correct. Rev. Stat.  824, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 632. The claims are several and represent distinct causes of action in different parties, although consolidated in a single suit.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","170":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTODD v. ROMEU(1910)\nNo. 408\nArgued: Decided: April 4, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 150, 151]\n\u00a0\n Mr. N. B. K. Pettingill for appellant.\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 150, 152]\n\u00a0\n No brief was filed for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n Todd, a judgment creditor of Pedro and Juan Agostini, sued Anna Merle to subject property registered in her name to the payment of the judgment, on the ground that she was a mere interposed person, resulting from simulated conveyances to \n\n[217 U.S. 150, 153]\n\u00a0\n her made by the Agostinis. To enforce a decree in his favor Todd advertised the property for sale. Romeu, alleging himself to be an innocent third person, who had bought the property pending the suit, filed a bill to enjoin. A demurrer on behalf of Todd having been sustained, and a final decree entered against Romeu, he brought the cause to this court. The judgment was reversed and the case remanded. Romeu v. Todd, \n206 U.S. 358\n, 51 L. ed. 1093, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 724.\n In virtue of leave given him by the court below, Todd answered, and alleged that Romeu was not an innocent third person, because he had bought with notice of the pendency of the suit. A demurrer on the ground that this answer stated no defense was sustained, and a final decree was rendered enjoining Todd from proceeding against the property. This appeal is prosecuted by Todd, and the question for decision is thus stated in the brief filed on his behalf: 'What is the law of Porto Rico as to the effect of bringing home to an intending purchaser of real estate knowledge or notice of a defect in the title to, or of a lien upon, such real estate in favor of some person other than the vendor, where such knowledge or notice is not required (acquired?) from the registry of properties, such defect or lien not being recorded?' Under the assumption that the pending suit, by operation of law, dismembered the ownership of Merle in the property to which the suit related, pending the same, or operated, from the fact of its pendency, to create a lien upon the property, decisions of the supreme courts, both of Porto Rico and of Spain, are referred to as establishing that one who acquires a right in or to property, with knowledge of a defective title or of an existing lien, is not a third party, and therefore is not entitled to rights which depend for their existence upon that relation. Conceding, for the sake of the argument, that the decisions relied on announce the principle which it attributed to them, we think they are here inapposite. We say this because their applicability depends upon the erroneous assumption upon which the entire argument necessarily proceeds; that is to say, upon the theory \n\n[217 U.S. 150, 154]\n\u00a0\n that, by operation of law, the effect of the pending suit against Merle was either to create a defect in the title of the property standing in her name, or to engender a lien on the same.\n When the case was previously here we held: (a) That, differing from the ancient Spanish law, the modern Spanish law did not deprive an owner of property of the right, because a suit was brought against him concerning the same, to dispose of the property pendente lite. Pp. 363, 364. But while this was the case, the modern law, in order to prevent this right from depriving suitors of the ultimate benefit to result from the successful prosecution of suits, and to protect the public, provided for a system of cautionary notices, by means of which suitors in the cases provided for could put upon the public record a notice concerning the pendency of their suits, thus protecting those who dealt with property upon the faith of the recorded title, leaving the owner the power to dispose of his property pending a suit, and, at the same time, saving to those who sued the enjoyment of their ultimate rights if they recorded a cautionary notice. (b) As these requirements of the local law were incompatible and in conflict with the doctrine of lis pendens prevailing in the courts of the United States, it was held that that doctrine did not obtain in Porto Rico, because the legislation of Congress concerning that island contemplated the fostering, and not the overthrow, of the local laws, especially those governing the title to real estate. P. 364. (c) Applying these rulings, it was decided that as Todd had not availed of the privilege of the lacal law by applying for and recording a cautionary notice, the court below had erroneously decided that the property in the hands of Romeu, an innocent third person, who had bought from Merle on the faith of the record title, was liable to Todd as the result of the decree ultimately rendered in his favor.\n It thus becomes apparent that the assumption as to dismemberment of ownership and consequent defective title, or a lien on the property arising solely by the pendency of the Todd suit, upon which the case before us primarily depends, is \n\n[217 U.S. 150, 155]\n\u00a0\n without foundation, and was expressly decided to be so by our previous ruling. The case, then, if it has any foundation at all, can only rest upon the hypothesis that as, by the pendency of the suit, the law gave the right to obtain a cautionary notice and put the same upon the public records, so that, if the suit ultimated in favor of the complainant, the person buying the property or dealing concerning the same pending the suit would do so subject to rights finally established in favor of the complainant, therefore the knowledge of the suit and of the rights arising from it as a result of the privilege of registering a cautionary notice deprived the person having such knowledge of the attitude of an innocent third party, and subjected the property in his hands to a responsibility for the result of the suit to the extent which would have been the case had the notice been recorded. But this also depends upon an erroneous assumption as to the operation and effect of the local law as to cautionary notice. In that law, as expressly held in the previous opinion, the provision as to cautionary notices which was applicable to the suit of Todd v. Merle was embraced in the mortgage law, and was as follows ( article 42): 'Cautionary notices of their respective interests in the corrosponding public registries may be demanded by: 1. The person who enters suit for the ownership of the real property, or for the creation, declaration, modification, or extinction of any property right.' This provision is followed by nine other paragraphs, specifying particular cases in which a cautionary notice is authorized, none, however, or these paragraphs, having any relation to the case in hand. But the right to have a cautionary notice and to record it in order to cause the pendency of the suit to be operative against property involved in the suit, against persons buying, pending the suit, on the faith of the registered title, was not an absolute one arising in and by the effect of the pendency of the suit, but was contingent; that is to say, could only arise as the result of an application made to the court to grant the cautionary notice, and by a judgment of the court awarding the same. This \n\n[217 U.S. 150, 156]\n\u00a0\n clearly follows from a subsequent provision of the mortgage law, saying ( art. 43):\n'In the case of No. 1 of the preceding article, no cautionary notice may be made unless it is so ordered by a judicial decree issued at the instance of a person having a right thereto, and by virtue of a document sufficient in the opinion of the judge.'\n\n In other words, the right in the case specified to the cautionary notice was not absolute, but relative. That is to say, the law, considering the right of an owner to dispose of his property and the injustice which would arise from limiting such right in every case merely because a suit was brought against him concerning the property, gives the right to the cautionary notice in such case, not merely because of the commencement of the suit, but makes it depend upon an express order of the court granting the cautionary notice. As, therefore, the right to a cautionary notice did not arise in and by virtue of the pendency of the suit, and could only have come from a judicial decree which was never applied for and never rendered, it must follow that the assumption that there was an existing dismemberment of ownership, or lien, arising from the conception that there was the absolute right to the cautionary notice, has no foundation upon which to rest. It results that the contention reduces itself to this; that Romeu, the purchaser, who bought the property on the faith of the recorded title, and in the absence of a cautionary notice, was bound because he had knowledge of the suit, although, by operation of law, the suit had no effect whatever upon the right of the owner to dispose of the property during its pendency, since the steps which the law provided as necessary to limit the right of the owner had not been taken. Thus, to bring the proposition relied upon to establish that error was committed by the court below to its ultimate conclusion is to demonstrate its want of merit.\n Of course, our ruling is confined to the case before us, and we do not, therefore, intimate an opinion as to whether the \n\n[217 U.S. 150, 157]\n\u00a0\n doctrine that notice is equivalent to registry is or not compatible with the public policy manifested by the requirements of the mortgage law prevailing in Porto Rico. And upon the hypothesis that the doctrine that notice is equivalent to registry is not incompatible with the requirements of the mortgage law, we must not be understood as deciding that one who bought where no cautionary notice had been registered, but with knowledge of a pending suit from which, owing to its character, the law gave an absolute right, without the prerequisite of judicial action, to the cautionary notice, would not be liable to the extent of the property acquired pendente lite for the ultimate results of the suit. See, among others, paragraph 2 of article 42 of the mortgage law, in connection with the second paragraph of article 43 of the same law.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","171":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTOXAWAY HOTEL CO. v. J L SMATHERS & CO(1910)\nNo. 88\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n From the facts certified it appears that the Toxaway Hotel Company was, in May, 1905, duly incorporated under the laws of Georgia. Among the purposes of the company, as stated in the application for incorporation, were these: 'to conduct hotels for the accommodation of the public, . . . to keep, manage, conduct, and carry on the business of running hotels, cottages, inns, and restaurants, with their usual and necessary adjuncts, including the running of billiard and pool rooms, bowling alleys, buying and selling liquors and tobacco in all their forms, conducting and leasing news and book stands; baths of all kinds, to conduct livery stables, operating farm and fish hatcheries, to run omnibuses and transfer lines, together with all other pursuits incident to the operation of hotels.' The company acquired and operated six hotels, situated in a thinly populated part of the mountains of western \n\n[216 U.S. 439, 440]\n\u00a0\n North Carolina, having an aggregate capacity of 750 guests. These were carried on from March, 1905, until October, 1906, when an assignment was made. Within four months after such assignment, creditors filed a petition seeking to adjudicate the corporation a bankrupt, as having been 'engaged principally' in trading and mercantile pursuits. It contested adjudication, and averred that it was not a corporation subject to involuntary proceedings, as it had not been principally engaged either in 'trading' or 'mercantile pursuits,' but was a hotel company, and, as such, was not one of the class of corporations specified in the 4th section of the bankrupt act, as amended.\n The material facts as to the character of the business done by this corporation are these:\n'That the business done by the corporation at these hotels during the first season, from March to October, 1905, as shown by the receipts, amounted to $119,171.36; and that done during the second season, from January 1st to October 1st, 1906, as shown by the receipts, amounted to $ 127,136.01.\n\n'That during 1905, and until June, 1906, the said corporation did no other business than conducting hotels, excepting the cultivation of a small farm connected with one of the hotels, for the purpose of supplying vegetables and garden truck.\n\n'That in June, 1906, said corporation acquired and began conducting two country stores,-one located at Toxaway Inn and the other at Lake Sapphire and Fairfield Inn. In these stores were kept stocks of general merchandise, such as is usually carried in country stores; to wit, dry goods, groceries, notions, hats, caps, clothing, a small assortment of hardware, flour, meal, meat, feed, etc., the average value of each stock being from three to four thousand dollars.\n\n'The said hotels were located in a thinly settled section of the mountains of North Carolina, quite a distance from any town; that the stores furnished the hotels from their stocks, and also with such produce and other things necessary for \n\n[216 U.S. 439, 441]\n\u00a0\n the hotels as came into the stores, and they also sold goods and merchandise to people generally; and also bought and sold some tan bark. That from two thirds to three fourths of the goods handled by these stores went as supplies to the hotels on orders from the stewards of the hotels, and the remainder were sold generally, principally to employees of the corporation, and also to the people at large. That the business of the hotels and the stores was kept without separation in one set of books. The corporations also kept a bar in the Toxaway Inn, at which liquors were sold exclusively to the guests, and had a number of boats and launches on the lakes at Taxaway Inn and at Fairfield, which it hired to patrons when called for.\n\n'That said corporation employed about 130 persons in and about the hotels, and 4 persons in and about the stores.'\n\n Upon these facts the bankrupt court adjudicated the corporation bankrupt. An appeal was allowed to the circuit court of appeals, and the question certified as to whether, upon the facts stated, this hotel company is subject to the provisions of the bankrupt act, and liable to be adjudicated a bankrupt.\n Messrs. Theodore F. Davidson, Louis M. Bourne, John M. Slaton, Ben Z. Phillips and Haywood Parker for Toxaway Hotel Company.\n\n\n[216 U.S. 439, 444]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Julius C. Martin for J. L. Smathers & Company.\n\n\n[216 U.S. 439, 445]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Lurton, after stating the facts, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The act of 1867 [14 Stat. at L. 517, chap. 176] applied to 'all moneyed business or com- \n\n[216 U.S. 439, 446]\n\u00a0\n mercial corporations and joint-stock companies.' The present act applies only to such corporations as are 'principally engaged' in certain enumerated kinds of business. That of inn keeping, though as old as civilization, is not specifically enumerated. Unless, therefore, a corporation engaged in the business of hotel keeping is embraced within one or the other of those which are enumerated, it is not liable to an involuntary adjudication.\n The contention is that this was a corporation principally engaged in 'trading' or 'mercantile pursuits.'\n For the present we shall only deal with the bare question as to whether inn keeping is within a proper definition of 'trading' or 'mercantile pursuits.' The keeping of a bar, cigar and news stand are obviously but ordinary incidents to the main business when conducted within the inn, and primarily for the convenience of guests. The maintenance of a livery and of small pleasure boats for the accommodation of guests may also be accepted as merely incidental to that class of hotels called 'resorts.' The significance of the fact that this company did, in addition to the ordinary business of hotel keeping, engage to a certain extent in an outside trading or mercantile business, will later be considered.\n Having thus narrowed the question, we must answer that a corporation engaged principally in running hotels is not a corporation engaged principally in 'trading' or 'mercantile pursuits.' An innkeeper is one who maintains a house for the entertainment of strangers, for a reasonable compensation. To secure this compensation he is given a lien upon the property of his guests within the inn. For this property he is under liability much like that of a common carrier. So long as he has room, he must receive all who may apply and are fit persons. He may not discriminate. To say that he buys and sells articles of food and drink is only true in a limited sense. Such articles are not bought to be sold, nor are they sold again, as in ordinary commerce. They are bought to be served as food or drink, and the price includes \n\n[216 U.S. 439, 447]\n\u00a0\n rent, service, heat, light, etc. To say that such a business is that of a 'trader' or a 'mercantile pursuit,' is giving those words an elasticity of meaning not according to common usage.\n Until changed by a Parliamentary declaration in 1825, act 6, Geo. IV., chap. 16, defining the persons included under the term 'trader,' as used in the bankrupt and insolvency acts, it was held that an innkeeper was not a tradesman. Newton v. Trigg, 1 Shower, 96; Luton v. Bigg, Skinner, 276, 291; Willett v. Thomas, 2 Chitty, 6519\n\n\n In Luton v. Bigg it was said of an innkeeper: 'He is in the nature of a public person, and his house and occupation a thing of necessity, and his gain does not rise from the victuals which he sells, but from his furniture and attendance.'\n In Newton v. Trigg, cited above, it was said: 'An innkeeper cannot set his own prices, but is bound to reasonable prices. A tradesman may sell to whom he pleases. An innkeeper cannot refuse his guest. . . . He doth not get by buying and selling. He gets by the price and hire of his lodgings [also] by the profit or use of his kitchen. The profits from the stables do not arise from the hay only, but from the standing.'\n Congress having never by express legislation declared an innkeeper a 'trader,' it must be presumed to have used the word in its well-understood public and judicial meaning, and cases based upon a Parliamentary meaning are not in point. See Hall v. Cooley, 3 % n. y. l\/eg. Obs. 282, Fed. Cas. No. 5,928, and Re Cote, 2 Low. Dec. 374, Fed. Cas. No. 3,267, where Judge Lowell, referring to the declaratory act giving a list of occupations which should constitute trading, said that Congress 'had not defined a tradesman, and the question was therefore addressed to the common usage of this country and to the judge's knowledge of his own language.' He defined a tradesman 'as substantially the same as shopkeeper.' In the case styled Re Smith, 2 Low. Dec. 69, Fed. Cas. No. 12,981, the same learned judge adopted the definition of Bouvier, who defines a tradesman as 'one who makes it his business to buy merchandise or goods or chattels to sell again \n\n[216 U.S. 439, 448]\n\u00a0\n for the purpose of making a profit.' If the occupation of inn keeping is not 'trading,' it is not a 'mercantile pursuit,' for little more than a broader significance can be given to that term than to 'trading.' It is, in fact, trading in the larger sense. 'Mercantile' is defined 'as having to do with trade or commerce; of or pertaining to merchants, or the traffic carried on by merchants' (Century dictionary). To be principally engaged in a mercantile pursuit, one must be carrying on commerce in some of its branches. See Re Cameron Town Mut. F. Lightning & Windstorm Ins. Co. 96 Fed. 756; Loveland, Bankr.  48; Re New York & W. Water Co. 98 Fed. 711. The conclusion we reach accords with that announced by the sixth circuit court of appeals in Re United States Hotel Co. 68 L.R.A. 588, 67 C. C. A. 153, 134 Fed. 225, where the matter is considered and the cases bearing upon the subject reviewed.\n But it is said that although this was a hotel company, and engaged in doing the business of an innkeeper, it was in fact principally engaged in trading and mercantile pursuits. If so, that is the end of the matter; for liability under the act is dependent upon what it was actually doing rather than upon what it was organized to do or professed to be doing. See Friday v. Hall & K. Co. just decided. [\n216 U.S. 449\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 261.]\n It may have been engaged in doing two distinct kinds of business. But unless this corporation was 'engaged principally' in mercantile pursuits, it was not amenable to the act. 'Engaged principally' are plain words of no ambiguous meaning. They need no construction. Amenability to the statute must turn upon the facts of the case where, as here, the same corporation was engaged in 'mercantile pursuits' in addition to inn keeping. There is no way to settle whether it was 'engaged principally' in the one or the other but by a comparison of the two. When we do this it is easy to see that the mercantile business which it did was of minor character, and was largely an incident to the location of the hotels of the company in a thinly settled mountainous region. The stores were country stores,-that is, stores dealing in a \n\n[216 U.S. 439, 449]\n\u00a0\n great variety of ordinary necessities. From two thirds to three fourths of the goods handled were used in the running of the hotels, upon order of the stewards. Much of the remainder were sold to the employees, and the rest to customers at large, who paid in money or bartered country supplies for goods. The average stocks carried were from three to four thousand dollars in value. They were, in a large sense, hotel commissaries. The business was done but for one season. If we compare the volume of that done by the inn-keeping business proper with that done by the stores, the minor character of the latter is plain. The hotels employed 130 persons; the two stores, 4. The receipts of the hotel business plus the mercantile business-for all were kept upon one set of books-for the year 1906 were $ 127,136.01. The receipts for the previous year, when no stores were operated, were $119,171.36. The volume of mercantile business must have been small compared to the volume of the hotel business proper. That the company was 'engaged principally' in the hotel business proper is plain. It was, therefore, not amenable to the act.\n The answer to the interrogatory of the Circuit Court of Appeals must therefore be in the negative. \n\n\n\n","172":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

The controversy grows out of contracts made between the United States and the William R. Trigg Company, a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Virginia, carrying on business at Richmond, Virginia, for the construction of certain vessels for the United States, namely, a sea-going suction dredge, called the Benyuard, for the War Department; a revenue cutter, called the Mohawk, for the Treasury Department; and a cruiser, for the Navy Department, called the Galveston. The contract price for the Benyuard, apart from its pumping machinery, was $254,550; for the Mohawk, $ 217,000; and for the Galveston, $1,027,000. These contracts were dated, for the Benyuard, September 9, 1901; for the Mohawk, April 20, 1900; and for the Galveston, December 14, 1899\n\n\n In December, 1902, S. H. Hawes & Company filed a bill in the chancery court at the city of Richmond, on behalf of themselves and other creditors, asserting liens under the supply lien law of the state of Virginia, averring the insolvency of the Trigg Company, and asking for the appointment of a receiver, which was accordingly made. The receiver took possession of the property of the Trigg Company, including the vessels above named. Under  3753 and 3754 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2530) a stipulation was executed by the United States district attorney, on behalf of the United States, for the release and discharge of the vessels, and the material on hand applicable thereto.\n Thereafter the case proceeded to judgment, and, on final appeal, to the supreme court of appeals of Virginia, the liens under the supply lien law of the state were held superior to any claim or lien of the government. In the case of the Benyuard, two of the five judges of that court \n\n[218 U.S. 452, 462]\n\u00a0\n dissented from the opinion of the majority, holding that the title to the Benyuard had passed to the United States under the terms of the contract under which it was constructed. The case is reported in 110 Va. 165, 65 S. E. 538.\n It is contended that there is no jurisdiction in this court to review the judgment of the supreme court of appeals of Virginia, as no Federal question was decided in that court which would lay the foundation for the writ of error. In the third class of cases provided for in  709 of the United States Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575), it is expressly provided that where any right, title, privilege, or immunity claimed under the Constitution, treaty, or statute of the United States, or an authority exercised under the United States, is specially set up or claimed by either party, and the decision is against such right, title, privilege, or immunity, the same may be reexamined and reviewed by writ of error from this court.\n An examination of the record discloses that the government claimed in the case that under the contract the title to the dredge vested in the United States by virtue of the terms of the contract; that a lien was reserved to the United States under the contract for the cutter Mohawk and the cruiser Galveston, which was superior to the claims of the supply liens' creditors under the laws of the state of Virginia. The government further contended that the right of the government to its superior claims upon the vessels, whether of title or lien, could not be affected by, and was not subject to, the lien statutes of the state of Virginia. The government also claimed that the state had no power to retard, impede, or control the operation of the Federal government in making and carrying out such contracts as are herein under consideration.\n We think that from this statement of the claims made in the court below on behalf of the United States, assertions were made of rights and immunities which were the creation of Federal authority, and the denial thereof \n\n[218 U.S. 452, 463]\n\u00a0\n by the judgment of the state court brings the case within the provisions of  709 of the Revised Statutes of the United States. It is not necessary to lay the foundation for jurisdiction that the claims for Federal rights asserted should be well founded; it is enough if they are substantial claims of Federal rights within the statute, and such as were duly asserted and directly or necessarily denied in the judgment and decision of the state court.\n Nor do we think there is anything in the stipulation entered into on the part of the government by the United States district attorney, with a view to getting possession of the vessels, which were in the hands of the receiver, which in anywise deprived the government of the right to assert any such immunity and privilege as it has because of the nature and character of the contracts and the lien of the government in the premises.\n An examination of these sections, 3753, 3754, shows that they are intended to permit the United States to obtain possession of property claimed by it, when the same has been seized by judicial proceedings under the laws of the state, and to give to it and to the persons asserting rights in the property protection in their rights, notwithstanding such changes in possession.\n In  3753 it is expressly provided that 'nothing herein contained shall, however, be considered as recognizing or conceding any right to enforce by seizure, arrest, attachment, or any judicial process any claim against any property of the United States, or against any property held, owned, or employed by the United States, or by any department thereof, for any public use, or as waiving any objection to any proceeding instituted to enforce any such claim.'\n Section 3754 provides for the protection of persons asserting claims against such property, and that after final judgment given in the court of last resort, to which the Secretary of the Treasury may deem proper to carry \n\n[218 U.S. 452, 464]\n\u00a0\n the proceedings, affirming the rights of the persons asserting claims for the security or satisfaction of which such proceedings were instituted in the state courts against such property, notwithstanding the claims of the United States, the final judgment shall be deemed to all intents and purposes as a final determination of the rights of such persons, and shall entitle such persons, as against the United States, to such right as they would have in case the possession of such property had not been changed. The section provides for the payment of such final judgment out of the treasury of the United States.\n The evident purpose of these sections is that neither the United States nor the claimants to the property shall lose any rights because of the release of the property under the stipulation, but, as were the rights of the parties before the change of possession, such they shall continue to be. We do not agree that, by entering into a stipulation which embodied these terms, the United States lost any right which it had to assert claims under the contracts, or rights by reason of the sovereignty of the United States, if any such exist. We think this court has jurisdiction of this case upon this writ of error.\n Taking up the consideration of the case as to these several vessels, and first as to the Benyuard, this dredge was constructed under the provisions of a contract which are thus summarized by the master in the Virginia chancery court:\n'Materials furnished and the work done by the William R. Trigg Company were to be subject to rigid inspection by an inspector appointed on the part of the government, his decision to be final as to quantity and quality.\n\n'If the Trigg Company should fail to begin or prosecute the work in accordance with the specifications, which were made part of the contract, the contract might be annulled by the government. In that case all payments were to cease, and all money or reserved percentage must \n\n[218 U.S. 452, 465]\n\u00a0\n be retained until the final completion and acceptance of the boat. The government was to have the right to recover anything paid for such completion in excess of the original contract price with the William R. Trigg Company, including all extra cost of inspection; and might proceed under  3709 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2484) to provide for the completion of the boat by open purchase or contract, unless the time for such completion should be extended.\n\n'It was expressly provided that the William R. Trigg Company should be responsible for and pay all liabilities incurred in the prosecution of the work for labor and materials.\n\n'Section 9 of the contract was as follows:\n\n\"It is further agreed by and between the parties hereto that until final inspection and acceptance of, and payment for, all materials and work herein provided for, no prior inspection, payment, or act is to be construed as a waiver of the right of the party of the first part to reject any defective work or material, or to require the fulfilment of any of the terms of the contract.'\n\n'Section 199 of the specification was as follows:\n\n\"The purpose and spirit of these specifications are that the contractor is to provide and deliver a staunch dredge hull and first-class machinery, complete in every respect.'\n\n'Section 206 of of the specifications was as follows:\n\n\"It is understood and agreed that the contractor assumes full responsibility for the safety of his employees, plant, and materials, and for any damage or injury done by or to them from any source or cause.'\n\n'Section 209 provided for sea trials at the expense of the contractor, any defects that might appear to be remedied at his expense, and trials to be repeated until the steamer should be found satisfactory in all respects. Section 210 provided that if the requirements of the specifications were complied with, ten (10) equal payments \n\n[218 U.S. 452, 466]\n\u00a0\n should be made, based on the reports of the inspector, the first when the hull and propelling machinery should be 10 per cent complete, the second when 20 per cent complete, and so on, to the last payment, to be made when the vessel should be turned over to the United States after successful trial; from each of said payments, except the last, 20 per cent to be reserved until final payment.\n\n'Section 211 was as follows:\n\n\"The parts paid for under the system of partial payments above specified shall become thereby the sole property of the United States; but this provision shall not be interpreted as relieving the contractor from the sole responsibility for the proper care and protection of said parts prior to the delivery of the dredge to the United States, or from any other of the provisions of these specifications.'\n\n'Section 212 provided for insurance against fire and marine risks at the contractor's cost, for and in behalf of the United States, to at least the amount of each partial payment.\n\n'The evidence shows that the government had paid $142,550.80 on account of this contract when the receiver was appointed in this cause, and that said dredge was then 70 per cent complete.'\n\n It is the contention of the government that the terms of this contract are such that by its expressed provisions the vessel was to become the property of the United States as fast as it was paid for. A majority of the learned judges of the supreme court of appeals of Virginia were of opinion that title did not pass to the government under this contract, and that it was subject to the superior lien of claimants under the state laws of Virginia. It is undoubtedly true that the mere facts that the vessel is to be paid for in instalments as the work progresses, and to be built under the superintendence of a government inspector, who had power to reject or approve the materials, will \n\n[218 U.S. 452, 467]\n\u00a0\n not of themselves work the transfer of the title of a vessel to be constructed, in advance of its completion. But it is equally well settled that if the contract is such as to clearly express the intention of the parties that the builder shall sell and the purchaser shall buy the ship before its completion, and at the different stages of its progress, and this purpose is expressed in the words of the contract, it is binding and effectual in law to pass the title. 2 Parsons, Constr. 8th ed. 259, and cases cited.\n All sections of the agreement must be read in the light of the purposes of the contracting parties, as gathered from the entire contract, and must be considered in connection with other provisions of the contract. And it is said that  212, as to insurance, does not show an intention to protect the title transferred to the government, but must be read in the light of the purpose of the government to acquire title to the dredge in the event that it ultimately elected to take it over as a purchaser, the ownership in the meantime remaining in the builder until such final decision was made, and the insurance was required for the government's security for the partial payments.\n But we cannot agree to this construction of  212. The ownership clause provides that parts paid for are to become the sole property of the United States (specifications,  211), insurance was to be provided by the contractor preceding each partial payment, that is, as fast as title vested in the government by reason of the partial payments, insurance was to be effected 'to at least the amount of such partial payment, and the property was to be kept insured to at least the aggregate of the payments made until delivery and final acceptance.'\n It is insisted that the right to reject the dredge or to annul the contract is inconsistent with the passage of title under the provisions of  211 of the specification, however positive that section may be in terms. Section 9 of the contract provides: \n\n[218 U.S. 452, 468]\n\u00a0\n 'It is further agreed by and between the parties hereto that until final inspection and acceptance hereof, and payment for, all the material and work herein provided for, no prior inspection, payment, or act is to be construed as a waiver of the right of the party of the first part to reject any defective work or material, or to require the fulfilment of any of the terms of this contract.'\n Let it be conceded that this section gave the government the right to reject defective work or material, or even the entire dredge, if, upon trial and before final acceptance, it proved defective,-is that right inconsistent with the vesting of title in the parts as paid for, as specifically provided in  211? We think not. It may be that in such contingency the government might reject the dredge. This might be true consistently with the acquirement of title in parts accepted and paid for after inspection. That is, if the whole, upon final trial, proved defective, all, including the restoration of that acquired, might be within the power of the government. See, in this connection, The Poconoket, 67 Fed. 262, 266.\n The provisions of  4 look rather to the completion of the vessel by the government in the event of the annulment of the contracts for failure to keep its requirements. In that contingency it is provided that payments shall cease and reserved payments be retained until the final completion and acceptance of the work. In this section the United States is given a remedy for the cost of completion upon the failure of the contractor to prosecute the work according to the contract.\n Nor do we find it inconsistent with the vesting of the title in parts that bond was taken in the sum of $60,000 for the performance of the contract. The United States might well secure itself in this sum, notwithstanding it took title to parts as paid for. Security might nevertheless be required for the faithful doing of the work within the stipulated time. It is also true that the Trigg Com- \n\n[218 U.S. 452, 469]\n\u00a0\n pany was to be responsible for and pay all liabilities for labor and material incurred in the prosecution of the work. We are at a loss to see any inconsistency between this provision and the passing of the title in parts as paid for. Construing the whole contract, we find nothing in its other provisions which cuts down or lessens the binding force of the clear and distinct provisions of  211 as to ownership. The parties therein dealt with a specific part of the contract, they expressed themselves clearly upon the subject, and it is not to be presumed, in the absence of clear expression or necessary implication, that they intended to supersede this provision in dealing with other specific or general parts of the agreement.\n It is suggested, in this connection, that the contract with the government in the case of the Benyuard is not different in effect than the one passed upon in Clarkson v. Stevens, \n106 U.S. 505\n, 27 L. ed. 139, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 200. In that case the contract provided that the materials received at the yard for the construction of the steamer should be distinctly marked with the letters 'U. S.,' and should become the property of and belong to the United States. There was no provision that title to the vessel should vest in the United States as fast as parts thereof were constructed, and Mr. Justice Matthews, who delivered the opinion of the court, approved the opinion of the court of errors and appeals of New Jersey, expressing the view that the declaration as to the materials excluded the implication sought to be raised as to the title in the unfinished ship; 'for,' said Mr. Justice Matthews, 'the inference is obvious, from the particularity of such a provision, that the larger interest would not be left to mere intendment.' P. 516.\n In Briggs v. A. Light Boat, 7 Allen, 287, a builder's lien, taken under the Massachusetts statute on a light boat being built for the United States, was sustained. In that case the contract made no provision for a lien in favor \n\n[218 U.S. 452, 470]\n\u00a0\n of the government, or the passing of the title to the boat in progress of construction. Mr. Chief Justice Bigelow, delivering the opinion of the supreme judical court of Massachusetts, used this significant language ( page 297):\n'If this were a suit brought by the builders to enforce a lien for materials furnished for the construction of a ship under a contract directly with the government, or for repairs on a public vessel, the title of which was vested in the United States at the time the work was done or the supplies were furnished, the argument founded on public policy, and the suggestions arising from the inconvenience of causing delay and embarrassment to the public service, would be entitled to very great weight. It might in such case be open to grave doubt whether a lien on the property of the United States could be given by virtue of an enactment of the legislature of a state, or whether services rendered and materials supplied directly to the government must not be presumed to have been furnished exclusively on the faith and credit of the United States, to the exclusion of any intent to rely on a lien upon the public property. But considerations of this nature have no application to a case like the present. It would have been competent for the United States, if they wished to avoid the inconvenience or danger of delay arising from liens in favor of private persons, to make their contract in such form as to devest the builder of any title to the property in the vessel during the process of construction, or to stipulate for the application of the purchase money to the extinguishment of all claims for materials furnished to the builder.'\n\n As we construe the contract for the construction of the Benyuard, it did 'devest the builder of any title to the property in the vessel during the process of construction.' The question in this aspect of the case then becomes one as to the right of a state lien law to fasten upon the prop- \n\n[218 U.S. 452, 471]\n\u00a0\n erty of the United States, and that property a vessel intended for the use of the government in carrying on its necessary operations in the exercise of its governmental authority.\n It was in recognition of the inability of contractors for labor and material to take liens upon the public property of the United States that Congress passed the act of August 13, 1894 (28 Stat. at L. 278, chap. 280, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2523), amended February 24, 1905 (33 Stat. at L. 811, chap. 778, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 948), providing for bonds in favor of those who furnished labor or materials in the construction of public works. It was in view of this purpose to provide protection for those who could not protect themselves by liens upon public property that the statute was given liberal construction in this court. See United States Fidelity & G. Co. v. Golden Pressed Fire Brick Co. \n191 \nU.S. 416, 425\n, 48 S. L. ed. 242, 246, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 142; United States use of Hill v. American Surety Co. \n200 \nU.S. 197, 203\n, 50 S. L. ed. 437, 440, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 168.\n As we read the decision of the supreme court of appeals of Virginia, it is not held that a lien was fixed upon the dredge, if in fact the title thereto passed to the United States. In any event, it could not be tolerated that property of the United States could be seized or encumbered under state lien laws of the character in question. We are not now dealing with the right of a state to provide for such liens while property to the chattel in process of construction remains in the builder, who may be constructing the same with a view to transferring title therein to the United States upon its acceptance under a contract with the government. We are now treating of property which the United States owns. Such property, for the most obvious reasons of public policy, cannot be seized by authority of another sovereignty, against the consent of the government. The Benyuard, as fast as constructed, became one of the instrumentalities of the government, intended for public use, and could not be seized under state laws to answer the claim of a private person, however meritorious. \n\n[218 U.S. 452, 472]\n\u00a0\n Nor do we think the case one for the application of the doctrine governing cases where the United States claims an interest in property lawfully in possession of a court which is administering it,-as in equity or in admiralty,-and the government intervenes to protect its interest therein. In such instances its rights must be adjudicated in recognition of the rights and demands of others interested in the same property. In this case the vessels were released under a stipulation which fully protected the rights of the United States, and the government claims the exclusive right and title in the Benyuard as the parts were completed and paid for.\n In the case of the Mohawk there is no such stipulation as to passing of the title on partial payments in the progress of the work as is found in the contract for the Benyuard. The Secretary of the Treasury was, in his discretion, to make partial payments under the contract during the progress of the work, not to exceed 75 per cent of the value of the labor and materials actually furnished and delivered, and a lien was reserved for such payments, in the following language:\n'Provided, That a lien shall be, and hereby is, reserved to the United States upon the hull, machinery, fittings, and equipment of said vessel, and the materials on hand for use in her construction, respectively and collectively, for all moneys advanced on account thereof, and that such lien shall commence with the first payment, and shall thereupon attach to the work and the materials furnished, and shall in like manner attach from time to time, as the work progresses, and as further payments are made, and shall continue until the completion and acceptance of said vessel.'\n\n This lien, it is asserted, was reserved in accordance with a joint resolution of Congress passed May 5, 1894 (28 Stat. at L. 582, 583), which is as follows:\n'Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives \n\n[218 U.S. 452, 473]\n\u00a0\n of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Secretary of the Treasury be, and he hereby is, authorized to make partial payments, from time to time, upon existing contracts and all contracts hereafter made for the construction of vessels for the Treasury Department, but not in excess of 75 per cent of the amount of the value of the work already done; and that the contracts hereafter made shall provide for a lien upon such vessels for all advances so made: Provided, That nothing in this joint resolution shall be construed to hereafter authorize any partial payments except on contracts stipulating for the same, and then only in accordance with such contract stipulation.'\n\n On behalf of the government it is contended that this resolution makes the lien of the government, reserved under the contract, an express statutory lien by authority of the United States, and consequently superior to any asserted rights under the lien laws of a state. But we cannot agree to this contention. The joint resolution, if it be conceded to have the effect of an act of Congress, does not undertake to create a statutory lien, but directs how contracts thereafter made shall provide with reference to liens upon such vessels. As to future contracts, it is directed that they shall provide for liens upon vessels for advances thus made. We think the lien mentioned is only one created by the terms of the contract, and is to be considered in the light of the other provisions thereof.\n At the time of entering into the contract, a bond was required and was given by the Trigg Company in the penal sum of $45,000, conditioned for the proper construction of the vessel according to the contract and specifications, and that the Trigg Company should promptly make payments to other persons supplying labor and materials in the prosecution of the work. We think this requirement was a distinct recognition on the part of the government that the Trigg Company might become indebted \n\n[218 U.S. 452, 474]\n\u00a0\n to other persons who should perform labor or furnish materials in the building of the vessel, who might become entitled, by reason of such claims against the company, to liens upon the property.\n The contract was made with the Virginia corporation, and it was intended that the bond required of the Trigg Company should protect the government against rights arising out of labor performed or material furnished in the construction of the vessel. Conceding it to be true for this purpose, as asserted by the counsel for the government, that the United States can make contracts providing liens of this character which shall be superior to the claims of any person for liens under state laws, it is none the less certain that it may, if it chooses, recognize the authority of the labor or materials for the construction of labor or materials for th construction of government work. Indeed, such, as we have seen, is the policy of the government in respect to public buildings and structures, upon which liens cannot be taken under the laws of the states. In order that such claims may be satisfied, the United States has made provision for their protection by bonds upon which persons may recover damages, so that those who furnish property of which the government receives the benefit shall not entail a loss by so doing. Read in the light of this policy, so manifestly just and proper, and the requirements of this contract and bond, we think that the government did not intend that the lien which it reserved for itself should be superior to that of contractors for labor and material who had contributed to the work.\n The case of the Galveston is controlled by the same principles. In that contract there was no provision for taking title to the vessel; on the contrary, it was stipulated that, on certain conditions, the title should vest in the United States as collateral security, and the eighteenth clause of the contract provides for the release of liens \n\n[218 U.S. 452, 475]\n\u00a0\n before partial payments shall be required. This clause is distinct and clear in its requirements and reads:\n'When a payment is made under this contract, as a condition precedent thereto, the Secretary of the Navy may, in his discretion, require, for the protection of the party of the first part, evidence satisfactory to him, to be furnished by the party of the first part, that no lien or rights in rem of any kind against said vessels, or her machinery, fittings, or equipment, or the material on hand for use in the construction thereof, have been or can be acquired for or on account of any work done or any machinery, fitting, equipment, or material already incorporated as a part of said vessel, or on hand for that purpose, or that such liens or rights have either been released absolutely, or so subordinated to the rights of the government as to make its lien for all payments paramount, so as not to encumber or hinder in any way the right of the government to accept or reject said vessel, and so as to become absolutely extinguished in case of the acceptance of the vessel.'\n\n The effect which we give this provision is strengthened by the opinion rendered to the Secretary of the Navy by the Attorney General, that in his opinion the practice of the Navy Department in making such contracts recognized that liens of this class might be acquired on vessels where there was no provision in the contract for vesting title in the same in the United States. 23 Ops. Atty. Gen. 174, 176.\n We think that this contract, as the one for the Mohawk, was made in recognition of the rights of those who should furnish work or material for the vessel to secure their claims by liens which it was made the duty of the contractor to provide for in order to protect the title of the United States.\n Upon the whole case we reach the conclusion that judgment must be affirmed as to the Mohawk and Galveston, \n\n[218 U.S. 452, 476]\n\u00a0\n and reversed as to the Benyuard, and it is so ordered. The case is remanded to the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U. S. Comp.

Daish opposed.\n\n\n[217 U.S. 286, 297]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Lurton delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill which seeks to compel the defendant Oberlin M. Carter, late a captain in the Army of the United States, to account for illicit gains, gratuities, and profits received by him through collusion with contractors for river and harbor improvements in the Savannah, Georgia, improvement district, and to follow such illicit profits into securities and other property held for him by other defendants to the suit.\n In substance, the bill charges that under an appropriation made by Congress for the improvement of the harbor of Savannah, certain contracts were entered into with John F. Gaynor and Benjamin D. Greene, doing business either in their joint names, or the name of one of them, or as the Atlantic Contracting Company. That these contracts were made in pursuance of plans and specifications prepared and let out under biddings conducted by the defendant Oberlin M. Carter, then an engineer officer assigned as local engineer of the improvements projected in the Savannah district. These contracts were executed, the appropriations disbursed, and the work supervised and accepted by said officer, or, under his advice and recommendations, by the War Department.\n It is charged that Carter entered into a corrupt arrangement with the said contractors, by which he undertook to use his power and discretion in the preparation of specifications and contracts, and in advertising and letting the same out in such a way as to enable Gaynor and Greene to become contractors under conditions which would insure them a large profit, and to use his influence, power, and discretion in the supervision and acceptance of the work to their greatest advantage. It is then, in substance, averred that, in consideration of such service to them and the betrayal of his trust, he should share in the profits and receive one third of every distribution made. It is \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 298]\n\u00a0\n charged in substance that under such agreement or understanding there was paid over to the defendant Carter about $500,000 as his share of the profits, and that the same was converted into real estate, bonds, stocks, and negotiable notes, and that much of these gains were later placed in the custody of certain other defendants named in the bill, two of them being brothers of defendant Carter, to wit, Lorenzo D. Carter and I. Stanton Carter, who are charged as holding same as agents for Oberlin M. Carter. Securities aggregating in value some $400,000, into which the larger part of the share of the defendant Oberlin M. Carter is said to have gone, were attached under this and other bills, ancillary in character, and placed in the hands of a receiver to abide the result of a decree in this case, the same decree to go down in the ancillary suits in other jurisdictions in which any part of the property or securities has been impounded.\n There was a decree in favor of the United States in the circuit court, substantially as prayed for. Upon an appeal by the defendants and cross appeal by the United States, to the circuit court of appeals, the decree was affirmed as far as it went, and was enlarged in certain matters upon the appeal of the United States. The original defendants have appealed from this last decree so far as it was favorable to the complainant, and the United States has perfected a cross appeal with reference to certain parts of the decree with which it is discontent. Thus the whole case is here as upon a broad appeal, and the several appeals have been heard upon the entire record, consisting of some thirty printed volumes.\n The facts essential to be stated, as sifted out of this great record of pleadings and evidence, are these: From some time in 1889 until July 20, 1897, Oberlin M. Carter, then a brilliant and rising officer of engineers in the Army of the United States, was assigned to duty and placed in charge of certain improvements, for which an appropriation had been made, in the harbor of Savannah. It is enough to say, without going into particulars, that this duty involved large powers and con- \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 299]\n\u00a0\n siderable discretion in the matter of plans, preparation of contracts, advertising for and acceptance of bids, superintendence and acceptance of the work as it progressed, and some latitude in the construction and modification of contracts. It is undoubtedly true that the plans, the form of contracts, the character and time of advertising, and acceptance of bids, as well as most matters involving the exercise of judgment and discretion during the execution of contracts, were reported to the War Department for its approval or rejection. Nevertheless it is most thoroughly made out that the action and recommendation of a local engineer officer in charge of such work practically determined the situation so long as he had the confidence of his superiors and kept within the general limits of the appropriation by Congress for the work in hand. Passing by a number of comparatively small contracts made prior to 1892, as well as a very large one made in 1896, but not completed when Captain Carter was succeeded in July, 1897, the bill charges:\n'That commencing with the contract No. 4820 of September 16, 1892, let in the name of Edward H. Gaynor, contractor, that after the payment of the cost of the work, and after the payment to the other persons, parties to the said fraudulent scheme aforesaid, the profits, amounting to over $2, 000,000, of all the aforesaid contracts so fraudulently let, as aforesaid, were divided from time to time between Oberlin M. Carter, Benjamin D. Greene, and John F. Gaynor, in three equal shares, one of which shares was apportioned to the said Oberlin M. Carter as his share of the profits arising from the consummation of said scheme to defraud the United States.'\n\n Aside from certain contracts prior to September, 1892, and subsequent to May, 1896, the circuit court found, and the circuit court of appeals confirmed the finding, that between September 16, 1892, and May 12, 1896, the United States, through the defendant Oberlin M. Carter, as its disbursing officer, paid to Gaynor and Greene, or the Atlantic Contracting Company, a corporation of which they owned all of the shares \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 300]\n\u00a0\n except a few assigned to certain kinsmen for organization purposes, on account of what we shall hereafter describe as Gaynor and Greene contracts, the sum of $2,567,493.48. They also found that of this sum $1,815,941.62 was distributed as net profits between John F. Gaynor, Benjamin D. Greene, and some third person not publicly known to be interested. The remainder, $ 751,551.86, was the sum disbursed by Greene and Gaynor for labor, supplies, and salaries, being the actual cost of the work for which the government had in some way been induced to pay, under contracts drawn and supervised by Captain Carter, the sum of $2,567,493.48. These figures are not derived from any set of books kept by either the contractors or by Carter. Though the execution of these contracts extended over a period of four years and involved the receipt and expenditure of millions, yet the contractors say they kept no books other than one which related to supplies bought and ordinary labor or salary accounts, and that that book could not be produced. The plan under which Greene and Gaynor carried on these great affairs, as shown by the evidence, was to apply monthly payments received from Carter, as the government's disbursing officer, to the payment of the monthly expenses and advances which might have been made by one or the other of the contractors, and then divide the balance into three parts, one part being at once handed over to Greene, another to Gaynor, and the third to some third person, who both courts found upon the evidence to have been one Robert F. Westcott, the father-in-law of the defendant Oberlin M. Carter, or to accounts kept in his name, and that this third was ultimately turned over to Carter himself.\n Without any distinct finding as to the method by which the government had been defrauded, or as to the extent of actual loss sustained, both courts concurred in the conclusion that the government had been defrauded, and had suffered great loss. Without any distinct finding as to whether one third of the profits realized had been paid over to Robert F. Westcott, as a secret partner with Greene and Gaynor, or to him as the \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 301]\n\u00a0\n representative of Captain Carter, yet both courts concurred in holding that, if Westcott was interested as a partner in the contracts, Carter, under all of the facts, was chargeable with knowledge of such partnership relation, and that if, with such knowledge, he accepted from Westcott the share of profit so received, he was accountable to the government for all such illicit gratuities or gains. In view of this concurrence of opinion upon these material facts the burden rests heavily upon the appellant Oberlin M. Carter to satisfy this court that their conclusions are plainly erroneous, or that, conceding the facts to be as found, the decree holding him accountable is erroneous as matter of law. The Carib Prince ( Wuppermann v. The Carib Prince) \n170 \nU.S. 655, 658\n, 42 S. L. ed. 1181, 1185, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 753; Brainare v. Buck, \n184 U.S. 99\n, 46 L. ed. 449, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 458.\n But counsel have urged with great force and much confidence that the conclusion of both of the courts below rests upon no secure foundation, and that there has been a great miscarriage of justice in finding that Captain Carter was ever in any way interested in these contracts, or that he ever, directly or indirectly, consciously shared in any profits arising therefrom. This protest does not, as we understand it, involve any serious denial of the fact that nearly two millions of dollars were realized as profit upon contracts drawn by, let out, and supervised by Captain Carter, at a net cost to the contractors of less than one million dollars; nor does it involve any serious denial that approximately one third of this abnormal profit was paid over to some third person not publicly known to have had any connection with the contracts or the contractors. If, however, we are in error in assuming such a limitation upon the contention of counsel, there is no reasonable ground, upon this record, for doubting the correctness of the conclusion reached by the courts below as to either of these matters. It may be conceded that no witness proves an express agreement between the contractors and Carter that he should serve them in the letting or execution of these contracts. So far as the principals have spoken, they have denied any such agreement.\n But it is said that none of the specific averments of the bill \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 302]\n\u00a0\n as to the methods by which the government had been defrauded were sustained by either the circuit court or the circuit court of appeals. Thus it was averred that Carter had shortened the time required by regulations for advertising for bids, that he had made it difficult for some intending bidders to secure the plans and specifications, that he had deterred others by unduly magnifying the risks of the work, that the specifications were so drawn as to leave to the government the option of two or more materials of different value, or two or more methods of doing parts of the work, or the right to substitute one material for another. It was also averred that Greene and Gaynor were in advance advised as to how such options would be exercised, but that other proposing bidders were not, and that by this and other artifices Greene and Gaynor were enabled to secure contracts at unreasonable prices. It it then averred that Carter had collusively and fraudulently increased unduly the quantity of some materials required and diminished that of other kinds; that he had exercised options reserved in such a way as to greatly increase the cost of the work and the profit of the contractors; that he had permitted changes in materials and methods of using the materials and of doing the work in such manner as to be of disadvantage to the United States and of advantage to the contractors; and that he had permitted the use of cheap and inferior materials and had accepted bad and inferior work.\n Aside from the elusiveness of a fraud well concocted and unsuspected while going on, there was in the way of the government in this case the fact that, in respect to almost everything which had served to add to the cost of the work and to the profit of the contractors, Carter had confessedly a wide discretion. That he might be controlled in the exercise of this by his superior officers or by the War Department when important changes, modifications, or substitutions were made, is true. But, in actual practice, this War Department approval was largely official and formal when the engineer in charge was regarded as capable and honest and his recommendation \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 303]\n\u00a0\n within the limit of the appropriation or of the contract as made. It was the fact that such an officer in control of such work had a wide discretion which at once made his fidelity of the utmost importance to the government, and his co-operation and collusion of such large value to the contractors. This discretion was the stumbling block in the way of the circuit court. It was not easy to show in some instances that the work had suffered by the substitution of one material for another, or by the increase of one kind of mat in mattress work for another, or by one method of measuring or paying for mattrese work rather than by another. When contracts and specifications were elastic enough, as seems to have been the case with the Greene and Gaynor contracts, to justify varying interpretations, or full of options as to materials or methods, as was the fact here, nothing short of conduct or action plainly indefensible as an exercise of honest judgment would justify an inference of corruption. When to this situation there was added the fact that, as a whole, the harbor improvement had been intelligently and scientifically carried out and was apparently an engineering success, and that this result had been reached within the limit of the Congressional appropriation, it was not surprising that upon this line of evidence, considered apart from all other things, the circuit judge found himself unable to predicate fraud and corruption upon the conduct of Carter in these details which the bill pointed out as the methods by which he had enabled a great fraud upon the government to be carried out, and by which his corrupt collusion was to be established.\n The circuit court, upon this aspect of the evidence, said:\n'The evidence leaves the court with the impression that there was carelessness in the manner in which some of the work was done, indeed, carelessness for which Carter was justly entitled to be criticized; but considering the material results, the magnitude of the work, and assuming the absence of any mercenary or other ulterior motive on Carter's part, except such as might be justly deduced from the facts so far \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 304]\n\u00a0\n considered, I am of the opinion, as was Senator Edmunds in the court- martial case, that Carter's course in the premises was not necessarily an abuse of the discretion vested in him, nor seriously inconsistent with his claim that he discharged his duty to the government, and that, limited as above stated, under the rule of evidence obtaining in such case, the government has failed to maintain its case.'\n\n Excluding, as the circuit court did, all consideration of the extraordinary profit which the contractors had in some way realized upon these contracts, and that, through indirect ways, approximately $500,000 of this profit had come at last to the possession of Carter, it is not surprising that that court did not find evidence of such gross abuse of discretion as to justify a finding that he had conspired with Greene and Gaynor to defraud the government.\n But the case of the United States against the defendants is not to be determined by the consideration of the sufficiency of any one fact or group of facts, but by a judgment based upon the evidence as a whole. The learned circuit judge very nearly fell into error by such a partial view of the case. From ultimate error he was saved by the subsequent consideration of the principal, and really determinative, factors in the case; namely, the abnormal profit which the contractors had in some way been able to realize, and the evidence tracing one third of that profit into Carter's hands, with no credible reason for such result. The circuit court of appeals took a somewhat wider view of the matter. Thus that court said:\n'We concur, therefore, in the view expressed in the opinion filed by the trial judge, that the charge of conspiracy between Captain Carter and the contractors to defraud the United States, under the contracts referred to, is: (a) neither established by direct evidence, (b) nor can such charge be upheld under the testimony alone of methods adopted in making specifications, advertising for bids, treatment of proposed bidders, or letting contracts, (c) nor under one or\n\n\n (a)\n Cas. t. King, p. 61.\n\n\n (b)\n 1 Ves. Sr. 8. \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 305]\n\u00a0\n the other several branches of testimony reviewed in the opinion, considered independently of the entire chain of circumstances. But these conclusions are not the tests of sufficiency of the entire chain of circumstantial evidence to sustain that charge. While the fact is established, as there stated, 'that a great wrong was practised in this raid upon the government,' we are not satisfied that the right of the United States 'to a decree awarding to it' all property in question 'arising from funds made up of profits realized by the contractors' therein may rightly rest, as there stated, upon the proposition that Carter must, 'as a conclusion of law, be held chargeable with knowledge of what was being done in the premises.'\n'Under the settled facts above recited, however, linked with cumulative evidence, tending to prove actual knowledge on the part of Captain Carter of the excessive profit in the mattress work and of divisions thereof with Westcott in New York, and complicity in the fraudulent transactions, of which (at one time or another) he acquired approximately one third of the net proceeds, we are constrained to the belief that the evidence is decisive, not only of fraud perpetrated by the contractors, but of concurrence and participation therein by Captain Carter.' [96 C. C. A. 598, 172 Fed. 12.]\n\n If it be once assumed that the defendant Carter did secretly receive from Greene and Gaynor a proportion of the profits gained by them in the execution of the contracts in question, the right of the United States in equity to a decree against him for the share so received is made out. It is immaterial if that appears whether the complainant was able to show any specific abuse of discretion, or whether it was able to show that it had suffered any actual loss by fraud or otherwise. It is not enough for one occupying a confidential relation to another, who is shown to have secretly received a benefit from the opposite party, to say, 'You cannot show any fraud, or you cannot show that you have sustained any loss by my conduct.' Such an agent has the power to con- \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 306]\n\u00a0\n ceal his fraud and hide the injury done his principal. It would be a dangerous precedent to lay down as law that unless some affirmative fraud or loss can be shown, the agent may hold on to any secret benefit he may be able to make out of his agency. The larger interests of public justice will not tolerate, under any circumstances, that a public official shall retain any profit or advantage which he may realize through the acquirement of an interest in conflict with his fidelity as an agent. If he takes any gift, gratuity, or benefit in violation of his duty, or acquires any interest adverse to his principal, without a full disclosure, it is a betrayal of his trust and a breach of confidence, and he must account to his principal for all he has received.\n The doctrine is well established and has been applied in many relations of agency or trust. The disability results not from the subject- matter, but from the fiduciary character of the one against whom it is applied. It is founded on reason and the nature of the relation, and is of paramount importance. 'It is of no moment,' said Lord Thurlow, in The York Bldgs. Co. v. Mackenzie, 3 Paton, 378, 'what the particular name or description, whether of character or office, situation or position, is, on which the disability attaches.' Thus, in Aberdeen R. Co. v. Blaikie Bros. 1 Macq. H. L. Cas. 461, 472, it was applied to a contract of a director dealing in behalf of his company. Lord Chancellor Cranworth, in respect to the general rule, said:\n'And it is a rule of universal application, that no one having such duties to discharge shall be allowed to enter into engagements in which he has, or can have, a personal interest conflicting, or which possibly may conflict, with the interests of those whom he is bound to protect.\n\n'So strictly is this principle adhered to, that no question is allowed to be raised as to the fairness or unfairness of a contract so entered into.\n\n'It obviously is, or may be, impossible to demonstrate \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 307]\n\u00a0\n how far in any particular case the terms of such a contract have been the best for the interest of the cestui que trust, which it was possible to obtain.\n\n'It may sometimes happen that the terms on which a trustee has dealt or attempted to deal with the estate or interests of those for whom he is a trustee have been as good as could have been obtained from any other person,-they may even at the time have been better.\n\n'But still so inflexible is the rule that no inquiry on that subject is permitted. The English authorities on this head are numerous and uniform.\n\n'The principle was acted on by Lord King in Keech v. Sandford,1 and by Lord Hardwicke in Whelpdale v. Cookson2, and the whole subject was considered by Lord Eldon on a great variety of occasions. It is sufficient to refer to what fell from that very learned and able judge in Ex parte James, 8 Ves. Jr. 337.\n\n'It is true that the questions have generally arisen on agreements for purchases or leases of land, and not, as here, on a contract of a mercantile character. But this can make no difference in principle. The inability to contract depends not on the subject-matter of the agreement, but on the fiduciary character of the contracting party; and I cannot entertain a doubt of its being applicable to the case of a party who is acting as manager of a mercantile or trading business for the benefit of others, no less than to that of an agent or trustee employed in selling or letting land.'\n\n In Findlay v. Pertz, 29 L. R. A. 188, 192, 13 C. C. A. 559, 567, 31 U. S. App. 340, 357, 66 Fed. 427, 435, it was applied to a contract where it was shown that a municipal official, buying for the municipality, had received a commission from the seller. In that case the circuit court of appeals said:\n'His duty was to give to the public service the full benefit of a disinterested judgment and the utmost fidelity. Any agreement or understanding by which his judgment or duty conflicted with his private interest was corrupting in its \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 308]\n\u00a0\n tendency. We know of no more pernicious influence than that brought about through a system of commissions paid to public agents engaged in buying public supplies. Such arrangements are a fruitful source of public extravagance and speculation. The conflict created between duty and interest is utterly vicious, unspeakably pernicious, and an unmixed evil. Justice, morality, and public policy unite in condemning such contracts, and no court will tolerate any suit for their enforcement.'\n\n In Leake on Contracts, 409, it is said:\n'Any profit made by an agent in the execution of his agency must be accounted for to the principal, who may claim it as a debt for money received to his use. A gratuity given to an agent for the purpose of influencing the execution of his agency vitiates a contract subsequently made by him, as being presumptively made under that influence, and a gratuity to an agent after the execution of the agency must be accounted for to his principal.'\n\n See also Perry on Trusts,  430, and Parsons on Contracts, 6th ed.  89.\n The principle is most often applied in cases where one holding the relation of a trustee buys the trust property, though at public sale. Examples are numerous. Michoud v. Girod, 4 How. 503, 555, 11 L. ed. 1076, 1099, is a leading case decided by this court. Referring to the general rule, which forbids one to buy in an estate, directly or indirectly, when he is acting for the seller, this court said:\n'The general rule stands upon our great moral obligation to refrain from placing ourselves in relations which ordinarily excite a conflict between self-interest and integrity. It restrains all agents, public and private; but the value of the prohibition is most felt, and its application is more frequent, in the private relations in which the vendor and purchaser may stand towards each other. The disability to purchase is a consequence of that relation between them which imposes on the one a duty to protect the interest of the other, from the \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 309]\n\u00a0\n faithful discharge of which duty his own personal interest may withdraw him. In this conflict of interest, the law wisely interposes. It acts not on the possibility that, in some cases, the sense of that duty may prevail over the motives of self-interest, but it provides against the probability in many cases, and the danger in all cases, that the dictates of self- interest will exercise a predominant influence, and supersede that of duty. It therefore prohibits a party from purchasing on his own account that which his duty or trust requires him to sell on account of another, and from purchasing on account of another that which he sells on his own account. In effect, he is not allowed to unite the two opposite characters of buyer and seller, because his interests, when he is the seller or buyer on his own account, are directly conflicting with those of the person on whose account he buys or sells.'\n\n In Robertson v. Chapman, \n152 \nU.S. 673, 681\n, 38 S. L. ed. 592, 595, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 741, 744, this court, in dealing with the matter of a sale by an agent to himself, effected under cover of another, said:\n'If an agent to sell effects a sale to himself, under the cover of the name of another person, he becomes, in respect to the property, a trustee for the principal; and, at the election of the latter, seasonably made, will be compelled to surrender it, or, if he has disposed of it to a bona fide purchaser, to account not only for its real value, but for any profit realized by him on such resale. And this will be done upon the demand of the principal, although it may not appear that the property, at the time the agent fraudulently acquired it, was worth more than he paid for it. The law will not, in such case, impose upon the principal the burden of proving that he was, in fact, injured, and will only inquire whether the agent has been unfaithful in the discharge of his duty. While his agency continues, he must act in the matter of such agency solely with reference to the interests of his principal. The law will not permit him, without the knowledge or assent of his principal, to occupy a position in which he will be tempted not to do the best he may for the principal.' \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 310]\n\u00a0\n Reading the evidence in relation to Captain Carter's conduct in drafting the specifications, advertising, acceptance of bids, and more particularly his almost invariable exercise of options and other discretionary powers in the subsequent execution of the contracts let to Greene and Gaynor, in the light of the abnormal profit realized by them, of which, approximately, $500,000 ultimately found its way into his possession, we can but entertain a strong conviction that his relations with them from the beginning were inconsistent with his fidelity to the United States, and that he must account to his principal for every dollar of gain or profit or advantage which has been derived by him from these contracts.\n\n The defense against such a conclusion rests upon three propositions:\n\n 1. \nThat the affirmative evidence that he abused his discretion and secretly and corruptly favored Greene and Gaynor is not sufficient.\n We shall not consider this proposition apart from the other two, for it is not material whether the evidence referred to, considered out of relation to the other parts of the case, would or would not make out a case of fraud.\n\n 2. \nThat, in view of the great risk attendant upon such works, the profit claimed to have resulted was not so abnormal as to justify an inference of fraud, and that it was in part due to cheap labor, bordering upon peonage.\n Neither should this contention be considered apart from the chain of evidence which leads to but one inevitable result; namely, that this great profit was not legitimate. Looked at, apart from everything else, a profit of $1,815,941.62 upon a job which cost the contractor but $751,551.86 arouses deep suspicion, and demands a clear explanation. That explanation does not appear in the facts of this record.\n\n 3. \nIt is urged that Captain Carter's greatly increased personal expenditures during the progress of this work, and his acquisition of some four hundred thousand dollars,' worth of \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 311]\n\u00a0\n bonds, stock, and other property, much of which has been impounded in this case as property into which his illicit gains and gratuities have been traced, arose from the generous bounty of Robert F. Westcott, and that Carter was ignorant of any interest Westcott had in the Greene and Gaynor contracts, and of the fact, if it be a fact, that Westcott's gratuities came from his participation in the distribution of the profit on the Greene and Gaynor contracts.\n This last proposition presents the very crux of the case. What was Westcott's relation to the Greene and Gaynor contracts? It has been suggested, rather than urged, that he was, secretly, a partner in these enterprises. There is no evidence that he was, other than the fact that very many profit dividends are traced to bank accounts standing in his name. But, if he was, and Carter bargained with him for a share in the profit, knowing his relation, the legal consequence is the same as if he had received the same interest from Greene or Gaynor. But the apparent participation of Mr. Westcott in the profit arising from the Greene and Gaynor contracts is not inconsistent with a mere agency for Carter, and such an agent we think he was. That Carter could not openly receive any gains or gratuities from Greene and Gaynor is obvious. Some go-between was essential. The requisite conditions for such a screen would suggest Mr. Westcott. He was an aged, retired business man of some fortune, residing in New York. Captain Carter, in October, 1890, married one of his daughters. Mrs. Carter died in December, 1892, leaving no issue. During the marriage, Mr. Westcott made Mrs. Carter a small monthly allowance. His regard and esteem for Captain Carter during the time of and subsequent to this marriage was, on the evidence, very pronounced, and this relation affords the basis for the claim that Captain Carter's greatly increased personal expenditures during the progress of the Greene and Gaynor contracts was due to Mr. Westcott's generous and unceasing gratuities. It is shown that Captain Carter's income was substantially limited to his pay as captain, and that his personal \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 312]\n\u00a0\n expenditures did not exceed three or four thousand dollars per annum down to 1892. From then on his expenditures steadily increased, until they reached and passed $20,000 per annum. Now it cannot escape observation that this great change in his manner of living began with the Greene and Gaynor contracts, and became more and more marked through the progress of the work under his supervision. It does not follow, of course, that the means for such widening expenditures came from these contracts, but the circumstance is suspicious and calls for satisfactory explanation.\n Among other details averred in the bill of complaint is, that, beginning in 1892 and continuing down to 1896, Captain Carter was continuously engaged in making investments in loans, real estate, bonds, and stocks, and that the amount so invested aggregated more than $400,000. Many of these investments turned out to be in the identical securities, which, after much difficulty, were impounded under the process in this case, and are now in the hands of the receiver.\n That the increase from these investments was collected by him, ostensibly for Mr. Westcott, is not questioned. That he applied it to his own personal use is shown by a comparison of the bank accounts standing in his name and those in the name of Westcott, as well as by the inference to be drawn from the remarkable correspondence between the increasing volume of this income and his own personal expenditures. Now Carter does not deny that he did make large investments during 1892, and the years following, nor that the properties and other securities impounded in this case are in large part the result of such investments. What he does claim is that, in making such investments, he was acting for Westcott under powers of attorney which cover most of the time, and under oral authority during the rest. His use of the income from such investments or of means approximating such income, he says, was due to the generous bounty of Mr. Westcott. His title and right to the property in which he made such investments \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 313]\n\u00a0\n for Mr. Westcott he distinctly sets up in his sworn answer as resting alone upon donations made to him in October, 1897, and he sets out as evidence of title two receipts. In that he says that he 'never had any interest, direct or indirect, in the securities described in the receipts of October 11 and 29, 1897, until the same were respectively given to this defendant as a pure and original donation by said Westcott at the time of said respective receipts in October, 1897.'\n The first of these receipts reads thus: 'Received New York, October 11, 1897, from R. F. Westcott, the following bonds, sixty-three in all.' Then follow the numbers and description of bonds. Signed 'O. M. Carter.' The other reads thus: 'Received New York, October 29, 1897, from R. F. Westcott, the following instruments.' Then follows a long list of notes, mortgages, stocks, and bonds. Signed 'O. M. Carter.' The securities described in these receipts are undoubtedly the same securities bought by him from time to time, ostensibly for Mr. Westcott. These purchases and investments show a remarkable correspondence in date and amounts with the dividend distributions of Greene and Gaynor profits, and undoubtedly represent the one third of such profit nominally paid to the account or credit of Westcott. During the years covering these distributions, Captain Carter, according to his own account of matters, stood for and represented Mr. Westcott, sometimes by oral direction and sometimes by power of attorney. Certain it is that there was a blending of the business affairs of these two men rarely ever seen. Under Carter's powers of attorney he checked upon Westcott's bank account as his own. He had free access to his safe deposit box, where these securities were kept, and collected interest and dividends as they accrued. Certain investments of large amounts were shown to have been made by him which did not appear in Westcott's bank account. This was explained by Carter, who, in substance, said that Mr. Westcott had, on going off to Europe, left a large amount of currency in his safe deposit box, and that he invested this money for Westcott. Not less than \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 314]\n\u00a0\n $100,000 of money appears to have come from that source, and yet Carter says that he cannot say how much Mr. Westcott left there, nor how much remained when he returned, and that although he and Mr. Westcott had occasional settlements, they neither gave nor received receipts nor rendered accounts. There is no positive, competent evidence explaining just why these securities were in the personal custody of Mr. Westcott in October, 1897. Captain Carter was relieved at Savannah in July, 1897, by Captain Gillette, who very early discovered indications of maladministration by his predecessor. By direction of General Wilson he pressed his investigations and caused charges to be preferred. In August, 1897, and before Gillette's discoveries had been made public, Captain Carter was sent to England as military attache with the American embassy. Within a month he returned, doubtless due to orders, only to find that serious charges, involving his career and his honor, had been preferred, and that his management of the Savannah district improvements was about to undergo a thorough investigation. There is evidence, as we have before stated, strongly tending to show that he had himself collected the interest and dividends upon the shares and bonds mentioned in these receipts up to the time he went abroad,-a fact which points to his having had personal custody of these securities up to that time. Though there is no competent positive evidence that he did turn these securities over to Westcott, or caused them to be placed in his hands, for safekeeping, before his trip abroad, there is good reason for believing so. Frederick P. Solley, another son-in-law of R. F. Westcott, says that he went with Mr. Westcott to his safe deposit box in October, 1897, to get these securities. The statement then made to him by Westcott as to why he had possession of these instruments was objected to as not competent, being declarations in the absence of Carter. The objection was sustained, and there is no error assigned. Solley says 'that he and Westcott carried them to the office of Mr. Stimson, Westcott's lawyer;' there a list was made out and the witness checked them \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 315]\n\u00a0\n over. He did not see them delivered to Carter. But Mr. Stimson did. What explanation Mr. Westcott made to him of the transaction before Carter's arrival and delivery to him has been excluded, because not made in Carter's presence. He, however, saw the transfer, and saw the receipt signed. The significance of Stimson's evidence as to what was said in the presence of both Westcott and Carter is that nothing was said as to this being a gift, and that no acknowledgment was made so indicating. He does not recall anything said by Westcott in the presence of Carter. He does, however, say that after Carter had taken the securities, alluding to a number of bonds which were among the securities, he said: \"Daddy, I want you to take these,' or 'Daddy, I want to give these bonds to you.' Something substantially to that effect, and that Mr. Westcott replied: 'No,' either verbally or with some gesture of dissent. Captain Carter put the bonds which he had referred to back with the others and took them all.' A proposal to give to Westcott a part of the very securities which Westcott was then giving to Carter as a 'pure donation' is incompatible with the latter contention; it accords more with the attitude of one who was receiving back his own from one who had performed a great service as custodian of property which the owner had reason for concealing from publicity.\n A more significant fact pointing to the same conclusion is that Robert F. Westcott did not come forward and testify in favor of his son-in- law before the board of inquiry, or before the subsequent court-martial. The investigation before the board of inquiry and the trial before the court-martial involved Carter's execution of the contracts in question, and his business relations with both the contractors and with Westcott. In both investigations Carter claimed, then as now, that his large personal expenditures were met by gifts to his wife and, after her death, to himself by Mr. Westcott, and that, in the purchase of large amounts of securities and other property, he had only acted for Mr. Westcott. The testimony of Mr. Westcott was vital to his defense upon the merits. The board of \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 316]\n\u00a0\n inquiry sat in the fall of 1897, and the court-martial later. Westcott was living during both proceedings; but he appeared in neither, though urged to appear by General Gillespie, the president of the board. When the evidence was taken in the pending case he was dead, having died in July, 1901. If it be conceded that the testimony of one not in the service could not have been required in a purely military investigation, it was within Westcott's power to have voluntarily testified as many other witnesses did. After Carter had been convicted, there occurred in the city of New York certain removal proceedings before a United States commissioner, for the purpose of removing Greene and Gaynor from New York to Savannah for trial upon indictments there pending for the very fraud here under consideration. Carter was included in the same indictments, but was not a party to the removal proceedings mentioned. In that case Mr. Westcott was examined by the United States. His evidence then delivered was offered by the United States in the circuit court as evidence in this case, but was excluded upon objection, as having been given in a proceeding to which Carter was not a party, and without opportunity for cross-examination by him. The objection was rightly sustained. The evidence was, however, admitted for the purpose of fixing notice upon the defendants Lorenzo D. Carter and I. Stanton Carter of the character of the title of their brother, Oberlin M. Carter, to the securities involved in this suit. The evidence was properly admitted solely for the purpose of showing Westcott's disclaimer of any title to or interest in the securities which he handed over to Carter, as shown by his receipts mentioned above. We, however, exclude any statement made by him as against the defendant Oberlin M. Carter. The significant fact remains that Robert F. Westcott, though the close friend, and, indeed, the affectionate friend, of his ex-son-in-law, Oberlin M. Carter, did not voluntarily appear before either of the military tribunals in his defense, and, figuratively, stood by and saw him broken in rank and sent in ignominy to serve a term of five years for \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 317]\n\u00a0\n having betrayed his trust. It is true that Captain Carter says that he did all he could to persuade Mr. Westcott to appear and testify. Nevertheless, the failure of Captain Carter to secure his evidence, in view of their relation, justifies a presumption that it would not have borne out the defense.\n The conclusion we must reach is that Robert F. Westcott was but the agent and representative of Oberlin M. Carter in the receipt of a share in the profit made by Greene and Gaynor.\n For whatever gains, profits, or gratuities he is shown to have received, he must account.\n The contention that any recovery must be limited to property or securities into which such illicit gains have been traced is not sound.\n The facts stated by the bill and supported by the evidence show that Carter received from Greene and Gaynor, directly or indirectly, something in excess of $500,000 as his share in the Greene and Gaynor contracts. Under the legal principle which we have heretofore announced, the United States may require Captain Carter to account for all he has received by way of gain, gifts, or profits out of the Greene and Gaynor contracts, irrespective of the actual damage it has sustained or its ability to follow such gains into specific property. Undoubtedly it may, as by its bill it sought to do, follow the fund so corruptly received, and assert title to any property into which such illegal gains have gone. But there was a prayer for 'other, further, and general relief;' and under that it was entitled to a judgment, as for money had and received for its use, for any difference between the cost of the specific property recovered and the gains so received which it is unable to trace. The decree against O. M. Carter was for a much less sum than such difference.\n Neither did the agreement of November 6, 1901, between the parties, of which we shall speak later, afford any defense to the judgments against I. S. and L. D. Carter. Those judgments were for securities traced to their possession, which \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 318]\n\u00a0\n had not been disposed of in good faith, in view of the knowledge they had of the character of Captain Carter's title and the legal right of the United States to pursue his illegal gains into the property in their hands. There is no error in the decree below of which the cross appellants can complain.\n There remains for consideration the appeal by the United States. This involves allowances made out of the funds in court into which the gains of Carter had been traced, under an agreement between the United States and the defendants O. M. Carter and his brothers. Only the second, seventh, eighth, and ninth paragraphs of the agreement need be set out, and they are set out in the margin. \n\n\n (2)\n That as to the assets claimed by the government as assets into which it charges the fund intrusted to Oberlin M. Carter, as disbursing officer, was diverted, with the proceeds, income, and reinvestments thereof, where the form of the investments have been changed, and which assets have or may be hereafter traced into the possession, custody, or control of said defendants, and have not theretofore been bona fide disposed of by them, and therefore beyond their control, shall be forthwith by the said defendants turned over to the receiver appointed in this cause. But the court will determine whether the one Kentucky Central bond and one Michigan Telephone bond, charged in the bill to be reinvestments of said alleged trust fund, and which bonds are claimed by I Stanton Carter, should be held by the receiver pending the litigation.\n\n\n (7)\n From said fund to be accounted for to the receiver, the sum of $5, 000 shall be left in the hands of H. G. Stone, chief counsel for said Oberlin M. Carter, from which to compensate and cover the expense of employment of local counsel in any of the districts in which local counsel have been or may be employed in any branch of this case.\n\n\n (8)\n From said fund, to be accounted for to the receiver, there shall be paid:\n\n\n (a)\n The fees, traveling expenses, and other expenses of Oberlin M. Carter's chief counsel and of his attorney at Chicago, to be fixed and allowed by the court.\n The importance of the case, and the means and methods taken to bring the same to a just determination speedily, and not the length to which the proceedings may be protracted, to be considered as elements of merits in fixing such fees.\n\n\n (b)\n Also the fee of his attorney for representing said Carter in case of any criminal trial in Georgia, if Carter should be placed on trial there prior to the final disposition of this case.\n\n\n (c)\n The expenses of taking evidence in behalf of said Carter, including the services of an accountant at not exceeding $10 per day for his services when needed and actually employed, plus his expenses, if any.\n\n\n (d)\n And if, before the final determination of this cause, the said Oberlin M. Carter shall be liberated from prison, he shall be allowed his reasonable personal expenses incurred by him while engaged in work in this cause, including the taking of evidence, but with no compensation for his time. Such expenses to be determined by the court and paid out of the moneys in court. \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 319]\n\u00a0\n The United States assigns as error the allowance of a fee of $60,000 to Mr. H. G. Stone for his services in this and the ancillary suits, of which a balance of $42,500 was directed to be paid by the receiver out of the fund in court. Certain other payments to other counsel and for other expenses are also objected to. The ground of objection is that the allowance to Mr. Stone is excessive, and that neither that fee nor any of the other items should have been paid, because the condition upon which the United Stated agreed to the use of the fund had not been complied with.\n So far as the amount of the allowance is concerned, we do not feel authorized to disturb it, as two courts in succession \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 320]\n\u00a0\n have concurred in the amount allowed as reasonable. The consideration for the stipulation was abundantly sufficient to justify the assent of the United States. As it turns out, the bargain may appear to have been too generous, for the right of the United States to the entire fund which had been turned over to Lorenzo D. and I. Stanton Carter, as things now appear, was clear. Whether the securities which were the subject of this stipulation could have been seized and subjected was not so clear then, nor was the character of the claims which might be asserted by L. D. and I. S. Carter to these assets then fully known. Upon this stipulation they agreed to turn over to the receiver the assets claimed by the United States in the pending bill, which had not been theretofore 'bona fide disposed of by them, and therefore beyond their control.' This agreement necessarily left open for adjustment the question as to what assets received from O. M. Carter by his brothers, the defendants L. O. and I. S. Carter, had been theretofore disposed of by them bona fide, and which were therefore beyond their control. Immediately thereafter I. S. Carter delivered to the receiver assets in specie aggregating $71,660. The receiver's receipt is dated November 11, 1901. On May 23, 1900, I. S. Carter and Ditson P. Carter received from one J. H. Paul, in trust, for O. M. Carter, a long list of securities, of which a part went into the possession of Ditson P. Carter and the rest into the possession of I. S. Carter. The securities turned over on November 11, 1901, by I. S. Carter, are a part of those covered by the receipt given to J. H. Paul. On December 23, 1901, Mr. H. G. Stone, counsel for the Carters, reported to Mr. Edward I. Johnson, representing the United States, that, aside from the securities theretofore turned over by I. S. Carter on November 11, 1901, there remained to be accounted for assets which he listed, aggregating $69,704.53. Against this he claimed that I. S. Carter and L. D. Carter had disbursed $119,127.42. This left the parties every wide apart. The matter was referred to Mr. William M. Booth, as special master. In the \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 321]\n\u00a0\n accounting which ensued it appeared that many of the securities which had been received by one or the other of the Carter brothers in trust for O. M. Carter had been sold and the proceeds either reinvested or disbursed by them, or retained as salaries under agreements made between them and O. M. Carter. The master reported that there were very wide divergencies between the defendants and the United States as to the rule of accountability, the defendants insisting that any disbursements made by them satisfactory to O. M. Carter were proper credits, including large sums appropriated as salaries for managing these assets, as well as other large amounts for which no vouchers could be furnished. On the other hand, it was claimed that disbursements made by them must be accounted for to the complainant, as to a cestui que trust, and that all sums retained by them as compensation for their services should be disallowed, in view of their undoubted knowledge of the character of Carter's title.\n We shall not go further into this matter than to say that the final result in the court of appeals was to disallow the salary claims and some of the disbursements, for which no good reason was shown, or no vouchers produced. Among the assets in the hands of these trustees, at the date of the account, were twenty-one Kentucky Central bonds of $1,000 each, which appeared to have been the result of re-investments which had been appropriated by them on account of salaries. These the court required them to account for. The result was that, although they were allowed many thousand dollars on account of very questionable disbursements, there was a considerable decree against each of them for assets not accounted for or turned over in specie. The single question to which we shall apply this generalization of facts respecting this accounting is as it affects the condition upon which the United States agreed that, out of the funds in court, Captain Carter's expenses in conducting his defense, including counsel fees, should be paid. The stipulation was that 'fees, traveling expenses, and other expenses of Oberlin \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 322]\n\u00a0\n M. Carter's chief counsel [meaning Mr. H. G. Stone], and of his attorney at Chicago, to be fixed and allowed by the court,' etc. The 'condition' which the United States claims was violated was 'that the said defendants will turn over to the receiver at least substantially all of the assets turned over to I. S. Carter and L. D. Carter by J. H. Paul and R. E. Westcott and James Bragg, or their proceeds and reinvestments, except such as have been, prior to the receivership, bona fide paid out or pledged by them for attorneys' fees, or as expenses in defense of said Carter, or expended by them legitimately in the handling of said properties,' etc. This condition, we think, has not been violated by the insistence upon a credit for all disbursements made by them in Captain Carter's defense and in the care of his estate in their hands, nor by their claim to the compensation which he had agreed to allow them. The original agreement, as well as the provision inserted by the United States, alike provied that they should not be required to turn over that which had been disbursed in good faith. This involved the right to have their disbursements and their claims for services inquired into from their point of view. The Central Kentucky bonds represented, as the court found, reinvestments of funds or income from funds. They claimed that these bonds were rightfully their own property under the agreement with Captain Carter for a salary of $10,000 per year for one of them and $3,600 per year for the other. The court decided against this claim, but we do not believe that counsel, who, in good faith, presented the defense of the Carters for such salaries or for other disbursements made by them, should be deprived of the benefit of the stipulation which provided for their compensation. The bargain with the government may appear a bad one, but it was a contract and should be observed.\n The petition for a writ of prohibition, being calendar No. 10, original, will be dismissed, as the court, in view of the affirmance of the decree appealed from, finds it now \n\n[217 U.S. 286, 323]\n\u00a0\n unnecessary to decide any question as to the jurisdiction of the Circuit court pending the appeal just disposed of.\n The errors assigned by the United States are overruled and the decree affirmed in all particulars. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Select Cases, temp.

Vroman for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n By an act approved March 3d, 1887, chap. 376 (amended by act of February 12th, 1896, chap. 18, and by act of March 2d, 1896, chap. 39), Congress provided for the adjustment of land grants theretofore made in aid of the construction of railroads, and for the forfeiture of unearned lands, and for the relinquishment or reconveyance to the United States of lands which had been certified or patented to or for the use of any railroad company. 24 Stat. at L. 556; U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1895; 29 Stat. at L. 6, 42, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 1596, 1603\n\n\n If, upon completing such adjustment, it appeared that, from any cause, lands had been erroneously certified or patented by the United States, to or for the use of a railroad company, by, through, or under grant from the United States, to aid in the construction of a railroad, then it became the duty of the Secretary of the Interior to demand the relinquishment or reconveyance of such lands to the United States, whether within granted or indemnity limits; and if such demand was not complied with by a named time, then the Attorney General was to institute the necessary proceedings to cancel all patents, certificates, or other evidence of title issued for such lands, and to restore the title to the United States. Provision was made for the protection, by patents, of purchasers in good faith from the grantee company, and the Secretary of the Interior was required to demand, on behalf of the United States, 'payment from the company which has so disposed of such lands of an amount equal to the government price for similar lands;' and if payment was refused, within a time named, 'the Attorney General was to institute suits against the company for such amount.' Ibid.\n Under the authority of that act, the present suit was brought by the United States in 1903. It relates to about \n\n[218 U.S. 233, 235]\n\u00a0\n 4,300 acres of lands in Kossuth, Palo Alto, and Dickinson counties, Iowa, which, the United States alleges, were erroneously patented (in 1880) to the defendant railway company. That company sold the lands to purchasers in good faith, and refuses to account to the United States for the proceeds of such sales.\n The relief asked is a decree compelling the railway company to account for such proceeds, and declaring such indebtedness to be a lien upon all funds in its hands realized from the above sales. The company took issue with the government by answer, but before the cause was heard, the material facts were stipulated by the parties. The circuit court dismissed the bill, and its judgment was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals.\n In order that the grounds upon which the lower courts proceeded may fully appear, the circumstances under which the defendant railroad company became connected with the lands must be stated.\n By an act passed May 12th, 1864, chap. 84, Congress, in aid of the construction of certain railroads, granted to the state of Iowa, for the use and benefit of the McGregor Western Railroad Company, 'every alternate section of land designated by odd numbers for ten sections in width on each side of said roads; but, in case it shall appear that the United States have, when the lines or routes of said roads are definitely located, sold any section or any part thereof, granted as aforesaid, or that the right of pre-emption or homestead settlement has attached to the same, or that the same has been reserved by the United States for any purpose whatever, then it shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Interior to cause to be selected, for the purposes aforesaid, from the public lands of the United States nearest to the tiers of sections above specified, so much land in alternate sections, or parts of sections, designated by odd numbers, as shall be equal to such lands as the United States have sold, reserved, or \n\n[218 U.S. 233, 236]\n\u00a0\n otherwise appropriated, or to which the right of homestead settlement or pre-emption has attached, as aforesaid, which lands thus indicated by odd numbers and sections, by the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, shall be held by the state of Iowa for the uses and purposes aforesaid: Provided, That the lands so selected shall in no case be located more than twenty miles from the lines of said roads: Provided, further, That any and all lands heretofore reserved to the United States by any act of Congress, or in any other manner by competent authority, for the purpose of aiding in any object of internal improvement or other purpose whatever, be, and the same are hereby, reserved and excepted from the operation of this act, except so far as it may be found necessary to locate the route of said roads through such reserved lands, in which case the right of way shall be granted, subject to the approval of the President of the United States.' 13 Stat. at L. 72. The provisions of this act were duly accepted by the state in 1866. Laws of Iowa, 1866, chap. 42, p. 189.\n The McGregor & Western Railroad Company failed to comply with the conditions of the above act. Thereupon, all lands and rights to land granted to it by the act of 1864 (the lands now in dispute being part of those so granted) were 'absolutely and entirely resumed by the state of Iowa,' by an act of February 27th, 1868, which declared that 'the same be and are as fully and absolutely vested in the state as if the same had never been granted to said railroad company.' Laws of Iowa, 1868, p. 20. The state then, by an act of March 31st, 1868, gave the benefit of the grant for the road in question to the McGregor & Sioux City Railway Company, which accepted the terms prescribed by that act. Laws of Iowa, 1868, chap. 58, p. 70. But that company also failed to comply with the terms of the grant, and the lands and rights of lands granted were again resumed by the state, and afterwards were passed upon certain terms and conditions to the Chicago, Mil- \n\n[218 U.S. 233, 237]\n\u00a0\n waukee, & St. Paul Railway Company, by an act passed February 27th, 1878. The latter company accepted the provisions of that grant, and, in recognition of its rights, the United States, in 1880, patented to the state for the benefit of that company the following lands, covered by the act of 1864: 320 acres in Dickinson county, by patent of April, 1880; 3754. 81 in Kossuth and Palo Alto counties. These lands embraced all sued for except two tracts aggregating 200 acres in Kossuth county, to which the present defendant asserted no title. Laws of Iowa, 1878, chap. 21, p. 18. Upon compliance with the terms and conditions prescribed in that act, the governor of Iowa was authorized to patent and transfer to the present defendant, the Chicago, Milwaukee, & St. Paul Railway Company, the lands mentioned in the act of Congress of 1864.\n In 1864 and 1869 maps of definite location, designating the line of said road in Iowa, as indicated in the act of 1864, were filed in the office of the Commissioner of the General Land Office.\n It is alleged in the bill of complaint that, at the date of such definite location, all the lands the proceeds of the sale of which the government now claims, by which were within the 10-mile or place limits of the railroad, were covered by existing claims of record in the office of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, consisting of homestead entries, pre-emption declaratory statements, warrant locations, etc., and were pending before the Department of the Interior for adjudication. If that were true, then, by the very terms of the act of Congress, the lands in question would have been excepted from the grant of 1864. But the defendant denied in its answer that such fact existed, and it does not appear from the evidence that any homestead entry, pre-emption, declaratory statement, or warrant location had been made prior to the definite location of the line of the railroad. On the contrary, it was stipulated in the case that prior to and on \n\n[218 U.S. 233, 238]\n\u00a0\n August 30th, 1864,-which was after the passage by Congress of the original granting act, and was the date of the filing of the plat of definite location of the road,-none of the lands described in the bill of complaint had been covered by any homestead entry, pre-emption, declaratory statement, or warrant location or other existing claims of record in the office of the Commissioner of the General Land Office. In that view, and if this were the whole case, then, beyond all question, the law would be in favor of the railway company; for the grant of 1864 was one in praesenti for the purposes therein mentioned, and according to the settled doctrines of this court, the beneficiary of the grant was entitled to the lands granted in place limits which had not been appropriated or reserved by the United States for any purpose, or to which a homestead or pre- emption right had not attached prior to the definite location of the road proposed to be aided. The grant plainly included odd-numbered sections, within 10 miles on each side of the road, which were part of the public domain, not previously appropriated or set apart for some specific purpose at the time of the definite location.\n But the government insists that before the passage of the act of 1864 these lands had been reserved by what was done under or in execution of what is known as the swamp land act of September 28th, 1850 [9 Stat. at L. 519, chap. 84, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1586], and cannot, therefore, be regarded as granted by, but were excepted from, the operation of the act of 1864. 13 Stat. at L. 72,  1, chap. 84. Consequently, it is contended by the United States, patents could not have been legally issued to the railway company under the act of 1864. The contention of the railway company, on the other hand, is that the lands in question were not, in fact, swamp or overflowed lands granted by the act of 1850, to which any right could legally attach in behalf of the state under that act; therefore, it is contended that nothing done under that act availed or could have availed the state except a decision \n\n[218 U.S. 233, 239]\n\u00a0\n or ruling by competent authority, in due form, that these lands were in fact within the class of swamp or overflowed lands mentioned in the act of 1850.\n In view of what has been said, it becomes necessary to inquire into the scope and effect of the swamp land act of 1850.\n By the act of Congress of September 28th, 1850, chap. 84, Congress granted to Arkansas all the swamp and overflowed lands unfit for cultivation, within its limits, and which remained unsold at the time, to enable the state to construct the necessary levees and drains to reclaim such lands. That act provided that it should be 'the duty of the Secretary of the Interior, as soon as may be practicable after the passage of this act, to make out an accurate list and plats of the lands described as aforesaid, and transmit the same to the governor of the state of Arkansas, and, at the request of said governor, cause a patent to be issued to the state therefor; and on that patent, the fee simple to said lands shall vest in the said state of Arkansas, subject to the disposal of the legislature thereof: Provided, however, that the proceeds of said lands, whether from sale or by direct appropriation in kind, shall be applied, exclusively, as far as necessary, to the purpose of reclaiming said lands by means of the levees and drains aforesaid' ( 2); that 'in making out a list and plats of the land aforesaid, all legal subdivisions, the greater part of which is 'wet and unfit for cultivation,' shall be included in said list and plats; but when the greater part of a subdivision is not of that character, the whole of it shall be excluded therefrom' ( 3); and that 'the provisions of this act be extended to, and their benefits be conferred upon, each of the other states of the Union in which such swamp and overflowed lands, known and designated as aforesaid, may be situated' ( 4). 9 Stat. at L. 519, chap. 84, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1587.\n We have seen that by the act of 1864 the railroad company, by the grant in proesenti in that act contained, was \n\n[218 U.S. 233, 240]\n\u00a0\n to get the oddnumbered sections within 10 miles on each side of its line, and not sold by the United States before definite location, or to which no right of pre-emption or homestead settlement had attached at the time of such location, or which had not been previously reserved by the United States for some purpose. It is stipulated that when the line of the railroad was definitely located, none of the lands in question 'were covered by any homestead entry, pre-emption, declaratory statements, or warrant locations, or other existing claims of record in the office of the Commissioner of the General Land Office of the Department of the Interior.' But the United States contends that what was done, prior to the definite location of the road, for the purpose of bringing these lands under the operation of the act of 1850 as swamp and overflowed lands, created a claim that covered or attached these lands. But this contention of the government must be considered in the light of the fundamental inquiry whether the latter claim can avail anything whatever if the lands were not in fact swamp or overflowed lands; for only lands of that character were granted by the act of 1850, and no mere claim that they were swamp or overflowed lands could make them such, unless it was sustained by some decision or ruling by competent authority to that effect. There never was any such decision or ruling. It is true that Dickinson, Palo Alto, and Kossuth counties-acting, we may assume, for the purposes of this case, under the sanction of the state-made selections of those lands as swamp lands; but it is stipulated and agreed in this case that those selections were never adopted, ratified, or confirmed in any manner by the Interior or Land Department, but remained pending and undetermined therein down to the year 1876; that 'during that time the state of Iowa claimed said lands as being swamp and overflowed lands granted to it under and by virtue of said act of Congress of September 28, 1850, and as having been selected \n\n[218 U.S. 233, 241]\n\u00a0\n as such by said several counties under authority of an act of its legislature, approved January 13, 1853; and said McGregor Western Railroad Company and said McGregor & Sioux City Railway Company (afterwards McGregor & Missouri River Railway Company) successively made claims to the same lands as being neither swamp nor overflowed in character, but as inuring to them respectively, under the act of Congress of May 12, 1864, as place lands, within the 10-mile limits of said grant, under the plat of definite location filed August 30, 1864; that on May 31, 1876, and on October 21, 1876, the Commissioner of the General Land Office, upon public hearings of the matter of such respective claims, and after due notice to all parties interested, duly held and adjusted in writing that the lands in said Dickinson, Kossuth, and Palo Alto counties, Iowa, mentioned and described in complainant's exhibit 'A' and in paragraphs 11 and 12 of defendant's answer in this cause, were not in fact swamp or overflowed lands, and were not of a character embraced in said act of Congress of September 28, 1850, and known as the swamp land act; and that the state of Iowa and said several counties were never entitled to said lands, or any part thereof, under said act. Said hearings were had pursuant to the requirements of the act of Congress of March 5, 1872 [17 Stat. at L. 37, chap. 39], and said findings and decisions of the Commissioner were never appealed from, reversed, or modified in any manner, as shown by the records of said General Land Office.' Nearly thirty years have passed since this decision of the Land Department, and the United States, without ever appealing from the decision of the Land Department, now comes forward and asks a court of equity to cancel the patent issued in 1880 and 1881, under which the railway claims. Touching this aspect of the case, the circuit court of appeals said: 'Since then most, if not all, of the lands have been sold and conveyed to numerous purchasers of small tracts, who bought them in good faith and for value. \n\n[218 U.S. 233, 242]\n\u00a0\n Twenty-five years or more of quiet enjoyment of the land in question have now elapsed. No fraud or unfair practices in any stage of the proceedings leading up to the final patents are charged against the railway company or any persons acting for it. In such circumstances, it would, in our opinion, be inequitable and conducive of no good results to grant the relief sought by this bill.' [87 C. C. A. 600, 160 Fed. 826.]\n In determining this case, it must not be overlooked that the act of Congress confers upon the Secretary of the Interior, and upon him alone, the power to identify particular lands as swamp and overflow lands embraced by the act of 1850. Referring to the 2d section of that act, Mr. Justice Miller, speaking for the court in French v. Fyan, \n93 \nU.S. 169, 171\n, 23 S. L. ed. 812, 813, said: 'It was under the power conferred by this section that the patent was issued under which defendant holds the land. We are of opinion that this section devolved upon the Secretary, as the head of the Department which administered the affairs of the public lands, the duty, and conferred on him the power, of determining what lands were of the description granted by that act, and made his office the tribunal whose decision on that subject was to be controlling.' To the same effect, on this point, are Ehrhardt v. Hogaboom, \n115 \nU.S. 67, 68\n, 29 S. L. ed. 346, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1157, and Rogers Locomotive Mach. Works v. American Emigrant Co. \n164 \nU.S. 559, 571\n, 41 S. L. ed. 552, 557, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 188. In the latter case the court said: 'The identification of lands embraced by the swamp land act was therefore necessary before the state could claim a patent or exercise absolute control of them.'\n We repeat that it must be taken that these lands were not swamp or overflowed lands that had been reserved by the United States under the act of 1850. That fact must be regarded as conclusively established, as between the present parties. We say conclusively established; for, after full notice to all parties who were concerned in the matter, and who had asserted titles to these lands, the \n\n[218 U.S. 233, 243]\n\u00a0\n Commissioner of the General Land Office decided, in 1876, after full hearing, that these lands were not, in fact, swamp or overflowed lands, and that neither the state nor any of its counties were entitled to them or any of them under the act of 1850. That hearing by the Commissioner was had pursuant to said act of Congress of March 5th, 1872, chap. 39, which provided, among other things, that the decision should be 'without prejudice to legal entries or the rights of bona fide settlers under the homestead and pre-emption laws of the United States prior to the date of this act.' 17 Stat. at L. 37. In any view, that decision was, in contemplation of law, one by the Secretary of the Interior, who, by the original act of 1850, was directed to make out accurate lists or plats of the lands described by that act as swamp and overflowed lands. Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498, 10 L. ed. 264; Wolsey v. Chapman, \n101 \nU.S. 755, 768\n, 25 S. L. ed. 915, 919. The decision was never appealed from, and has never been reversed or modified. The United States now comes, many years after such decision, and in disregard of the unreversed decision of the Land Department, asks a decree which cannot be rendered except upon the theory that these lands were, in fact, swamp or overflowed lands. We cannot adopt this theory nor make any such decree as that asked. By the act of 1850, Congress granted in proesenti to the state only swamp and overflowed lands within its limits; and the state legally, we may concede, for the purposes of this case, passed its interest in such lands to the counties in which they were situated. A dispute arose between the parties interested in the question before the Land Department, among whom were the counties claiming, by sanction of the state, to have legally selected the lands under the act of 1850, as to whether the lands were, in fact, swamp or overflowed lands. That dispute, upon notice and hearing, as we have seen, was decided adversely to the contentions of the state and of the counties in question, by the Department which alone had authority to \n\n[218 U.S. 233, 244]\n\u00a0\n determine what were and what were not swamp or overflowed lands. We perceive no sound reason why what decision, unreversed and unmodified in any respect, should not be accepted as conclusive of the essential facts upon which it was based. In that view, the United States has no standing in a court of equity to obtain a decree that will be in disregard of the fact thus conclusively found by the Land Department. Therefore, their certification to the state for the benefit of the railway company, under the act of 1864, cannot be held to have been an error. It is, in substance, admitted-at any rate, the record shows-that if the lands were not swamp or overflowed, the company was entitled to them under the act of 1864, as lands not previously reserved, but granted for the benefit of the railway company. If, notwithstanding the decision of the Land Department, the court should determine the rights of the parties according to the facts presented to that Department, it would be confronted with the fact, established by the record, that the lands in question were not swamp or overflowed. We omit any reference to other questions, which, if determined, would lead to the same result as above stated. The decree dismissing the bill was right and the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is sustained. \n\n\n\n","175":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 220), and was advanced to be heard with and was heard with No. 380, just decided. [\n218 U.S. 532\n, 54 L. ed. 1139, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 99.]\n It involves substantially the same questions as No. 380. The indictment consists of fourteen counts, seven numbered and seven numbered and lettered. The court quashed the numbered counts, and its action as to six of them this writ of error is prosecuted to review.\n The circuit court, in its opinion, expressed the similarity of this case and No. 380 as follows:\n'From an examination of them which I recently made it appears, or would appear to me, that six out of the seven numbered counts in the indictment of 1910 there is exactly the same story as was contained in the corresponding number of counts in the indictment of 1909, with this difference; that the transaction which was said to have been evidenced by a demand note of 1909 is called in 1910 a demand loan, and it is then asserted, after stating the same facts in substance as those set forth in 1909, that there was a conversion.'\n\n And the view was expressed that if the indictment 'had stopped there, it might be good on demurrer.' By special words followed, it was said, which defeated this effect, and made the statements of the indictment the same as the 'corresponding statements of 1909, except that they have a label put on them, and they are called 'conversion.\" And finding no 'magic' in that word, the court further said, 'the allegations set forth specially' did 'not, even \n\n[218 U.S. 547, 549]\n\u00a0\n prima facie, amount to a conversion.' And that calling them such did not 'help the matter.'\n We might assume the identity of the questions in the cases on this statement, and rest the decision of this case on the opinion in No. 380, but it may be well to examine the indictment. The averment is that Heinze, with the intent to injure the Mercantile National Bank, did wilfully misapply $60,000 of its moneys, funds, and credits, 'by unlawfully, knowingly, fraudulently, and wilfully, and not for any use, benefit, or advantage of the said banking association, converting and applying the said moneys, funds, and credits to the use, benefit, and advantage of certain persons . . .' which said conversion and application of the said moneys, etc., were then and there accomplished by him by virtue of his power as president over such moneys, etc., and that he, at the time and place, and with the intent and to the use mentioned, wilfully applied the said sum 'to the making of a certain demand loan' to Otto Heinze & Company, 'and which said loan, when so made as aforesaid, was not then and there well secured, which fact he . . . then and there well knew;' and did cause the proceeds of said loan to be paid out of the moneys, etc., of the bank, 'and applied and converted to the use and benefit' of that firm, whereby the sum of $60,000 'then and there was wholly lost to the bank, and that its moneys, etc., were and are depleted in that amount.'\n Stripped of its repetitions, it charges that Heinze used his power and control as president of the bank to lend the sum of $60,000 of its moneys to Otto Heinze & Company without taking any security whatever for it, and that this was done, not for the use of the bank, but for the use of such firm, and with the intent to defraud the bank, and to convert and apply that sum to the use, benefit, and advantage of such firm. And it is averred that it was wholly lost to the bank. \n\n[218 U.S. 547, 550]\n\u00a0\n The other numbered counts contain the same allegations as count 1, except they relate to different transactions, and with like exception the subsequent lettered counts relate to the same transactions as count 1 A. The latter count relates to the same transaction as count 1, except it alleges that the misapplication was for the benefit of Fritz Augustus Heinze and Otto Heinze & Company while in the first count it is alleged that the misapplication was alone for the benefit of Otto Heinze & Company, and with the further exception that the inducement and purpose of the loan is set out with a detail of circumstances.\n It is insisted, as it was in No. 380, that this court has not the right of review of the order of the circuit court, because it only passed upon the sufficiency of the indictment, and did not construe the statute. Upon what ground the court proceeded is not very clear. As we have seen, the court said that in the six counts passed upon 'there is exactly the same story as was contained in the corresponding number of counts in the indictment of 1909,' the only difference being that in the indictment now under consideration the statements 'have a label put on them, and they are called 'conversion.\" The court found no 'magic' in the word, and said that 'the allegations set forth specially did not even prima facie amount to a conversion.' The question naturally occurs, why the court thought so? And the answer must be from the conception it had of the requirements of the statute, which it expressed when passing on the indictment of 1909, and which we considered in No. 380. In other words, that the counts had the same defect which the indictment of 1909 had, and the motion to quash was granted as to them for the same reason which the court gave in passing on the indictment of 1909. This court, therefore, has jurisdiction.\n It is further contended that the circuit court granted the motion to quash in the exercise of its descretion, and \n\n[218 U.S. 547, 551]\n\u00a0\n therefore its action is not reviewable under the act of March 2, 1907. The contention is untenable. The act of March 2, 1907, expressly provides that a writ of error may be taken by the United States 'from a decision or judgment quashing . . . any indictment, or any count thereof, where such decision or judgment is based upon the invalidity or construction of the statute upon which the indictment is founded.' United States v. Stevenson, \n215 U.S. 190\n, 54 L. ed. 153, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 35. And we have pointed out, the decision of the circuit court in this case was so based.\n On the merits the case is determined by the opinion in No. 380.\n Reversed and remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","177":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3497). The demurrer was sustained as to fifteen counts, and the United States has brought the case here by virtue of the act of March 2, 1907, chap. 2564, providing for writs of error in certain instances in criminal cases, among which instances is a decision or judgment sustaining a demurrer to an indictment, 'where such decision or judgment is based upon the invalidity or construction of the statute upon which the indictment is founded.' 34 Stat. at L. 1246, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 220.\n The averments of the first count may be taken as an example of all. It averred that Heinze was the president of the bank, and that, by 'virtue of his official relation to it as its president, and by virtue of the power of control, direction, and management' which, as president, he had over its moneys, funds, and credits, he 'wilfully, wrongfully, unlawfully, and with intent to injure and defraud' it 'and divers other persons to the grand jurors unknown,' and without the knowledge and consent of it or of its board of directors and committees, for his use and benefit and advantage, and of other persons to the grand jurors unknown, misapplied certain of its moneys, funds, and credits, to wit, the sum of $100,000, by receiving and discounting with its moneys, etc., a certain promissory note ( the names of the drawers being given) for the sum of $100,000, payable on demand, and which note, when so received and discounted, 'was not then and there well secured, and, in fact, was not secured at all,' which fact he knew, and which amount, it being the proceeds of the discount of the note, was wholly lost to the bank.\n The other counts charge the misapplication of the funds of the bank in the same way, the amounts and makers of the notes discounted being different. And it is alleged of some of them, not that they were not secured at all, but \n\n[218 U.S. 532, 539]\n\u00a0\n that they were, at the time of discount, 'not well secured.' A total loss to the bank of the respective amounts is alleged.\n The demurrer is almost as voluminous as the indictment. It alleges defects and uncertainties, and even repugnances in the indictment. In the brief of counsel emphasis is given to the following: That there is no allegation to whom the proceeds of the discount were paid by the bank, nor to whom the notes were payable; that there is no statement that payment of the notes had been demanded, or that they had not been paid, or that the makers were in default, of that the loss to the bank was due to the discounts, or that the makers of the notes were then or at the time of the discounts insolvent or unable to pay their obligations.\n The circuit court sustained the demurrer to the first fifteen counts. 183 Fed. 907.\n Section 5209, the section for the violation of which the indictment was found, is part of the provisions for the regulation of national banking associations, and provides as follows: 'Every president, director , . . . or agent of any association, who . . . wilfully misapplies any of the moneys, funds, or credits of the association . . . with intent . . . to injure or defraud the association . . . or any individual person, . . . and every person who, with like intent, aids or abets any officer . . . in any violation of this section, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.'\n For its general reasons in support of its ruling on the demurrer, the court referred to its opinion in United States v. Morse, 161 Fed. 429, and to the views expressed on the first indictment against defendant. 161 Fed. 425. As to the pending indictment, it was said:\n'This indictment seems to me to charge in counts 1-15 this, and no more; viz., that, with intent to defraud the \n\n[218 U.S. 532, 540]\n\u00a0\n bank, of which he was president, and for the benefit of himself and others, unnamed, defendant caused the bank to discount single named commercial paper, and the bank lost the amount paid on the discount.'\n\n And it was further said:\n'The crime of which the defendant is guilty, if guilty at all, is 'wilful misapplication.' The one characteristic or essential of this crime, on which the Supreme Court has always insisted, is conversion; no method of being guilty without converting the money, funds, or credits of the bank has been pointed out. This word 'conversion' has supplied the legal measure which the court has not been able to find in 'wilful misapplication.'\n\n'If the facts stated in an indictment do not set forth a case of conversion, the indictment is bad, and a general allegation of wrongful intent will not cure it.\n\n'Taking the first count, for example, could the bank have maintained an action for conversion against the recipient of the discount proceeds under the facts stated? I think not, and am therefore of opinion that counts 1-15 are demurrable.'\n\n It is contended by defendant that the ruling of the circuit court was not a construction of  5209, but only a determination of the sufficiency of the indictment, and that the writ of error should be dismised. We are unable to concur in that view. The court expressly ruled that the crime of which the defendant was guilty, if guilty at all, was 'wilful misapplication,' and that the essential ingredient of that is 'conversion,' and made so by the statute. And not only conversion by the officers of the bank, but by the person receiving the proceeds of the discount. The indictment was held insufficient, because the facts alleged in it did not constitute such double conversion; that is, it did not constitute a crime under the statute, as the latter should be construed. The motion to dismiss is therefore denied. \n\n[218 U.S. 532, 541]\n\u00a0\n We are therefore brought to the merits, and the first contention of defendant (and for convenience in discussion we use his contentions rather than those of the United States, although the decision below was against the latter), is that if the circuit court did consider the statute, its construction was correct.\n A wilful misapplication of the funds of a bank is the essence of the crime, it is urged, and that the decision of this court has defined what constitutes a wilful misapplication, and that the facts alleged in the indictment do not fulfil the definition. The following cases are cited to sustain the contention: United States v. Britton, \n107 U.S. 665\n, 27 L. ed. 524, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 512; United States v. Northway, \n120 U.S. 327\n, 30 L. ed. 664, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 580; Evans v. United States, \n153 U.S. 584\n, 38 L. ed. 830, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 934, 9 Am. Crim. Rep. 668; Coffin v. United States, \n156 U.S. 432\n, 39 L. ed. 481, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 394, and certain cases in the circuit courts and circuit courts of appeals.\n Before examining these cases it will be well to revert to the averments of the indictment to see what exactly it charges. It charges that the defendant was the president of the bank, and as such, having control of and possession of its funds, wilfully, wrongfully, unlawfully, and with intent to injure and defraud it, and for his use, benefit, and advantage, misapplied certain of its funds. A wilful misapplication of the funds of the bank is charged, and that it was induced by and resulted in a benefit and advantage to defendant. This is a direct accusation of wrongdoing through his office, and the precise manner by which it was accomplished is averred to have been with the illegal intent to injure and defraud the bank by receiving and discounting with its moneys an absolutely unsecured promissory note of a named partnership, whereby the proceeds of the discount of the note were wholly lost to the bank.\n We may now turn to the cases. In United States v. Britton, \n107 U.S. 655\n, 27 L. ed. 520, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 512, it was decided that the 'misapplication made an offense by this statute means a misapplication \n\n[218 U.S. 532, 542]\n\u00a0\n for the use, benefit, or gain of the party charged,' or someone other than the association. And further, that to constitute the offense 'there must be a conversion to its own use or the use of someone else of the moneys and funds of the association by the party charged.'\n The Britton Case was referred to in United States v. Northway, \n120 U.S. 327\n, 30 L. ed. 664, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 580, as holding that it was of the essence of the criminality of the misapplication that there should be a conversion of the funds to the use of the defendant or of some person other than the association, with intent to injure or defraud the association. This case has further instruction. It makes a distinction between embezzlement and a wilful misapplication of the funds. There may be a wilful misapplication of the funds, it is said, even though the officer have not the actual possession of them. He may have such control and power of management 'as to direct an application of the funds in such manner and under such circumstances as to constitute an offense.' A count in an indictment was sustained which charged the misapplication to have been made by causing funds to be paid out to the use and benefit of the officer indicted in an unauthorized and unlawful purchase of the shares of stock of certain stock companies, without the knowledge and consent of the association, and with intent to injure it.\n Evans v. United States, \n153 U.S. 584\n, 38 L. ed. 830, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 934, 9 Am. Crim. Rep. 668, was also a case of alleged violation of  5209, where the sufficiency of an indictment was considered. Evans was indicted for aiding and abetting the cashier in a wilful misapplication of the funds of the bank. The misapplication was described to be the unlawful receiving and discounting with the money and funds of the bank, with intent to defraud the bank, and for the use, etc., of Evans, a note made by Evans, which, when so discounted, 'was not then and there well secured,' which he and the cashier well knew, and which note was never paid, by reason of which the bank suffered \n\n[218 U.S. 532, 543]\n\u00a0\n loss in that amount, withintent in Evans to injure and defraud the bank. It was said:\n'While the mere discount of an unsecured note, even if the maker and the officer making the discount knew it was not well secured, would not necessarily be a crime, if the maker believed that he would be able to provide for it at maturity, yet, if his original intent was to procure the note to be discounted in order to defraud the bank, as charged in this count, every element of criminality is present. . . . The criminality really depends upon the question whether there was, at the time of the discount, a deliberate purpose on the part of the defendant to defraud the bank of the amount. . . . No averment was necessary that such discount was procured by fraudulent means, since the offense consists not in the use of fraudulent means, but in the discount of a note which both parties know to be unsecured, with the intent thereby to defraud the bank. An averment that Evans was . . . insolvent or knew himself to be so was also unnecessary, in view of the allegation that Evans knew that the note was not secured, and procured the same to be discounted with intent to defraud the bank.'\n\n It was said that weight must be given to the words 'knowingly, wilfully, and unlawfully and fraudulently,' and 'to the general allegation of an attempt to defraud.' Pages 592 and 593.\n In Coffin v. United States, \n156 U.S. 432\n, 39 L. ed. 481, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 394, the crime of the misapplication of funds was again considered. One of the contentions of the defendant was that certain counts in the indictment were insufficient, because they failed to aver the actual conversion of the sum misapplied to the use of any particular person. The proposition that the law required an actual conversion was yielded to, and that there must be an averment of it. The indictment was considered and held sufficient, as it described the conversion to consist of paying money out of the funds of the \n\n[218 U.S. 532, 544]\n\u00a0\n bank to a designated person when that person was not entitled to take the funds, and that, owing to the insolvency of such person, the money was lost to the bank.\n These cases established that there must be, to constitute a misapplication of the funds of the bank, a conversion, but it may be by the officer alone. The words of United States v. Britton are that 'there must be a conversion to his own use or the use of someone else of the moneys and funds of the association by the party charged.' And this is repeated in United States v. Northway. The language of the Britton Case is repeated in the Evans Case, but it was said that the offense consisted not in the use of fraudulent means, but in the discount of a note which both parties knew to be unsecured, with the intent to defraud the bank. In Coffin v. United States, conversion of the funds was again recognized as necessary to constitute the offense. In that case the wilful misapplication was alleged to have been done 'with intent to convert the same to the use of the Indianapolis Cabinet Company,' whose check was paid, though it had no funds in the bank. And such averment, it was said, stated the misapplication and actual conversion of money by the methods described; that is to say, by paying it out of the funds of the bank to a designated person when that person was not entitled to take the funds, and that, owing to the insolvency of such person, the money was lost to the bank. And in the same case, in \n162 \nU.S. 664, 669\n, 40 S. L. ed. 1109, 1111, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 943, 946, it is said that 'the primary object of the statute was to protect the bank from the acts of its own servants.'\n It follows from these citations that the circuit court erred in considering as necessary, not only that there should be alleged a conversion by the officer of the bank, but also by the recipient of the proceeds of the discount. The conversion may be to the use of either, and the indictment fulfils the requirement. It charged that Heinze, being president of the bank, and having control of its \n\n[218 U.S. 532, 545]\n\u00a0\n funds, with intent to injure and defraud it, received and discounted the note of $100,000, knowing that it was not secured at all, and which was wholly lost to the bank. And it was charged this was done for his 'use, benefit, and advantage.' This charges a conversion as explicitly as it was charged in Coffin v. United States, supra, 'that is to say,' to quote the language of that case, 'by paying money out of the funds of the bank to a designated person when that person was not entitled to take the funds,' with the consequence that the money was lost to the bank. And it was fairly inferable (to answer certain of the objections made by defendant) that the proceeds of the discount were actually paid by the bank, and to whom paid, and that payment had been demanded and not made. It is more than an inference that the loss to the bank was due to the discounts. The charge that the bank officer received for discounting a note for $100,000, which was wholly unsecured, and which sum was lost to the bank, is quite a direct way of saying that the loss was caused by the discounting. And the statement would receive very little strength or the act of the officer any additional degree of culpability by an allegation that the makers of the note were insolvent, the element which the circuit court found in count 16, and which induced it to sustain that count.\n It is contended by the defendant that the act of March 2, 1907, is not applicable to the case, because the right it offers is 'wholly unilateral.' 'It opens the door of this court,' it is said, 'to the United States as one party to the cause only, and denies the same privilege to the defendant.' The ultimate contention is that defendant is thereby denied the equal protection of the laws. This inequality is asserted because the United States is given an appeal to this court, and before trial, and a defendant is only given right of review in the circuit court of appeals, and only at the end of the trial. The defendant is \n\n[218 U.S. 532, 546]\n\u00a0\n put to expense and peril, it is urged, though the indictment against him may be wholly bad, 'and is, at every stage of the case, forbidden the right of review upon any question in the Supreme Court, except the construction or application of the Constitution or the constitutionality of any Federal statute.' And this, it is insisted, is the denial of due process of the law as well as the denial of the equal protection of the laws. We shall not follow the somewhat roundabout argument to establish the identity of those two rights. If we should yield to the argument, it would necessarily follow that if defendant has not been denied due process, he has not been denied the equal protection of the law, and this court has decided that the right of appeal is not essential to due process of law. Reetz v. Michigan, \n188 \nU.S. 505, 508\n, 47 S. L. ed. 563, 566, 23 Sup.Ct.Rep. 390. The provisions have definite application, and even if the explicit clause of the 14th Amendment, forbidding a state to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of its laws, can be said to apply to the United States, it can have no broader meaning when so applied than when applied to the states. Assuming, therefore, and assuming only, not deciding (see the District of Columbia v. Brooke, \n214 \nU.S. 138, 149\n, 53 S. L. ed. 941, 945, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 560), that Congress may not discriminate in its legislation, it certainly has the power of classification, and the act of March 2 is well within such power.\n Reversed and remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","178":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. KISSEL(1910)\nNo. 390\nArgued: Decided: December 12, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 601, 602]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Fowler and Solicitor General Bowers for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 601, 605]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William D. Guthrie, Joseph H. Choate, Leavitt J. Hunt, Howard S. Gans, William C. Osborn, George White-field Betts, Jr., De Lancey Nicoll, John M. Bowers, and John D. Lindsay for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a writ of error brought by the United States to reverse a judgment of the circuit court, sustaining pleas in bar, pleaded to an indictment by the defendants in error. 173 Fed. 823. The first count of the indictment alleges that the defendants in error and others named, on December 30, 1903, and from that day until the day of presenting the indictment (July 1, 1909), have engaged in an unlawful conspiracy in restraint of trade in refined sugar among the several states of the Union; that is to say, to eliminate free competition and prevent all competition with the American Sugar Refining Company, \n\n[218 U.S. 601, 606]\n\u00a0\n one of the defendants, by a would-be competitor, the Pennsylvania Sugar Refining Company. It then sets forth, at length, the means by which the alleged purpose was to be accomplished, and what are put forward as overt acts done in pursuance of the plan. In other counts, referring to the first, the defendants are alleged to have conspired to monopolize the trade in refined sugar among the states. There are similar counts as to the trade in raw sugar and molasses, and as to trade with foreign nations. The offenses aimed at, of course, are the conspiracies punished by the act of July 2, 1890, chap. 647, 26 Stat. at L. 209, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3200, commonly known as the Sherman act.\n There are other counts in the indictment, but the argument was devoted mainly to these. The defendants severally pleaded to all of them the limitation of three years fixed by Rev. Stat.  1044, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 725, alleging that for more than three years before the finding of the indictment on July 1, 1909, they did not engage in, or do any act in aid of, such conspiracies. The defendant Kissel added averments that all the overt acts alleged to have been done within three years before July 1, 1909, were done without his participation, consent, or knowledge. He also pleaded that since October 6, 1906, the Pennsylvania Sugar Refining Company had been in the hands of a duly appointed receiver.\n We deem it unnecessary to state the pleadings with more particularity, becauses the only question before us under the act of March 2, 1907, chap. 2564, 34 Stat. at L. 1246, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 220, is whether the plea in bar can be sustained. That this court is confined to a consideration of the grounds of decision mentioned in the statute when an indictment is quashed was decided in United States v. Keitel, \n211 \nU.S. 370, 399\n, 53 S. L. ed. 230, 245, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 123. We think that there is a similar limit when the case comes up under the other clause of the act, from a 'judgment sustaining a special plea in bar, when the defendant has not been put in jeopardy.' This being so, we are not concerned with the technical sufficiency or redundancy of the \n\n[218 U.S. 601, 607]\n\u00a0\n indictment, or even, in the view that we presently shall express, with any consideration of the nature of the overt acts alleged. The indictment charges a conspiracy beginning in 1903, but continuing down to the date of filing. It pretty nearly was conceded that if a conspiracy of this kind can be continuous, then the pleas in bar are bad. Therefore we first will consider whether a conspiracy can have continuance in time.\n The defendants argue that a conspiracy is a completed crime as soon as formed, that it is simply a case of unlawful agreement, and that therefore the continuando may be disregarded, and a plea is proper to show that the statute of limitations has run. Subsequent acts in pursuance of the agreement may renew the conspiracy or be evidence of a renewal, but do not change the nature of the original offense. So also, it is said, the fact that an unlawful contract contemplates future acts, or that the results of a successful conspiracy endure to a much later date, does not affect the character of the crime.\n The argument, so far as the premises are true, does not suffice to prove that a conspiracy, although it exists as soon as the agreement is made, may not continue beyond the moment of making it. It is true that the unlawful agreement satisfies the definition of the crime, but it does not exhaust it. It also is true, of course, that the mere continuance of the result of a crime does not continue the crime. United States v. Irvine, \n98 U.S. 450\n, 25 L. ed. 193, 3 Am. Crim. Rep. 334. But when the plot contemplates bringing to pass a continuous result that will not continue without the continuous co-operation of the conspirators to keep it up, and there is such continuous co-operation, it is a perversion of natural thought and of natural language to call such continuous co-operation a cinematographic series of distinct conspiracies, rather than to call it a single one. Take the present case A conspiracy to restrain or monopolize trade by improperly excluding a competitor from business contemplates \n\n[218 U.S. 601, 608]\n\u00a0\n that the conspirators will remain in business, and will continue their combined efforts to drive the competitor out until they succeed. If they do continue such efforts in pursuance of the plan, the conspiracy continues up to the time of abandonment or success. A conspiracy in restraint of trade is different from and more than a contract in restraint of trade. A conspiracy is constituted by an agreement, it is true, but it is the result of the agreement, rather than the agreement itself, just as a partnership, although constituted by a contract, is not the contract, but is a result of it. The contract is instantaneous, the partnership may endure as one and the same partnership for years. A conspiracy is a partnership in criminal purposes. That as such it may have continuation in time is shown by the rule that an overt act of one partner may be the act of all without any new agreement specifically directed to that act.\n The means contemplated for the exclusion of the Pennsylvania Sugar Refining Company were the making of a large loan by the American Sugar Refining Company through Kissel to one Segal, and the receiving from him of more than half the stock of the Pennsylvania Company, with a power of attorney to vote upon it, Segal not knowing that the American Company was behind Kissel. The loan was to be for a year, but the American Company was to use the power of voting to prevent the Pennsylvania Company from going on with its business, and, as Segal was dependent largely upon the returns from that company for means of repaying the loan, he was to be prevented from repaying it, and the control of the Pennsylvania Company retained until it should be ruined and finally driven from business. It is alleged that the loan was made, and that a vote was passed that the Pennsylvania Company refrain from business until further order of the board of directors. Now, of course, it well may be that the object was so far accomplished by this vote that \n\n[218 U.S. 601, 609]\n\u00a0\n the conspiracy was at an end; but a vote upon pledged stock that might be redeemed was not necessarily lasting, and further action might be necessary to reach the desired result. The allegation that the conspiracy continued down to the date of the indictment is not contradicted by the vote. Furthermore, as we have said, the only question here is whether the plea of the statute of limitations is good.\n Taking it that the conspiracies made criminal by the act of July 2, 1890, may have continuance, we are of opinion that the pleas are bad. To be sure, it still might be argued that the general rule that time need not be proved as laid applies to continuing offenses, that therefore the allegation in the indictment, so far as it specifies the time in which the conspiracy was maintained, is immaterial, and that a plea traversing only that is, in substance, a plea in confession and avoidance, and good. Whether, in a charge of a continuing offense, even such specific earmarks of time as those in this indictment make it enter into the essence of the offense, we shall not discuss. Time is held to be of the essence in Massachusetts and some other states (Com v. Pray, 13 Pick, 359, 364; Com. v. Briggs, 11 Met. 573; State v. Small, 80 Me. 452, 14 Atl. 942; Fleming v. State, 28 Tex. App. 234, 12 S. W. 605); while this has been thought to be a local peculiarity, and the contrary has been decided elsewhere (State v. Reno, 41 Kan. 674, 682, 683, 21 Pac. 770; State v. Arnold, 98 Iowa, 253, 67 N. W. 252; Bishop, New Crim. Rpoc.  397, 402). However this may be, if the plea of the statute of limitations is good where it confesses and avoids all that the indictment avers, still, as was pointed out in an able brief by the late lamented Solicitor General, it is open to too many objections and difficulties to be encouraged or allowed except in clear cases. Apart from technical rules, the averments of time in the indictment are expected and intended to be proved as laid. The overt acts relied upon coming down \n\n[218 U.S. 601, 610]\n\u00a0\n to within three years of the indictment are alleged to have been done in pursuance of the conspiracy, and the pleas must be taken to deny that allegation, unless they rely upon the supposed impossibility of the acts having the character alleged. It is only by an artificial rule, if at all, that the plea can be treated as not traversing the indictment, and we are not prepared to give that supposed rule such an effect.\n The discussion at the bar took a wider range than is open at this stage. It hardly is necessary to explain that we have nothing to say as to what evidence would be sufficient to prove the continuation of the conspiracy, or where the burden of pleading or proof as to abandonment would be. We deal only with a naked and highly technical question, when once the possibility of continuation is established, and as to that we cannot bring ourselves to doubt.\n To sum up and repeat: The indictment charges a continuing couspiracy. Whether it does so with technical sufficiency is not before us. All that we decide is that a conspiracy may have continuance in time, and that where, as here, the indictment, consistently with the other facts, alleges that it did so continue to the date of filing, that allegation must be denied under the general issue, and not by a special plea. Under the general issue all defenses, including, the defense that the conspiracy was ended by success, abandonment, or otherwise, more than three years before July 1, 1909, will be open and unaffected by what we now decide.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","179":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

Separate indictments were found as to moneys received by the clerk in the years 1906, 1907, and 1908, respectively. They are precisely alike, save for the difference in the years and the amounts specified. In each case the circuit court sustained a demurrer as to three counts of the indictment, the second, third and fourth, and the judgments on the demurrers are brought here for review.\n Each of these three counts-which are set forth in the margin -states that the moneys were a 'portion of a\n Second count. And the jurors aforesaid, on their oath aforesaid, do further present, that said Frank H. Mason during all of the year 1908 was, and ever since has been, an officer of the United States, to wit, clerk of the district court of the United States for the district of Massachusetts, and on said 1st day of February, in the year 1909, had in his possession and under his control, to wit, at Boston, aforesaid, certain public moneys of the United States, a particular description whereof is to said grand jurors unknown, to wit, moneys to the amount and of the value of $387, which, during said year 1908, had come into his possession and under his control in the execution of his office as such officer, and under authority and claim of authority as such officer, and were a portion of a surplus of fees and emoluments of his said office over and above the compensation and allowances authorized by law to be retained by him for said year 1908, which said public moneys said Frank H. Mason, on said 1st day of February, in the year 1909, as such officer, was charged, by certain acts of Congress, to wit,  823, 828, and 844 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 632, 635 and 647), and the act approved June 28, 1902, 32 Stat. at L. 419, chap. 1301, and by divers other acts of Congress, safely to keep; that said Frank H. Mason, on said 1st day of February, in the year 1909, at Boston, aforesaid, the same public moneys unlawfully did fail safely to keep, as required by said acts of Congress, and, on the contrary, the same then and there unlawfully did convert to his own use; and that thereby said Frank H. Mason then and there was guilty of embezzlement of said public moneys so converted.\n Third count. And the jurors aforesaid, on their oath aforesaid, do further present, that said Frank H. Mason, during all of the year 1908, was, and ever since has been, an officer of the United States, to wit, clerk of the district court of the United States for the district of Massachusetts, and on said 1st day of February, in the year 1909, had in his possession and under his control, to wit, at Boston, aforesaid, certain public moneys of the United States, a particular description whereof is to said grand jurors unknown; to wit, moneys to the amount and of the value of $387, which, during said year 1908, had come into his possession and under his control in the execution of his office as such officer, and under authority and claim of authority as such officer, and were a portion of a surplus of fees and emoluments of his said office over and above the compensation and allowances authorized by law to be retained by him for said year 1908, which said public moneys said Frank H. Mason, on said 1st day of February, in the year 1909, as such officer, was charged, by certain acts of Congress, to wit,  823, 828, and 844 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, and the act approved June 28, 1902, 32 Stat. at L. 419, chap. 1301, and by divers other acts of Congress, safely to keep; that said Frank H. Mason, on said 1st day of February, in the year 1909, at Boston, aforesaid, the lastmentioned public moneys unlawfully did fail safely to keep, as required by said acts of Congress, and, on the contrary, the same then and there unlawfully and fraudulently did convert to his own \n\n[218 U.S. 517, 519]\n\u00a0\n surplus of fees and emoluments of his said office over and above the compensation and allowances authorized by law to be retained by him.' The charge of the second count is that the defendant 'the same public moneys \n\n[218 U.S. 517, 520]\n\u00a0\n unlawfully did fail safely to keep' as required by acts of Congress, 'and, on the contrary, the same then and there unlawfully did convert to his own use,' and thereby 'was guilty of embezzlement of said public moneys so converted.' The third count is the same as the second, except that it charges that the defendant converted the moneys 'fraudulently' as well as 'unlawfully.' The fourth count charges that he should have paid the money, that is, the alleged surplus, to the United States, 'in the manner provided by law,' and that he 'the same money unlawfully, wrongfully, and fraudulently did convert to his own personal use and embezzle.'\n To sustain the counts, the assignment of errors refers to  5490 and 5497 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3704, 3707), and to the act of March 3, 1875, chapter 144 (18 Stat. at L. p. 479, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3675).\n Section 5490 is as follows:\n'Every officer or other person charged by any act of Congress with the safe-keeping of the public moneys, who fails to safely keep the same, without loaning, using, converting to his own use, depositing in banks, or exchanging for other funds than as specially allowed by law, shall be guilty of embezzlement of the money so loaned, used, converted, deposited, or exchanged; and shall be impris- \n\n[218 U.S. 517, 521]\n\u00a0\n oned not less than six months nor more than ten years, and fined in a sum equal to the amount of money so embezzled.'\n\n Section 5497, with the addition made by the amendment of February 3, 1879, chapter 42 (20 Stat. at L. 280, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3707), provides:\n'Every banker, broker, or other person not an authorized depositary of public moneys, . . . who uses, transfers, converts, appropriates, or applies any portion of the public money for any purpose not prescribed by law, . . . is guilty of an act of embezzlement of the public money so deposited, loaned, transferred, used, converted, appropriated, or applied, and shall be punished as prescribed in section fifty-four hundred and eighty-eight.\n\n'And any officer connected with, or employed in, the internal revenue service of the United States, and any assistant of such officer, who shall embezzle or wrongfully convert to his own use any money or other property of the United States, and any officer of the United States, or any assistant of such officer, who shall embezzle or wrongfully convert to his own use any money or property which may have come into his possession or under his control in the execution of such office or employment, or under color or claim of authority as such officer or assistant, whether the same shall be the money or property of the United States or of some other person or party, shall, where the defense is not otherwise punishable by some statute of the United States, be punished by a fine equal to the value of the money and property thus embezzled or converted, or by imprisonment not less than three months nor more than ten years, or by both such fine and imprisonment.'\n\n By the act of March 3, 1875, chapter 144,  1 (18 Stat. at L. p. 479, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3675), 'any person who shall embezzle, steal, or purloin any money, property, record, voucher, or valuable \n\n[218 U.S. 517, 522]\n\u00a0\n thing whatever, of the moneys, goods, chattels, records, or property of the United States, shall be deemed guilty of felony.'\n It is also contended in argument, that the facts alleged in the indictment bring it within the scope of  5489 of the Revised Statutes, which provides that if 'any public depositary fails safely to keep all moneys deposited' he shall be deemed guilty of embezzlement; and this, under  5493, is to be construed 'to apply to all persons charged with the safe-keeping, transfer, or disbursement of the public money, whether such persons be indicted as receivers or depositaries of the same.'\n What, if any, application these provisions may have to the clerk of the district court, with respect to the fees and emoluments of his office, can be determined only after a consideration of the history of his relation to these moneys and of the stautes which specifically define his rights and duties. Prior to 1841 the clerks were not required to render any account of their fees to the government. United States v. Hill, \n120 U.S. 169\n, at page 176, 30 L. ed. 627, 630, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 510. The act of March 3, 1791, chapter 22,  1 (1 Stat. at L. 217), fixed their compensation for attending court and made an allowance for traveling. That of May 8, 1792, chapter 36,  3 (1 Stat. at L. 277), added such fees as were allowed by the supreme court of the state, and authorized the court to grant a reasonable compensation for the discharge of duties not performed by the clerks of the state court, and for which the laws of the state made no allowance. But, under these statutes, the fees and emoluments received by the clerks were their own property. And they were to be recovered 'in like manner as the fees of the officers of the states respectively for like services.' 1 Stat. at L. 278,  6, chap. 36, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 658.\n In 1841, for the first time, the clerks were limited as to the amount which they were entitled to retain out of their fees. The act of March 3, 1841, chapter 35,  1 \n\n[218 U.S. 517, 523]\n\u00a0\n (5 Stat. at L. 427), provided that the fees and emoluments retained by the clerks after the payment 'of such necessary office and other expenses as shall be allowed by the Secretary of the Treasury,' within a prescribed limit, should 'not exceed, in any case, four thousand five hundred dollars; the overplus of fees and emoluments to be paid into the public Treasury, under such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, subject to the disposition of Congress.' This was followed by the act of May 18, 1842, chapter 29 (5 Stat. at L. 483), which limited the amount which the clerk could retain out of the fees and emoluments of his office 'for his own personal compensation, over and above the necessary expenses of his office, and necessary clerk hire included, also to be audited and allowed by the proper accounting officers of the Treasury,' to the sum of $3,500 per year. The clerks were required to make verified returns semiannually, 'embracing all the fees and emoluments of their respective offices, of every name and character,' and also 'all the necessary office expenses of such officer, together with the vouchers for the payment of the same.' It was also provided that the officer, with each return, should 'pay into the Treasury of the United States, or deposit to the credit of the Treasurer thereof, as he may be directed by the Secretary of the Treasury, any surplus of the fees and emoluments of his office which his half-yearly return, so made as aforesaid, shall show to exist over and above the compensation and allowances hereinbefore authorized to be retained and paid by him.' Where the return showed that a surplus might exist, the Secretary of the Treasury was to cause the return to be carefully examined, and the accounts of disbursements to be regularly audited, 'and an account to be opened with such officer in proper books to be provided for that purpose.'\n The plain object of this statute was to limit the amount \n\n[218 U.S. 517, 524]\n\u00a0\n which the clerk was to retain, and to require an accounting, an audit of expenses, and a payment of the surplus. Otherwise the established method of administering the office was not changed. The fees were to be recovered as theretofore; and to the extent of the amount of the fixed compensation of the clerk and the necessary expenses of his office, he was entitled to use and to pay as formerly. The statute suggests no other course. What, if anything, should be paid into the public treasury at the end of the half year, when he was to make his return, depended upon the amount of the fees, the amount of the expenses, and the result of the audit. If his fixed compensation and his necessary expenses exhausted the fees, there would be nothing to pay. The amount payable was to be determined when the return was made.\n This was the state of the law as to the clerks' fees and emoluments at the time of the passage of the act of August 6, 1846, chapter 90 (9 Stat. at L. 59), which was entitled, 'An Act to Provide for the Better Organization of the Treasury and for the Collection, Safe-Keeping, Transfer, and Disbursement of the Public Revenue.' It made careful provision with respect to the duties of the Treasurer, Assistant Treasurers, and of collectors and receivers of public moneys, and the manner in which these moneys should be deposited and disbursed. By  6 of this act 'all public officers of whatever character' were required 'to keep safely, without loaning, using, depositing in banks, or exchanging for other funds than as allowed by this act, all the public money collected by them,' until it was ordered 'by the proper department or officer of the government' to be transferred or paid out. See Revised Statutes,  3639, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2422. By  16 it was provided that if any officer 'charged by this act, or any other act, with the safekeeping, transfer, and disbursement of the public moneys,' should use, loan, deposit, or exchange, except as allowed by the act, 'any portion of the public \n\n[218 U.S. 517, 525]\n\u00a0\n moneys intrusted to him,' every such act should be deemed an embezzlement. 9 Stat. at L. 63, chap. 90, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3704\n\n\n This last-mentioned section is the source of  5490 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3704), which we have quoted above as one of the statutes relied upon to sustain the counts in question, and in construing it we may refer to the purpose and scope of the act from which it was derived. McDonald v. Hovey, \n110 U.S. 619\n, 28 L. ed. 269, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 142; United States v. Le Bris, \n121 U.S. 278\n, 30 L. ed. 946, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 894; Logan v. United States, \n144 \nU.S. 263, 302\n, 36 S. L. ed. 429, 442, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 617. Section 5493 must be construed in the same way for a similar reason. And it is clear that the Treasury act of 1846, and the provisions of  16, did not apply to the fees and emoluments received by clerks of courts, and that the clerks were not charged, within the meaning of that act, with the safe-keeping of these fees and emoluments as public moneys. These were governed by other rules. They lay outside of the prohibition of  16 against loaning, using, converting to his own use, depositing in banks, and exchanging for other funds, for it was upon these fees that the clerk depended for his livelihood and for the payment of the expenses of his office, subject only to the duty twice a year to make his accounting, and to pay over the surplus if the fees exceeded the total amount allowed him.\n The statute relating to the Treasury was speedily supplemented by the act of March 3, 1849, chapter 110, entitled, 'An Act Requiring All Moneys Receivable from Customs and from All Other Sources to be Paid Immediately into the Treasury, without Abatement or Reduction, and for Other Purposes' ( 9 Stat. at L. 398). This is the source of  3617 of the Revised Statutes ( U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2413), providing that 'the gross amount of all moneys received from whatever source for the use of the United States,' with the exceptions stated (not here important), 'shall be paid by the officer or agent receiving the same into the Treasury, at as early a day as practicable, without any abatement or \n\n[218 U.S. 517, 526]\n\u00a0\n deduction on account of salary, fees, costs, charges, expenses, or claim of any description whatever.' But this, obviously, had no application to clerks of courts, who continued to receive, hold, and use their fees and emoluments subject to the prescribed limitations and the duty to account.\n In 1849 the supervisory power of the Secretary of the Treasury over the accounts of clerks was transferred to the Secretary of the Interior ( act of March 3, 1849, chapter 108,  4, 9 Stat. at. L. 395). In 1853, a statute was passed regulating the fees of clerks and other officers of the courts throughout the United States, and the duties of clerks with respect to their returns and payments were defined. This established the present fee bill (act of February 26, 1853, chapter 80, 10 Stat. at L. 161, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 632). In 1870, the supervisory power passed to the Attorney General. Act of June 22, 1870, chapter 150,  15, 16 Stat. at L. 164.\n The provisions of the act of 1853, as modified by the subsequent legislation, have been incorporated in the Revised Statutes,  823 to 857 ( U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 632-658), and these continue the policy of the act of 1842, supra.\n Section 823 provides that 'the following and no other compensation shall be taxed and allowed to . . . clerks of the circuit and district courts.' Section 828 prescribes the clerks' fees. Section 833 provides for semiannual returns to the Attorney General, as follows:\n'Every district attorney, clerk of a district court, clerk of a circuit court, and marshal, shall, on the first days of January and July, in each year, or within thirty days thereafter, make to the Attorney General, in such form as he may prescribe, a written return for the half year ending on said days, respectively, of all the fees and emoluments of his office, of every name and character, and of all the necessary expenses of his office, including necessary clerk hire, together with the vouchers for the payment of the same for such last half year. He shall \n\n[218 U.S. 517, 527]\n\u00a0\n state separately in such returns the fees and emoluments received or payable under the bankrupt act; . . . Said returns shall be verified by the oath of the officer making them.'\n\n Section 839 defines the amount which may be retained out of the clerk's fees for his compensation over and above expenses:\n'No clerk of a district court, or clerk of a circuit court, shall be allowed by the Attorney General, except as provided in the next section, and in section eight hundred and forty-two, to retain of the fees and emoluments of his office, or, in case both of the said clerkships are held by the same person, of the fees and emoluments of the said offices, respectively, for his personal compensation, over and above his necessary office expenses, including necessary clerk hire, to be audited and allowed by the proper accounting officers of the Treasury, a sum exceeding three thousand five hundred dollars a year for any such district clerk, or for any such circuit clerk, or exceeding that rate for any time less than a year.'\n\n Sections 844, 845, and 846 contain the following provisions, which are applicable to the payment by clerks of the surplus shown by their returns and for the examination and audit of their accounts:\n'Sec. 844. Every district attorney, clerk, and marshal shall, at the time of making his half-yearly return to the Attorney General, pay into the Treasury, or deposit to the credit of the Treasurer, as he may be directed by the Attorney General, any surplus of the fees and emoluments of his office which said return shows to exist over and above the compensation and allowances authorized by law to be retained by him.\n\n'Sec. 845. In every case where the return of a district attorney, clerk, or marshal shows that a surplus may exist, the Attorney General shall cause such returns to be carefully examined, and the accounts of disbursements \n\n[218 U.S. 517, 528]\n\u00a0\n to be regularly audited by the proper officer of his Department, and an account to be opened with such officer in proper books to be provided for that purpose.\n\n'Sec. 846. The accounts of district attorneys, clerks, marshals, and commissioners of circuit courts shall be examined and certified by the district judge of the district for which they are appointed, before they are presented to the accounting officers of the Treasury Department for settlement. They shall then be subject to revision upon their merits by said accounting officers, as in case of other public accounts.'\n\n Section 857 brings forward the provision of the act of 1792 (1 Stat. at L. 278, chap. 36, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 658), as to the manner in which the fees shall be recovered.\n Section 5 of the act of February 22, 1875, chapter 95 (18 Stat. at L. 334)1 provides that if any clerk of any district or circuit court of the United States shall wilfully refuse or neglect to make or to forward any report, certificate, statement, or other document required by law to be made or forwarded by him, it shall be the duty of the President to remove him from office, and he shall not be eligible to any appointment as clerk or deputy clerk for the period of two years thereafter. By  6 of the same act, the wilful refusal or neglect to make or to forward the report or other documents mentioned in the preceding section is made a misdemeanor.\n We have also to note the proviso contained in the appropriation act of June 28, 1902, chapter 1301 (32 Stat. at L. 475, 476, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 239), as follows:\n'That each clerk of the district and circuit courts shall, on the first days of January and July of each year, or within thirty days thereafter, make to the Attorney General, in such form as he may prescribe, written returns for the half year ending on said days, respectively, of all fees and emoluments of his office of every name and character, and of all necessary expenses of his office, in- \n\n[218 U.S. 517, 529]\n\u00a0\n cluding necessary clerk hire, together with the vouchers for the payment of the same for such last half year; and the word 'emoluments' shall be understood as including all amounts received in connection with the admission of attorneys to practice in the court, all amounts received for services in naturalization proceedings, whether rendered as clerk, as commissioner, or in any other capacity, and all other amounts received for services in any way connected with the clerk's office.'\n\n There has thus been established a distinct system with respect to the fees and emoluments of the clerks. Its features are to be explained by the history of the clerk's office and the requirements of its convenient administration. It is urged that the fees and emoluments are attached to the office, and are received in an official capacity. This consideration, however, does not aid the prosecution, for they were attached to the office before the statute of 1841, when they belonged to the clerk without any duty on his part to account for any portion of them. The fees and emoluments stand in a different category from other moneys which he may receive by virtue of his office, as, for example, moneys paid into court. Revised Statutes,  995, 996, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 711.\n In United States v. Hill, \n123 U.S. 681\n, 31 L. ed. 275, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 308, the action was on the official bond of the clerk of the district court of the United States for the district of Massachusetts, and it was asserted that this court had jurisdiction to review the judgment because the suit was brought for the enforcement of a 'revenue law.' The court held that  844 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 647), requiring the clerk to pay into the Treasury any surplus of fees and emoluments shown by his return, was not a revenue law within the meaning of  699, and in delivering the opinion of the court, Chief Justice Waite said:\n'Certainly it will not be claimed that the clerk of a district court of the United States is an 'officer of the \n\n[218 U.S. 517, 530]\n\u00a0\n revenue,' but there is nothing to indicate that the term 'revenue' has any different signification in this subdivision of the section from that which it has in the other. The clerk of a court of the United States collects his taxable 'compensation,' not as the revenue of the United States, but as the fees and emoluments of his office, with an obligation on his part to account to the United States for all he gets over a certain sum which is fixed by law. This obligation does not grow out of any 'revenue law,' properly so called, but out of a statute governing an officer of a court of the United States.'\n\n None of the statutes relating to embezzlement of moneys or property of the United States, which we have quoted, affords a basis for the counts in question. There may be an honest difference of opinion with regard to the amount the payment of which from the fees collected may properly be allowed. Provision has been made for the examination of the matter and for the ascertainment of the amount due. Pending such audit there would be no justification for indicting the clerk as an embezzler, upon the allegation that he had in his hands a surplus which he had converted to his own use. It is not a question of public moneys, which are to be deposited as such, and are to be disbursed in accordance with the Treasury system. A fixed compensation is to be retained, the expenses of the office are to be defrayed, and the question of the necessity of the expenses is to be passed upon; and the clerk is not in default until he refuses or fails to make his return or to pay over the surplus shown by his return to exist, or the amount found upon the audit of his accounts to be payable.\n We have not before us a case where a clerk has refused or failed to make the return required by statute, or to pay over the surplus shown by his return to exist, or established by the audit. None of the three counts makes that charge. The second and third counts charge that the moneys in \n\n[218 U.S. 517, 531]\n\u00a0\n question constituted a portion of the surplus over and above his authorized allowances, and that he converted the moneys to his own use. Whether or not this surplus was shown by his return, or was the result of the audit contemplated by the statute, is not stated. The fourth count alleges that the clerk should have paid to the United States the moneys which it is said were a part of the surplus; but it is not alleged that the duty had arisen upon the return and accounting required by the statute.\n But, for the reasons we have stated, even the duty to pay the surplus shown by the return or audit is not governed by the statutes relating to embezzlement, which have been referred to in support of these counts. The amount with which the clerk is chargeable upon his accounting is not the 'public money' or 'the money or property of the United States' within the meaning of their provisions. The fees and emoluments are not received by the clerk as moneys or property belonging to the United States, but as the amount allowed to him for his compensation and office expenses under the statutes defining his rights and duties, and with respect to the amount payable when the return is made, the clerk is not trustee, but debtor. Any other view must ignore not only the practical construction which the statutes governing the office have received, but their clear intent.\n The second, third, and fourth counts of the indictment are insufficient, and the judgment of the Circuit Court is therefore in each case affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n use; and that thereby said Frank H.

PLOWMAN(1910)\nNo. 96\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n Assistant Attorney General Harr for plaintiff in error.\n No appearance for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action to recover the value of timber cut from the public domain in Idaho. The defendant justifies under the act of June 3, 1878, chap. 150, 20 Stat. at L. 88, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1528. That act authorizes citizens of the United States and other persons, bona fide residents of certain states and territories, including Idaho, 'and all other mineral districts of the United States,' to cut 'for building, agricultural, mining, or other domestic purposes, any timber or other trees growing or being on the public lands, said lands being mineral, and not subject to entry under existing laws of the United States, except for mineral entry' in the state, territory, or district of their residence. This authority is given subject to regulation by the Secretary of the Interior for the protection of the timber \n\n[216 U.S. 372, 373]\n\u00a0\n and undergrowth, and is not given to railroads. The only question before us is how far the authority extends with reference to the specific land upon which the wood is cut.\n There was a trial by jury and the issue is exhibited sufficiently by a passage or two from the charge, and the instructions asked on behalf of the government, but refused. The passages from the charge are as follows: 'The law cannot be construed to limit the cutting of timber simply to ground that is known to contain mineral, or ground which is or which might be legally located as a mining claim. . . . The law includes as mineral lands not only those tracts in which mineral has actually been discovered, and which have been or could be legally located as mining locations, but also all other lands lying in reasonably close proximity to or in the general neighborhood of such known mineral tracts. . . . Take, for instance, a large section of country. . . . There in the lower part of the map, as you will see, is a section of country about 6 miles square; the upper part indicates another section 6 miles square. We will suppose now there are found here and there in that section of country mineral locations. They may not be contiguous; they may even be some distance apart; but you will be justified, under the law as I have given it to you, in holding all that particular section of country to be mineral ground . . . . The question for you to decide is not whether those little tracts on that map there-the ground cut over by the defendant-contain mineral, but whether that whole section of country surrounding that for miles around is what may be denominated a mineral country. If you find it is a mineral country within the meaning of the law as I have defined it to you, then your verdict must be for the defendant.' The government asked for instructions that it was not sufficient to show that the land in question was adjacent to lands valuable for mineral purposes, but that the authority given by the act extended only to lands valuable for minerals. It is needless to set them forth at length. There was a verdict and judg- \n\n[216 U.S. 372, 374]\n\u00a0\n ment for the defendant. The ruling and refusals were excepted to, but the exceptions were overruled, and the judgment affirmed by the circuit court of appeals, 81 C. C. A. 682, 151 Fed. 1022, on the authority of United States v. Basic Co. 57 C. C. A. 624, 121 Fed. 504, and United States v. Rossi, 66 C. C. A. 442, 133 Fed. 380. The case then was brought to this court.\n The instructions appear to us to have paid too little regard to the words of the act, defining the land on which it permits timber to be cut as 'mineral, and not subject to entry under existing laws of the United States, except for mineral entry.' As was said in Northern P. R. Co. v. Lewis, \n162 \nU.S. 366, 376\n, 40 S. L. ed. 1002, 1006, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 831, 'the right to cut is exceptional and quite narrow,' and the party claiming the right must prove it. The only lands excluded in 1878 or now from any but mineral entry are lands 'valuable for minerals' or containing 'valuable mineral deposits.' Rev. Stat.  2302, 2318, 2319, U. S. Comp. Stat. pp. 1410, 1423, 1424. See  2320. The matter was much discussed in Davis v. Wiebbold, \n139 U.S. 507\n, 35 L. ed. 238, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 628, and there it was said that the exceptions of mineral land from pre-emption and settlement, etc., 'are not held to exclude all lands in which minerals may be found, but only those where the mineral is in sufficient quantity to add to their richness and to justify expenditure for its extraction, and known to be so at the date of the grant.' P. 519. A Land Department rule is quoted, with seeming approval, that 'if the land is worth more for agriculture than mining, it is not mineral land, although it may contain some measure of gold or silver,' pp. 521, 522, citing United States v. Reed, 12 Sawy. 99, 104, 28 Fed. 482. Again it was said: 'The exception of mineral lands from grant in the acts of Congress should be considered to apply only to such lands as were, at the time of the grant, known to be so valuable for their minerals as to justify expenditure for their extraction.' P. 524. These are the tests to which the act of 1878 must be taken to refer, since it refers to and rests upon the statutes construed to adopt these tests.\n It is said that such a construction empties the statute of all its use, because if the land is known to be valuable for \n\n[216 U.S. 372, 375]\n\u00a0\n minerals, a mining claim to it will be located, only the owners of which can cut the timber, whereas the statute gives the right to all residents. If that were true, courts still would be bound by the explicit and unmistakable words. It is not unknown, when opinion is divided, that qualifications sometimes are inserted into an act that are hoped to make it ineffective. But the objection is stated too strongly. As pointed out at the argument, in 1878 probably there was a great deal of mineral land still unexplored on which claims had not been located, not to speak of mere exceptional cases in which the act would apply. The regulations of the Secretary of the Interior for a long time, and it would seem always, have been in accord with our opinion and the language of the act.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice McKenna dissents. \n\n\n\n","181":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 753, to recover the value of land taken by the United States. It is admitted that a strip of about 3 acres of land lying along the side of Four Mile creek, and running east and west, was taken, and is to be paid for. It was permanently flooded by a dam on the Kentucky river, into which Four Mile creek flows. United States v. Lynah, \n188 U.S. 445\n, 47 L. ed. 539, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 349. Manigault v. Springs, \n199 \nU.S. 473, 484\n, 50 S. L. ed. 274, 280, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 127. The plaintiffs owned other land south of and adjoining the strip taken, and had a private right of way at right angles to the creek, northerly, across land of other parties, to the Ford county road, which ran parallel to the creek and at some distance from it. This was the only practical outlet from the plaintiffs' farm to the county road. The taking of the intervening strip of course cut off the use of the way, and the judge who tried the case found that it lessened the value of the farm $1, 700. He allowed this sum in addition to $300 for the land taken. The United States took a writ of error on the ground that the former item was merely for collateral damage not amounting to a taking and of a kind that cannot be allowed; that at most it was only a tort. The case is likened to the depreciation in value of a neighboring but distinct tract by reason of the use to which the government intends to put that which it takes. Sharp v. United States, \n191 \nU.S. 341, 355\n, 48 S. L. ed. 211, 216, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 114.\n The petition, like the form of the finding, lends some countenance to this contention, by laying emphasis on the damage \n\n[217 U.S. 333, 339]\n\u00a0\n to the farm, although it is to be noted that, even in this aspect, the damage is to the tract of which a part is taken. \n191 U.S. 354\n. But both petition and finding in substance show clearly that the way has been permanently cut off. A private right of way is an easement and is land. We perceive no reason why it should not be held to be acquired by the United States as incident to the fee for which it admits that it must pay. But if it were only destroyed and ended, a destruction for public purposes may as well be a taking as would be an appropriation for the same end. Miller v. Horton, 152 Mass. 540, 547, 10 L.R.A. 116 23 Am. St. Rep. 850, 547, 10 L.R. A. 116, 23 Am. St. Rep. 850, a recovery for the taking of land by permanent occupation allows it for a right of way taken in the same manner; and the value of the easement cannot be ascertained without reference to the dominant estate to which it was attached. The argument is only confused by reference to cases like Gibson v. United States, \n166 U.S. 269\n, 41 L. ed. 996, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 578; Harvard College v. Stearns, 15 Gray, 1; Smith v. Boston, 7 Cush. 254, ect., where it was held, although there are decisions the other way, that a landowner cannot recover for the obstruction of a public water course, the discontinuance of a public way, or the like. The ground of such decisions is that the plaintiff's rights are subject to superior public rights, or that he has no private right, and that his damage, though greater in degree than that of the rest of the public, is the same in kind. Here there is no question of the plaintiffs' private right.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Harlan concurs in the judgment only so far as it allows the item of $300. \n\n\n\n","184":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S, TO USE OF HINE, v.

Hine et al. \nv.\n Robert Edward Hine et al.\n Know all men by these presents, that we, Thomas E. Waggaman, principal, and Daniel B. Clarke, surety, all of the District of Columbia, acknowledge ourselves indebted to the United States of America in the penal sum of $18,000, for the payment of which we bind ourselves and every of our heirs, executors, and administrators, jointly and severally, for and in the whole. Sealed with our seals, and dated this 7th day of July, A. D. 1899\n\n\n Whereas the said Thomas E. Waggaman has been duly appointed trustee to make sale of the real estate in the proceedings in this cause mentioned.\n Now the condition of the above obligation is such, that if the above bounden Thomas E. Waggaman shall well and truly discharge the duties devolving upon him as such trustee, and shall in all things obey such order and decree as this court shall make in the premises, then the above obligation to be void and of no effect; else to be in full force and virtue.\n The bond, as shown by its recitals, was executed in a pending equity cause in the supreme court of the District, wherein the parties for whose use this suit is brought were parties, either plaintiff or defendant.\n The declaration, in substance, averred a breach of the bond, in this: That Waggaman had assumed the duty and function of trustee for the sale directed by the decree, had sold and conveyed the property as directed, but had not accounted for the proceeds, having unfaithfully vio- \n\n[218 U.S. 493, 501]\n\u00a0\n lated the trust and confidence reposed in him by squandering and misappropriating such proceeds. It was further averred that on November 21, 1905, the said Waggaman had disobeyed a decree of the court, requiring him to pay into court the sum of $8,147.27, with interest from August 1, 1904, and was therefore in default.\n The defenses with which we are concerned upon this writ are those made by the surety, who, by a plea which the court below sustained, challenged the obligation of the bond. The insistence is that the supreme court of the District exceeded its authority in decreeing a sale of the land which was sold by Waggaman, and his appointment to make such a sale was a nullity, and the bond executed by him with the defendant Clarke as surety mere waste paper.\n The proceeding in the supreme court in which this bond was executed was a bill in equity to sell lot No. 1912 I street N. W., Washington, District of Columbia, as the property of a minor, for purpose of reinvestment under like trusts. The title was held under the will of Robert B. Hine, who died in 1895. So much of the will as concerns the title to the premises of which a sale was decreed was in these words:\n'I give and bequeath to my dear wife, Mattie McC. Hine, a life interest in all my real estate. As executrix she will collect the income arising from my said real estate, and after paying all necessary expenses of collection, fire insurance, and repairs, shall retain the remainder of the income for her own use. After the death of my said wife, I give and bequeath my real estate to my son, Robert Edward, and any other children that may hereafter be born to me. If my said wife should marry again, she will, from the date of such remarriage, be entitled to retain for her own use, one half of the net income of my estate, and will pay the remainder to a trustee for my son, and any other children who may hereafter be born to me. Provided, further, that should my wife marry \n\n[218 U.S. 493, 502]\n\u00a0\n again, and should no child of mine by her be then surviving, the whole net income from my estate shall be retained by her, during her life, and after her death, my real estate shall be sold, and of the proceeds, one third shall be paid to my father, the Rev. Henry Hine, now of Boston Spa, Yorkshire, England, if he then be living, be not being then living, to my mother, Amelia Burnett Hine, neither of them being then living, to my sister Amelia Burnett Hine, and the residue shall be equally divided between my brothers and sisters, share and share alike. If neither parent, nor my sister Amelia Burnett Hine, outlives my said wife, then the whole net proceeds of the sale of my real estate, shall be equally divided between my brothers and sisters. Should any of these have died before this distribution takes place, their surviving children shall receive the share of the deceased parent, share and share alike.'\n\n The complainant in the suit was Mattie McC. Hine, the widow of the testator, who averred that she had never remarried. The defendants were the only issue of her marriage with testator, her son, Robert E. Hine, then an infant of nine years of age, and the persons who, under the will, were given contingent interests. The minor, Robert E. Hine, was duly served and answered by guardian ad litem. The other defendants were made parties by publication, as persons not to be found in the District. The bill alleged that the dwelling house was deteriorating in value, that it was often unrented, that repairs, insurance, and taxes left an inconsiderable net income, which would go on diminishing. That she believed she could obtain $8,500 for the premises, a sum much larger than the value of the property to the remaindermen when her estate should fall in, and that the proceeds could be so invested as to much improve her income and better 'enable her to provide for the remainderman during his minority.' The bill alleged that the will did not \n\n[218 U.S. 493, 503]\n\u00a0\n prohibit a sale. The prayer was for a decree of sale and for a reinvestment, in pursuance of  973, D. C. Rev. Stat.\n Upon the pleadings and proof the court directed a sale of the said lot, and in the same decree appointed Thomas E. Waggaman 'trustee to make the sale,' requiring him to execute a bond of surety 'conditioned for the faithful performance of the trust reposed in him by this decree, or which may be reposed in him by any future order or decree in the premises.' By the same decree he was required 'to bring into court the money arising on such sale . . . to be disposed of under the direction of the court,' etc.\n The contention is that the supreme court of the District has no inherent or general power as a court of equity to decree the sale of an infant's property for the purpose of reinvestment, and that its jurisdiction was wholly dependent upon statutory power conferred by  969 et seq., D. C. Rev. Stat. taken from the act of Congress of August 18, 1856 [11 Stat. at L. 118, chap. 163]. Section 969 reads as follows:\n'Where real estate is limited by deed or will to one or more for life or lives, with a contingent limitation over to such issue of one or more of the tenants for life as shall be living at the death of their parent or parents, and the deed or will does not prohibit a sale, the supreme court of the District may, upon the application of the tenants for life, and if the court shall be of the opinion that it is expedient to do so, order a sale of such estate, and decree to the purchaser an absolute and complete title in fee simple.'\n\n The contention is that the only jurisdiction conferred by the statute is confined to real estate which is by deed or will 'limited to one or more lives, with a contingent limitation over to such issue of one or more of the tenants for life as shall be living at the death of either parent,' and that, under the will of Robert B. Hine, the devise to Robert Edward Hine is a vested, and not a contingent, \n\n[218 U.S. 493, 504]\n\u00a0\n remainder, while the contingent remainders-contingent on the death of said Robert and the subsequent remarriage of his mother, the said Mattie-are not limitations over to issue of either Robert B. Hine or Mattie Hine. For this construction of the statute of the court below relied upon American Security & T. Co. v. Muse, 4 App. D. C. 12, 20; Thaw v. Ritchie, 5 Mackey, 200, and Clark v. Mathewson, 7 App. D. C. 384.\n Clearly, under the will there was a life tenant and a remainder over at the death of the life tenant to Robert E. Hine, who was the issue of the testator and of the life tenant. The remainder was not absolute, for if the remainderman should die, and his mother, the life tenant, remarry, this lot was to be sold and the proceeds paid over to certain collaterals named. Technically the interest was a vested remainder, subject to open and let in the testator's brothers and sisters, and to be devested upon the death of Robert E. Hine and remarriage of the life tenant. The contention now is that if the court erred in the construction of the will, or in the interpretation and application of the statute, and decreed a sale for reinvestment, not strictly authorized by the statute, that its action and decree is to be regarded as a nullity, that the sale is void, and that the appointment of Waggaman as trustee and the execution of his bond are absolute nullities.\n But if we assume that, upon a critical construction of the will and of the statute, the bill seeking a sale of this property for reinvestment did not state a case clearly within the statutory authority of the court, it does not necessarily follow that the decree of sale and all else that occurred are to be treated as mere nullities, subject to collateral attacks such as this is.\n The supreme court of the District is one of general jurisdiction. It possesses all of the powers which by statute are conferred upon the circuit and district courts of the United States. D. C. Rev. Stat.  760 and 765. \n\n[218 U.S. 493, 505]\n\u00a0\n It may be said, indeed, to have the usual powers incident to a court of equity at the date of the Revolution, not incompatible with the changed form and principles of government, or affected by subsequent legislation. Clark v. Mathewson, 7 App. D. C. 382.\n The inherent power of a court of equity over the persons and estates of infants is very wide. For the purpose of maintenance, the power over real estate is undoubtedly more comprehensive than it is over the sale of real estate for purposes of reinvestment, though manifestly for the interest of the minor. The weight of authority seems to be that it does not extend to sales merely because it shall appear to be for the interest of the infant (Bispham, Eq.  549; Story, Eq.  1357; 3 Pom. Eq. Jur.  1304, 1309), though there is not lacking very respectable authority for the power to sell real estate when shown to be for the manifest interest of the minor. 2 Kent, Com. 11th ed. *230; Hedges v. Riker, 5 Johns Ch. 167; Thompson v. Mebane, 4 Heisk. 370; and Talbot v. Provine, 7 Baxt. 502. The supreme court of the District had jurisdiction over the subject-matter, the res. It had jurisdiction over the parties. It was, according to due course of equity proceeding, called upon to examine the will and the statute which gave the power to make the sale in certain circumstances. If, then, jurisdiction consists in the power to hear and determine, as has so many times been said, and the court errs in holding that a case has been made either under its inherent power or its statutory authority, can it be said that it has usurped jurisdiction and that its decrees are absolute nullities? To this we cannot consent. If the court was one of general, and not special, jurisdiction, if, under its inherent power, supplemented by statutory enlargement, it had jurisdiction under any circumstances to sell the real estate of minors for reinvestment, it had jurisdiction to examine and determine whether the particular application was within or beyond its authority. To do this \n\n[218 U.S. 493, 506]\n\u00a0\n was jurisdiction. If it errs, its judgment is reversible by proper appellate procedure. But its judgment, until it be corrected, is a judgment, and cannot be regarded as a nullity.\n In the leading case of Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 193, 203, 206, 7 L. ed. 650, 653, 654, the opinion was by Chief Justice Marshall. The question arose upon a writ of habeas corpus. The petitioner had been indicted and convicted. He sought to be discharged from prison because the indictment upon its face charged no offense cognizable by courts of the United States. The court said, among other things:\n'An imprisonment under a judgment cannot be unlawful unless that judgment be an absolute nullity; and it is not a nullity if the court has general jurisdiction of the subject, although it should be erroneous. The circuit court for the District of Columbia is a court of record, having general jurisdiction over criminal cases. An offense cognizable in any court is cognizable in that court. If the offense be punishable by law, that court is competent to inflict the punishment. The judgment of such a tribunal has all the obligation which the judgment of any tribunal can have. To determine whether the offense charged in the indictment be legally punishable or not is among the most unquestionable of its powers and duties. The decision of this question is the exercise of jurisdiction, whether the judgment be for or against the prisoner. The judgment is equally binding in the one case as in the other; and must remain in full force unless reversed regularly by a superior court capable of reversing it.'\n\n After referring to and commenting upon Kempe v. Kennedy, 5 Cranch, 173, 3 L. ed. 70, and Skillern v. May, 6 Cranch, 267, 3 L. ed. 220, the court added:\n'Had any offense against the laws of the United States been in fact committed, the circuit court for the District of Columbia could take cognizance of it. The question \n\n[218 U.S. 493, 507]\n\u00a0\n whether any offense was or was not committed, that is, whether the indictment did or did not show that an offense had been committed, was a question which that court was competent to decide. If its judgment was erroneous, a point which this court does not determine, still it is a judgment, and, until reversed, cannot be disregarded.'\n\n This case was followed in Ex parte Parks, \n93 \nU.S. 18, 23\n, 23 S. L. ed. 787, 788, and in Re Coy, \n127 \nU.S. 731, 757\n, 32 S. L. ed. 274, 280, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1263, 1272, where this court, speaking by Mr. Justice Miller, said of the language just cited from Ex parte Watkins, that--\n'It may be said that this language is too broad in asserting that, because every court must pass upon its own jurisdiction, such decision is itself the exercise of a jurisdiction which belongs to it, and cannot, therefore, be questioned in any other court. But we do not so understand the meaning of the court. It certainly was not intended to say that because a Federal court tries a prisoner for an ordinary common-law offense, as burglary, assault and battery, or larceny, with no averment or proof of any offense against the United States, or any connection with a statute of the United States, and punishes him by imprisonment, he cannot be released by habeas corpus because the court which tried him had assumed jurisdiction.\n\n'In all such cases, when the question of jurisdiction is raised, the point to be decided is whether the court has jurisdiction of that class of offenses. If the statute has invested the court which tried the prisoner with jurisdiction to punish a well-defined class of offenses, is forgery of its bonds or perjury in its courts, its judgment as to what acts were necessary under these statutes to constitute the crime is not reviewable on a writ of habeas corpus.'\n\n The principle has been applied in many cases, notably in cases in which want of jurisdiction as a court of the \n\n[218 U.S. 493, 508]\n\u00a0\n United States was apparent on the record. Des Moines Nav. & R. Co. v. Iowa Homestead Co. \n123 \nU.S. 552, 557\n, 559 S., 31 L. ed. 202, 204, 205, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 217; Dowell v. Applegate, \n152 \nU.S. 327, 337\n, 38 S. L. ed. 463, 467, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 611.\n In McNitt v. Turner, 16 Wall. 352, 365, 21 L. ed. 341, 347, the court, after passing upon various jurisdictional objections to a judicial sale of a title in controversy, said:\n'But there is a comprehensive and more conclusive answer to all the objections to the sale which have been considered, and to others suggested which have not been adverted to.\n\n'Upon the filing of the notice with the proof of publication, and the subsequent filing of the petition of the administrator for authority to sell, the circuit court had jurisdiction of the case. No presumption on that subject is necessary. Jurisdiction is authority to hear and determine. It is an axiomatic proposition that when jurisdiction has attached, whatever errors may subsequently occur in its exercise, the proceeding, being coram judice, can be impeached collaterally only for fraud. In all other respects it is as conclusive as if it were irreversible in a proceeding for error. The order of sale before us is within this rule. Grignon v. Astor, 2 How. 341, 11 L. ed. 292, was, like this, a case of a sale by an administrator. In that case, this court said: 'The purchaser under it is not bound to look beyond the decree. If there is error in it of the most palpable kind, if the court which rendered it have, in the exercise of jurisdiction, disregarded, misconstrued, or disobeyed the plain provisions of the law which gave them the power to hear and determine the case before them, the title of the purchaser is as much protected as if the adjudication would stand the test of a writ of error; and so where an appeal is given, but not taken, in the time allowed by law.' This case and the case of Voorhees v. Jackson, 10 Pet. 449, 9 L. ed. 490, are the leading authorities in this court upon the subject. Other and later cases have fol- \n\n[218 U.S. 493, 509]\n\u00a0\n lowed and been controlled by them. Stow v. Kimball, 28 Ill. 93, affirms the same doctrine.'\n\n The line between a judgment which is a plain usurpation of jurisdiction and one which is merely erroneous, and reviewable only by seasonable appeal, is a plain one. The case in hand falls, in our judgment, within those which are merely reversible upon appellate proceedings, and the judgment decreeing the sale and appointing Waggaman as trustee to make the sale was not a nullity.\n In Voorhees v. Jackson, 10 Pet. 449, 474, 9 L. ed. 490, 500, this court said:\n'The line which separates error in judgment from the usurpation of power is very definite; and is precisely that which denotes the cases where a judgment or decree is reversible only by an appellate court, or may be declared a nullity collaterally when it is offered in evidence in an action concerning the matter adjudicated, or purporting to have been so. In the one case, it is a record importing absolute verity; in the other, mere waste paper. There can be no middle character assigned to judicial proceedings which are irreversible for error. Such is their effect between the parties to the suit; and such are the immunities which the law affords to a plaintiff who has obtained an erroneous judgment or execution. It would be a well-merited reproach to our jurisprudence if an innocent purchaser, no party to the suit, who had paid his money on the faith of an order of a court, should not have the same protection under an erroneous proceeding as the party who derived the benefit accruing from it.'\n\n In Fauntleroy v. Lum, \n210 \nU.S. 230, 237\n, 52 S. L. ed. 1039, 1042, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 641, it is laid down that a judgment cannot be collaterally impeached by showing that it was based upon a mistake of law.\n But aside from the view we have expressed as to the validity of the proceedings when collaterally attacked, we are of opinion that the question of the validity of the decree of sale, the order appointing Waggaman trustee to make the sale, and the validity of the bond in suit, is \n\n[218 U.S. 493, 510]\n\u00a0\n not open to question by one who voluntarily became the surety upon the bond, thereby enabling his principal to obtain the proceeds of sale. Having obtained the trust and confidence of the court by aid of the security afforded by the solemn obligation to faithfully execute the order of the court, and to pay into the court the proceeds of the sale which he undertook to make, neither the trustee so appointed, nor the surety for his performance of the trust, is in a situation to deny the regularity of the transaction. The proceeds which Waggaman received are either the funds of the beneficial owners of the property, or, if the sale be in fact void so far as to confer no title, the purchaser, in equity and justice, must be protected before the money is distributed. The benefit which Waggaman expected to secure, he has been enabled to enjoy through the voluntary execution of this bond by Clarke as his surety. That bond recites his due appointment, and it would be inequitable and unjust to permit either the principal or his surety to deny the fact.\n This rule of estoppel has been applied in many cases. It was applied in respect to the bond of an Indian agent. The surety upon the bond denied liability because the government did not produce the commission showing the appointment of his principal. The court said: 'The bond upon which the suit was brought recites that he was appointed agent, and, the obligors in the 442, 15 L. ed. 129, 131. it.' Bruce v. United States, 17 How. 437, 42, 15 L. ed. 129, 131.\n The principle was applied to a distiller's bond, where one of the defenses was that the bond was invalid. The court said:\n'But we prefer to place our judgment upon the broader ground marked out by the adjudications of this court, to which we have referred. Everyone is presumed to know the law. Ignorance, standing alone, can never be the basis of a legal right. If a bond is liable to the objec- \n\n[218 U.S. 493, 511]\n\u00a0\n tion taken in this case and the parties are dissatisfied, the objection should be made when the bond is presented for execution. If executed under constraint, the constraint will destroy it. But where it is voluntarily entered into and the principal enjoys the benefits which it is intended to secure and a breach occurs, it is then too late to raise the question of its validity. The parties are estopped from availing themselves of such a defense. In such cases there is neither injustice nor hardship in holding that the contract as made is the measure of the rights of the government and of the liability of the obligors.' United States v. Hodson, 10 Wall. 395, 409, 19 L. ed. 937, 940.\n\n It was applied in respect of a stay bond executed under a void act of legislation. 'Not to apply the principle of estoppel to the bond in this case would,' said the court, 'it seems to us, involve a mockery in judicial administration, and a violation of the plainest principles of reason and justice.' Daniels v. Tearney, \n102 \nU.S. 415, 422\n, 26 S. L. ed. 187, 189.\n The opinions of the highest courts of the states are full of applications of the rule of estoppel. In Plowman v. Henderson, 59 Ala. 559, the sureties upon the bond of an administrator were not permitted to show the illegality of his appointment. To the same effect is White v. Weatherbee, 126 Mass. 450.\n The sureties upon the bond of a sheriff were held estopped to deny the validity of his appointment or the regularity of his bond. Jones v. Gallatin County, 78 Ky. 491.\n In People v. Norton, 9 N. Y. 176, the sureties upon the bond of a trustee appointed by a chancery court were held estopped to deny the validity of the order appointing him.\n In State v. Anderson, 16 Lea. 321, 335, and United States v. Maurice, 2 Brokc, 96, Fed. Cas. No. 15,747, the rule is recognized and applied.\n The questions which we have considered arose upon \n\n[218 U.S. 493, 512]\n\u00a0\n a plea which set out the proceedings in the case in which the bond had been taken, and averred their nullity for want of jurisdiction. Another and distinct defense relied upon in the plea was that, after the proceeds of sale had come to the possession of said Waggaman, Mattie McC. Hine, one of the beneficiaries for whose use this suit is prosecuted by the United States, had agreed with the said Waggaman that he should retain in his possession and for his own purposes the fund aforesaid, and should pay to her interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum, quarterly. That this agreement was acted upon and the interest so paid from the date of the receipt of the proceeds, in 1899, to May 1, 1904, and that the agreement was without the knowledge or consent of the surety. There was a demurrer and joinder thereon to so much of the said plea as set out and relied upon the nullity of the proceedings under which the bond had been executed, and a replication and issue upon the plea relying upon any alleged agreement between Waggaman, the principal, and Mrs. Hine, as one of the beneficiaries in the bond. The demurrer was overruled, and complainants, electing to stand upon it, declined to further plead; whereupon the action was dismissed. From this judgment there was an appeal to the court of appeals of the District, where the judgment was affirmed.\n So much of the plea as sought to defend the action in whole or in part in consequence of the alleged agreement between the principal in the bond and Mrs. Hine, without the consent of the surety, remains at issue undisposed of, and is accordingly not considered by us.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals, so far as it determined the validity of the plea aforesaid, was erroneous, and the case is reversed and remanded with direction to sustain the demurrer, and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","185":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNION PAC. R. CO. v. HARRIS(1910)\nNo. 19\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1910\n\n\n\n The admitted facts are that on April 22, 1861, Bernhard Blou settled upon and improved the northeast quarter of section 12, township 14 south, of range 3, in Saline county, Kansas, and on May 13, 1861, filed the declaratory statement required by the pre-emption laws. Blou, by occupation, cultivation, and improvements, preserved all his rights under the pre-emption until September 5, 1865, when, having made no payment or final proof, he changed his pre-emption entry to one under the homestead act of May 20, 1862. He continued in occupation, on December 8, 1870, made final proof under his homestead entry, and, on March 15, 1872, received a patent.\n By the act of July 1, 1862, the general Union Pacific Railroad act ( 12 Stat. at L. 489, 494, chap. 120), the Leavenworth, Pawnee, & Western Railroad Company, whose name was changed to the Union Pacific Railroad Company, Eastern Division, \n\n[215 U.S. 386, 387]\n\u00a0\n and thereafter to the Kansas Pacific Railway Company, was granted a right of way 200 feet in width on each side of its road, through the public lands of the United States. The plaintiff in error, hereinafter called the defendant, has succeeded to the right, title, and interest of the Leavenworth Company. The route of the company, as prescribed by the act, ran from Missouri up the Kaw river until it reached the Republican river, and then north along the left bank of that river to intersect with the one hundredth meridian in the territory of Nebraska. On July 17, 1862, the company filed its map of general route, and caused the lands within the limits of 15 miles thereof on either side of the proposed route to be withdrawn from sale. Under the amendatory act of July 2, 1864 (13 Stat. at L. 356, chap. 216), the company filed another map, designating the same general route. Neither of these routes came within 45 miles of the tract in controversy. Among the changes in the last named act is one providing in  3 for the condemnation of a right of way 200 feet wide through land occupied by the owner or claimant. The act of July 3, 1866 (14 Stat. at L. 79, chap. 159), changed the route to extend westwardly towards Denver. Under this act the company located and constructed its road westwardly along the Smoky Hill river instead of northwestwardly along the Republican river, and, as located and constructed, the road passed through the quarter section which Blou was then seeking to acquire under the homestead law.\n On January 20, 1873, Bernhard Blou executed and delivered to the Kansas Pacific Railway Company, the successor of the Leavenworth, Pawnee, & Western Railroad Company, a deed for a right of way through said quarter section, which deed the railway company accepted, and paid him the consideration named in it. The land in controversy is a strip 150 feet wide, lying immediately south of a line 50 feet south of the center of the track of the defendant through the quarter section. On November 10, 1882, Blou sold and conveyed to John Erickson, by warranty deed, all that part of the \n\n[215 U.S. 386, 388]\n\u00a0\n quarter section lying south of the railroad track, containing 101 acres. The defendants in error, hereinafter called the plaintiffs, derive title from Erickson. The plaintiffs and those under whom they claim had exclusive possession of the land in question from May, 1861, to August, 1902; broke and cultivated it, and paid all taxes assessed upon it since the issue of the patent. In August, 1902, the defendant fenced and took possession of the tract in controversy, whereupon this action to recover possession was commenced by the plaintiffs. The court found in their favor, and rendered judgment accordingly. This judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the state (76 Kan. 255, 91 Pac. 68), and thereupon the case was brought here on error.\n Messrs. Maxwell Evarts and R. W. Blair for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. T. F. Garver and Z. C. Millikin for defendants in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer:\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The grant of the right of way was 'through the public lands.' What is meant by 'public lands' is well settled. As stated in Newhall v. Sanger, \n92 \nU.S. 761, 763\n, 23 S. L. ed. 769, 770: 'The words 'public lands' are habitually used in our legislation to describe such as are subject to sale or other disposal under general laws.' See also Barker v. Harvey, \n181 U.S. 481\n-490, 45 L. ed. 963-968, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 690; Minnesota v. Hitchcock, \n185 U.S. 373\n-391, 46 L. ed. 954-964, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 650. If it is claimed in any given case that they are used in a different meaning, it should be apparent either from the context or from the circumstances attending the legislation. While the power of Congress over lands which an individual is seeking to acquire under either the pre-emption or the homestead law remains until the payment of the full purchase price required by the former law or the full occupation prescribed by the \n\n[215 U.S. 386, 389]\n\u00a0\n latter, yet, under the general land laws of the United States, one who, having made an entry, is in actual occupation under the preemption or homestead law, cannot be dispossessed of his priority at the instance of any individual. Hastings & D. R. Co. v. Whitney, \n132 \nU.S. 357, 363\n, 364 S., 33 L. ed. 363, 366, 367, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 112. In other words, one who has taken land under the pre-emption or homestead law acquires an equity of which he cannot be deprived by any individual under the like laws. Now, at the time of the passage of the act of July 3, 1866, Blou was and had been, for several months, in actual occupation under the homestead law. Did Congress intend by its legislation to deprive him of that equity which he had under the general land laws as against anyone proceeding under those laws?\n Any possible rights of the railroad company in this land commence with the act of July 3, 1866, for while the acts of 1864 and 1866 were in amendment of the act of 1862, yet the route prescribed by the acts of 1862 and 1864 was far to the east of this land, and only by the act of 1866 was the company authorized to construct a road through or near it. True, as held in St. Joseph & D. C. R. Co. v. Baldwin, \n103 U.S. 426\n, 26 L. ed. 578; Bybee v. Oregon & C. R. Co. \n139 \nU.S. 663, 679\n, 35 S. L. ed. 305, 308, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 641; Northern P. R. Co. v. Hasse, \n197 U.S. 9\n, 49 L. ed. 642, 643, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 305, the grant of the right of way is absolute, and taking effect as of the date of the grant. But that date must be found in an act prescribing the finally adopted route.\n A case much relied upon by the railroad company, as showing the intent of Congress in its grant of the right of way to the Union Pacific Railroad Company and its tributaries, is Union P. R. Co. v. Douglass County, 31 Fed. 540. In it it was held:\n'It was the evident intention of Congress by the act of July 1, 1862 ( 12 Stat. at L. 491, chap. 120), giving a right of way to the Union Pacific Railroad Company, to grant such right of way through those lands which, by surveys, should be found to be sections 16 and 36, the school sections which it intended to give to the future state of Nebraska, pursuant to the provisions of the \n\n[215 U.S. 386, 390]\n\u00a0\n organic act of 1854 (10 Stat. at L. 283, chap. 59), creating the territory of Nebraska.'\n\n In other words, it was held that although Congress had, in 1854, created the territory of Nebraska, with the provision that when the lands within it were surveyed, sections 16 and 36 in each township should be reserved for school purposes, it meant by the act of 1862 to grant a right of way to the railroad company through lands which should thereafter be found to be those sections. But that decision does not reach to the precise question here presented, and many of the reasons which led to it are inapplicable here. It was well known that a large part of western Nebraska was, at the time of the passage of the act of 1862, not only unoccupied, but unsurveyed. The speedy construction of the railroad to the Pacific was desired, and nothing was said about a condemnation of the right of way. By the amendatory act of 1864, however, provision was made for such condemnation through land occupied by an owner or claimant. In Washington & I. R. Co. v. Osborn, \n160 U.S. 103\n, 40 L. ed. 356, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 219, it appeared that Osborn was a settler upon unsurveyed public land, and had placed improvements thereon, and intended when the surveys were made to pre-empt the same under the pre-emption laws of the government. The railroad company was vested by the act of March 3, 1875 ( 18 Stat. at L. 482, chap 152, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1568), with a right of way through the public lands of the United States, subject to the exception of 'lands within the limits of any military park or Indian reservation, or other lands specially reserved from sale.' Osborn did not come within the terms of this exception. The act of March 3, 1875, authorized the legislature of any territory to provide the manner in which private lands and possessory claims of lands of the United States might be condemned, and further, that when no provision should have been made, such condemnation might be made in accordance with  3 of the act of July 2, 1864, supra. And upon this the court, sustaining Osborn's claim of payment for the right of way, said (p. 109): \n\n[215 U.S. 386, 391]\n\u00a0\n 'It must, therefore, be conceded that Osborn did not, by maintaining possession for several years and putting valuable improvements thereon, preclude the government from dealing with the lands as its own, and from conferring them on another party by a subsequent grant.\n'On the other hand, it would not be easy to suppose that Congress would, in authorizing railroad companies to traverse the public lands, intend thereby to give them a right to run the lines of their roads at pleasure, regardless of the rights of settlers.'\n\n It is true as suggested in Western P. R. Co. v. Tevis, 41 Cal. 489, 493, that the condemnation proceedings named by the act of July 2, 1864, were in territorial courts, whereas Kansas at that time was a state. But undoubtedly the thought of Congress was the protection of an owner or claimant by condemnation proceedings, and not in what courts those proceedings should be had.\n Further, 'this right of way through school sections had been accepted without challenge for twenty years.' This indicated the general understanding, and was significant. The contrary appears here. The railway company not only did not disturb the possession of the settler for nearly forty years, but, on the other hand, purchased and paid him for a right of way through the tract.\n We are of opinion that the case in \n160 U.S. 103\n;1 is, as respects the case at bar, inconsistent with that in the 31st Fed. and must be held to have, to that extent, overruled it. We do not think that it would be profitable to cite the many other cases which touch the question before us more or less closely, or to seek to point out the differences between them and this, or to notice all the general expressions which are to be found in them.\n We are of opinion that the Supreme Court of Kansas did not err, and its judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 16 Sup.

BETTMAN(1910)\nNo. 126\nArgued: Decided: April 4, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 127, 128]\n\u00a0\n The only question to be determined in this ease relates to the ownership of fifty shares of preferred stock in the Philip Carey Manufacturing Company, a corporation of Ohio.\n On or about May 13th, 1905, Richard Fritz, the owner of such shares, placed the certificate for them in the hands of a member of the partnership of Holzman & Company, brokers, with or through whom Fritz had some dealings. The deposit of the stock with that firm was upon an express agreement that it was to be held by them only to show Fritz's financial responsibility, and was not to pass out of their possession. There was no change in the terms or conditions of that contract. The certificate was in the name of Fritz Brothers, and was thus indorsed:\n For value received, I, the undersigned, hereby sell and transfer to Richard Fritz fifty shares of stock within mentioned and described, and hereby appoint _____ true and lawful attorney irrevocable, with power and [of] substitution to transfer said stock on the books of the company. Witness _____ hand and seal this 5th day of January, 1905\n\n\n Fritz Brothers.\n Per Otto H. Fritz.\n Witness, Max Wintler.\n On May 15th, 1905, without the knowledge or consent of Fritz, this certificate was pledged by Holzman & Company with the Unity Banking & Saving Company, as a substituted security for a note, dated March 21st, 1905, for $10,000, which that firm had executed to the bank, other security of substantially the same value being withdrawn at the time of the substitution. That transaction had no connection with any dealings by Holzman & Company for or on behalf of Fritz.\n When the pledge to the bank was made, there was pinned to the certificate a blank power of attorney, purporting to have been signed May 13th, 1905, by Richard Fritz in the presence of Ross Holzman, the active member of the firm of \n\n[217 U.S. 127, 129]\n\u00a0\n Holzman & Company. None of the blanks in the power of attorney were then filled out, and the only writing on the paper included the date, the name of Richard Fritz in the blank for the signature, and Ross Holzman in the blank for the attestation.\n Upon the petition of certain creditors of Holzman & Company, that partnership and the individuals composing it were, on July 1st, 1905, adjudicated bankrupts by the district court of the United States for the southern district of Ohio, the petition charging that the act of bankruptcy was committed May 25th, 1905. Boyden was the first trustee in the bankruptcy case. He subsequently resigned and was succeeded by Bettman. The case was sent to a referee in bankruptcy to take such further proceedings as might be necessary.\n Richard Fritz filed in the bankruptcy proceeding a claim, supported by affidavit, that he owned the certificate of stock placed with Holzman & Company, and which, as above stated, was afterwards pledged by that firm, without the authority or knowledge of Fritz, with the Unity Banking & Saving Company. He neither signed, nor authorized to be singed for him, the blank power of attorney of May 13th, 1905, and his name to that paper was a forgery. It does not appear who committed the forgery. But at the time of the hearing of the case, Ross Holzman was beyond the jurisdiction of the court and in parts unknown. The referee so stated.\n The relief sought by Fritz was, among other things, an order requiring the delivery to him of the above stock in the Philip Carey Manufacturing Company, free from the claims of all the parties.\n At the time of the hearing below, the certificate for the stock has come under the control of court. The Banking & Saving Company asserted its right to the possession of the stock and to retain the certificate therefor, with authority to apply the proceeds of the sale of the stock on the loan for which it had been pledged to the bank. The trustee asked \n\n[217 U.S. 127, 130]\n\u00a0\n the determination of the controversy between Richard Fritz and the manufacturing company, and for the protection of the interests represented by him as trustee. He contended that if Fritz did not sign the power in question, he authorized it to be signed for him.\n The cause was sent to a referee in bankruptcy, who found that Richard Fritz had never singed the above power of attorney, nor authorized anyone to sign it for him; that he was the owner of the fifty shares of stock represented by the certificate; and that he was entitled to the possession of them, free of all liens and interests, either by the Unity Banking & Saving Company or of the trustee in bankruptcy. The referee thus stated his conclusion of law from the facts found by him: 'Where F deposits with a broker a certificate of stock belonging to F, and in his name, without any indorsement or power to execute or transfer of said stock, upon an agreement that said stock is to be held by said broker as an evidence of F's financial responsibility only, and is not to leave the broker's possession, and the broker pledges said certificate to a bank as security upon a note of the broker for money loaned by the bank to the broker for general use of the broker, the bank holds said certificate subject to all the conditions of the original deposit by F with the broker, and F is not estopped to claim title to said certificate as against the bank by the mere placing of said certificate in the hands of the broker, or the further fact that, in the course of dealings between F and the broker, large balances have, at various times, been owed by F to the broker, when it appears that no demand for the payment of said balances was made upon F, or notice served upon him, changing the conditions of the deposit of said stock, and further, that, at the conclusion of the dealings between F and the broker, F is a creditor, and not a debtor, of said broker.'\n This order, upon being brought before the court in bankruptcy for review, was affirmed. The case was then carried by appeal to the circuit court of appeals, which affirmed the \n\n[217 U.S. 127, 131]\n\u00a0\n decree of the district court. Only the Unity Banking & Saving Company appealed to this court.\n Messrs. Constant Southworth and Louis J. Dolle for appellant.\n\n\n[217 U.S. 127, 134]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Theodore Horstman for appellee Fritz.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Harlan:\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the court:\n Briefly outlined, the case, as disclosed by the above statement, is this: The certificate of stock in the Carey Manufacturing Company was placed in the possession of Holzman & Company under an express agreement that it should not go out of their possession, but be held simply for the purpose of showing Fritz's financial responsibility; that Holzman & Company had no authority to pledge the stock with the Unity Banking & Saving Company as security for the payment of their individual note for $ 10,000 to that institution; that the pledging of the stock with the bank by Holzman & Company was without Fritz's knowledge; that his signature to the blank power of attorney was unauthorized by him and was a forgery; that Fritz did not, by anything said, done, or omitted by him, lead the bank to believe that he had executed such power of attorney, or had authorized anyone to do so for him; and that he never, in any way, ratified the forgery of his name, or approved the pledging of the stock to the Unity Banking & Saving Company for the individual debt of Holzman & Company. \n\n[217 U.S. 127, 135]\n\u00a0\n In view of these facts,-which the referee as well as the district and circuit courts of appeals correctly held to have been established by the evidence,-it would seem unnecessary to cite authorities to show that, as between the bank and Fritz, the bank did not acquire any interest, legal or equitable, in the stock represented by the certificate placed in the possession of Holzman & Company under the circumstances stated. The bank no doubt relied upon the integrity of that firm, and acted in the belief that Frtiz had in fact signed the blank power of attorney or authorized it to be signed for him. But that belief was not, according to the evidence, superinduced by anything said, done, or omitted by Fritz. He was not chargeable with laches or negligence. The bank, having elected to rely upon Holzman & Company, must stand the consequences. It cannot say that it was misled by Fritz to its prejudice. It could not, therefore, as between itself and Fritz, take anything in virtue of the forgery. As against the true owner, a right of property cannot be acquired by means of a forged written instrument relating to such property. This is the general rule. An exception to the rule arises where the owner by laches, or by culpable, gross negligence, or by remaining silent when he should speak, has induced another, proceeding with reasonable caution, to act with reference to the property, in the belief that the instrument was genuine, or would be so recognized by the owner. In such cases, the owner would be equitably estopped to rely upon the fact of forgery, as against the person who was misled by his conduct. There are no facts in this case from which could arise an exception to the general rule.\n Nor, in view of the facts, need we follow the example of counsel and enter upon an examination of the cases bearing on the general inquiry as to the circumstances under which a broker who, by the act of the owner, comes into the lawful possession of a stock certificate,-but without the legal title having been transferred to him,-may retain the certificate as security for any balance ascertained upon settlement due \n\n[217 U.S. 127, 136]\n\u00a0\n him on account of dealings for or on behalf of such customer. We say this because it appears and it is so found, that, at the close of the business transacted by Holzman & Company for Fritz, the letter was a creditor, not a debtor, of that firm.\n In any aspect in which the case can be properly viewed, and for the reasons stated, the judgment sustaining Fritz's claim to the stock and certificate in question must be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","187":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWAGG v. HERBERT(1910)\nNo. 29\nArgued: Decided: January 24, 1910\n\n\n\n\n This was a suit commenced on June 13, 1903, in the district court of Pawnee county, Oklahoma, by William H. Herbert and Mary B. Herbert, his wife, against a number of defendants, the principal one being Solomon R. Wagg, the appellant. The suit was one to have a certain conveyance, in form conveying the legal title to a tract of land from Mrs. Herbert to Wagg, adjudged void, as having been fraudulently obtained, and to redeem the property from a prior mortgage lien. An outline of the transaction between the Herberts and Wagg is as follows: On October 26, 1898, they borrowed from him $1,000, and gave their promissory note, payable in one year, with interest after maturity at 10 per cent per annum, and as security therefor a mortgage on 80 acres belonging to her, and adjoining the town of Cleveland, in the county of Pawnee. \n\n[215 U.S. 546, 547]\n\u00a0\n Wagg retained $100 as interest for the first year, and sent the mortgagors $ 900. At the same time, as required by him, the plaintiffs executed to him a warranty deed for the same real estate, which was left in the bank of Cleveland in escrow as security for the note and mortgage. In closing this transaction he wrote to one of the plaintiffs a letter, in which he said: 'This pays first year's interest, second year's interest is not due until the end of the second year, and six months' grace on end of this makes a full two and a half years before you allow, or I can ask for, the deed in case of default of contract.'\n On December 26, 1899, he withdrew the deed in escrow from the bank, and caused it be filed and recorded in the office of the register of deeds of Pawnee county. His excuse for this was that not merely was $100 due as interest, but also that there was a default in the payment of taxes for the year 1898, and that, to protect the property, he had been obliged to pay them, amounting to $24.94, with accrued penalty and costs. Notwithstanding he had taken and recorded this deed, which apparently transferred to him the legal title, he advised Mrs. Herbert that she might still redeem the land according to the terms of the original loan. In May, 1901, the parties, who had been talking of a settlement for some time, executed two deeds, one for Mrs. Herbert, her husband having left for parts unknown, to the defendant, of the entire 80 acres, and one from him to her of 25 acres. Thereafter this defendant platted the 55 acres as an addition to the town of Cleveland, and sold and conveyed lots to the other parties named as defendants.\n In the second amended petition, the one upon which the case was tried, plaintiffs alleged that the defendant Wagg was guilty of fraud and oppression, and, taking advantage of his position and the relationship of the parties, obtained for a grossly inadequate consideration the title to the 55 acres; that, after platting, he conveyed some lots 'to innocent purchasers, the exact lots and amounts received for which are \n\n[215 U.S. 546, 548]\n\u00a0\n not known to the plaintiff, but which amount to a large sum of money;' that he had not accounted for the moneys so wrongfully received, and that an accounting was necessary.\n The case was tried by the judge without a jury. Several hundred pages of testimony were taken, and on May 19, 1905, a decree was entered finding generally the issues in favor of the plaintiff, Mrs. Herbert, the death of whose husband had been suggested pending the suit, adjudging that the deed of May, 1901, from her to the defendant, was a mortgage, that an accounting be had, and that she be allowed to redeem. The case was reserved for further consideration and determination of the claims of, and an accounting with, the other defendants. This decree was, on October 12, 1907, affirmed by the supreme court of the territory (19 Okla. 525, 92 Pac. 250), all the defendants joining in the appeal to that court. Thereafter the case was brought here on appeal by the defendant Wagg, the other defendants not joining in the appeal, but named as parties appellees.\n Mr. Arthur J. Biddison for appellant.\n\n\n[215 U.S. 546, 550]\n\u00a0\n Watson E. Coleman and E. M. Clark for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The petition charged that the defendant Wagg was guilty of fraudulent, wrongful, oppressive, and unjust conduct, and that through such conduct he obtained the deed of May 28, 1901. The trial court, as stated, found generally in plaintiff's favor. The supreme court, in an elaborate opinion, in which it \n\n[215 U.S. 546, 551]\n\u00a0\n narrated fully the details of the transactions between these parties and the testimony given on the hearing, closed its recital in these words:\n'It must therefore follow as an irresistible conclusion that the allegations in the petition of fraud, oppression, undue influence, and inadequate consideration were fully sustained by the evidence, and we are unable to perceive how the trial court could have reached any other fair, just, and rational conclusion upon the entire evidence as disclosed by this record.'\n\n The testimony as to the value of the property at the time of the settlement in May, 1901, was conflicting, some placing it at $100 per acre. In reference to this conflict the court said:\n'It is a settled rule of this court, and one which we have reiterated and reiterated time and again, that where the evidence reasonably sustains the finding and judgment of the court, or where the evidence is conflicting, it will not be disturbed by this court.'\n\n Evidently the supreme court believed that the defendant has acquired in settlement of a debt a tract of land of far greater value than the amount of the debt, and that this was accomplished by fraud, oppression, and undue influence. Upon these facts a decree setting aside the conveyance was undoubtedly right.\n Counsel for defendant, on his appeal to this court, has filed a brief of over 150 pages, in which he narrates the facts as they appear to him, and cites many authorities as to the circumstances which will uphold a conveyance upon such or similar facts. Of course, upon the face of the papers, the deed of May, 1901 vested in the defendant the title to the 55 acres, but it is well established that, in a suit in equity between parties, in which fraud, oppression, and undue influence are charged, the court is not concluded by that which appears on the face of the papers, but may institute an inquiry into the real facts of the transactions. So thoroughly is this doctrine established that any discussion of the cases in this and other courts affirming it would be useless. They rest upon elementary \n\n[215 U.S. 546, 552]\n\u00a0\n principles of equity. It is sufficient to refer to Russell v. Southard, 12 How. 139, 13 L. ed. 927, and the many authorities cited in the opinion.\n Counsel further contends that the decree is erroneous, in that it adjudges that the deed of May, 1901, to defendant was a mortgage, and as such only a lien upon the property; that there is no evidence that this deed was not intended as a conveyance, or that it was intended as a mortgage, and that courts do not make contracts for parties. But this contention presents a mere technical matter. The petition alleges, in addition to the averment that the deed was obtained wrongfully and fraudulently, 'that the only consideration received by said plaintiff for the said purported deed, marked 'Exhibit E' (the deed to defendant of May, 1901, of the entire tract), was a relinquishment of the said mortgage herein referred to as 'Exhibit B' (the original mortgage given by Mr. and Mrs. Herbert to defendant).' In other words, whatever technical criticism may be made upon the form of the decree, it was in substance a finding and decree that the deed of May, 1901, was void, as having been obtained by the fraudulent conduct of the defendant, and that being set aside left the property subject to the lien of the original mortgage given October 24, 1898. Of course, the act of Wagg in taking from the bank the deed placed in escrow, and having it recorded, may, in view of his assurances to Mrs. Herbert, be regarded as immaterial. Equitably, the relation of mortgagor and mortgagee was not disturbed. The court did not make a new contract for the parties, but, leaving the mortgage valid and binding, decreed the invalidity of a subsequent conveyance, and also ordered an accounting by the defendant as a mortgagee in possession.\n There is in this case no lapse of time, no matter of estoppel, which, so far as the defendant Wagg is concerned, forbids a court of equity from investigating and determining the real facts. Mrs. Herbert's deed to defendant was executed May 28, 1901, and this suit was commenced June 13, 1903, less than two years and a month from the date of the wrong complained \n\n[215 U.S. 546, 553]\n\u00a0\n of. While laches is often spoken of as the equitable equivalent of the legal statute of limitations, yet there is no fixed time which makes it an absolute bar. In Russell v. Southard, supra, there was between the fraudulent transaction and the commencement of the suit a lapse of nineteen years and eight months, and it was held that that was not sufficient, the court saying (p. 155):\n'The absence of all valuable consideration for the surrender of the equity, and the circumstances of distress under which it was made, and which, so far as it appears, continued to exist down to the filing of the bill, coupled with the conviction, which we think Russell mistakingly entertained, that his rights were probably destroyed, must prevent us from allowing the lapse of time to be a positive bar.'\n\n The rights of purchasers from Wagg subsequent to May 28, 1901, are protected by the accounting ordered, and as they did not appeal from the decree, it must be assumed that they were satisfied with it.\n The decree of the Supreme Court of the Territory of Oklahoma is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","188":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWALLACH v.

Thomas for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Lurton delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case was argued with the case of Columbia Heights Realty Co. v. Rudolph [\n217 U.S. 547\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 581], and the questions presented are substantially the same. The plaintiffs in error were interested as owners of certain lots or parts of lots involved in the gen- \n\n[217 U.S. 561, 562]\n\u00a0\n eral proceeding for the condemnation of property for the extension of Eleventh street, and an assessment for benefits was confirmed as to the property owned by them. They were allowed to prosecute a separate writ of error to the court of appeals for the District of Columbia from so much of the award as affected them, where the judgment was affirmed, and from that affirmation this writ of error has been sued out. The aggregate of the amounts which affect these plaintiffs in error, and in respect of which they have assigned error, is only $2,450.\n Jurisdictional limit upon writs of error and appeals to or from the court of appeals of the District of Columbia is $5,000, exclusive of interest and costs. See act of Feb. 9, 1893 (27 Stat. at L. 436, chap. 74).\n To sustain the jurisdiction, an affidavit has been filed to show that plaintiffs in error are contingently liable for an amount in excess of $5, 000, if this judgment is sustained, by reason of like assessments in the same proceeding upon certain other lots or parts of lots, under other subdivision numbers, and standing in the name of different owners, being lots disposed of pending the proceeding, under an undertaking to remove the lien of any assessment for benefits which might be made herein. It does not follow as matter of law that such assessments against such other lots, to other parties, will be determined by this review. But, however this may be, 'jurisdiction is to be determined by the amount directly involved in the decree appealed from, and not by any contingent demand which may be recovered, or any contingent loss which may be sustained, by either one of the parties, through the probative effect of the decree, however direct its bearing upon such contingency.'

STATE OF MARYLAND(1910)\nNo. 174\nArgued: Decided: May 31, 1910\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles G. Watson and Ferdinand Williams for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Isaac Lobe Straus for defendant in error. \n\n[218 U.S. 173, 174]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff in error was convicted in the circuit court of Allegany county, Maryland, for a violation of  99 of article 43 of the Maryland Code of 1904, for the offense of practising medicine in the state of Maryland without being registered in accordance with the provisions of  83 and 89 of the same article. The Maryland act in question, requiring registration of physicians, provides a comprehensive system for the regulation of the practice of medicine and surgery, and, concerning the necessity of registration, enacts (art. 43,  83):\n'All persons, except physicians who were practising medicine in this state prior to the 1st day of January, 1898, who are now practising medicine or surgery, and can prove by affidavit that within one year of said date said physician had treated in his professional capacity at least twelve persons, who shall commence the practice of medicine or surgery in any of their branches after the 11th day of April, 1902, shall make a written application for license to the president of either board of medical examiners,' etc.\n\n The statute requires proof of good moral character, certain school education, and makes provision as to the effect of diplomas from certain medical colleges, and as to other and various details required of an applicant for the practice of medicine or surgery.\n The judgment of conviction was affirmed by the court of appeals of Maryland (105 Md. 650, 66 Atl. 635), and the case is brought here to review that judgment, because of alleged violation of certain rights secured to the plaintiff in error by the Federal Constitution. The first of these grounds concerns  80 of the same act, which provides for the sending of notice to physicians practising in the state without being legally registered, and further providing that those physicians being entitled to register, and yet \n\n[218 U.S. 173, 175]\n\u00a0\n have failed to comply at the expiration of four months from the election of the secretary-treasurer of the board, shall be prosecuted; and that no one after the 11th day of April, 1902, shall be allowed to practise medicine or surgery without being duly registered according to the provision of the subtitle.\n The contention of the plaintiff in error is that there being no charge in the indictment, nor proof in the case, that he was furnished with this notice, his conviction was without due process of law. But the court of appeals of Maryland, examining this question, determined that  99, under which the indictment was prosecuted, making it a misdemeanor to attempt to practise medicine in the state of Maryland without registration, was not subject to the limitations of  80, relating to the sending of the notice, etc.\n The offense, the court of appeals held, was created solely by  99 in broad and general language, without exceptions or qualification, and that for conviction under that section it was not essential to prove the sending of the notice required by  80. This construction of the Maryland statute is conclusive upon us. The accused had a trial before a court and jury under the statutes of Maryland, was proceeded against under the forms provided for by the laws of that state, and under a statute which the highest court of the state has held completely defined the offense without resorting to the necessity of notifying unregistered physicians before they became liable for the penalties of the act for practising without registration. The contention that the conviction in this aspect was without due process of law under the Federal Constitution cannot be sustained.\n It is next contended that  83 violates the Federal Constitution, in the 14th Amendment thereof, in denying to the plaintiff in error the equal protection of the laws, in that it makes unreasonable and arbitrary \n\n[218 U.S. 173, 176]\n\u00a0\n distinction in its classification of physicians, including some and excluding others, and in making unreasonable omissions of certain classes from the requirements of the act, as shown in the exemption of certain classes from its requirements. It is contended that to except from the provisions of the act the physicians who were practising medicine in the state prior to the 1st day of January, 1898, who, at the time of the passage of the act, were practising medicine or surgery, and who could prove by affidavit that within one year of said date they had treated at least twelve persons in their professional capacity, is an unreasonable and arbitrary classification, resulting in the exclusion from the exception of physicians of equal merit and like qualifications with those who are within its terms.\n It is too well settled to require discussion at this day that the police power of the states extends to the regulation of certain trades and callings, particularly those which closely concern the public health. There is perhaps no profession more properly open to such regulation than that which embraces the practitioners of medicine. Dealing, as its followers do, with the lives and health of the people, and requiring for its successful practice general education and technical skill, as well as good character, it is obviously one of those vocations where the power of the state may be exerted to see that only properly qualified persons shall undertake its responsible and difficult duties. To this end many of the states of the Union have enacted statutes which require the practitioner of medicine to submit to an examination by a competent board of physicians and surgeons, and to receive duly authenticated certificates showing that they are deemed to possess the necessary qualifications of learning, skill, and character essential to their calling. In Dent v. West Virginia, \n129 U.S. 114\n, 32 L. ed. 623, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 231, the subject is elaborately considered, and this view affirmed by Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the court. \n\n[218 U.S. 173, 177]\n\u00a0\n In such statutes there are often found exceptions in favor of those who have practised their calling for a period of years. In the Dent Case, supra, an exception was made in favor of practitioners of medicine who had continuously practised their profession for ten years prior to a date shortly before the enactment of the law. Such exception proceeds upon the theory that those who have acceptably followed the profession in the community for a period of years may be assumed to have the qualifications which others are required to manifest as a result of an examination before a board of medical experts. In the statute under consideration, the excepted class were those who had practised before the 1st day of January, 1898, being more than four years before the passage of the law, and who could show, presumably with a view to establishing that they were actively practising at that time, that they had treated at least twelve persons within one year of that date.\n Conceding the power of the legislature to make regulations of this character, and to exempt the experienced and accepted physicians from the requirements of an examination and certificate, the details of such legislation rest primarily within the discretion of the state legislature. It is the lawmaking body, and the Federal courts can only interfere when fundamental rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution are violated in the enactment of such statutes.\n This subject has been so frequently and recently before this court as not to require an extended consideration. The right to regulate occupations was considered by this court at the present term in the case of Williamsv. Arkansas, \n217 U.S. 79\n, 54 L. ed. --, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 493, in which it was held that a state statute which prohibited a certain class of drumming or soliciting of business on trains did not amount to a denial of the equal protection of the law. In that case the recent cases in this court were reviewed and \n\n[218 U.S. 173, 178]\n\u00a0\n followed. It was therein held that regulations of a particular trade or business essential to the public health and safety were within the legislative capacity of the state in the exercise of its police power, and that unless such regulations are so unreasonable and extravagant as to interfere with property and personal rights of citizens, unnecessarily and arbitrarily, they are within the power of the state; and that the classification of the subjects of such legislation, so long as such classification has a reasonable basis, and is not merely arbitrary selection without real difference between the subjects included and those omitted from the law, does not deny to the citizen the equal protection of the laws. Applying these tests, we see nothing arbitrary or oppressive in the classification of physicians subject to the provisions of this statute, which excludes from its requirements those who have practised prior to January 1, 1898, and were able to show that they had treated at least twelve persons in a professional way within a year of that date.\n But it is insisted that undue discrimination is shown and equal protection of the law denied in the exceptions of the statute provided for in art. 43,  101, of the Code. These exceptions are contained in the following portions of that section:\n'. . . but nothing herein contained shall be construed to apply to gratuitous services, nor to any resident or assistant resident physicians or students at hospitals, in the discharge of their hospital or dispensary duties, or in the office of physicians, or to any physician or surgeon from another state, territory, or district in which he resides, when in actual consultation with a legal practitioner of this state, or to commissioned surgeons of the United States Army or Navy or Marine Hospital Service, or to chiropodists, or to midwives, or to masseurs or other manual manipulators, who use no other means; nor shall the provisions of this subtitle apply to physicians or sur- \n\n[218 U.S. 173, 179]\n\u00a0\n geons residing on the borders of a neighboring state, and duly authorized under the laws thereof to practise medicine or surgery therein, whose practice extends into the limits of this state: Provided, that such practitioners shall not open an office or appoint places to meet their patients or receive calls within the limits of this state without complying with the provisions of this subtitle: Provided, that the same privileges be accorded to licensed physicians of this state: Provided, further, that nothing in this subtitle shall annul any of the provisions of article 32, title 'Dentistry,' nor shall apply to any registered graduate of dental surgery now practising in the said state of Maryland, with the sign titles: Dentist, surgeon dentist, dental surgeon, or stomatologist.'\n\n The court of appeals of Maryland contented itself on this branch of the case with a reference to its former decisions as to certain of the exceptions, and, as to the others, with the expression of the opinion that all of them came within the discretion vested in the legislature, in the exercise of the police power, to make regulations for the public health and safety. We shall not take occasion to consider each of these exceptions. A reading of them makes it manifest that they are not without reason. Before a law of this kind can be declared violative of the 14th Amendment as an unreasonable classification of the subjects of such legislation because of the omission of certain classes, the court must be able to say that there is 'no fair reason for the law that would not require with equal force its extension to others whom it leaves untouched.' Such was the expression of this court in Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. May, \n194 U.S. 269\n, 48 L. ed. 972, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 638, quoted with approval in Williams v. Arkansas, supra.\n The stress of the argument for the plaintiff in error as to these exceptions is put upon the exemption of resident physicians, or assistant physicians, at hospitals, and students on hospital and dispensary duties. The selec- \n\n[218 U.S. 173, 180]\n\u00a0\n tion of the exempted classes was within the legislative power, subject only to the restriction that it be not arbitrary or oppressive, and apply equally to all persons similarly situated. We cannot say that these exceptions nullify the law. The reason for them may be that hospitals are very often the subject of state or municipal regulation and control, and employment in them may be by boards responsible to public authority under state law or municipal ordinance. Certainly the conduct of such institutions may be regulated by such laws or municipal regulations as might not reach the general practitioner of medicine. In any event, we cannot say that these exceptions are so wholly arbitrary and have such slight relation to the objects to be attained by the law as to require the courts to strike them down as a denial of the equal protection of the law, within the meaning of the Federal Constitution.\n Other questions are made in the record, but they do not present alleged denials of rights of a Federal character, reviewable here. We find no error in the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland, and the same is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","190":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWEEMS v. U.S.(1910)\nNo. 20\nArgued: Decided: May 2, 1910\n\n\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 349, 351]\n\u00a0\n Mr. A. S. Worthington for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[217 U.S. 349, 354]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Fowler and Solicitor General Hoyt for defendant in error.\n\n\n[217 U.S. 349, 357]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This writ of error brings up for review the judgment of the supreme court of the Philippine Islands, affirming the conviction of plaintiff in error for falsifying a 'public and official document.'\n In the 'complaint,' by which the prosecution was begun, it was charged that the plaintiff in error, 'a duly appointed, qualified, and acting disbursing officer of the Bureau of Coast Guard and Transportation of the United States Government of the Philippine Islands,' did, as such, 'corruptly, and with intent then and there to deceive and defraud the United States government of the Philippine Islands and its officials, falsify a public and official document, namely, a cash book of the captain of the port of Manilla, Philippine Islands, and the Bureau of Coast Guard and Transportation of the United States Government of the Philippine Islands,' kept by him as disbursing officer of that bureau. The falsification, which is alleged with much particularity, was committed by entering as paid out, 'as wages of employees of the lighthouse service \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 358]\n\u00a0\n of the United States government of the Philippine Islands,' at the Capul lighthouse, of 204 pesos, and for like service at the Matabriga lighthouse of 408 pesos, Philippine currency. A demurrer was filed to the 'complaint,' which was overruled.\n He was convicted, and the following sentence was imposed upon him: 'To the penalty of fifteen years of cadena, together with the accessories of  56 of the Penal Code, and to pay a fine of 4,000 pesetas, but not to serve imprisonment as a subsidiary punishment in case of his insolvency, on account of the nature of the main penalty, and to pay the costs of this cause.'\n The judgment and sentence were affirmed by the supreme court of the islands.\n It is conceded by plaintiff in error that some of the questions presented to the supreme court of the Philippine Islands cannot be raised in this court, as the record does not contain the evidence. Indeed, plaintiff in error confines his discussion to one point raised in the court below and to three other questions, which, though not brought to the attention of the supreme court of the islands, and not included in the assignment of errors, are of such importance, it is said, that this court will consider them under the right reserved in rule 35. \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 359]\n\u00a0\n These questions are as follows:\n'I. The court below erred in overruling the demurrer to the complaint, this assignment being based upon the fact that, in the complaint, the plaintiff in error is described as the 'disbursing officer of the Bureau of Coast Guard and Transportation of the United States Government of the Philippine Islands,' and the cash book referred to in the complaint is described as a book 'of the captain of the port of Manila, Philippine Islands,' whereas there is no such body politic as the 'United States government of the Philippine Island.'\n\n'2. The record does not disclose that the plaintiff in error was arraigned, or that he pleaded to the complaint after his demurrer was overruled and he was 'ordered to plead to the complaint.'\n\n'3. The record does not show that the plaintiff in error was present when he was tried, or, indeed, that he was present in court at any time.\n\n'4. The punishment of fifteen years' imprisonment was a cruel and unusual punishment, and, to the extent of the sentence, the judgment below should be reversed on this ground.'\n\n The second assignment of error was based upon a misapprehension of the fact, and has been abandoned.\n The argument to support the first assignment of error is based upon certain acts of Congress and certain acts of the Philippine Commission in which the government of the United States and the government of the Islands are distinguished. \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 360]\n\u00a0\n And it is urged that in one of the acts ( 3396 of the acts of the commission) it is recognized that there may be allegiance to or treason against both or 'either of them,' and ( 3397) that there may be 'rebellion or insurrection against the authority' of either, and ( 3398) that there may be a conspiracy to overthrow either, or to 'prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of either.' Other sections are cited, in which it is contended that the insular government is spoken of as an 'entity,' and distinguished from that of the United States. Section 1366, which defines the duty of the attorney general, it is pointed out, especially distinguishes between 'causes, civil or criminal, to which the United States or any officer thereof in his official capacity is a party,' and causes, civil or criminal, to which the 'government of the Philippine Islands or any officer thereof in his official capacity is a party.' And still more decisively, it is urged, by subdivision 'C' of  1366, in which it is recognized that the cause of action may be for money, and that the judgment may be for money, 'belonging to the government of the United States and that of the Philippine Islands or some other province.' It is therefore contended that the government of the United States and that of the Philippine Islands are distinct legal entities, and that there may be civil obligations to one, and not to the other; that there may be governmental liability to the one, and not to the other; and that proceedings, civil or criminal, against either, must recognixe the distinction to be either, must recognize the distinction to be these principles, let us see what the information charges. It describes Weems, plaintiff in error, as 'a public official of the United States government of the Philippine Islands; to wit, a duly appointed and qualified acting disbursing official of the Bureau of Coast Guard and Transportation of the United States Government of the Philippine Islands;' and it is charged that, by taking advantage of his official position, with intent to 'deceive and defraud the United States government of the Phillipine Islands,' he falsified a public and official document. In the same manner the gov- \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 361]\n\u00a0\n ernment is designated throughout the information. It is contended that 'there is no such body politic as the 'United States government of the Philippine Islands,\" and it is urged that the objection does not relate to a matter of form. 'It is as substantial,' it is said, as the point involved in Carrington v. United States, \n208 U.S. 1\n, 52 L. ed. 367, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 203, where a military officer of the United States was prosecuted as a civil officer of the government of the Philippines. His conviction was reversed, this court holding that, 'as a soldier, he was not an official of the Philippines, but of the United States.'\n It is true that the distinctions raised are expressed in the statutes, and necessarily so. It would be difficult otherwise to provide for government where there is a paramount authority making use of subordinate instrumentalities. We have examples in the states of the Union and their lesser municipal divisions, and rights may flow from and to such lesser divisions. And the distinction in the Philippine statutes means no more than that, and, conforming to that, a distinction is clearly made in the information. Weems's official position is described as 'disbursing officer of the Bureau of Coast Guard and Transportation of the United States Government of the Philippine Islands.' There is no real uncertainty in this description, and whatever technical nicety of discrimination might have been insisted on at one time cannot now be, in view of the provisions of the Philippine Criminal Code of Procedure, which requires a public offense to be described in 'ordinary and concise language,' not necessarily in the words of the statute, 'but in such form as to enable a person of common understanding to know what is intended, and the court to pronounce indgment according to the right.' And it is further provided that 'no information or complaint is insufficient, nor can the trial, judgment, or other proceeding be affected, by reason of a defect in matter of form which does not tend to prejudice a substantial right of the defendant upon the merits' ( 10).\n Carrington v. United States, \n208 U.S. 1\n, 52 L. ed. 367, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 203, is not in point. In \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 362]\n\u00a0\n that case it was attempted to hold Carrington guilty of an offense as a civil officer for what he had done as a military officer. As he was the latter, he had not committed any offense under the statute. The first assignment of error is therefore not sustained.\n It is admitted, as we have seen, that the questions presented by the third and fourth assignments of error were not made in the courts below, but a consideration of them is invoked under rule 35, which provides that this court, 'at its option, may notice a plain error not assigned.'\n It is objected on the other side that Paraiso v. United States, \n207 U.S. 368\n, 52 L. ed. 249, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 127, stands in the way. But the rule is not altogether controlled by precedent. It confers a discretion that may be exercised at any time, no matter what may have been done at some other time. It is true we declined to exercise it in Paraiso v. United States, but we exercised it in Wiborg v. United States, \n163 \nU.S. 632, 658\n, 41 S. L. ed. 289, 298, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1127, 1197; Clyatt v. United States, \n197 \nU.S. 207, 221\n, 49 S. L. ed. 726, 731, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 429, and Crawford v. United States, \n212 U.S. 183\n, 53 L. ed. 465, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 260, 15 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 392. It may be said, however, that Paraiso v. United States is more directly applicable, as it was concerned with the same kind of a crime as that in the case at bar, and that it was contended there, as here, that the amount of fine and imprisonment imposed inflicted a cruel and unusual punishment. It may be that we were not sufficiently impressed with the importance of those contentions, or saw in the circumstances of the case no reason to exercise our right of review under rule 35. As we have already said, the rule is not a rigid one, and we have less reluctance to disregard prior examples in criminal cases than in civil cases, and less reluctance to act under it when rights are asserted which are of such high character as to find expression and sanction in the Constitution or Bill of Rights. And such rights are asserted in this case.\n The assignment of error is that 'a punishment of fifteen years' imprisonment was a cruel and unusual punishment, and, to the extent of the sentence, the judgment below should be reversed on this ground.' Weems was convicted, as we \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 363]\n\u00a0\n have seen, for the falsification of a public and official document, by entering therein, as paid out, the sums of 208 and 408 pesos, respectively, as wages to certain employees of the lighthouse service. In other words, in entering upon his cash book those sums as having been paid out when they were not paid out; and the 'truth,' to use the language of the statue, was thereby perverted 'in the narration of facts.'\n A false entry is all that is necessary to constitute the offense. Whether an offender against the statute injures anyone by his act, or intended to injure anyone, is not material, the trial court held. The court said: 'It is not necessary that there be any fraud nor even the desire to defraud, nor intention of personal gain on the part of the person committing it, that a falsification of a public document be punishable; it is sufficient that the one who committed it had the intention to pervert the truth and to falsify the document, and that by it damage might result to a third party.' The court further, in the definition of the nature of the offense and the purpose of the law, said: 'In public documents, the law takes into consideration not only private interests, but also the interests of the community;' and it is its endeavor (and for this a decision of the Supreme Court of Spain, delivered in 1873, was quoted) 'to protect the interest of society by the most strict faithfulness on the part of a public official in the administration of the office intrusted to him,' and thereby fulfil the 'responsibility of the state to the community for the official or public documents under the safeguard of the state.' And this was attempted to be secured through the law in controversy. It is found in  1 of chapter 4 of the Penal Code of Spain. The caption of the section is, 'Falsification of Official and Commercial Documents and Telegraphic Despatches.' Article 300 provides as follows: 'The penalties of cadena temporal and a fine of from 1,250 to 12, 500 pesetas shall be imposed on a public official who, taking advantage of his authority, shall commit a falsification. . . . By perverting the truth in the narration of facts . . ..'\n By other provisions of the Code we find that there are only \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 364]\n\u00a0\n two degrees of punishment higher in scale than cadena temporal,-death, and cadena perpetua. The punishment of cadena temporal is from twelve years and one day to twenty years (arts. 28 and 96), which 'shall be served' in certain 'penal institutions.' And it is provided that 'those sentenced to cadena temporal and cadena perpetua shall labor for the benefit of the state. They shall always carry a chain at the ankle, hanging from the wrists; they shall be employed at hard and painful labor, and shall receive no assistance whatsoever from without the institution.' Arts. 105, 106. There are, besides, certain accessory penalties imposed, which are defined to be (1) civil interdiction; (2) perpetual absolute disqualification; (3) subjection to surveillance during life. These penalties are defined as follows:\n'Art. 42. Civil interdiction shall deprive the person punished, as long as he suffers it, of the rights of parental suthority, guardianship of person or property, participation in the family council, marital authority, it, of the rights of parental authority, the right to dispose of his own property by acts inter vivos. Those cases are excepted in which the laws explicitly limit its effects.\n\n'Art. 43. Subjection to the surveillance of the authorities imposes the following obligations on the persons punished:\n\n'1. That of fixing his domicil and giving notice thereof to the authority immediately in charge of his surveillance, not being allowed to change it without the knowledge and permission of said authority, in writing.\n\n'2. To observe the rules of inspection prescribed.\n\n'3. To adopt some trade, art, industry, or profession should he not have known means of subsistence of his own.\n\n'Whenever a person punished is placed under the surveillance of the authorities, notice thereof shall be given to the government and to the governor general.'\n\n The penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification is the deprivation of office, even though it be held by popular election, the deprivation of the right to vote or to be elected to \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 365]\n\u00a0\n public office, the disqualification to acquire honors, etc., and the loss of retirement pay, etc.\n These provisions are attacked as infringing that provision of the Bill of Rights of the islands which forbids the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment. It must be confessed that they, and the sentence in this case, excite wonder in minds accustomed to a more considerate adaptation of punishment to the degree of crime. In a sense the law in controversy seems to be independent of degrees. One may be an offender against it, as we have seen, though he gain nothing and injure nobody. It has, however, some human indulgence,-it is not exactly Draconian in uniformity. Though it starts with a severe penalty, between that and the maximum penalty it yields something to extenuating circumstances. Indeed, by article 96 of the Penal Code the penalty is declared to be 'divisible,' and the legal term of its 'duration is understood as distributed into three parts, forming the three degrees,-that is, the minimum, medium, and maximum,'-being respectively twelve years and one day to fourteen years and eight months; from fourteen years, eight months, and one day to seventeen years and four months; from seventeen years, four months, and one day to twenty years. The law therefore allows a range from twelve years and a day to twenty years, and the government, in its brief, ventures to say that 'the sentence of fifteen years is well within the law.' But the sentence is attacked as well as the law, and what it is to be well within the law a few words will exhibit. The mimimum term of imprisonment is twelve years, and that, therefore, must be imposed for 'perverting the truth' in a single item of a public record, though there be no one injured, though there be no fraud or purpose of it, no gain or desire of it. Twenty years is the maximum imprisonment, and that only can be imposed for the perversion of truth in every item of an officer's accounts, whatever be the time covered and whatever fraud it conceals or tends to conceal. Between these two possible sentences, which seem to have no adaptable relation, or rather \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 366]\n\u00a0\n in the difference of eight years for the lowest possible offense and the highest possible, the courts below selected three years to add to the minimum of twelve years and a day for the falsification of two items of expenditure, amounting to the sums of 408 and 204 pesos. And the fine and 'accessories' must be brought into view. The fine was 4,000 pesetas,-an excess also over the minimum. The 'accessories' we have already defined. We can now give graphic description of Weems's sentence and of the law under which it was imposed. Let us confine it to the minimum degree of the law, for it is with the law that we are most concerned. Its minimum degree is confinement in a penal institution for twelve years and one day, a chain at the ankle and wrist of the offender, hard and painful labor, no assistance from friend or relative, no marital authority or parental rights or rights of property, no participation even in the family council. These parts of his penalty endure for the term of imprisonment. From other parts there is no intermission. His prison bars and chains are removed, it is true, after twelve years, but he goes from them to a perpetual limitation of his liberty. He is forever kept under the shadow of his crime, forever kept within voice and view of the criminal magistrate, not being able to change his domicil without giving notice to the 'authority immediately in charge of his surveillance,' and without permission in writing. He may not seek, even in other scenes and among other people, to retrieve his fall from rectitude. Even that hope is taken from him, and he is subject to tormenting regulations that, if not so tangible as iron bars and stone walls, oppress as much by their continuity, and deprive of essential liberty. No circumstance of degradation is omitted. It may be that even the cruelty of pain is not omitted. He must bear a chain night and day. He is condemned to painful as well as hard labor. What painful labor may mean we have no exact measure. It must be something more than hard labor. It may be hard labor pressed to the point of pain. Such penalties for such offenses amaze those \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 367]\n\u00a0\n who have formed their conception of the relation of a state to even its offending citizens from the practice of the American commonwealths, and believe that it is a precept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to offense.\n Is this also a precept of the fundamental law? We say fundamental law, for the provision of the Philippine Bill of Rights, prohibiting the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment, was taken from the Constitution of the United States, and must have the same meaning. This was decided in Kepner v. United States, \n195 U.S. 100\n, 49 L. ed. 114, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 797, 1 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 655, and Serra v. Mortiga, \n204 U.S. 477\n, 51 L. ed. 574, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 343. in Kepner v. United States this court considered the instructions of the President to the Philippine Commission, and quoted from them the admonition to the commission that the government that we were establishing was not designed 'for our satisfaction or for the expression of our theoretical views, but for the happiness . . . of the people of the Philippine Island; and the measures adopted should be made to conform to their customs, their habits, and even their prejudices, to the fullest extent consistent with the accomplishment of the indispensable requisites of just and effective government.' But, it was pointed out, a qualification accompanied the admonition, and the commission was instructed 'to bear in mind' and the people of the islands 'made plainly to understand' that certain great principles of government had been made the basis of our governmental system, which were deemed 'essential to the rule of law and the maintenance of individual freedom.' And the president further declared that there were 'certain practical rules of government which we have found to be essential to the preservation of those great principles of liberty and law.' These he admonished the commission to establish and maintain in the islands 'for the sake of their liberty and happiness,' however they might conflict with the customs or laws of procedure with which they were familiar. In view of the importance of these principles and rules, which the President said the 'enlightened \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 368]\n\u00a0\n thought of the Philippine Islands' would come to appreciate, he imposed their observance 'upon every division and branch of the government of the Philippines.'\n Among those rules was that which prohibited the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment. It was repeated in the act of July 1, 1902 [32 Stat. at L. 691, chap. 1369], providing for the administration of the affairs of the civil government in the islands, and this court said of it and of the instructions of the President that they were 'intended to carry to the Philippine Islands those principles of our government which the President declared to be established as rules of law for the maintenance of individual freedom.' The instructions of the President and the act of Congress found in nominal existence in the islands the Penal Code of Spain, its continuance having been declared by military order. It may be there was not and could not be a careful consideration of its provisions and a determination to what extent they accorded with or were repugnant to the 'great principles of liberty and law' which had been 'made the basis of our governmental system.' Upon the institution of the government of the commission, if not before, that consideration and determination necessarily came to the courts and are presented by this record.\n What constitutes a cruel and unusual punishment has not been exactly decided. It has been said that ordinarily the terms imply something inhuman and barbarous,-torture and the like. McDonald v. Com. 173 Mass. 322, 73 Am. St. Rep. 293, 53 N. E. 874. The court, however, in that case, conceded the possibility 'that punishment in the state prison for a long term of years might be so disproportionate to the offense as to constitute a cruel and unusual punishment.' Other cases have selected certain tyrannical acts of the English monarchs as illustrating the meaning of the clause and the extent of its prohibition.\n The provision received very little debate in Congress. We find from the Congressional Register, p. 225, that Mr. Smith, of South Carolina, 'objected to the words 'nor cruel and \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 369]\n\u00a0\n unusual punishment,' the import of them being too indefinite.' Mr. Livermore opposed the adoption of the clause saying:\n'The clause seems to express a great deal of humanity, on which account I have no objection to it; but, as it seems to have no meaning in it, I do not think it necessary. What is meant by the terms 'excessive bail?' Who are to be the judges? What is understood by 'excessive fines?' It lays with the court to determine. No cruel and unusual punishment is to be inflicted; it is sometimes necessary to hang a man, villains often deserve whipping, and perhaps having their ears cut off; but are we, in future, to be prevented from inflicting these punishments because they are cruel? If a more lenient mode of correcting vice and deterring others from the commission of it could be invented, it would be very prudent in the legislature to adopt it; but until we have some security that this will be done, we ought not to be restrained from making necessary laws by any declaration of this kind.'\n\n The question was put on the clause, and it was agreed to by a considerable majority.\n No case has occurred in this court which has called for an exhaustive definition. In Pervear v. Massachusetts, 5 Wall. 475, 18 L. ed. 608, it was decided that the clause did not apply to state but to national legislation. But we went further, and said that we perceive nothing excessive, or cruel, or unusual in a fine of $50 and imprisonment at hard labor in the house of correction for three months, which was imposed for keeping and maintaining, without a license, a tenement for the illegal sale and illegal keeping of intoxicating liquors. A decision from which no one will dissent.\n In Wilkerson v. Utah, \n99 U.S. 130\n, 25 L. ed. 345, the clause came up again for consideration. A statute of Utah provided that 'a person convicted of a capital offense should suffer death by being shot, hanged, or beheaded,' as the court might direct, or he should 'have his option as to the manner of his execution.' The statute was sustained. The court pointed out that death was an usual punishment for murder, that it pre- \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 370]\n\u00a0\n vailed in the territory for many years, and was inflicted by shooting; also that that mode of execution was usual under military law. It was hence concluded that it was not forbidden by the Constitution of the United States as cruel or unusual. The court quoted Blackstone as saying that the sentence of death was generally executed by hanging, but also that circumstances of terror, pain, or disgrace were sometimes superadded. 'Cases mentioned by the author,' the court said, 'are where the person was drawn or dragged to the place of execution, in treason; or where he was disemboweled alive, beheaded, and quartered, in high treason. Mention is also made of public dissection in murder and burning alive in treason committed by a female.' And it was further said: 'Examples of such legislation in the early history of the parent country are given by the annotator of the last edition of Archbold's treatise. Archbold, Crim. Pr. & Pl. 8th ed. 584.'\n This court's final commentary was that 'difficulty would attend the effort to define with exactness the extent of the constitutional provision which provides that cruel and unusual punishments shall not be inflicted; but it is safe to affirm that punishments of torture, such as those mentioned by the commentator referred to, and all others in the same line of unnecessary cruelty, are forbidden by that Amendment to the Constitution. Cooley, Const. Lim. 4th ed. 408; Wharton, Crim. Law, 7th ed .  3405.'\n That passage was quoted in Re Kemmler, \n136 \nU.S. 436, 447\n, 34 S. L. ed. 519, 524, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 930 and this comment was made: 'Punishments are cruel when they involve torture or a lingering death; but the punishment of death is not cruel, within the meaning of that word as used in the Constitution. It implies there something inhuman and barbarous, and something more than the mere extinguishment of life.' The case was an application for habeas corpus, and went off on a question of jurisdiction, this court holding that the 8th Amendment did not apply to state legislation. It was not meant in the language we have quoted to give a comprehensive definition of cruel and unusual \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 371]\n\u00a0\n punishment, but only to explain the application of the provision to the punishment of death. In other words, to describe what might make the punishment of death cruel and unusual, though of itself it is not so. It was found as a fact by the state court that death by electricity was more humane than death by hanging.\n In O'Neil v. Vermont, \n144 U.S. 323\n, 36 L. ed. 450, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 693, the question was raised, but not decided. The reasons given for this were that because it was not as a Federal question assigned as error, and, so far as it arose under the Constitution of Vermont, it was not within the province of the court to decide. Moreover, it was said, as a Federal question, it had always been ruled that the 8th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States did not apply to the states. Mr. Justice Field, Mr. Justice Harlan, and Mr. Justice Brewer were of opinion that the question was presented, and Mr. Justice Field, construing the clause of the Constitution prohibiting the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment, said, the other two justices concurring, that the inhibition was directed not only against punishments which inflict torture, 'but against all punishments which, by their execssive length or severity, are greatly disproportioned to the offenses charged.' He said further: 'The whole inhibition is against that which is excessive in the bail required or fine imposed or punishment inflicted.'\n The law writers are indefinite. Story, in his work on the Constitution, vol. 2, 5th ed.  1903, says that the provision 'is an exact transcript of a clause in the Bill of Rights framed at the revolution of 1688.' He expressed the view that the provision 'would seem to be wholly unnecessary in a free government, since it is scarcely possible that any department of such a government should authorize or justify such atrocious conduct.' He, however, observed that it was 'adopted as an admonition to all departments of the national department, to warn them against such violent proceedings as had taken place in England in the arbitrary reigns of some of the Stuarts.' For this he cites 2 Elliott's Debates, 345, and refers to 2 Lloyd's \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 372]\n\u00a0\n Debates, 225, 226; 3 Elliott's debates, 345. If the learned author meant by this to confine the prohibition of the provision to such penalties and punishment as were inflicted by the Stuarts, his citations do not sustain him. Indeed, the provision is not mentioned except in 2 Elliott's Debates, from which we have already quoted. The other citations are of the remarks of Patrick Henry in the Virginia convention, and of Mr. Wilson in the Pennsylvania convention. Patrick Henry said that there was danger in the adoption of the Constitution without a Bill of Rights. Mr. Wilson considered that it was unnecessary, and had been purposely omitted from the Constitution. Both, indeed, referred to the tyranny of the Stuarts. Henry said that the people of England, in the Bill of Rights, prescribed to William, Prince of Orange, upon what terms he should reign. Wilson said that 'the doctrine and practice of a declaration of rights have been borrowed from the conduct of the people of England on some remarkable occasions; but the principles and maxims on which their government is constituted are widely different from those of ours.' It appears, therefore, that Wilson, and those who thought like Wilson, felt sure that the spirit of liberty could be trusted, and that its ideals would be represented, not debased, by legislation. Henry and those who believed as he did would take no chances. Their predominant political impulse was distrust of power, and they insisted on constitutional limitations against its abuse. But surely they intended more than to register a fear of the forms of abuse that went out of practice with the Stuarts. Surely, their jealousy of power had a saner justification than that. They were men of action, practical and sagacious, not beset with vain imagining, and it must have come to them that there could be exercises of cruelty by laws other than those which inflicted bodily pain or mutilation. With power in a legislature great, if not unlimited, to give criminal character to the actions of men, with power unlimited to fix terms of imprisonment with what accompaniments they might, what more potent instrument of cruelty \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 373]\n\u00a0\n could be put into the hands of power? And it was believed that power might be tempted to cruelty. This was the motive of the clause, and if we are to attribute an intelligent providence to its advocates we cannot think that it was intended to prohibit only practices like the Stuarts', or to prevent only an exact repetition of history. We cannot think that the possibility of a coercive cruelty being exercised through other forms of punishment was overlooked. We say 'coercive cruelty,' because there was more to be considered than the ordinary criminal laws. Cruelty might become an instrument of tyranny; of zeal for a purpose, either honest or sinister.\n Legislation, both statutory and constitutional, is enacted, it is true, from an experience of evils but its general language should not, therefore, be necessarily confined to the form that evil had theretofore taken. Time works changes, brings into existence new conditions and purposes. Therefore a principle, to be vital, must be capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it birth. This is peculiarly true of constitutions. They are not ephemeral enactments, designed to meet passing occasions. They are, to use the words of Chief Justice Marshall, 'designed to approach immortality as nearly as human institutions can approach it.' The future is their care, and provision for events of good and bad tendencies of which no prophecy can be made. In the application of a constitution, therefore, our contemplation cannot be only of what has been, but of what may be. Under any other rule a constitution would indeed be as easy of application as it would be deficient in efficacy and power. Its general principles would have little value, and be converted by precedent into impotent and lifeless formulas. Rights declared in words might be lost in reality. And this has been recognized. The meaning and vitality of the Constitution have developed against narrow and restrictive construction. There is an example of this in Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, 18 L. ed. 356, where the prohibition against ex post facto laws was given a more extensive application than what a minority of this court \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 374]\n\u00a0\n thought had been given in Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 1 L. ed. 648. See also Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall. 333, 18 L. ed. 366. The construction of the 14th Amendment is also an example, for it is one of the limitations of the Constitution. In a not unthoughtful opinion, Mr. Justice Miller expressed great doubt whether that Amendment would ever be held as being directed against any action of a state which did not discriminate 'against the negroes as a class, or on account of their race.' Slaughter House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 81, 21 L. ed. 394, 410. To what extent the Amendment has expanded beyond that limitation need not be instanced.\n There are many illustrations of resistance to narrow constructions of the grants of power to the national government. One only need be noticed, and we select it because it was made against a power which, more than any other, is kept present to our minds in visible and effective action. We mean the power over interstate commerce. This power was deduced from the eleven simple words,-'to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states.' The judgment which established it was pronounced by Chief Justice Marshall (Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 6 L. ed. 23), and reversed a judgment of Chancellor Kent, justified, as that celebrated jurist supposed, by a legislative practice of fourteen years, and fortified by the opinions of men familiar with the discussions which had attended the adoption of the Constitution. Persuaded by such considerations the learned chancellor confidently decided that the congressional power related to 'external, not to internal, commerce,' and adjudged that, under an act of the state of New York, Livingston and Fulton had the exclusive right of using steamboats upon all of the navigable waters of the state. The strength of the reasoning was not underrated. It was supported, it was said, 'by great names, by names which have all the titles to consideration that virtue, intelligence, and office can bestow.' The narrow construction, however, did not prevail, and the propriety of the arguments upon which it was based was questioned. It was said, in effect, that they supported a construction which 'would cripple the govern- \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 375]\n\u00a0\n ment and render it unequal to the objects for which it was declared to be instituted, and to which the powers given, as fairly understood, render it competent.'\n But general discussion we need not farther pursue. We may rely on the conditions which existed when the Constitution was adopted. As we have seen, it was the thought of Story, indeed, it must come to a less trained reflection than his, that government by the people, instituted by the Constitution, would no imitate the conduct of arbitrary monarchs. The abuse of power might, indeed, be apprehended, but not that it would be manifested in provisions or practices which would shock the sensibilities of men.\n Cooley, in his 'Constitutional Limitations,' apparently in a struggle between the effect to be given to ancient examples and the inconsequence of a dread of them in these enlightened times, is not very clear or decisive. He hesitates to advance definite views, and expresses the 'difficulty of determining precisely what is meant by cruel and unusual punishment.' It was probable, however, he says, that 'any punishment declared by statute for an offense which was punishable in the same way at common law could not be regarded as cruel or unusual, in a constitutional sense.' And he says further that 'probably any new statutory offense may be punished to the extent [italics ours] and in the mode permitted by the common law for offenses of a similar nature.'\n In the cases in the state courts, different views of the provision are taken. In State v. Driver, 78 N. C. 423, 427, it was said that criminal legislation and its administration are so uniformly humane that there is seldom occasion for complaint. In that case, a sentence of the defendant for assault and battery upon his wife was imprisonment in the county jail for five years, and at the expiration thereof to give security to keep the peace for five, in the sum of $500, with sureties, was held to be cruel and unusual. To sustain its judgment, the court said that the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment was not 'intended to warn against merely erratic \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 376]\n\u00a0\n modes of punishment or torture, but applied expressly to 'bail,' 'fines' and 'punishments.\" It was also said that 'the earliest application of the provision in England was in 1689, the first year after the adoption of the Bill of Rights in 1688, to avoid an excessive pecuniary fine imposed upon Lord Devonshire by the court of King's bench. 11 How. St. Tr. 1354.' Lord Devonshire was fined $30,000 for an assault and battery upon Colonel Culpepper, and the House of Lords, in reviewing the case, took the opinion of the law Lords, and decided that the fine 'was excessive and exorbitant, against Magna Charta, the common right of the subject, and the law of the land.' Other cases have given a narrower construction, feeling constrained thereto by the incidences of history.\n In Hobbs v. State, 133 Ind. 404, 18 L.R.A. 774, 32 N. E. 1019, the supreme court of Indiana expressed the opinion that the provision did not apply to punishment by 'fine or imprisonment or both, but such as that inflicted at the whipping post, in the pillory, burning at the stake, breaking on the wheel.' etc.\n It was further said: 'The word, according to modern interpretation, does not affect legislation providing imprisonment for life or for years, or the death penalty by hanging or electrocution. If it did, our laws for the punishment of crime would give no security to the citizen.' That conclusion certainly would not follow, and its expression can only be explained by the impatience the court exhibited at the contention in that case, which attacked a sentence of two years' imprisonment in the state prison for combining to assault, beat, and bruise a man in the nighttime. Indeed, in court ventured the inquiry 'whether, in this country, at the close of the nineteenth century,' the provision was 'not obsolete,' except as an admonition to the courts 'against the infliction of punishment so severe as not to 'fit the crime.\" In other words, that it had ceased to be a restraint upon legislatures, and had become an admonition only to the courts not to abuse the discretion which might be intrusted to them. Other cases might \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 377]\n\u00a0\n be cited in illustration, some looking backwards for examples by which to fix the meaning of the clause; others giving a more expansive and vital character to the provision, such as the President of the United States thought it possessed, and admonished the Philippine Commission that it possessed as 'essential [with other rights] to the rule of law and the maintenance of individual freedom.'\n An extended review of the cases in the state courts, interpreting their respective constitutions, we will not make. It may be said of all of them that there was not such challenge to the import and consequence of the inhibition of cruel and unusual punishments as the law under consideration presents. It has no fellow in American legislation. Let us remember that it has come to us from a government of a different form and genius from ours. It is cruel in its excess of imprisonment and that which accompanies and follows imprisonment. It is unusual in its character. Its punishments come under the condemnation of the Bill of Rights, both on account of their degree and kind. And they would have those bad attributes even if they were found in a Federal enactment, and not taken from an alien source.\n Many of the state cases which have been brought to our attention require no comment. They are based upon sentences of courts, not upon the constitutional validity of laws. The contentions in other cases vary in merit and in their justification of serious consideration. We have seen what the contention was in Hobbs v. State, supra. In others, however, there was more inducement to an historical inquiry. In Com. v. Wyatt, 6 Rand. (Va.) 694, the whipping post had to be justified and was justified. In comparison with the 'barbarities of quartering, hanging in chains, castration, etc.,' it was easily reduced to insignificance. The court in the latter case pronounced it 'odious, but not unusual.' Other cases have seen something more than odiousness in it, and have regarded it as one of the forbidden punishments. It is certainly as odious as the pillory, and the latter has been pro- \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 378]\n\u00a0\n nounced to be within the prohibitory clause. Whipping was also sustained in Foote v. State (1882) 59 Md. 264, as a punishment for wife beating. And, it may be, in Aldridge v. Com. 2 Va. Cas. 447. The law considered was one punishing free negroes and mulattoes for grand larceny. Under the law, a free person of color could be condemned to be sold as a slave, and transported and banished beyond the limits of the United States. Such was the judgment pronounced on the defendant by the trial court, and, in addition, thirty-nine stripes on his bare back. The judgment was held valid on the ground that the Bill of Rights of the state was 'never designed to control the legislative right to determine ad libitum upon the adequacy of punishment, but is merely applicable to the modes of punishment.' Cooley, in his Constitutional Limitations, says that it may be well doubted if the right exist 'to establish the whipping post and the pillory in states where they were never recognized as instruments of punishment, or in states whose constitutions, revised since public opinion had banished them, have forbidden cruel and unusual punishment.' [7th ed. p. 472.] The clause of the Constitution, in the opinion of the learned commentators, may be therefore progressive, and is not fastened to the obsolete, but may acquire meaning as public opinion becomes enlightened by a humane justice. See Ex parte Wilson, \n114 \nU.S. 417, 427\n, 29 S. L. ed. 89, 92, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 935; Mackin v. United States, \n117 \nU.S. 348, 350\n, 29 S. L. ed. 909, 910, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 777.\n In Hobbs v. State, supra, and in other cases, prominence is given to the power of the legislature to define crimes and their punishment. We concede the power in most of its exercises. We disclaim the right to assert a judgment against that of the legislature, of the expediency of the laws, or the right to oppose the judicial power to the legislative power to define crimes and fix their punishment, unless that power encounters in its exercise a constitutional prohibition. In such case, not our discretion, but our legal duty, strictly defined and imperative in its direction, is invoked. Then the legislative power is brought to the judgment of a power superior to it for the \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 379]\n\u00a0\n instant. And for the proper exercise of such power there must be a comprehension of all that the legislature did or could take into account,- that is, a consideration of the mischief and the remedy. However, there is a certain subordination of the judiciary to the legislature. The function of the legislature is primary, its exercise fortified by presumptions of right and legality, and is not to be interfered with lightly, nor by any judicial conception of its wisdom or propriety. They have no limitation, we repeat, but constitutional ones, and what those are the judiciary must judge. We have expressed these elementary truths to avoid the misapprehension that we do not recognize to the fullest the wide range of power that the legislature possesses to adapt its penal laws to conditions as they may exist, and punish the crimes of men according to their forms and frequency. We do not intend in this opinion to express anything that contravenes those propositions.\n Our meaning may be illustrated. For instance, in Territory v. Ketchum, 10 N. M. 718, 55 L.R.A. 90, 65 Pac. 169, a case that has been brought to our attention as antagonistic to our views of cruel and unusual punishments, a statute was sustained which imposed the penalty of death upon any person who should make an assault upon any railroad train, car, or locomotive, for the purpose and with the intent to commit murder, robbery, or other felony upon a passenger or employee, express messenger or mail agent. The supreme court of the territory discussed the purpose of the 8th Amendment, and expressed views opposed to those we announce in this opinion, but finally rested its decision upon the conditions which existed in the territory, and the circumstances of terror and danger which accompanied the crime denounced. So, also, may we mention the legislation of some of the states, enlarging the common-law definition of burglary, and dividing it into degrees, fixing a severer punishment for that committed in the nighttime from that committed in the daytime, and for arson of buildings in which human beings may be from arson of buildings which may be \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 380]\n\u00a0\n vacant. In all such cases there is something more to give character and degree to the crimes then the seeking of a felonious gain, and it may properly become an element in the measure of their punishment.\n From this comment we turn back to the law in controversy. Its character and the contence in this case may be illustrated by examples even better than it can be represented by words. There are degrees of homicide that are not punished so severely, nor are the following crimes: misprision of treason, inciting rebellion, conspiracy to destroy the government by force, recruiting soldiers in the United States to fight against the United States, forgery of letters patent, forgery of bonds and other instruments for the purpose of defrauding the United States, robbery, larceny, and other crimes. Section 86 of the Penal Laws of the United States, as revised and amended by the act of Congress of March 4, 1909 (35 Stat. at L. 1088, chap. 321, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 1391), provides that any person charged with the payment of any appropriation made by Congress, who shall pay to any clerk or other employee of the United States a sum less than that provided by law, and require a receipt for a sum greater than that paid to and received by him, shall be guilty of embezzlement, and shall be fined in double the amount so withheld, and imprisoned not more than two years. The offense described has similarity to the offense for which Weems was convicted, but the punishment provided for it is in great contrast to the penalties of cadena temporal and its 'accessories.' If we turn to the legislation of the Philippine Commission we find that instead of the penalties of cadena temporal, medium degree ( fourteen years, eight months, and one day, to seventeen years and four months, with fine and 'accessories'), to cadena perpetua, fixed by the Spanish Penal Code for the falsification of bank notes and other instruments authorized by the law of the kingdom, it is provided that the forgery of or counterfeiting the obligations or securities of the United States or of the Philippine Islands shall be punished by a fine of not more than 10,000 pesos and by imprisonment of not more than \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 381]\n\u00a0\n fifteen years. In other words, the highest punishment possible for a crime which may cause the loss of many thousand of dollars, and to prevent which the duty of the state should be as eager as to prevent the perversion of truth in a public document, is not greater than that which may be imposed for falsifying a single item of a public account. And this contrast shows more than different exercises of legislative judgment. It is greater than that. It condemns the sentence in this case as cruel and unusual. It exhibits a difference between unrestrained power and that which is exercised under the spirit of constitutional limitations formed to establish justice. The state thereby suffers nothing and loses no power. The purpose of punishment is fulfilled, crime is repressed by penalties of just, not tormenting, severity, its repetition is prevented, and hope is given for the reformation of the criminal.\n It is suggested that the provision for imprisonment in the Philippine Code is separable from the accessory punishment, and that the latter may be declared illegal, leaving the former to have application. United States v. Pridgeon, \n153 U.S. 48\n, 38 L. ed. 631, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 746, is referred to. The proposition decided in that case was that 'where a court has jurisdiction of the person and of the offense, the imposition of a sentence in excess of what the law permits does not render the legal or authorized portion of the sentence void, but only leaves such portion of the sentence as may be in excess open to question and attack.' This proposition is not applicable to the case at bar. The imprisonment and the accessories were in accordance with the law. They were not in excess of it, but were positively required by it. It is provided in article 106, as we have seen, that those sentenced to cadena temporal shall labor for the benefit of the state; shall always carry a chain at the ankle, hanging from the wrist; shall be employed at hard and painful labor; shall receive no assistance whatsoever from without the penal institutions. And it is provided in article 56 that the penalty of cadena temporal shall include the accessory penalties.\n In Re Graham, \n138 U.S. 461\n, 34 L. ed. 1051, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 363, it was recognized to be 'the \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 382]\n\u00a0\n general rule that a judgment rendered by a court in a criminal case must conform strictly to the statute, and that any variation from its provisions, either in the character or the extent of punishment inflicted, renders the judgment absolutely void.' In Ex parte Karstendick, \n93 \nU.S. 396, 399\n, 23 S. L. ed. 889, 890, it was said: 'In cases where the statute makes hard labor a part of the punishment, it is imperative upon the court to include that in its sentence.' A similar view was expressed in Re Mills, \n135 \nU.S. 263, 266\n, 34 S. L. ed. 107, 108, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 762. It was recognized in United States v. Pridgeon and the cases quoted which sustained it.\n The Philippine Code unites the penalties of cadena temporal, principal and accessory, and it is not in our power to separate them, even if they are separable, unless their independence is such that we can say that their union was not made imperative by the legislature. Employers' Liability Cases (Howard v. Illinois C. R. Co.) \n207 U.S. 463\n, 52 L. ed. 297, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 141. This certainly cannot be said of the Philippine Code, as a Spanish enactment, and the order putting it into effect in the islands did not attempt to destroy the unity of its provisions or the effect of that unity. In other words, it was put into force as it existed, with all its provisions dependent. We cannot, therefore, declare them separable.\n It follows from these views that, even if the minimum penalty of cadena temporal had been imposed, it would have been repugnant to the Bill of Rights. In other words, the fault is in the law; and, as we are pointed to no other under which a sentence can be imposed, the judgment must be reversed, with directions to dismiss the proceedings.\n So ordered.\n Mr. Justice Lurton, not being a member of the court when this case was argued, took no part in its decision.\n\n Mr. Justice White, dissenting:\n The Philippine law made criminal the entry in a public record by a public official of a knowingly false statement. The \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 383]\n\u00a0\n punishment prescribed for violating this law was fine and imprisonment in a penal institution at hard and painful labor for a period ranging from twelve years and a day to twenty years, the prisoner being subjected, as accessories to the main punishment, to carrying during his imprisonment a chain at the ankle, hanging from the wrist, deprivation during the term of imprisonment of civil rights, and subjection, besides, to perpetual disqualification to enjoy political rights, hold office, etc., and, after discharge, to the surveillance of the authorities. The plaintiff in error, having been convicted of a violation of this law, was sentenced to pay a small fine and to undergo imprisonment for fifteen years, with the resulting accessory punishments above referred to. Neither at the trial in the court of first instance nor in the supreme court of the Philippine Islands was any question raised concerning the repugnancy of the statute defining the crime and fixing its punishment to the provision of the Philippine Bill of Rights, forbidding cruel and unusual punishment. Indeed, no question on that subject was even indirectly referred to in the assignments of error filed in the court below for the purpose of this writ of error. In the brief of counsel, however, in this court, the contention was made that the sentence was void, because the term of imprisonment was a cruel and unusual one, and therefore repugnant to the Bill of Rights. Deeming this contention to be of such supreme importance as to require it to be passed upon, although not raised below, the court now holds that the statute, because of the punishment which it prescribes, was repugnant to the Bill of Rights, and therefore void, and for this reason alone reverses and remands with directions to discharge.\n The Philippine Bill of Rights, which is construed and applied, is identical with the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the 8th Amendment. Because of this identity it is now decided that it is necessary to give to the Philippine Bill of Rights the meaning properly attributable to the provision on the same subject found in the 8th Amendment, as, in using the language of that Amendment in the statute, it is to be \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 384]\n\u00a0\n presumed that Congress intended to give to the words their constitutional significance. The ruling now made, therefore, is an interpretation of the 8th Amendment, and announces the limitation which that Amendment imposes on Congress when exercising its legislative authority to define and punish crime. The great importance of the decision is hence obvious.\n Of course, in every case where punishment is inflicted for the commission of crime, if the suffering of the punishment by the wrongdoer be alone regarded, the sense of compassion aroused would mislead and render the performance of judicial duty impossible. And it is to be conceded that this natural conflict between the sense of commiseration and the commands of duty is augmented when the nature of the crime defined by the Philippine law and the punishment which that law prescribes are only abstractly considered, since the impression is at once produced that the legislative authority has been severely exerted. I say only abstractly considered, because the first impression produced by the merely abstract view of the subject is met by the admonition that the duty of defining and punishing crime has never, in any civilized country, been exerted upon mere abstract considerations of the inherent nature of the crime punished, but has always involved the most practical consideration of the tendency at a particular time to commit certain crimes, of the difficulty of repressing the same, and of how far it is necessary to impose stern remedies to prevent the commission of such crimes. And, of course, as these considerations involve the necessity for a familiarity with local conditions in the Philippine Islands which I do not possess, such want of knowledge at once additionally admonishes me of the wrong to arise from forming a judgment upon insufficient data, or without a knowledge of the subject-matter upon which the judgment is to be exerted. Strength, indeed, is added to this last suggestion by the fact that no question concerning the subject was raised in the courts below or there considered; and therefore no opportunity was afforded those courts, presumably, at least, relatively familiar with the local \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 385]\n\u00a0\n conditions, to express their views as to the considerations which may have led to the prescribing of the punishment in question. Turning aside, therefore, from mere emotional tendencies, and guiding my judgment alone by the aid of the reason at my command, I am unable to agree with the ruling of the court. As, in my opinion, that ruling rests upon an interpretation of the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the 8th Amendment, naver before announced, which is repugnant to the natural import of the language employed in the clause, and which interpretation curtails the legislative power of Congress to defind and punish crime by asserting a right of judicial supervision over the exertion of that power, in disregard of the distincition between the legislative and judicial department of the government, I deem it my duty to dissent and state my reasons.\n To perform this duty requires at the outset a precise statement of the construction given by the ruling now made to the provision of the 8th Amendment. My inability to do this must, however, be confessed, because I find it impossible to fix with precision the meaning which the court gives to that provision. Not for the purpose of criticizing, but solely in order to indicate my perplexity on the subject, the reasons for my doubt are briefly given. Thus, to my mind, it appears as follows: First. That the court interprets the inhibition against cruel and unusual punishment as imposing upon Congress the duty of proportioning punishment according to the nature of the crime, and casts upon the judiciary the duty of determining whether punishments have been properly apportioned in a particular statute, and if not, to decline to enforce it. This seems to me to be the case, because of the reference made by the court to the harshness of the principal punishment (imprisonment), and its comments as to what it deems to be the severity, if not inhumanity, of the accessories which result from or accompany it, and the declaration in substance that these things offend against the just principle of proportioning punishment to the nature of the crime punished, stated to be a \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 386]\n\u00a0\n fundamental precept of justice and of American criminal law. That this is the view now upheld, it seems to me, is additionally demonstrated by the fact that the punishment for the crime in question, as imposed by the Philippine law, is compared with other Philippine punishments for crimes deemed to be less heinous, and the conclusion is deduced that this fact, in and of itself, serves to establish that the punishment imposed in this case is an exertion of unrestrained power, condemned by the cruel and unusual punishment clause.\n Second. That this duty of apportionment compels not only that the lawmaking power should adequately apportion punishment for the crimes as to which it legislates, but also further exacts that the performance of the duty of apportionment must be discharged by taking into view the standards, whether lenient or severe, existing in other and distinct jurisdictions; and that a failure to do so authorizes the courts to consider such standards in their discretion, and judge of the validity of the law accordingly. I say this because, although the court expressly declares in the opinion, when considering a case decided by the highest court of one of the territories of the United States, that the legislative power to define and punish crime committed in a territory, for the purpose of the 8th Amendment, is separate and distinct from the legislation of Congress, yet, in testing the validity of the punishment affixed by the law here in question, proceeds to measure it not alone by the Philippine legislation, but by the provisions of several acts of Congress punishing crime, and in substance declares such congressional laws to be a proper standard, and in effect holds that the greater proportionate punishment inflicted by the Philippine law over the more lenient punishments prescribed in the laws of Congress establishes that the Philippine law is repugnant to the 8th Amendment.\n Third. That the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the 8th Amendment controls not only the exertion of legislative power as to modes of punishment, proportionate or otherwise, but addresses itself also to the mainspring of the \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 387]\n\u00a0\n legislative motives in enacting legislation punishing crime in a particular case, and therefore confers upon courts the power to refuse to enforce a particular law defining and punishing crime, if, in their opinion, such law does not manifest that the lawmaking power, in fixing the punishment, was sufficiently impelled by a purpose to effect a frformation of the criminal. This is said because of the statements contained in the opinion of the court as to the legislative duty to shape legislation not only with a view to punish, but to reform the criminal, and the inferences which I deduce that it is conceived that the failure to do so is a violation of constitutional duty.\n Fourth. That the cruel and unusual punishment clause does not merely limit the legislative power to fix the punishment for crime by excepting out of that authority the right to impose bodily punishments of a cruel kind, in the strict acceptation of those terms, but limits the legislative discretion in determining to what degree of severity an appropriate and usual mode of punishment may, in a particular case, be inflicted; and therefore endows the courts with the right to supervise the exercise of legislative discretion as to the adequacy of punishment, even although resort is had only to authorized kinds of punishment, thereby endowing the courts with the power to refuse to enforce laws punishing crime, if, in the judicial judgment, the legislative branch of the government has prescribed a too severe punishment.\n Not being able to assent to these, as it to me seems, in some respects conflicting, or, at all events, widely divergent, propositions, I shall consider them all as sanctioned by the interpretation now given to the prohibition of the 8th Amendment, and with this conception in mind shall consider the subject.\n Before approaching the text of the 8th Amendment to determine its true meaning, let me briefly point out why, in my opinion, it cannot have the significance which it must receive to sustain the propositions rested upon it. In the first place, if it be that the lawmaker, in defining and punishing crime, is imperatively restrained by constitutional provisions to apportion \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 388]\n\u00a0\n punishment by a consideration alone of the abstract heinousness of the offenses punished, it must result that the power is so circumscribed as to be impossible of execution; or, at all events, is so restricted as to exclude the possibility of taking into account, in defining and punishing crime, all those considerations concerning the condition of society, the tendency to commit the particular crime, the difficulty of detecting the same, the necessity for resorting to stern measures of repression, and various other subjects which have, at all times, been deemed essential to be weighed in defining and punishing crime. And certainly the paralysis of the discretion vested in the lawmaking authority which the propositions accomplish is immeasurably magnified when it is considered that this duty of proportioning punishment requires the taking into account of the standards prevailing in other or different countries or jurisdictions, thereby at once exacting that legislation on the subject of crime must be proportioned not to the conditions to which it is intended to apply, but must be based upon conditions with which the legislation, when enacted, will have no relation or concern whatever. And when it is considered that the propositions go further, and insist that, if the legislation seems to the judicial mind not to have been sufficiently impelled by motives of reformation of the criminal, such legislation defining and punishing crime is to be held repugnant to constitutional limitations, the impotency of the legislative power to define and punish crime is made manifest. When to this result is added the consideration that the interpretation, by its necessary effect, does not simply cause the cruel and unusual punishment clause to carve out of the domain of legislative authority the power to resort to prohibited kinds of punishments, but subjects to judicial control the degree of severity with which authorized modes of punishment may be inflicted, it seems to me that the demonstration is conclusive that nothing will be left of the independent legislative power to punish and define crime, if the interpretation now made be pushed in future application to its logical conclusion. \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 389]\n\u00a0\n But let me come to the 8th Amendment, for the purpose of stating why the clause in question does not, in my opinion, authorize the deductions drawn from it, and therefore does not sanction the ruling now made.\n I shall consider the Amendment (a) as to its origin in the mother country, and the meaning there given to it prior to the American Revolution; (b) its migration and existence in the states after the Revolution, and prior to the adoption of the Constitution; (c) its incorporation into the Constitution, and the construction given to it in practice from the beginning to this time; and (d) the judicial interpretation which it has received, associated with the construction affixed, both in practice and judicially, to the same provision found in various state constitutions or Bills of Rights.\n Without going into unnecessary historical detail, it is sufficient to point out, as did the court in Re Kemmler, \n136 \nU.S. 436, 446\n, 34 S. L. ed. 519, 524, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 930, 933, that 'the provision in reference to cruel and unusual punishments was taken from the well-known act of Parliament of 1688 [1689?], entitled 'An Act Declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Subject, and Settling the Succession of the Crown.\" And this act, it is to be observed, was but in regular form a crystallization of the Declaration of Rights of the same year. 3 Hallam, Const. Hist. p. 106. It is also certain, as declared in the Kemmler Case, that 'this Declaration of Rights had reference to the acts of the executive and judicial departments of the government of England,' since it but embodied the grievances which it was deemed had been suffered by the usurpations of the Crown and transgressions of authority by the courts. In the recitals both of the Declaration of Rights and the Bill of Rights, the grievances complained of were that illegal and cruel punishments had been inflicted, 'which are utterly and directly contrary to the known laws and statutes and freedom of this realm;' while in both the Declaration and the Bill of Rights the remedy formulated was a declaration against the infliction of cruel and unusual punishments.\n Whatever may be the difficulty, if any, in fixing the mean- \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 390]\n\u00a0\n ing of the prohibition at its origin, it may not be doubted, and indeed is not questioned by anyone, that the cruel punishments against which the Bill of Rights provided were the atrocious, sanguinary, and inhuman punishments which had been inflicted in the past upon the persons of criminals. This being certain, the difficulty of interpretation, if any, is involved in determining what was intended by the unusual punishments referred to and which were provided against. Light, however, on this subject, is at once afforded by observing that the unusual punishments provided against were responsive to and obviously considered to be the illegal punishments complained of. These complaints were, first, that customary modes of bodily punishments, such as whipping and the pillory, had, under the exercise of judicial discretion, been applied to so unusual a degree as to cause them to be illegal; and, second, that in some cases an authority to sentence to perpetual imprisonment had been exerted under the assumption that power to do so resulted from the existence of judicial discretion to sentence to imprisonment, when it was unusual, and therefore illegal, to inflict life imprisonment in the absence of express legislative authority. In other words, the prohibitions, although conjunctively stated, were really disjunctive, and embraced braced as follows: (a) Prohibitions against a resort to the inhuman bodily punishments of the past; (b) or, where certain bodily punishments were customary, a prohibition against their infliction to such an extent as to be unusual and consequently illegal; (c) or the infliction, under the assumption of the exercise of judicial discretion, of unusual punishments not bodily, which could not be imposed except by express statute, or which were wholly beyond the jurisdiction of the court to impose.\n The scope and power of the guaranty as we have thus stated it will be found portrayed in the reasons assigned by the members of the House of Lords who dissented against two judgments for perjury entered in the King's bench against Titus Oates. 10 How. St. Tr. col. 1325. \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 391]\n\u00a0\n The judgments and the dissenting reasons are copied in the margin. \n As well the dissent feferred to as the report of the conferees\n Judgment against Titus Oates upon conviction upon two indictments for perjury, as announced by the court (10 How. St. Tr. cols. 1316, 1317):\n'First, The court does order for a fine that you pay 1,000 marks upon each Indictment.\n\n\"Secondly, That you be stript of all your Canonical Habits.\n\n\"Thirdly, The Court does award, That you do stand upon the Pillory, and in the Pillory, here before Westminster-hall gate, upon Monday next, for an hour's time, between the hours of 10 and 12; with a paper over your head (which you must first walk with round about to all the Courts in Westminster-hall) declaring your crime.' And that is upon the first indictment.\n\n\"Fourthly (on the Second Indictment), upon Tuesday, you shall stand upon, and in the Pillory, at the Royal Exchange in London, for the space of an hour, between the hours of 12 and 2; with the same inscription.\n\n\"You shall upon the next Wednesday be whipped from Aldgate to Newgate.\n\n\"Upon Friday, you shall be whipped from Newgate to Tyburn, by the hands of the common hangman.'\n\n'But, Mr. Oates, we cannot but remember, there were several particular times you swore false about; and therefore, as annual commemorations, that it may be known to all people as long as you live, we have taken special care of you for an annual punishment.\n\n\"Upon the 24th of April every year, as long as you live, you are to stand upon the Pillory and in the Pillory, at Tyburn, just opposite to the gallows, for the space of an hour, between the hours of 10 and 12.\n\n\"You are to stand upon, and in the Pillory, here at Westminster-hall gate, every 9th of August, in every year, so long as you live. And that it may be known what we mean by it, 'tis to remember, what he swore about Mr. Ireland's being in town between the 8th and 12th of August.\n\n\"You are to stand upon, and in the Pillory, at Charing-cross, on the 10th of August, every year, during your life, for an hour, between 10 and 12.\n\n\"The like over against the Temple gate, upon the 11th.\n\n\"And upon the 2d of September (which is another notorious time, which you cannot but be remember'd of) you are to stand upon, and in the Pillory, for the space of one hour, between 12 and 2, at the Royal Exchange; and all this you are to do every year, during your life; and to be committed close prisoner, as long as you live.\"\n\n Dissenting statement of a minority of the House of Lords: \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 392]\n\u00a0\n on the part of the House of Commons, made to that body concerning a bill to set aside the judgments against Oates above referred to (5 Cobbett's Parl. History, col. 386), proceeded upon the identity of what was deemed to be the illegal practices complained of, and which were intended to be rectified by the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments, \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 393]\n\u00a0\n made in the Declaration of Rights, and treated that prohibition, as already stated, as substantially disjunctive, and as forbidding the doing of the things we have above enumerated. See, for the disjunctive character of the provision, Stephen, Com. Law Eng. 15th ed. p. 379.\n When the origin and purpose of the Declaration and the Bill of Rights is thus fixed it becomes clear that that Declaration is not susceptible of the meaning now attributed to the same language found in the Constitution of the United States. That in England it was nowhere deemed that any theory of proportional punishment was suggested by the Bill of Rights, or that a protest was thereby intended against the severity of punishments, speaking generally, is demonstrated by the practice which prevailed in England as to punishing crime from the time of the Bill of Rights to the time of the American Revolution. Speaking on this subject, Stephen, in his history of the criminal law of England, vol. 1, pp. 470, 471, says:\n'The severity of the criminal law was greatly increased all through the eighteenth century by the creation of new felonies without benefit of clergy. . . . However, after making all deductions on these grounds, there can be no doubt that the legislation of the eighteenth century in criminal matters was severe to the highest degree, and destitute of any sort of principal or system.'\n\n For the sake of brevity a review of the practises which prevailed in the colonial period will not be referred to. Therefore, attention is at once directed to the express guaranties in certain of the state constitutions adopted after the Declaration of Independence, and prior to the formation of the Constitution of the United States, and the circumstances connected with the subsequent adoption of the 8th Amendment.\n In 1776, Maryland, in a Bill of Rights, declared (1 Cahrters and Constitutions, pp. 818, 819):\n'14. That sanguinary laws ought to be avoided, as far as is consistent with the safety of the state; and no law to inflict \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 394]\n\u00a0\n cruel and unusual pains and penalties ought to be made in any case, or at any time hereafter.'\n\n'22. That excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel or unusual punishments inflicted, by the courts of law.'\n\n The Constitution of North Carolina of 1776, in general terms prohibited the infliction of 'cruel or unusual punishments.'\n Virginia, by  9 of the Bill of Rights adopted in 1776, provided as follows:\n'That excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.'\n\n In the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights of 1780, a direct prohibition was placed upon the infliction by magistrates or courts of cruel or unusual punishments, the provision being as follows:\n'Art. 26. No magistrate or court of law shall demand excessive bail or sureties, impose excessive fines, or inflict cruel or unusual punishments.'\n\n The Declaration of Rights of New Hampshire, of 1784, was as follows:\n'18. All penalties ought to be proportioned to the nature of the offense. No wise legislature will affix the same punishment to the crimes of theft, forgery, and the like, which they do to those of murder and treason; where the same undistinguishing severity is exerted against all offense the people are led to forget the real distinction in the crimes themselves, and to commit the most flagrant with as little compunction as they do those of the lightest dye. For the same reason a multitude of sanguinary laws is both impolitic and unjust. The true design of all punishments being to reform, not to exterminate, mankind.'\n\n'33. No magistrate or court of law shall demand excessive bail or sureties, impose excessive fines, or inflict cruel or unusual punishments.'\n\n The substantial identity between the provisions of these several constitutions or Bills of Rights shows beyond doubt that \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 395]\n\u00a0\n their meaning was understood; that is to say, that the significance attributed to them in the mother country as the result of the Bill of Rights of 1689 was appreciated, and that it was intended, in using the identical words, to give them the same well-understood meaning. It is to be observed that the New Hampshire Bill of Rights contains a clause admonishing as to the wisdom of the apportionment of punishment of crime according to the nature of the offense, but in marked contrast to the re- enactment, in express and positive terms, of the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the English Bill of Rights, the provision as to apportionment is merely advisory, additionally demonstrating the precise and accurate conception then entertained of the nature and character of the prohibition adopted from the English Bill of Rights.\n Undoubtedly, in the American states, prior to the formation of the Constitution, the necessity for the protection afforded by the cruel and unusual punishment guaranty of the English Bill of Rights had ceased to be a matter of concern, because, as a rule, the cruel bodily punishments of former times were no longer imposed, and judges, where moderate bodily punishment was usual, had not, under the guise of discretion, directed the infliction of such punishments to so unusual a degree as to transcend the limits of discretion and cause the punishment to he illegal, and had also not attempted, in virtue of mere discretion, to inflict such unusual and extreme punishments as had always been deemed proper to be inflicted only as the result of express statutory authority. Despite these considerations, it is true that some of the solicitude which arose after the submission of the Constitution for ratification, and which threatened to delay or prevent such ratification, in part, at least, was occasioned by the failure to guarantee against the infliction of cruel and unusual punishments. Thus, in the Massachusetts convention, Mr. Holmes, discussing the general result of the judicial powers conferred by the Constitution, and referring to the right of Congress to define and fix the punishment for crime, said (2 Elliot, Debates, 111): \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 396]\n\u00a0\n 'They are nowhere restrained from inventing the most cruel and unheared-of punishments, and annexing them to crimes; and there is no constitutional check on them, but that racks and gibbets may be amongst the most mild instruments of their discipline.'\n That the opposition to the ratification in the Virginia convention was earnestly and eloquently voiced by Patrick Henry is too well known to require anything but statement. That the absence of a guaranty against cruel and unusual punishment was one of the causes of the solicitude by which Henry was possessed is shown by the debates in that convention. Thus Patrick Henry said (3 Elliot, Debates, 447):\n'In this business of legislation, your members of Congress will lose the restriction of not imposing excessive fines, demanding excessive bail, and inflicting cruel and unusual punishments. These are prohibited by your Declaration of Rights. What has distinguished our ancestors? That they would not admit of tortures, or cruel and barbarous punishment. But Congress may introduce the practice of the civil law, in preference to that of the common law. They may introduce the practice of France, Spain, and Germany,-of torturing to extort a confession of the crime. They will say that they might as well draw examples from those countries as from Great Britain, and they will tell you that there is such a necessity of strengthening the arm of government that they must have a criminal equity, and extort confession by torture, in order to punish with still more relentless severity. We are then lost and undone. And can any man think it troublesome when he can, by a small interference, prevent our rights from being lost? If you will, like the Virginian government, give them knowledge of the extent of the rights retained by the people, and the powers of themselves, they will, if they be honest men, thank you for it. Will they not wish to go on sure grounds? But, if you leave them otherwise, they will not know how to proceed; and, being in a state of uncertainty, they will assume rather than give up powers by implication.' \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 397]\n\u00a0\n These observations, it is plainly to be\n\n These observations, it is plainly to be seen, were addressed to the fear of the repetition, either by the sanction of law or by the practice of courts, of the barbarous modes of bodily punishment or torture, the protest against which was embodied in the Bill of Rights in 1689\n\n\n The ultimate recognition by Henry of the patriotic duty to ratify the Constitution and trust to the subsequent adoption of a Bill of Rights, the submission and adoption of the first ten Amendments as a Bill of Rights, which followed ratification, the connection of Mr. Madison with the drafting of the amendments, and the fact that the 8th Amendment is in the precise words of the guaranty on that subject in the Virginia Bill of Rights, would seem to make it perfectly clear that it was only intended by that Amendment to remedy the wrongs which had been provided against in the English Bill of Rights, and which were likewise provided against in the Virginia provision, and therefore was intended to guard against the evils so vividly portrayed by Henry in the debate which we have quoted. That this was the common understanding which must have existed on the subject is plainly to be inferred from the fact that the 8th Amendment was substantially submitted by Congress without any debate on the subject. 2 Lloyd's Debates, 225. Of course, in view of the nature and character of the government which the Constitution called into being, the incorporation of the 8th Amendment caused its provisions to operate a direct and controlling prohibition upon the legislative branch (as well as all other departments), restraining it from authorizing or directing the infliction of the cruel bodily punishments of the past, which was one of the evils sought to be prevented for the future by the English Bill of Rights, and also restrained the courts from exerting and Congress from empowering them, to select and exert by way of discretion modes of punishment which were not usual, or usual modes of punishment to a degree not usual, and which could alone be imposed by express authority of law. But this obvious result lends no \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 398]\n\u00a0\n support to the theory that the adoption of the Amendment operated or was intended to prevent the legislative branch of the government from prescribing, according to its conception of what public policy required, such punishments, severe or otherwise, as it deemed necessary for the prevention of crime, provided, only, resort was not had to the infliction of bodily punishments of a cruel and barbarous character, against which the Amendment expressly provided. Not to so conclude is to hold that because the Amendment, in addition to depriving the lawmaking power of the right to authorize the infliction of cruel bodily punishments, had restricted the courts, where discretion was possessed by them, from exerting the power to punish by a mode or in a manner so unusual as to require legislative sanction, it thereby deprived Congress of the power to sanction the punishments which the Amendment forbade being imposed, merely because they were not sanctioned. In other words, that because the power was denied to the judiciary to do certain things without legislative authority, thereby the right on the part of the legislature to confer the authority was taken away. And this impossible conclusion would lead to the equally impossible result that the effect of the Amendment was to deprive Congress of its legitimate authority to punish crime, by prescribing such modes of punishment, even although not before employed, as were appropriate for the purpose.\n That no such meaning as is now ascribed to the Amendment was attributed to it at the time of its adoption is shown by the fact that not a single suggestion that it had such a meaning is pointed to, and that, on the other hand, the practice from the very beginning shows directly to the contrary, and demonstrates that the very Congress that adopted the Amendment construed it in practice as I have construed it. This is so, since the first crimes act of the United States prescribed punishments for crime utterly without reference to any assumed rule of proportion, or of a conception of a right in the judiciary to supervise the action of Congress in respect to \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 399]\n\u00a0\n the severity of punishment, excluding, always, the right to impose as a punishment the cruel bodily punishments which were prohibited. What clearer demonstration can there be of this than the statement made by this court in Ex parte Wilson, \n114 U.S. 427\n, 29 L. ed. 92, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 935, of the nature of the first crimes act, as follows:\n'By the first crimes act of the United States, forgery of public securities, or knowingly uttering forged public securities with intent to defraud, as well as treason, murder, piracy, mutiny, robbery, or rescue of a person convicted of a capital crime, was punishable with death; most other offenses were punished by fine and imprisonment; whipping was part of the punishment of stealing or falsifying records, fraudulently acknowledging bail, larceny of goods, or receiving stolen goods; disqualification to hold office was part of the punishment of bribery; and those convicted of perjury or subornation of perjury, besides being fined and imprisoned, were to stand in the pillory for one hour, and rendered incapable of testifying in any court of the United States. Act of April 30, 1790, chap. 9, 1 Stat. at L. 112-117; Mr. Justice Wilson's Charge to the Grand Jury in 1791, 3 Wilson's Works, 380, 381.'\n\n And it is, I think, beyond power even of question that the legislation of Congress, from the date of the first crimes act to the present time, but exemplifies the truth of what has been said, since that legislation from time to time altered modes of punishment, increasing or diminishing the amount of punishment, as was deemed necessary for the public good, prescribing punishments of a new character, without reference to any assumed rule of apportionment, or the conception that a right of judicial supervision was deemed to obtain. It is impossible with any regard for brevity to demonstrate these statements by many illustrations. But let me give a sample from legislation enacted by Congress of the change of punishment. By  14 of the first crimes act (Act April 30, 1790, chap. 9, 1 Stat. at L. 115), forgery, etc., of the public securities of the United States, or the knowingly ut- \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 400]\n\u00a0\n tering and offering for sale of forged or counterfeited securities of the United States with intent to defraud, was made punishable by death. The punishment now is a fine of not more than $5,000, and imprisonment at hard labor for not more than fifteen years. Rev. Stat.  5414, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3662.\n By the first crimes act, also, as in numerous others since that time, various additional punishments for the commission of crime were imposed, prescribing disqualification to hold office, to be a witness in the courts, etc., and as late as 1865 a law was enacted by Congress which prescribed as a punishment for crime the disqualification to enjoy rights of citizenship. Rev. Stat.  1996-1998, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1269.\n Comprehensively looking at the rulings of this court, it may be conceded that hitherto they have not definitely interpreted the precise meaning of the clause in question, because in most of the cases in which the protection of the Amendment has been invoked, the cases came from courts of last resorts of states, and the opinions leave room for the contention that they proceeded upon the implied assumption that the 8th Amendment did not govern the states, by virtue of the adoption of the 14th Amendment. However, in Wilkerson v. Utah, \n99 U.S. 130\n, 25 L. ed. 345, a case coming to this court from the territory of Utah, the meaning of the clause of the 8th Amendment in question came directly under review. The question for decision was whether a sentence to death by shooting, which had been imposed by the court under the assumed exercise of a discretionary power to fix the mode of execution of the sentence, was repugnant to the clause. While the court, in deciding that it was not, did not undertake to fully interpret the meaning of the clause, it nevertheless, reasoning by exclusion, expressly negatived the construction now placed upon it. It was said (pp. 135, 136):\n Pervear v. Massachusetts, 5 Wall. 475, 18 L. ed. 608; Wilkerson v. Utah, \n99 U.S. 130\n, 25 L. ed. 345; Re Kemmler, \n136 U.S. 436\n, 34 L. ed. 519, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 930; McElvaine v. Brush, \n142 U.S. 155\n, 35 L. ed. 971, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 156; Howard v. Fleming, \n191 U.S. 126\n, 48 L. ed. 121, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 49. \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 401]\n\u00a0\n 'Difficulty would attend the effort to define with exactness the extent of the constitutional provision which provides that cruel and unusual punishments shall not be inflicted; but it is safe to affirm that punishments of torture, such as those mentioned by the commentator referred to, and all others in the same line of unnecessary cruelty, are forbidden by that Amendment to the Constitution. Cooley, Const. Lim. 4th ed. 408; Wharton, Crim. Law, 7th ed.  3405.'\n And it was doubtless this ruling which caused the court subsequently to say in Re Kemmler, \n136 \nU.S. 436, 447\n, 34 S. L. ed. 519, 524, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 930, 933:\n'Punishments are cruel when they involve torture or a lingering death; but the punishment of death is not cruel, within the meaning of that word as used in the Constitution. It implies there something inhuman and barbarous, something more than the mere extinguishment of life.'\n\n Generally viewing the action of the states in their Bills of Rights as to the prohibition against inhuman or cruel and unusual punishments, it is true to say that those provisions substantially conform to the English Bill of Rights and to the provision of the 8th Amendment we are considering, some using the expression 'cruel and unusual,' others the more accurate expression 'cruel or unusual,' and some 'cruel' only; and in a few instances a provision requiring punishments to be proportioned to the nature of the offense is added to the inhibition against cruel and unusual punishments. In one (Illinois) the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments is not expressed, although proportional punishment is commanded; yet in Kelly v. State, 115 Ill. 583, 56 Am. Rep. 184, 4 N. E. 644, discussing the extent of punishment inflicted by a criminal statute, the supreme court of Illinois declared that 'it would not be for the court to say the penalty was not proportioned to the nature of the offense.' In another state (Ohio), where, in the early constitution of the state, proportionate punishment was conjoined with the cruel and unusual punishment provision, the proportionate provision was omitted in a later constitution. \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 402]\n\u00a0\n Here, again, it is true to say, time forbidding my indulging in a review of the statutes, that the legislation of all the states is absolutely in conflict with and repugnant to the construction now given to the clause, since that legislation but exemplifies the exertion of legislative power to define and punish crime according to the legislative conception of the necessities of the situation, without the slightest indication of the assumed duty to proportion punishments, and without the suggestion of the existence of judicial power to control the legislative discretion, provided only that the cruel bodily punishments forbidden were not resorted to. And the decisions of the state courts of last resort, it seems to me, with absolute uniformity, and without a single exception from the beginning, proceed upon this conception. It is true that when the reasoning employed in the various cases in critically examined, a difference of conception will be manifested as to the occasion for the adoption of the English Bill of Rights and of the remedy which it provided. Generally speaking, when carefully analyzed, it will be seen that this difference was occasioned by treating the provision against cruel and unusual punishment as conjunctive instead of disjunctive, thereby overlooking the fact, which I think has been previously demonstrated to be the case, that the term 'unusual,' as used in the clause, was not a qualification of the provision against cruel punishments, but was simply synonymous with illegal, and was mainly intended to restrain the courts, under the guise of discretion, from indulging in an unusual and consequently illegal exertion of power. Certain it is, however, whatever may be these differences of reasoning, there stands out in bold relief in the state cases, as it is given to me to understand them, without a single exception, the clear and certain exclusion of any prohibition upon the lawmaking power to determine the adequacy with which crime shall be punished, provided only the cruel bodily punishments of the past are not resorted to. Let me briefly refer to some of the cases. \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 403]\n\u00a0\n In Aldridge v. Com. 2 Va. Cas. 447, decided about twenty years after the ratification of the 8th Amendment, speaking concerning the evils to which the guaranty of the Virginia Bill of Rights against cruel and unusual punishments was addressed, the court, after referring to the punishments usually applicable in that state to crime at the time of the adoption of the Bill of Rights of Virginia, said (p. 450):\n'We consider these sanctions as sufficiently rigorous, and we knew that the best heads and hearts of the land of our ancestors had long and loudly declaimed against the wanton cruelty of many of the punishments practised in other countries; and this section in the Bill of Rights was framed effectually to exclude these, so that no future legislature, in a moment, perhaps, of great and general excitement, should be tempted to disgrace our Code by the introduction of any of those odious modes of punishment.'\n\n And, four years later, in 1828, applying the same dectrine in Com. v. Wyatt, 6 Rand. (Va.) 694, where a punishment by whipping was challenged as contrary to the Virginia Bill of Rights, the court said (p. 700): 'The punishment of offenses by stripes is certainly odius, but cannot be said to be unusual.'\n Until 1865 there was no provision in the Constitution of Georgia expressly guaranteeing against cruel and unusual punishments. The Constitution of that year, however, contained a clause identical in terms with the 8th Amendment, and the scope of the guaranty arose for decision in 1872 in Whitten v. State, 47 Ga. 297. The case was this: Upon a conviction for assault and battery, Whitten had been sentenced to imprisonment or the payment of a fine of $250 and costs. The contention was that this sentence was so disproportionate to the offense committed as to be cruel and unusual and repugnant to the guaranty. In one of its immediate aspects the case involved the guaranty against excessive fines; but, as the imprisonment was the coercive means for the payment of the fine, in that aspect the case \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 404]\n\u00a0\n involved the cruel and unusual punishment clause, and the court so considered; and, in coming to interpret the clause, said (p. 301):\n'Whether the law is unconstitutional, a violation of that article of the Constitution which declares excessive fines shall not be imposed nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted, is another question. The latter clause was, doubtless, intended to prohibit the barbarities of quartering, hanging in chains, castration, etc. When adopted by the framers of the Constitution of the United States, larceny was generally punished by hanging; forgeries, burglaries, ete., in the same way; for, be it remembered, penitentiaries are of modern origin, and I doubt if it ever entered into the mind of men of that day that a crime such as this witness makes the defendant guilty of deserved a less penalty than the judge has inflicted. It would be an interference with matters left by the Constitution to the legislative department of the government for us to undertake to weigh the propriety of this or that penalty fixed by the legislature for specific offenses. So long as they do not provide cruel and unusual punishments, such as disgraced the civilization of former ages, and made one shudder with horror to read of them, as drawing, quartering, burning, etc., the Constitution does not put any limit upon legislative discretion.'\n\n In State v. White (1890) 44 Kan. 514, 25 Pac. 33, it was sought to reverse a sentence of five years' imprisonment in the penitentiary, imposed upon a boy of sixteen for statutory rape. The girl was aged sixteen, and had consented. It was contended that if the statute applied, it was unconstitutional and void, 'for the reason that it conflicts with  9 of the Bill of Rights, because it inflicts cruel and unusual punishment, and is in conflict with the spirit of the Bill of Rights generally, and is in violation of common sense, common reason, and common justice.'\n The court severely criticized the statute. After deciding that the offense was embraced in the statute, the court said: \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 405]\n\u00a0\n 'With respect to the severity of the punishment, while we think it is true that is is a severer one than has ever before been provided for in any other state or country for such an offense, yet we cannot say that the statute is void for that reason. Imprisonment in the penitentiary at hard labor is not of itself a cruel or unusual punishment, within the meaning of  9 of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution, for it is a kind of punishment which has been resorted to ever since Kansas has had any existence, and is a kind of punishment common in all civilized countries. That section of the Constitution probably, however, relates to the kind of punishment to be inflicted, and not to its duration. Although the punishment in this case may be considered severe, and much severer, indeed, than the punishment for offenses of much greater magnitude, as adultery, or sexual intercourse coupled with seduction, yet we cannot say that the act providing for it is unconstitutional or void.'\n In State v. Hogan (1900) 63 Ohio St. 218, 52 L.R.A. 863, 81 Am. St. Rep. 626, 58 N. E. 572, the court sustained a 'tramp law,' which prescribed as the punishment to be imposed on a tramp for threatening to do injury to the person of another, imprisonment in the penintentiary not more than three years nor less than one year. In the course of the opinion the court said:\n'The objection that the act prescribes a cruel and unusual punishment we think not well taken. Imprisonment at hard labor is neither cruel nor unusual. It may be severe in the given instance, but that is a question for the law-making power. Re Kemmler, \n136 U.S. 436\n, 34 L. ed. 519, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 930; Cornelison v. Com. 84 Ky. 583, 2 S. W. 235. The punishment, to be effective, should be such as will prove a deterrent. The tramp cares nothing for a jail sentence. Often he courts it. A workhouse sentence is less welcome, but there are but few workhouses in the state. A penitentiary sentence is a real punishment. There he has to work, and cannot shirk.'\n\n In Minnesota a register of deeds was convicted of misappropriating the sum of $62.50, which should have been turned \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 406]\n\u00a0\n over by him to the county treasurer. He was sentenced to pay a fine of $ 500 and be imprisoned at hard labor for one year. The contention that the sentence was repugnant to the state constitutional guaranty against cruel and unusual punishment was considered and disposed of by the court in State v. Borgstrom, 69 Minn. 508, 72 N. W. 799, 975. Among other things the court said:\n'It is claimed that the sentence imposed was altogether disproportionate to the offense charged, and of which the defendant was convicted, and comes within the inhibition of Const. art. 1,  5, that no cruel or unusual punishments be inflicted. . . . We are not unmindful of the importance of this question, and have given to it that serious and thorough examination which such importance demands. . . . In England there was a time when punishment was by torture, by loading him with weights to make him confess. Traitors were condemned to be drowned, disemboweled, or burned. It was the law 'that the offender shall be drawn, or rather dragged, to the gallows; he shall be hanged and cut down alive; his entrails shall be removed and burned while he yet lives; his head shall be decapitated; his body divided into four parts.' Browne, Bl. Com. 617. For certain other offenses the offender was punished by cutting off the hands or ears, or boiling in oil, or putting in the pillory. By the Roman law a parricide was punished by being sewed up in a leather sack with a live dog, a cock, a viper, and an ape, and cast into the sea. These punishments may properly be termed cruel, but happily the more humane spirit of this nation does not permit such punishments to be inflicted upon criminals. Such punishments are not warranted by the laws of nature or society, and we find that they are prohibited by our Constitution. But, within this limitation or restriction, the legislature is ordinarily the judge of the expediency of creating new crimes and of prescribing the penalty. . . . While the amount of money misappropriated in this instance was not great, the legislature evidently had in mind the fact that the misappropriation by a \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 407]\n\u00a0\n public official of the public money was destructive of the public rights and the stability of our government. But fine and imprisonment are not ordinarily cruel and unusual punishments.'\n\n In Territory v. Ketchum, 10 N. M. 721, 55 L.R.A. 90, 65 Pac. 169, the court considered whether a statute which had recently been put in force, and which imposed the death penalty instead of a former punishment of imprisonment, for an attempt at train robbery, was cruel and unusual. In sustaining the validity of the law, the court pointed out the conditions of society which presumably had led the lawmaking power to fix the stern penalty, and after a lengthy discussion of the subject it was held that the law did not impose punishment which was cruel or unusual.\n The cases just reviewed are typical, and I therefore content myself with noting in the margin many others to the same general effect. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n In stating, as I have done, that, in my opinion, no case could be found sustaining the proposition which the court now \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 408]\n\u00a0\n holds, I am, of course, not unmindful that a North Carolina case (State v. Driver, 78 N. C. 423) is cited by the court as authority, and that a Louisiana case (State ex rel. Garvey v. Whitaker, 48 La. Ann. 527, 35 L.R. A. 561, 19 So. 457) is sometimes referred to as of the same general tenor. A brief analysis of the Driver Case will indicate why, in my opinion, it does not support the contention based upon it. In that case the accused was convicted of assault and battery, and sentenced to imprisonment for five years in the county jail. The offense was a common-law misdemeanor, and the punishment not being fixed by statute, as observed by the court ( page 429), was left to the discretion of the judge. In testing whether the term of the sentence was unusual and therefore illegal, the court held that a long term of imprisonment in the county jail was unlawful because unusual, and was a gross abuse by the lower court of its discretion. Although the court made reference to the constitutional guaranty, there is not the slightest indication in its opinion that it was deemed there would have been power to set aside the sentence had it been inflicted by virtue of an express statutory command. But this aside, it seems to me, as the test applied in the Driver Case to determine what was an unusual punishment in North Carolina was necessarily so local in character, that it affords no possible ground here for giving an erroneous meaning to the 8th Amendment. I say this because an examination of the opinion will disclose that it proceeded upon a consideration of the disadvantages peculiar to an imprisonment in a county jail in North Carolina, as compared with the greater advantages to arise from the imprisonment for a like term in the penitentiary, the court saying:\n'Now, it is true, our terms of imprisonment are much longer, but they are in the penitentiary, where a man may live and be made useful; but a county jail is a close prison, where life is soon in jeopardy, and where the prisoner is not only useless, but a heavy public expense.'\n\n As to the Louisiana case, I content myself with saying that it, in substance, involved merely the question of error committed \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 409]\n\u00a0\n by a magistrate in imposing punishment for many offenses when, under the law, the offense was a continuing and single one.\n From all the considerations which have been stated, I can deduce no ground whatever which, to my mind, sustains the interpretation now given to the cruel and unusual punishment clause. On the contrary, in my opinion, the review which has been made demonstrates that the word 'cruel,' as used in the Amendment, forbids only the lawmaking power, in prescribing punishment for crime, and the courts in imposing punishment, from inflicting unnecessary bodily suffering through a resort to inhuman methods for causing bodily torture, like or which are of the nature of the cruel methods of bodily torture which had been made use of prior to the Bill of Rights of 1689, and against the recurrence of which the word 'cruel' was used in that instrument. To illustrate. Death was a well-known method of punishment, prescribed by law, and it was, of course, painful, and in that sense was cruel. But the infliction of this punishment was clearly not prohibited by the word 'cruel,' although that word manifestly was intended to forbid the resort to barbarous and unnecessary methods of bodily torture in executing even the penalty of death.\n In my opinion, the previous considerations also establish that the word 'unusual' accomplished only three results: First, it primarily restrains the courts when acting under the authority of a general discretionary power to impose punishment, such as was possessed at common law, from inflicting lawful modes of punishment to so unusual a degree as to cause the punishment to be illegal, because to that degree it cannot be inflicted without express statutory authority; second, it restrains the courts in the exercise of the same discretion from inflicting a mode of punishment so unusual as to be impliedly not within its discretion, and to be consequently illegal in the absence of express statutory authority; and, third, as to both the foregoing, it operated to restrain the lawmaking power from endowing the judiciary with the right to exert an illegal \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 410]\n\u00a0\n discretion as to the kind and extent of punishment to be inflicted.\n Nor is it given to me to see in what respect the construction thus stated minimizes the constitutional guaranty by causing it to become obsolete or ineffective in securing the purposes which led to its adoption. Of course, it may not be doubted that the provision against cruel bodily punishment is not restricted to the mere means used in the past to accomplish the prohibited result. The prohibition, being generic, embraces all methods within its intendment. Thus, if it could be conceived that to- morrow the lawmaking power, instead of providing for the infliction of the death penalty by hanging, should command its infliction by burying alive, who could doubt that the law would be repugnant to the constitutional inhibition against cruel punishment? But while this consideration is obvious, it must be equally apparent that the prohibition against the infliction of cruel bodily torture cannot be extended so as to limit legislative discretion in prescribing punishment for crime by modes and methods which are not embraced within the prohibition against cruel bodily punishment, considered even in their most generic sense, without disregarding the elementary rules of construction which have prevailed from the beginning. Of course, the beneficent application of the Constitution to the ever-changing requirements of our national life has, in a great measure, resulted from the simple and general terms by which the powers created by the Constitution are conferred, or in which the limitations which it provides are expressed. But this beneficent result has also essentially depended upon the fact that this court, while never hasitating to bring within the powers granted or to restrain by the limitations created all things generically within their embrace, has also incessantly declined to allow general words to be construed so as to include subjects not within their intendment. That these great results have been accomplished through the application by the court of the familiar rule that what is generically included in the words \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 411]\n\u00a0\n employed in the Constitution is to be ascertained by considering their origin and their significance at the time of their adoption in the instrument may not be denied,-Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 624\n, 29 S. L. ed. 746, 748, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 524; Kepner v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 100, 124\n, 125 S., 49 L. ed. 114, 122, 123, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 797, 1 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 655,-rulings which are directly repugnant to the conception that by judicial construction constitutional limitations may be made to progress so as to ultimately include that which they were not intended to embrace,-a principle with which it seems to me the ruling now made is in direct conflict, since, by the interpretation now adopted, two results are accomplished: (a) the clause against cruel punishments, which was intended to prohibit inhumane and barbarous bodily punishments, is so construed as to limit the discretion of the lawmaking power in determining the mere severity with which punishments not of the prohibited character may be prescribed, and (b) by interpreting the word 'unusual,' adopted for the sole purpose of limiting judicial discretion in order thereby to maintain the supremacy of the lawmaking power, so as to cause the prohibition to bring about the directly contrary result; that is, to expand the judicial power by endowing it with a vast authority to control the legislative department in the exercise of its discretion to define and punish crime.\n But further than this, assuming, for the sake of argument, that I am wrong in my view of the 8th Amendment, and that it endows the courts with the power to review the discretion of the lawmaking body in prescribing sentence of imprisonment for crime, I yet cannot agree with the conclusion reached in this case, that, because of the mere term of imprisonment, it is within the rule. True, the imprisonment is at hard and painful labor. But certainly the mere qualification of painful in addition to hard cannot be the basis upon which it is now decided that the legislative discretion was abused, since to understand the meaning of the term requires a knowledge of the discipline prevailing in the prisons in the Philippine Islands. The division of hard labor into classes, one more irksome, and, it may be said, more painful than the other in the \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 412]\n\u00a0\n sense of severity, is well known. English prisons act of 1865, Pub. Gen. Stat.  19, p. 835. I do not assume that the mere fact that a chain is to be carried by the prisoner causes the punishment to be repugnant to the Bill of Rights, since, while the chain may be irksome, it is evidently not intended to prevent the performance of the penalty of hard labor. Such a provision may well be part of the ordinary prison discipline, particularly in communities where the jails are insecure, and it may be a precaution applied, as it is commonly applied in this country, as a means of preventing the escape of prisoners; for instance, where the sentence imposed is to work on the roads or other work where escape might be likely. I am brought, then, to the conclusion that the accessory punishments are the basis of the ruling now made, that the legislative discretion was so abused as to cause it to be necessary to declare the law prescribing the punishment for the crime invalid. But I can see no foundation for this ruling, as, to my mind, these accessory punishments, even under the assumption, for the sake of argument, that they amounted to an abuse of legislative discretion, are clearly separable from the main punishment,- imprisonment. Where a sentence is legal in one part and illegal in another, it is not open to controversy that the illegal, if separable, may be disregarded and the legal enforced. United States v. Pridgeon, \n153 U.S. 48\n, 38 L. ed. 631, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 746. But it is said here the illegality is not merely in the sentence, but in the law which authorizes the sentence. Grant the premise. The illegal is capable of separation from the legal in the law as well as in the sentence; and because this is a criminal case, it is none the less subject to the rule that where a statute is unconstitutional in part and in part not, the unconstitutional part, if separable, may be rejected and the constitutional part maintained. Of course it is true that that can only be done provided it can be assumed that the legislature would have enacted the legal part separate from the illegal. The ruling now made must therefore rest upon the proposition that because the law has provided an illegal in addition to a legal punish- \n\n[217 U.S. 349, 413]\n\u00a0\n ment, it must be assumed that the legislature would not have defined and punished the crime to the legal extent, because to some extent the legislature was mistaken as to its powers. But this I contend is to indulge in an assumption which is unwarranted and has been directly decided to the contrary at this term in United States v. Union Supply Co. \n215 U.S. 50\n, 54 L. ed.--, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 15. In that case a corporation was proceeded against criminally for an offense punishable by imprisonment and fine. The corporation clearly could not be subjected to the imprisonment, and the contention was that the lawmaker must be presumed to have intended that both the punishments should be inflicted upon the person violating the law, and therefore it could not be intended to include a corporation within its terms. In overruling the contention, it was said:\n'And if we free our minds from the notion that criminal statutes must be construed by some artificial and conventional rule, the natural inference, when a statute prescribes two independent penalties, is that it means to inflict them so far as it can, and that if one of them is impossible, it does not mean, on that account, to let the defendant escape.'\n\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice Holmes concurs in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n'1. For that the King's bench, being a temporal court, made it part of the judgment, that Titus Oates, being a clerk, should, for his said perjuries, be devested of his canonical and priestly habit, and to continue devested all his life; which is a matter wholly out of their power, belonging to the ecclesiastical courts only.\n'2. For that the said judgments are barbarous, inhuman, and unchristian; and there is no precedents to warrant the punishments of whipping and committing to prison for life, for the crime of perjury; which yet were but part of the punishments inflicted upon him.\n\n'3. For that the particular matters upon which the indictments were found were the points objected against Mr. Titus Oates's testimony in several of the trials, in which he was allowed to be a good and credible witness, though testified against him by most of the same persons, who witnessed against him upon those indictments.\n\n'4.

Western U. Teleg. \n\n[216 U.S. 165, 166]\n\u00a0\n Co. decided to-day [\n216 U.S. 146\n, 54 L. ed.-, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 280], it is unnecessary to set out at large the provisions of the statute in question.\n The bill in this case was brought against the prosecuting attorneys of the seventeenth judicial circuits of the state of Arkansas to enjoin them from instituting actions against the Western Union Telegraph Company to recover the penalties of $1,000 for each alleged violation of the act. It was averred in the bill that the defendant prosecuting attorneys would, unless restrained by the order of the court, institute numerous actions, as they had threatened to do, for the recovery of the penalties aforesaid. The learned district judge sustained the demurrer to the bill, and dismissed the case upon the ground that the action is, in effect, a suit against the state of Arkansas, and for that reason prohibited by the 11th Amendment to the Federal Constitution. The sole question presented upon this record is as to the correctness of that ruling.\n Since the decision in the circuit court, this court has decided the case of Ex parte Young, \n209 U.S. 123\n, 52 L. ed. 714, 13 L.R.A.(N.S.) 932, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 441. In that case the previous cases in this court concerning the application of the 11th Amendment of the Constitution were fully considered, and it was then said by Mr. Justice Peckham, speaking for the court:\n'The various authorities we have referred to furnish ample justification for the assertion that individuals who, as officers of the state, are clothed with some duty in regard to the enforcement of the laws of the state, and who threaten and are about to commence proceedings, either of a civil or criminal nature, to enforce against parties affected an unconstitutional act, violating the Federal Constitution, may be enjoined by a Federal court of equity from such action.'\n\n This doctrine is precisely applicable to the case at bar. The statute specifically charges the prosecuting attorneys with the duty of bringing actions to recover the penalties. It is averred in the bill, and admitted by the demurrer, that they threatened and were about to commence proceedings for that purpose. \n\n[216 U.S. 165, 167]\n\u00a0\n The unconstitutionality of the act is averred, and relief is sought against its enforcement. As this case is ruled, upon the question of jurisdiction, by the case of Ex parte Young, it is unnecessary to consider the question further. Upon the authority of that case the decree of the Circuit Court dismissing the bill for want of jurisdiction is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","194":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWESTERN UNION TEL. CO. v. COMMERCIAL MILL. CO.(1910)\nNo. 15\nArgued: October 26, 1901Decided: November 28, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[218 U.S. 406, 407]\n\u00a0\n This is an action for damages for failure to deliver a telegram given to the telegraph company at Detroit, Michigan, to be delivered at Kansas City, Missouri.\n On the 15th of August, 1904, the milling company was offered 10,000 bushels of wheat, of a certain kind, at $1.01 a bushel, for immediate acceptance. The telegram in controversy was sent to accept the offer. It was promptly transmitted by the company to its relay station at Chicago within a minute or two after it was filed at Detroit. What became of it afterwards is not shown; it \n\n[218 U.S. 406, 408]\n\u00a0\n was not delivered. On the face of the telegram were the following words: 'Send the following message, without repeating, subject to the terms and conditions printed on the back hereof, which are hereby agreed to.' One of the conditions referred to was this: 'It is agreed . . . that the said company shall not be liable . . . for nondelivery of any unrepeated messages beyond the amount received for the same.' Fifty times the amount received for the message was fixed as the damages for nondelivery in case of its repetition, and there was a provision for insurance upon the payment of a premium.\n The case was tried to a jury, and the milling company gave evidence of the above facts and of its damages. The telegraph company offered no evidence. The telegraph company asked certain instructions, which to understand, the statute of the state in regard to telegrams must be given. It is entitled, 'An Act to Prescribe the Duties of Telegraph Companies Incorporated, Whether within or without This State, Relative to the Transmission of Messages, and to Provide for the Recovery of Damages for Negligence in the Nonperformance of Such Duties.' [Act 195, Pub. Acts 1893 .] Section 1 of the act provides as follows:\n'Sec. 1. The people of the state of Michigan enact that it shall be the duty of all telegraph companies incorporated either within or without this state, doing business within this state, to receive despatches from and for other telegraph companies' lines, and from and for any individual, and on payment of the usual charges for individuals for transmitting despatches, as established by the rules and regulations of such telegraph company, to transmit the same with impartiality and in good faith. Such telegraph companies shall be liable for any mistakes, errors, or delays in the transmission \n\n[218 U.S. 406, 409]\n\u00a0\n or delivery, or for the nondelivery of any repeated or nonrepeated message, in damages to the amount which such person or persons may sustain by reason of the mistakes, errors, or delays in the transmission or delivery, due to the negligence of said company; or for the nondelivery of any such despatch, due to the negligence of such telegraph company or its agents, to be recovered with the costs of suit by the person or persons sustaining such damage.'\n\n As to the statute, the telegraph company requested the court to instruct the jury (1) that it did not prohibit a contract like the one made by the parties; (2) the milling company must recover on the contract or not at all; (3) the message was interstate commerce and the statute cannot be held to apply to it. If the statute be held to be prohibitory, it is void as an attempted regulation of interstate commerce, in violation of the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States.\n The court refused the instructions, and expressed in its charge to the jury a view antagonistic to the propositions of law expressed in them. A verdict was rendered for the milling company in the sum of $960. The telegraph company moved for a new trial, repeating the propositions expressed in the instructions, and added the further ground that the statute, when construed as prohibiting contracts between persons sui juris, is in violation of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Judgment was entered on the verdict, which was affirmed by the supreme court of the state by a divided court.\n Messrs. Rush Taggart, C. D. Joslyn, George H. Fearons, and Henry D. Estabrook for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[218 U.S. 406, 411]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Ralph B. Wilkinson for defendant in error.\n\n\n[218 U.S. 406, 413]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the court:\n Intercourse between the states by the telegraph is interstate commerce. Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Texas, \n105 \nU.S. 460, 464\n, 26 S. L. ed. 1067, 1068; Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Pendleton, \n122 \nU.S. 347, 356\n, 30 S. L. ed. 1187, 1188, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 306, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1126. So considering, one division of the supreme court of Michigan was of the opinion that the statute of the state in regard to telegraph messages, if not limited to those which were delivered within the state, would be unconstitutional. In arriving at that conclusion it was considered whether the common law of the state prohibited the stipulation against liability for negligence, and it was asked, if it did not, 'can a statute of a state deny to one engaged in interstate commerce the right which he theretofore possessed of making a contract limiting his lia- \n\n[218 U.S. 406, 414]\n\u00a0\n bility?' The first question was answered in the negative, on the authority of the Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Carew, 15 Mich. 525, and subsequent cases. The second question was also answered in the negative, as we have seen. It was, in effect, said that if the first question could be answered in the affirmative, the case would be determined by the local law, and there would be no power of revision in this court, citing Delmas v. Merchants' Mut. Ins. Co. 14 Wall. 661, 20 L. ed. 757, and Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Hughes, \n191 U.S. 477\n, 48 L. ed. 268, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 132. This presents the seeming paradox that a prohibition against a limitation of liability, if prescribed by the common law, would be valid, and that a like prohibition prescribed by a statute would not be. It is not clear whether it is meant to be said that in the first instance there would be, and in the second instance there would not be, a proper limitation of the liberty of contract and a valid interference with interstate commerce.\n The other division of the court, on the other hand, expressed the view that 'the legislature intended its action to be coextensive with its authority to act, and that the statute should be given the broadest possible application,' and held to cover state and interstate messages, and 'to forbid a limitation of liability' for negligence, and 'to make void the stipulation contained in the contract.' The power of the legislature to pass it was asserted, and that it did not burden interstate commerce. 'The contract,' it was said, 'was made in the state, is single, involves in its performance service of defendant within and without this state for a single charge.' The service was not performed, and for the breach of the common-law and contract duty the milling company has brought suit, it was said, and that the telegraph company seeks to avoid liability by the stipulation on the back of the message. To this defense it was answered:\n'By the law of the state, the stipulation is of no force or effect. The court so declared. It is contended here \n\n[218 U.S. 406, 415]\n\u00a0\n that in so doing the court was in error. It will be well to have in mind the effect of the statute as it was applied by the trial court. Undoubtedly, it was the application of a local law to the contract. But the local law does not attempt to state, measure, or define any duty of defendant, or to establish, define, or fix the consequences of its miscarriage. The liability of defendant is established without reference to the statute. It is when it asks to be discharged therefrom, by giving effect to the stipulation, that the local law becomes, if at all, effective. These considerations answer those objections which are based upon the notion that the local law has been given extraterritorial effect, and they require, also, that this case and Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Pendleton, \n122 U.S. 347\n, 30 L. ed. 1187, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 306, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1126, shall be distinguished.'\n\n Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Pendleton leaves nothing to be said upon the principles relating to interstate telegraphic messages and the limitations upon the states of power to regulate them. A statute of Indiana was adjudged invalid which prescribed that despatches should be transmitted in the order of their delivery, whether intended for delivery within or without the state, 'under penalty, in case of failure to transmit, or if postponed out of such order, of $100, to be recovered by the person whose despatch is neglected or postponed.' The statute was construed by the supreme court of the state to apply to despatches not delivered in the state, even against the practice of the companies, authorized by the laws of another state. The message was delivered to the telegraph company in Indiana, addressed to the care of a person in Ottumwa, Iowa, who lived over a mile from the telegraph station, and not within the delivery district. These facts were set up in the answer, and that, in accordance with the custom and usage of the office, and in order to facilitate the delivery of the message, a copy of the telegram was \n\n[218 U.S. 406, 416]\n\u00a0\n promptly placed in the postoffice, properly addressed, and delivered the following morning. And it was averred that this was in accordance with the laws of Iowa. A demurrer was sustained to the answer, and judgment entered for the plaintiff for the sum of $100. It was affirmed by the supreme court; it was reversed by this court on the ground that the statute was a regulation of interstate commerce. Of the correctness of that conclusion there cannot be any controversy, but there is a manifest difference between the statute of Indiana and the statute of Michigan and their purposes and effects. The former imposed affirmative duties, and regulated the performance of the business of the telegraph company. It besides ignored the requirements or regulations of another state, made its laws paramount to the laws of another state, gave an action for damages against the permission of such laws for acts done within its jurisdiction. Such a statute was plainly a regulation of interstate commerce, and exhibited in a conspicuous degree the evils of such interference by a state, and the necessity of one uniform plan of regulation. The statute of Michigan has no such objectionable qualities. It imposes no additional duty. It gives sanction only to an inherent duty. It declares that in the performance of a service public in its nature, that it is a policy of the state that there shall be no contract against negligence. The prohibition of the statute, therefore, entails no burden. It permits no release from that duty in the public service which men in their intercourse must observe,- the duty of observing the degree of care and vigilance which the circumstances justly demand, to avoid injury to another.\n We have seen that one division of the supreme court of the state was of the view that if the prohibition rested on the common law, its validity could not be questioned. We cannot concede such effect to the common law and deny it to a statute. Both are rules of conduct proceed- \n\n[218 U.S. 406, 417]\n\u00a0\n ing from the supreme power of the state. That one is unwritten and the other written can make no difference in their validity or effect. The common law did not become a part of the laws of the states of its own vigor. It has been adopted by constituional provision, by statute or decision, and, we may say in passing, is not the same in all particulars in all the states. But, however adopted, it expresses the policy of the state for the time being only, and is subject to change by the power that adopted it. How, then, can it have an efficacy that the statute changing it does not possess?\n It is to the laws, whether part of the common law or found in the statutes of the state, that we look for the validity and extent of a contract between persons. They constitute its obligation. How far this principle is limited by the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States may be illustrated by several cases cognate to the one at bar.\n In Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. v. Solan, \n169 U.S. 133\n, 42 L. ed. 688, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 289, a statute was considered which prohibited any railway company from limiting its liability as a common carrier. Solan sued the company to recover $10,000 damages received by him in Iowa from the derailing, by the company's negligence, of a car in which he was traveling under a written contract by which the company agreed to carry him, with cattle, from Rock Valley to Chicago. It was stipulated in the contract that the company should, in no event, be liable to the owner or person in charge of such stock for any injury to his person in any amount exceeding $500. The company alleged that the stipulation was part of the consideration for the transportation, that it related exclusively to interstate commerce, that it was valid at common law, and that the statute of Iowa was void and unconstitutional, 'as being an attempt to regulate and limit contracts relating to interstate commerce.' The contentions were rejected. The court said: \n\n[218 U.S. 406, 418]\n\u00a0\n 'Railroad corporations, like all other corporations and persons doing business within the territorial jurisdiction of a state, are subject to its law. . . . The rules prescribed for the construction of railroads, and for their management and operation, designed to protect persons and property otherwise endangered by their use, are strictly within the scope of the local law. They are not in themselves regulations of interstate commerce, although they control, in some degree, the conduct and the liability of those engaged in such commerce. So long as Congress has not legislated upon the particular subject, they are rather to be regarded as legislation in aid of such commerce, and as a rightful exercise of the police power of the state to regulate the relative rights and duties of all persons and corporations within its limits.'\n It was further said:\n'The statute now in question, so far as it concerns liability for injuries happening within the state of Iowa,-which is the only matter presented for decision in this case,-clearly comes within the same principles. It is in no just sense a regulation of commerce. It does not undertake to impose any tax upon the company, or to restrict the persons or things to be carried, or to regulate the rate of tolls, fares, or freight. Its whole object and effect are to make it more sure that railroad companies shall perform the duty resting upon them by virtue of their employment as common carriers to use the utmost care and diligence in the transportation of passengers and goods.'\n\n Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Hughes, \n191 U.S. 477\n, 48 L. ed. 268, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 132, may be cited as pertinent. It determined the validity of the common law of Pennsylvania, which prohibited the common carrier from limiting his liability for his own negligence, though the property was shipped from New York to a town in Pennsylvania, under a bill of lading which contained a clause limiting the carrier's liability to a stip- \n\n[218 U.S. 406, 419]\n\u00a0\n ulated value in consideration of the rate paid, the shipper having been offered a bill of lading without such limitation on payment of a higher rate. The court quoted at length from the Solan Case, and concluded as follows:\n'We can see no difference in the application of the principle based upon the manner in which the state requires this degree of care and responsibility, whether enacted into a statute or resulting from the rules of law enforced in the state courts. The state has a right to promote the welfare and safety of those within its jurisdiction by requiring common carriers to be responsible to the full measure of the loss resulting from their negligence, a contract to the contrary notwithstanding.'\n\n There is a difference between that case and this,-indeed some contrast. In that case a contract was made in New York which limited the liability of the carrier, the limitation being in accordance with the laws of that state; it was disregarded in Pennsylvania, where the act of negligence occurred, and the law of the latter enforced. In this case the contract limiting liability was made in Michigan, the negligent act occurred in another state, and yet the limitation, it is insisted, is void. In other words, in that case the law of the state was disregarded; in this case it is sought to be enforced. These, however, are but incidental contrasts, in no way affecting the basic principle of the cases, which was that the laws passed upon were exercises of the police power of the states in aid of interstate commerce, and, although incidentally affecting it, did not burden it.\n Western U. Teleg. Co. v. James, \n162 U.S. 650\n, 40 L. ed. 1105, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 934, is a strong example of the same distinctions. A statute of Georgia which required telegraph companies having wires wholly or partly within the state to receive despatches, transmit and deliver them with due diligence, under the penalty of $100, was sustained as a valid exercise of the power of the state in relation to messages by telegraph \n\n[218 U.S. 406, 420]\n\u00a0\n from points outside of and directed to some point within the state. It will be observed that this case in some particulars exhibits a contrast to Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Pendleton, \n122 U.S. 347\n, 30 L. ed. 1187, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 306, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1126, and yet they are entirely reconcilable, having a common principle. In the latter case the law passed on clearly transcended the power of the state, because it directly regulated interstate commerce, as we have already shown. In the James Case the power of the state was exercised in aid of commerce. In the latter case prior cases were reviewed, and the principle determining the validity of the respective statutes was declared to be whether they could be 'fully carried out and obeyed without in any manner affecting the conduct of the company with regard to the performance of its duties in other states.' It was said that a statute of that kind, as it would not 'unfavorably affect or embarrass' the telegraph company in the course of its employment, should be held valid 'until Congress speaks upon the subject.' And it was observed that 'it is the duty of a telegraph company which receives a message for transmission, directed to an individual at one of its stations, to deliver that message to the person to whom it is addressed with reasonable diligence and in good faith. That is a part of its contract, implied by taking the message and receiving payment therefor.' And there can be liability to the sender of the message as well as to him who is to receive it. The telegraph company in the case at bar surely owed the obligation to the milling company to not only transmit the message, but to deliver it. For the failure of the latter it sought to limit its responsibility,-to make the measure of its default not the full and natural consequence of the breach of its obligation, but the mere price of the service, relieving itself, to some extent, even from the performance of its duty; a duty, we may say, if performed or omitted, may have consequence beyond the damage in the particular instance. This the statute of the state, expressing the policy of the state, \n\n[218 U.S. 406, 421]\n\u00a0\n declares shall not be. For the reasons stated we think that this may be done, and that it is not an illegal interference with interstate commerce.\n Another contention is made. It is urged that the statute as construed violates the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, in that it abridges the privileges and immunities between citizens of the United States, and deprives the telegraph company and the persons with whom it does business of their liberty and property without due process of law. The basis of this contention is the liberty of the telegraph company to make contracts. It is rather late in the day to make that contention. The regulation of public-service corporations is too well established, both as to power and the extent of the power, to call for any discussion. It is true such power is not unlimited, nor is the police power of the state, but the cases we have cited demonstrate that the statute of Michigan is not in excess of such powers.\n Lastly it is said that the statute deprives the telegraph company and the persons with whom it does business of the equal protection of the laws. This is sought to be sustained on the ground that express companies and other common carriers may by contract limit their liability. The argument to sustain the contention is in effect that which we have considered. If an unjust discrimination is intended to be asserted, Orient Ins. Co. v. Daggs, \n172 U.S. 557\n, 43 L. ed. 552, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 281, is an answer.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Holmes dissents. \n\n\n\n","195":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWESTERN UNION TEL. CO. v. KANSAS(1910)\n\nArgued: Decided: January 17, 1910\n\n\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n This action was brought by the state of Kansas in one of its courts against the Western Union Telegraph Company, a New York corporation, to obtain a decree ousting and restraining that corporation from doing, in Kansas, any telegraphic business that was wholly internal to that state, and not pursuant to some arrangement, or to meet its contracts with, or obligations to, the government of the United States. Upon the petition of the telegraph company the case was removed to the circuit court of the United States for the district of Kansas. But it was thereafter remanded to the state court, where, upon a demurrer to the answer, a final decree was rendered, prohibiting and enjoining the telegraph company from transacting intrastate business in Kansas as a corporation, the decree, however, not to affect the company's duties to or contracts with the United States. From that decree the present writ of error was prosecuted.\n The state contends that the decree is in exact conformity with certain provisions of the Kansas statutes to be found in the General Statutes of that state of 1901, title, 'Corporations,' p. 280, and the General Statutes of 1905, p. 284. Those provisions, or the ones directly involved here, originated in an act known as the Bush act, passed at a special session of the legislature in 1898. Laws of Kansas, Special Session, p. 27.\n The issues raised by the pleadings arise out of the above statutes. Under those statutes, a state charter board was organized and its powers defined. That board was authorized to receive applications from corporations of other states, territories, or countries seeking permission to engage in business as foreign corporations in Kansas. Any such corporation was required in its application to set forth a certified copy of its charter or articles of incorporation, the place where its principal office or place of business was to be located, the full nature and character of the business in which it proposed to engage, the names and addresses of its officers, trustees, or directors and stockholders, with a detailed statement of its assets and liabilities, and such other information as the board might require in \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n order to determine the solvency of the corporation. The statute further provided that the application should be accompanied by a fee of $25, to be known as an application fee, and that it should be a condition precedent to obtaining authority to transact business in the state that the corporation should file in the office of the secretary of state its written consent, irrevocable, that actions might be brought against it in the proper court of any county in the state (in which the cause of action arose, or in which the plaintiff resided), by service of process on the secretary of state, and stipulating that such service should be valid and binding as if due service had been made upon the president or chief officer of the corporation. Every foreign corporation then doing business in the state was required, within thirty days from the taking effect of the act, to file with the secretary of state the specified written consent. Kan. Gen. Stat. 1901,  1261. If the charter board determined that the foreign company seeking to do business in the state was organized in accordance with the laws under which it was created, that its capital was unimpaired, and that it was organized for a purpose for which a domestic corporation might be organized in Kansas, then the board was directed to grant the application, and by its secretary issue a certificate, setting forth the granting of the application to engage in business in the state, as provided in the statute Id.  1262\n\n\n Then come these important sections: 'Each corporation which has received authority from the charteer board to organize shall, before filing its charter with the secretary of state, as provided by law, pay to the state treasurer of Kansas, for the benefit of the permanent school fund, a charter fee of 1\/10 of 1 per cent of its authorized capital, upon the first $100,000 of its capital stock, or any part thereof; and upon the next $400,000, or any part thereof, 1\/20 of 1 per cent; and for each million or major part thereof over and above the sum of $500,000, $200 . . . . In addition \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n to the charter fee herein provided, the secretary of state shall collect a fee of $2.50 for filing and recording each charter containing not to exceed ten folios, and an additional fee of 25 cents for each folio in excess of ten contained in any charter. The fee for filing and recording a charter shall also entitle the corporation to a certified copy of its charter. All the provisions of this act, including the payment of the fees herein provided, shall apply to foreign corporations seeking to do business in this state, except that, in lieu of their charter, they shall file with the secretary of state a certified copy of their charter, executed by the proper officer of the state, territory, or foreign country under whose laws they are incorporated; and any corporation applying for a renewal of its charter shall comply with all the provisions of this act in like manner, and to the same extent, as is herein provided for the chartering and organizing of new corporations.' 'Any corporation organized under the laws of another state, territory, or foreign country, and authorized to do business in this state, shall be subject to the same provisions, judicial control, restrictions, and penalties, except as herein provided, as corporations organized under the laws of this state.' Id.  1264, 1267.\n By another section it is made the duty of each corporation doing business for profit in Kansas, except banking, insurance, and railroad corporations, annually, on or before August 1st, 'to prepare and deliver to the secretary of state a complete detailed statement of the condition of such corporation on the 30th day of June next preceding. Such statement shall set forth and exhibit the following, namely: 1st. The authorized capital stock. 2d. The paid-up capital stock. 3d. The par value and the market value per share of said stock. 4th. A complete and detailed statement of the assets and liabilities of the corporation. 5th. A full and complete list of the stockholders, with the postoffice address of each, and the number of shares held and paid for by each. 6th. The names and postoffice addresses of the officers, trustees, or directors and mana- \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n ger elected for the ensuing year, together with a certificate of the time and manner in which such election was held. . . . And such failure to file such statement by any corporation doing business in this state, and not organized under the laws of this state, shall work a forfeiture of its right or authority to do business in this state, and the charter board may, at any time, declare such forfeiture, and shall forthwith publish such declaration in the official state paper. . . . No action shall be maintained or recovery had in any of the courts of this state by any corporation doing business in this state without first obtaining the certificate of the secretary of state that statements provided for in this section have been properly made.'  1283.\n Under this statute, the Western Union Telegraph Company made application to the charter board for permission to engage in business in Kansas as a foreign corporation, stating that the amount of its capital stock, fully paid up in cash, was $100,000,000. With that application the company deposited with the secretary of state the specified fee of $25, and also its written consent, irrevocable, in the prescribed form, as to suits brought against it, in the courts of the state, by service of process on that officer. In reference to that consent, the company, in its answer, said: 'It made such written submission to service and paid such application fee voluntarily, and ex gratia, and out of a desire to avoid the appearance of not complying with the reasonable regulations of the state of Kansas, made with reference to its own corporations; but denies that said payment and that said written submission were obligatory upon it, or were necessary or essential as a condition precedent to its continuing to transact business within the state of Kansas, both state and interstate.'\n The charter board granted the application of the telegraph company, but its order to that effect, made April 5th, 1905, recited that the application be granted and the applicant au- \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n thorized and empowered to transact the business of receiving and transmitting messages by telegraph within the state of Kansas, and transacting within the said state its business of a telegraph company, provided that the order should not take effect and no certificate of authority should issue or be delivered to the company 'until such applicant shall have paid to the state treasurer of Kansas, for the benefit of the permanent school fund, the sum of twenty thousand one hundred dollars ($20,100), being the charter fee provided by law necessary to be paid by a foreign corporation having a capital of $100,000,000. It is further understood, ordered, and provided that nothing herein contained shall apply to nor be construed as restricting in any wise the transaction by the said applicant of its interstate business nor its business for the Federal government; but that this grant of authority and requirement as to payment relate only to the business transacted wholly within the state of Kansas. The above fee of $20,100 was the specified per cent of the authorized capital of the company which the statute required it to pay before doing or continuing to do any local business in Kansas.\n The company refused to pay the fee thus required, and continued, as before, to do telegraph business of all kinds in Kansas. Thereupon the present action was brought, the sole ground of complaint being that, in consequence of the failure of the telegraph company to pay the charter fee of $20,100, it was without authority to continue doing any intrastate or local business in Kansas. The relief sought by the state, as shown by the prayer of its petition, was that the defendant be required to show by what authority it exercised within Kansas the corporate right and power of receiving, transmitting, and delivering telegraphic messages within its limits and receiving compensation therefor; that it be adjudged by the court that the defendant had no authority of law for the performance of such corporate acts, and the exercise of such corporate powers and franchises, and the carrying on of said corporate business within the state; and that it be decreed and adjudged that the \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n defendant 'be ousted of and from the exercise within the state of Kansas of the said corporate rights and franchises of receiving, transmitting, and delivering within the state of Kansas of telegraphic messages and communications and of receiving compensation therefor.'\n The reasons given by the telegraph company for its refusal to pay the required fee are set forth in its answer, to which a demurrer was sustained, and may be summarized as follows: 1. That the company had the right to transact both interstate and local business in Kansas without paying the fee of $20,100. 2. That by the laws of Kansas, enacted while it was a territory and after it became a state telegraph companies were invited to come into it and do both domestic and interstate business there, and in consequence of such invitation the company had established between eight hundred and nine hundred offices in Kansas at great expense, all of which was done in the full faith that it would receive the equal protection of the laws under the Constitution of the United States. 3. That it had been doing a general telegraph business in Kansas ever since its organization as a territory. 4. That on the 7th day of June, 1867, it duly accepted the conditions of the act of Congress of July 24th, 1866 [14 Stat. at L. 221, chap. 230], entitled, 'An Act to Aid in the Construction of Telegraph Lines, and to Secure to the Government the Use of the Same for Postal, Military, and Other Purposes' (Rev. Stat.  5263 et seq., U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3580), whereby it became and is now an instrument of interstate commerce and an agency of the United States for the transaction of public business, and subject to all the duties imposed, and entitled to all the rights, benefits, and privileges conferred, by said act of Congress. 5. That its lines were originally constructed in the territory of Kansas by the authority of an arrangement made with the Secretary of the Treasury in conformity with certain acts of Congress, one of which was enacted June 16th, 1860, and was entitled, \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n 'An Act to Facilitate Communication between the Atlantic and Pacific States by Electric Telegraph' [12 Stat. at L. 41, chap. 137], the other, enacted July 2d, 1864, entitled, 'An Act for Increased Facilities of Telegraph Communication between the Atlantic and Pacific States and the Territory of Idaho' [13 Stat. at L. 373, chap. 220]; and the telegraph company, therefore, 'has always been in the state of Kansas rightfully for the purpose of the transaction of governmental business and for the public generally, and that it cannot be now excluded therefrom.' 6. That the company's lines of telegraph within Kansas are upon the public domain and upon military and post roads of the United States, and are part of the postal system of the United States, and that the defendant has, therefore, under the Constitution and laws of the United States, the power, and is under the duty and obligation, to transmit all messages for the government and for the public generally just as much and as fully with respect to messages between points within Kansas as to interstate messages. 7. That the enforcement of the statute of Kansas would seriously affect and cripple the company's efficiency as an instrument of interstate commerce and as an agency of the government for transacting both interstate and domestic business in that state, because the receipts derived from interstate and governmental business alone would, in many offices in Kansas, not be equal to the expense of keeping such offices open, and that the closing of them on that account would be detrimental to the governmental service, as well as to interstate commerce. 8. That by the statutes in question 'any corporation, including telegraph companies, organized in the state, is authorized to do business in Kansas upon paying a charter fee based on the actual capital of such corporation employed in the state of Kansas, whereas, in respect to the defendant company, the charter board requires and is attempting to exact from the defendant company, by this proceeding, a charter fee based upon the defendant's entire capitalization, to wit, $100,000,000 which $100,000,000 represents the property and lines of telegraph of the defendant company in the forty- five states of the American Union, in the Dominion of Canada, and lines under the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and in foreign countries.' 9. That such tax is \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n upon property and rights outside of Kansas, and, therefore, beyond its jurisdiction for purposes of taxation. 10. That 'by laws passed relating to private corporations, and especially by laws having reference to telegraph companies, some enacted by the legislature of the territory of Kansas and many since the creation and organization of the state of Kansas, telegraph companies, including the Western Union, were invited to come into the state of Kansas, and build and construct their lines therein, and to connect said lines with other telegraph liens then or thereafter constructed, and to do a general telegraph business, both domestic and interstate, throughout the state of Kansas, and to thereby place the citizens of the state of Kansas, wherever the lines reached, in direct telegraphic communication with all parts of the United States; that said telegraph companies, including the Western Union Telegraph Company, were, by the laws of the state of Kansas, authorized to go upon the public highways of the state, and thereon place their poles and wires; that, in pursuance of such invitation, and before the admission of the state of Kansas to the Union, the Western Union Telegraph Company entered the state of Kansas and extended its lines to all points where the same might be needed, and subsequent to the admission of the state, by construction and purchase, lines of the Western Union Telegraph Company were extended to all parts of the state of Kansas, and between eight hundred and nine hundred offices established for the use and convenience of the public; that there had been expended by the defendant at the time of the enactment of the so-called Bush corporation act, under which the present proceeding is brought, many thousands of dollars in the construction of lines and wires and in the other appurtenances of the telegraphic business and in the establishment of offices; that all of this money was expended in full faith and confidence in the laws already enacted by the state of Kansas for the furtherance and encouragement of telegraphic business, and also in the full faith that said company would have the equal protection of the laws of the state of Kansas, and the fair \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n equitable, and equal treatment required by the Constitution of the state of Kansas in the matter of taxes and other public charges imposed upon it.' 11. That the statute in question, so far as it prevents the company from using its property in the state for all purposes of its business, would operate as a taking of such property without due process of law. 12. That the statute is in contravention of the power of Congress to regulate commerce among the several states and with foreign countries, with its power to establish postoffices and post roads, and with its authority to pass all laws necessary and proper to carry into execution the powers vested in the government of the United States.\n Messrs. Rush Taggart, Henry D. Estabrook, Charles Blood Smith, John F. Dillon, W. H. Rossington, and George H. Fearons for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[216 U.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Fred S. Jackson and C. C. Coleman for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Harlan:\n\n\n[216 U.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan, after making the above statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The above extended statement would seem to be justified by the importance of this case.\n The contentions of the company, to which particular attention will be directed, are, in substance, that the requirement that it pay, for the benefit of the permanent school fund of the state, a given per cent of its authorized capital, wherever and however employed, as a condition of its right to continue to do domestic business in Kansas, is a regulation which, by its necessary operation, directly burdens or embarrasses interstate commerce, and therefore is illegal under the commerce clause of the Constitution; further, that such a requirement involves the taxation not only of the company's interstate business everywhere, but equally the property employed by it beyond the limits of the state,-a thing which could not be done consistently with the due process of law enjoined by the 14th Amendment.\n It will be well to inquire, at the outset, as to the state of the law in respect of local regulations that materially burden and interfere with the freedom of commerce among the states. A review of some of the cases will throw light on the questions now before us, and enable us the better to ascertain the scope and effect of the statute.\n In McCall v. California, \n136 \nU.S. 104, 109\n, 34 S. L. ed. 391, 392, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 181, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 881, a municipal ordinance of San Francisco imposing a license tax of a specified amount upon 'every railroad agency' was held to be violative of the commerce clause of the Constitution \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n when applied to an agent in San Francisco of a railroad company which had its principal place of business in Chicago, and operated a continuous line between Chicago and New York. That agent, conducting his business in San Francisco, city and county, solicited there passengers who proposed to travel from Chicago to New York to use the railroad he represented. The court said: 'The object and effect of his soliciting agency were to swell the volume of the business of the road. It was one of the 'means' by which the company sought to increase, and doubtless did increase, its interstate passenger traffic. It was not incidentally or remotely connected with the business of the road, but was a direct method of increasing that business. The tax upon it, therefore, was, according to the principles established by the decisions of this court, a tax upon a means or an occupation of carrying on interstate commerce, pure and simple.' At the same time, in Norfolk & W. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n136 U.S. 114\n, 34 L. ed. 394, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 178, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 958, the court held that a license tax exacted by Pennsylvania upon a railroad corporation of another state, engaged in interstate commerce, for keeping an office in Philadelphia, was a tax on such commerce, and invalid.\n A leading authority on the general subject, and which has an important bearing on more than one question in the present case, is that of Crutcher v. Kentucky, \n141 \nU.S. 47, 51\n, 57 S., 59, 62, 35 L. ed. 649, 651- 654, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 851. That case involved the constitutional validity of a statute of Kentucky regulating the agencies of foreign express companies. The statute made it unlawful for the agent of a foreign express company to set up, establish, or carry on the business of transportation in Kentucky without first obtaining a license from the auditor of public accounts to carry on such business, and that officer was forbidden to issue the license until the copy of the express company's charter was filed with him, and a statement, verified by oath, showing its assets and liabilities, the amount of its capital stock and how paid, of what its assets consisted, the amount of its losses due and unpaid, and that the company was possessed of an actual capital of at least $150,000, either in cash or safe investments, exclusive of stock \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 20]\n\u00a0\n notes. Any person carrying on any business in the state for a transportation or express company, not incorporated in Kentucky, without having obtained the required license, was subject to be fined not less than $100 nor more than $500, at the discretion of the jury. The statute specified the fee to be paid for the license, also a certain fee for filing a copy of the company's charter, and still another fee for filing an original or annual statement. The fees prescribed were on account of the company's business in Kentucky, no discrimination being made between interstate and domestic business done there. Without obtaining the required license, Crutcher acted as agent in Kentucky of the United States Express Company, which was organized under the laws of New York, and was engaged in both interstate and domestic commerce. For acting as such agent without the required license from the state, he was indicted, convicted, and fined $100. The highest court of Kentucky sustained the conviction and held the statute to be constitutional. Among other things it said: 'There is no discrimination made between corporations doing a like business; and the state, although the appellant's company is a foreign corporation, has the right to license the business and calling of this agent as it would that of the lawyer or merchant whose business is confined to the state alone.' The judgment of the Kentucky court was reversed by this court.\n Speaking by Mr. Justice Bradley, this court, among other things, said: 'The law of Kentucky which is brought in question by the case requires from the agent of every express company not incorporated by the laws of Kentucky a license from the auditor of public accounts, before he can carry on any business for said company in the state. This, of course, embraces interstate business as well as business confined wholly within the state. It is a prohibition against the carrying on of such business without a compliance with the state law. . . . If a partnership firm of individuals should undertake to carry on the business of interstate commerce between Kentucky and other states, it would not be within the \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 21]\n\u00a0\n province of the state legislature to exact conditions on which they should carry on their business, nor to require to take out a license therefor. To carry on interstate commerce is not a franchise or a privilege granted by the state; it is a right which every citizen of the United States is entitled to exercise under the Constitution and laws of the United States; and the accession of mere corporate facilities, as a matter of convenience in carrying on their business, cannot have the effect of depriving them of such right, unless Congress should see fit to interpose some contrary regulation on the subject. It has frequently been laid down by this court that the power of Congress over interstate commerce is as absolute as it is over foreign commerce. Would any one pretend that a state legislature could prohibit a foreign corporation-an English or a French transportation company, for example-from coming into its borders and landing goods and passengers at its wharves, and soliciting goods and passengers for a return voyage, without first obtaining a license from some state officer, and filing a sworn statement as to the amount of its capital stock paid in? And why not? Evidently because the matter is not within the province of state legislation, but within that of national legislation. Inman S. S. Co. v.

Again: 'As was said by Mr. Justice Lamar, in the case last cited: 'It is well settled by numerous decisions of this court, that a state cannot, under the guise of a license tax, exclude from its jurisdiction a foreign corporation engaged in interstate commerce, or impose any burdens upon such commerce within its limits.' We have repeatedly decided that a state law is unconstitutional and void which requires a party to take out a license for carrying on interstate commerce, no matter how specious the pretext may be for imposing it,'-citing Pickard v. Pull- \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 22]\n\u00a0\n man Southern Car Co. \n117 U.S. 34\n, 29 L. ed. 785, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 635; Robbins v. Taxing Dist. \n120 U.S. 489\n, 30 L. ed. 694, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 45, 7 Sup.

Further, in the Crutcher Case: 'We do not think that the difficulty is at all obviated by the fact that the express company, as incidental to its main business ( which is to carry goods between different states), does also some local business by carrying goods from one point to another within the state of Kentucky. This is, probably, quite as much for the accommodation of the people of that state as for the advantage of the company. But whether so or not, it does not obviate the objection that the regulations as to license and capital stock are imposed as conditions on the company's carrying on the business of interstate commerce, which was manifestly the principal object of its organization. These regulations are clearly a burden and a restriction upon that commerce. Whether intended as such or not, they operate as such. But taxes or license fees in good faith imposed exclusively on express business carried on wholly within the state would be open to no such objection.' The decisions, the court said, 'are clear to the effect that neither licenses nor indirect taxation of any kind, nor any system of state regulation, can be imposed upon interstate any more than upon foreign commerce; and that all acts of legislation producing any such result are, to that extent, unconstitutional and void. And as, in our judgment, the law of Kentucky now under consideration, as applied to the case of the plaintiff in error, is open to this objection, it necessarily follows that the judgment of the court of appeals must be reversed.'\n The court had previously adjudged in Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n114 \nU.S. 196, 204\n, 211 S., 29 L. ed. 158, 162, 164, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 382, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 826, that a statute of Pennsylvania, requiring both domestic and foreign corporations doing business in that commonwealth to pay an annual tax rated by the dividends declared and imposed upon the capital stock of the corporation at a named rate for every dollar of \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 23]\n\u00a0\n such stock, was invalid so far as corporations engaged in interstate commerce were concerned. In that case, the court, speaking by Mr. Justice Field, said: 'Nor does it make any difference whether such commerce is carried on by individuals or by corporations. Welton v. Missouri, \n91 U.S. 275\n, 23 L. ed. 347; Mobile County v. Kimball, \n102 U.S. 691\n, 26 L. ed. 238.' Again, in the Gloucester Ferry Case: 'While it is conceded that the property in a state belonging to a foreign corporation engaged in foreign or interstate commerce may be taxed equally with like property of a domestic corporation engaged in that business, we are clear that a tax or other burden imposed on the property of either corporation because it is used to carry on that commerce, or upon the transportation of persons or property, or for the navigation of the public waters over which the transportation is made, is invalid and void as an interference with, and an obstruction of, the power of Congress in the regulation of such commerce.' This language was quoted approvingly in Philadelphia & S. Mail S. S. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n122 \nU.S. 326, 343\n, 344 S., 30 L. ed. 1200, 1204, 1205, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 308, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1118, which held that a tax by Pennsylvania upon the gross receipts of one of its own corporations, derived from interstate and foreign commerce, was a regulation of interstate and foreign commerce that was inconsistent with the power of Congress under the Constitution. In Philadelphia & S. Mail S. S. Co. v. Pennsylvania, the court, referring to the Gloucester Ferry Case, said: 'It is hardly necessary to add that the tax on the capital stock of the New Jersey company, in that case, was decided to be unconstitutional, because, as the corporation was a foreign one, the tax could only be construed as a tax for the privilege or franchise of carrying on its business, and that business was interstate commerce.'\n In Leloup v. Mobile, \n127 \nU.S. 640, 645\n, 32 S. L. ed. 311, 313, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 134, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1380, the court, speaking by Mr. Justice Bradley, said: 'The question is squarely presented to us, therefore, whether a state, as a condition of doing business within its jurisdiction, may exact a license tax from a telegraph company, a large part of whose business is the transmission of messages from one state to an- \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 24]\n\u00a0\n other and between the United States and foreign countries, and which is invested with the powers and privileges conferred by the act of Congress passed July 24th, 1866 [14 Stat. at L. 221, chap. 230], and other acts incorporated in title 65 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3579). Can a state prohibit such a company from doing such a business within its jurisdiction, unless it will pay a tax and procure a license for the privilege? If it can, it can exclude such companies, and prohibit the transaction of such business altogether. We are not prepared to say that this can be done. Ordinary occupations are taxed in various ways, and, in most cases, legitimately taxed. But we fail to see how a state can tax a business occupation when it cannot tax the business itself. Of course, the exaction of a license tax as a condition of doing any particular business is a tax on the occupation; and a tax on the occupation of doing a business is surely a tax on the business.'\n In the recent case of Galveston, H. & S. A. R. Co. v. Texas, \n210 \nU.S. 217, 227\n, 52 S. L. ed. 1031, 1037, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 638, which involved the validity of a Texas statute imposing an annual tax 'equal to 1 per cent of its gross receipts' on each railroad lying wholly within that state. The railroads there concerned lay wholly within Texas, but, this court said, they connected with other lines, and a part, and in some instances much the larger part, of their gross receipts, were derived from the carriage of passengers and freight coming from, or destined to, points without the state. The contention by the railroad company was that the tax was a burden on interstate commerce, and invalid, so far as it was based on or was measured by receipts derived from interstate transportation. That view was sustained. The court said: 'Neither the state courts nor the legislatures, by giving the tax a particular name or by the use of some form of words, can take away our duty to consider its nature and effect. If it bears upon commerce among the states so directly as to amount to a regulation in a relatively immediate way, it will not be saved by name or form. Stockard v. Morgan, \n185 \nU.S. 27, 37\n, 46 S. L. ed. 785, 794, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 576; Asbell v. Kansas, \n209 \nU.S. 251, 254\n, 256 S., 52 L. ed. 778, 780, 781, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 485. \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 25]\n\u00a0\n We are of opinion that the statute levying this tax does amount to an attempt to regulate commerce among the states. The distinction between a tax 'equal to' 1 per cent of gross receipts and a tax of 1 per cent of the same seems to us nothing, except where the former phrase is the index of an actual attempt to reach the property, and to let the interstate traffic and the receipts from it alone. We find no such attempt or anything to qualify the plain inference from the statute, taken by itself. On the contrary, we rather infer, from the judgment of the state court and from the argument on behalf of the state, that another tax on the property of the railroad is upon a valuation of that property, taken as a going concern. This is merely an effort to reach the gross receipts, not even disguised by the name of an occupation tax, and in no way helped by the words 'equal to.' Of course, it does not matter that the plaintiffs in error are domestic corporations, or that the tax embraces indiscriminately gross receipts from commerce within as well as outside of the state.'\n So, in Brennan v. Titusville, \n153 \nU.S. 289, 303\n, 38 S. L. ed. 719, 723, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 658, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 829, which involved the validity of an ordinance imposing a license tax on those engaged in the business of soliciting orders on behalf of manufacturers of goods, the court said: 'It is clear, therefore, that this license tax is not a mere police regulation, simply inconveniencing one engaged in interstate commerce, and so only indirectly affecting the business, but is a direct charge and burden upon that business; and if a state may lawfully exact it, it may increase the amount of the exaction until all interstate commerce in this mode ceases to be possible. And notwithstanding the fact that the regulation of interstate commerce is committed by the Constitution to the United States, the state is enabled to say that it shall not be carried on in this way, and to that extent to regulate it.' Again, in Ashley v. Ryan, \n153 \nU.S. 436, 440\n, 38 S. L. ed. 773, 776, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 664, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 865, the court said: 'Whether this charge by viewed as a tax, a license, or a fee, if its exaction violated the interstate com- \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 26]\n\u00a0\n merce clause of the Constitution of the United States, or involved the assertion of the right of a state to exercise its powers of taxation beyond its geographical limits, it was void, whatever might be the technical character affixed to the exaction.' To the same effect is Caldwell v. North Carolina, \n187 U.S. 622\n, 47 L. ed. 336, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 229.\n The authorities cited show that this court has guarded with both diligence and firmness the freedom of interstate commerce against hostile state or local action, as such action has been manifested by regulations operating, in some instances, directly, in others indirectly, upon the means or instruments employed in that commerce. This has been done without violating the principle that an interstate carrier, entering a state for purposes of its business, is subject to local regulations that, in their essence and purpose, only incidentally affect interstate commerce, but are established in good faith for the protection, safety, comfort, and convenience of the people, are not in themselves in any real, just sense an obstruction to or in conflict with the substantial rights of those engaged in interstate commerce, but are referable to the police powers of the state, and to be respected until Congress covers the subject by legislation.

We are aware of no decision by this court holding that a state may, by any device or in any way, whether by a license tax in the form of a 'fee,' or otherwise, burden the interstate business of a corporation of another state, although the state may tax the corporation's property regularly or permanently located within its limits, where the ascertainment of the amount assessed is made 'dependent \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 27]\n\u00a0\n in fact on the value of its property situated within the state.' Postal Teleg. Cable Co. v. Adams, \n155 \nU.S. 688, 696\n, 39 S. L. ed. 311, 315, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 1, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 268, 360; Leloup v. Mobile, \n127 \nU.S. 640, 649\n, 32 S. L. ed. 311, 314, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 134, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1380. On the contrary, it is to be deduced from the adjudged cases that a corporation of one state, authorized by its charter to engage in lawful commerce among the state, may not be prevented by another state from coming into its limits for all the legitimate purposes of such commerce. It may go into the state without obtaining a license from it for the purposes of its interstate business, and without liability to taxation there on account of such business.\n But it is said that none of the authorities cited are pertinent to the present case, because the state expressly disclaims any purpose by the statute in question to obstruct or embarrass interstate commerce, but seeks only to prevent the telegraph company from entering the field of domestic business in Kansas without its consent, and without conforming to the requirements of its statute. But the disavowal by the state of any purpose to burden interstate commerce cannot conclude the question as to the fact of such a burden being imposed, or as to the unconstitutionality of the statute, as shown by its necessary operation upon interstate commerce. If the statute, reasonably interpreted, either directly or by its necessary operation, burdens interstate commerce, it must be adjudged to be invalid, whatever may have been the purpose for which it was enacted, and although the company may do both interstate and local business. This court has repeatedly adjudged that in all such matters the judiciary will not regard mere forms, but will look through forms to the substance of things. Such is an established rule of constitutional construction, as the adjudged cases abundantly show.\n In Henderson v. New York (Henderson v. Wickham), \n92 \nU.S. 259, 268\n, 23 S. L. ed. 543, 547, which involved the question whether a statute of New York was, in any real sense, a regulation of commerce with foreign nations, the court said that, in whatever language a statute may be framed, its purpose must be determined by its natural and \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 28]\n\u00a0\n reasonable effect. In Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623, 661\n, 31 S. L. ed. 205, 210, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 273, it was said that the courts, when determining whether a statute is consistent with the fundamental law, must not deem themselves 'bound by mere forms, nor are they to be misled by mere pretenses. They are at liberty-indeed, are under a solemn duty-to look at the substance of things, whenever they enter upon the inquiry whether the legislature has transcended the limits of its authority.' In Lyng v. Michigan, \n135 \nU.S. 161, 166\n, 34 S. L. ed. 150, 153, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 143, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 725, it was adjudged that a state could not lay a tax on interstate commerce 'in any form, whether by way of duties laid on the transportation of the subjects of that commerce, or on the receipts derived from that transportation, or on the occupation or business of carrying it on, for the reason that such taxation is a burden on that commerce, and amounts to a regulation of it, which belongs solely to Congress.' In Robbins v. Taxing Dist. \n120 \nU.S. 489, 497\n, 30 S. L. ed. 694, 697, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 45, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 592, it was attempted to support a local regulation about drummers upon the ground that no discrimination was made between domestic and foreign drummers,-that they were all taxed alike. But that device or form of taxation did not prevail, the court saying: 'That does not meet the difficulty. Interstate commerce cannot be taxed at all, even though the same amount of tax should be laid on domestic commerce or that which is carried on solely within the state.' In Minnesota v. Barber, \n136 \nU.S. 313, 319\n, 326 S., 34 L. ed. 455, 457, 460, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 185, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 862, the particular statute there assailed as repugnant to the Constitution of the United States was not saved by the fact that it was applicable to citizens of all the states, including citizens of the state which enacted it. This court said: 'There may be no purpose upon the part of a legislature to violate the provisions of that instrument, and yet a statute enacted by it, under the forms of law, may, by its necessary operation, be destructive of rights granted or secured by the Constitution. In such cases, the courts must sustain the supreme law of the land by declaring the statute unconstitutional and void.' It was further said in that case \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 29]\n\u00a0\n 'that a statute may, upon its face, apply equally to the people of all the states, and yet be a regulation of interstate commerce which a state may not establish. A burden imposed by a state upon interstate commerce is not to be sustained simply because the statute imposing it applies alike to the people of all the states, including the people of the state enacting such statute.'\n In Brimmer v. Rebman, \n138 \nU.S. 78, 81\n, 34 S. L. ed. 862, 863, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 485, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 213, the question arose as to the validity of a Virginia statute making it unlawful to offer for sale, within the limits of that state, 'any fresh meats (beef, veal, or mutton) which shall have been slaughtered 100 miles or over from the place at which it is offered for sale until and except it has been inspected and approved' as provided in the statute. The preamble of the statute recited that unwholesome meats were being offered for sale in Virginia. Such recital was held not to conclude the question as to the conformity of the statute with the Constitution. Despite the avowal by the state that its object, by the statute, was to prevent the offering of unwholesome meats for sale in Virginia, this court adjudged it to be unconstitutional, saying: 'Is the statute now before us liable to the objection that, by its necessary operation, it interferes with the enjoyment of rights granted or secured by the Constitution? This question admits of but one answer. . . . The fees exacted under the Virginia statute for the inspection of beef, veal, and mutton, the product of animals slaughtered 100 miles or more from the place of sale, are, in reality, a tax; and 'a discriminating tax, imposed by a state, operating to the disadvantage of the products of other states when introduced into the first-mentioned state, is, in effect, a regulation in restraint of commerce among the states, and as such is a usurpation of the powers conferred by the Constitution upon the Congress of the United States.' Walling v. Michigan, \n116 \nU.S. 446, 455\n, 29 S. L. ed. 691, 694, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 454. Nor can this statute be brought into harmony with the Constitution by the circumstances that it purports to apply alike to the citizens of \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 30]\n\u00a0\n all the states, including Virginia; for 'a burden imposed by a state upon interstate commerce is not to be sustained simply because the statute imposing it applies alike to the people of all the states, including the people of the states enacting such statutes.' Minnesota v. Barber, \n136 \nU.S. 313, 319\n, 34 S. L. ed. 455, 457, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 185, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 862; Robbins v. Taxing Dist. \n120 \nU.S. 489, 497\n, 30 S. L. ed. 694, 697, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 45, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 592. If the object of Virginia had been to obstruct the bringing into that state, for use as human food, of all beef, veal, and mutton, however wholesome, from animals slaughtered in distant states, that object will be accomplished if the statute before us be enforced.'\n Looking, then, at the natural and reasonable effect of the statute, disregarding mere forms of expression, it is clear that the making of the payment by the telegraph company, as a charter fee, of a given per cent of its authorized capital, representing, as that capital clearly does, all of its business and property, both within and outside of the state, a condition of its right to do local business in Kansas, is, in its essence, not simply a tax for the privilege of doing local business in the state, but a burden and tax on the company's interstate business and on its property located or used outside of the state. The express words of the statute leave no doubt as to what is the basis on which the fee specified in the state statute rests. That fee, plainly, is not based on such of the company's capital stock as represented in its local business and property in Kansas. The requirement is a given per cent of the company's authorized capital; that is, all its capital, wherever or however employed, whether in the United States or in foreign countries, and whatever may be the extent of its lines in Kansas as compared with its lines outside of that state. What part of the fee exacted is to be attributed to the company's domestic business in Kansas and what part to interstate business, the state has not chosen to ascertain and declare in the statute. It strikes at the company's entire business, wherever conducted, and its property, wherever located, and, in terms, makes it a condition of the company's telegraph \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 31]\n\u00a0\n right to transact purely local business in Kansas that it shall contribute, for the benefit of the state school fund, a given per cent of its whole authorized capital, representing all of its property and all its business and interests everywhere.\n In Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Atty. Gen. \n125 \nU.S. 549, 550\n, 552 S., 31 L. ed. 793-795, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 961, a tax nominally upon the shares of the capital stock of the company was held to be in effect a tax only on property owned and used by the company in Massachusetts, because, and only because, the basis established for the ascertainment of the value of such property was the proportion of the company's lines in the state to their entire length throughout the whole country. Such a tax was held not to be forbidden by the Constitution, because based on the company's stock representing only its business and its property inside the state. In Ratterman v. Western U. Teleg. Co. \n127 U.S. 411\n, 32 L. ed. 229, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 59, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1127, it was held that a single tax on the receipts of a telegraph company, some of which were derived from interstate commerce and some from intrastate commerce, but capable of separation, was invalid to the extent that the receipts were derived from interstate commerce. The court was confronted with the same situation in Leloup v. Mobile, \n127 \nU.S. 640, 647\n, 32 S. L. ed. 311, 314, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 134, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1380, which case involved the validity of a city ordinance imposing, generally, a specified license tax, 'on telegraph companies.' The ordinance was held invalid because the tax had reference to the entire business of the telegraph company, interstate and domestic, without any distinction being made between the different kinds of business. It was urged in that case that a portion of the telegraph company's business was wholly internal to the state, and therefore was taxable by the state. To this view the response of the court was: 'But that fact does not remove the difficulty. The tax affects the whole business without discrimination. There are sufficient modes in which the internal business, if not already taxed in some other way, may be subjected to taxation, without the imposition of a tax which covers the entire operations of the company.' So, in the case now before us, the exaction, \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 32]\n\u00a0\n as a condition of the privilege of continuing to do or doing local business in Kansas, that the telegraph company shall pay a given per cent of its authorized capital stock, is, for every practical purpose, a tax both on the company's local business in Kansas, and on its interstate business, or on the privilege of doing interstate business; for the statute, by its necessary operation, will accomplish precisely the result that would have been accomplished had it been made, in express words, a condition of doing local business, that the telegraph company should submit to taxation upon both its interstate and intrastate business and upon its interests and property everywhere, as represented by its capital stock. The exaction made by the Kansas statute is as much a tax on the interstate business of the company and on its property outside of the state as a fee or tax on the sale of an article imported only for sale, or as a tax on the occupation of an importer would be a tax on the property imported (Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 444, 6 L. ed. 678, 687); or that a tax on the stock of the United States is a tax on the contract under which it was issued, and a tax on the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States (Weston v. Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 467, 468, 7 L. ed. 481, 487, 488); or that a tax on the salary of an officer of the United States would be a tax on the means employed by the government of the Union to execute its constitutional powers (Dobbins v. Erie County, 16 Pet. 435, 449, 10 L. ed. 1022, 1027); or that a tax on an ordinary bill of lading for property taken out of a state would be a tax on the property covered by that instrument (Almy v. California, 24 How. 169, 16 L. ed. 644 ); or that a tax on the amount of sales made by an auctioneer would be a tax on the goods sold (Cook v. Pennsylvania, \n97 \nU.S. 566, 573\n, 24 S. L. ed. 1015, 1017). But, as already said, what part of the fee exacted by Kansas is to be attributed to intrastate business and what part to interstate business the state has not chosen to ascertain and declare. It has seen proper to exact a specified per cent of the authorized capital of the telegraph company, representing, necessarily, all its business, interstate and intrastate, and all \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 33]\n\u00a0\n its property interests in and out of the state. It is important here to observe-indeed, the contrary could not be asserted-that the telegraph company lawfully entered Kansas, with the consent of both the territory and state, for the purposes of its business of every kind, long before, and was legally there when, the Bush act was passed. The state concedes its right to continue in such business in Kansas, if it will comply with the statute in question, and pay the fee demanded; and only because of such refusal it seeks the aid of the court to oust the company from the state, so far as local business is concerned, unless it shall, by paying such fee, contribute-that is the proper word-a given per cent of all its capital for the support of the schools of the state. The state knows that the telegraph company, in order to accommodate the general public and make its telegraphic system effective, must do all kinds of telegraphic business. Yet, it seeks to enforce a regulation requiring the company by paying the 'fee' in question to assent to its interstate business being burdened and its property outside of Kansas being taxed in order that it may continue to conduct a business concededly beneficial to the public,-a right lawfully acquired from the United States when Kansas was a territory, and exercised consistently with the statutes of the state for many years after Kansas was admitted as a state of the Union.\n But it is said to be well settled that a state, in the exercise of its reserved powers, may prescribe the terms on which a foreign corporation, whatever the nature of its business, may enter and do business within its limits.\n It is true that, in many cases, the general rule has been laid down that a state may, if it chooses to do so, exclude foreign corporations from its limits, or impose such terms and conditions on their doing business in the state as, in its judgment, may be consistent with the interests of the people. But those were cases in which the particular foreign corporation before the court was engaged in ordinary business, and not directly or regularly in interstate or foreign commerce. In Paul v. \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 34]\n\u00a0\n Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 19 L. ed. 357, which sustained the power of the state to exclude foreign insurance companies from its limits, or to impose conditions upon their entering the state for purposes of its business, the court said: 'It is undoubtedly true, as stated by counsel, that the power conferred upon Congress to regulate commerce includes as well commerce carried on by corporations as commerce carried on by individuals. . . . This state of facts forbids the supposition that it was intended in the grant of power to Congress to exclude from its control the commerce of corporations. The language of the grant makes no reference to the instrumentalities by which commerce may be carried on; it is general, and includes alike commerce by individuals, partnerships, associations, and corporations. . . . The defect of the argument lies in the character of their business. Issuing a policy of insurance is not a transaction of commerce. . . . Such contracts are not interstate transactions, though the parties may be domiciled in different states.' In Pensacola Teleg. Co. v. Western U. Teleg. Co. \n96 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 13 S., 24 L. ed. 708, 711, the case of Paul v. Virginia was referred to and the above extract made from its opinion. And the court, speaking by Chief Justice Waite, in the Pensacola Case, said: 'We are aware that, in Paul v. Virginia, supra, this court decided that a state might exclude a corporation of another state from its jurisdiction, and that corporations are not within the clause of the Constitution which declares that 'the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.' Art. 4,  2. That was not, however, the case of a corporation engaged in interstate commerce; and enough was said by the court to show that, if it had been, very different questions would have been presented.'\n Whatever may be the extent of the state's authority over intrastate business, was it competent for the state to require that the telegraph company,-which surely had the right to enter and remain in the state for interstate business,-as a condition of its right to continue doing domestic business in \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 35]\n\u00a0\n Kansas, should pay, in the form of a fee, a specified per cent of its capital stock representing the interests, property, and operations of the company not only in Kansas, but throughout the United States and foreign countries? Is such a regulation consistent with the power of Congress to regulate commerce among the states, or with rights growing out of such commerce, and secured by the Constitution of the United States? Can the state, in this way, relieve its own treasury from the burden of supporting its public schools, and put that burden, in whole or in part, upon the interstate business and property of foreign corporations? Can such a regulation be deemed constitutional any more than one requiring the company, as a condition of its doing intrastate business, that it should surrender its right, for instance, to invoke the protection of the Constitution when it is proposed to deprive it of its property without due process of law, or to deny it the equal protection of the laws? In Lafayette Ins. Co. v. French, 18 How. 404, 407, 15 L. ed. 451, 452, the court, speaking by Mr. Justice Curtis, said: 'A corporation created by Indiana can transact business in Ohio only with the consent, express or implied, of the latter state (Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 13 Pet. 519, 40 L. ed. 274). This consent may be accompanied by such conditions as Ohio may think fit to impose; and these conditions must be deemed valid and effectual by other states and by this court, provided they are not repugnant to the Constitution or laws of the United States.' In Southern P. Co. v. Denton, \n146 \nU.S. 202, 207\n, 36 S. L. ed. 942, 945, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 44, the court considered the question of the validity of a Texas statute relating to foreign corporations desiring to transact business in that state. That statute provided that the application of the corporation to do business in the state should contain a stipulation that the permit be subject to certain provisions of the statute, one of which was that the permit shall become null and void if the corporation, being sued in a state court, should remove the case into a court of the United States upon the ground of the diverse citizenship of the parties or of local prejudice against such corporation. Dealing \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 36]\n\u00a0\n with that point, this court, speaking by Mr. Justice Gray, said: 'But that statute, requiring the corporation, as a condition precedent to obtaining a permit to do business within the state, to surrender a right and privilege secured to it by the Constitution and laws of the United States, was unconstitutional and void, and could give no validity or effect to any agreement or action of the corporation in obedience to its provisions,'- citing Home Ins. Co. v. Morse, 20 Wall. 445, 22 L. ed. 365; Barron v. Burnside, \n121 U.S. 186\n, 30 L. ed. 915, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 295, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 931; Texas Land & Mortg. Co. v. Worsham, 76 Tex. 556, 13 S. W. 384. See also to the same effect, Martin v. Baltimore & O. R. Co. (Gerling v. Baltimore & O. R. Co.) \n151 \nU.S. 673, 684\n, 38 S. L. ed. 311, 315, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 533; St. Clair v. Cox, \n106 \nU.S. 350, 356\n, 27 S. L. ed. 222, 225, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 354; Barrow S. S. Co. v. Kane, \n170 \nU.S. 100, 110\n, 111 S., 42 L. ed. 964, 968, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 526. In the above case of Barron v. Burnside ( which was cited with approval in the Denton Case), this court, speaking by Mr. Justice Blatchford, unanimously held: 'As the Iowa statute makes the right to a permit dependent upon the surrender by the foreign corporation of a privilege secured to it by the Constitution and laws of the United States, the statute requiring the permit must to held to be void. . . . In all the cases in which this court has considered the subject of the granting by a state to a foreign corporation of its consent to the transaction of business in the state, it has uniformly asserted that no conditions can be imposed by the state which are repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United States,' So, in Barrow S. S. Co. v. Kane, above cited, Mr. Justice Gray, delivering the unanimous judgment of the court, said: 'Statutes requiring foreign corporations, as a condition of being permitted to do business within the state, to stipulate not to remove into the courts of the United States suits brought against them in the courts of the state have been adjudged to be unconstitutional and void.' If a domestic corporation engaged in the business of soliciting orders for goods manufactured, sold, and delivered in a state should, in addition, solicit orders for goods manufactured in and to be brought from another state for delivery, could the former state make it a condition of the right to engage in local \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 37]\n\u00a0\n business within its limits that the corporation pay a given per cent of all fees or commissions received by it in its business, interstate and domestic? There can be but one answer to this question, namely, that such a condition would operate as a direct burden on interstate commerce, and therefore would be unconstitutional and void. Consistently with the Constitution no court could, by any form of decree, recognize or give effect to or enforce such a condition.\n We repeat that the statutory requirement that the telegraph company shall, as a condition of its right to engage in local business in kansas, first pay into the state school fund a given per cent of its authorized capital, representing all its business and property everywhere, is a burden on the company's interstate commerce and its privilege to engage in that commerce, in that it makes both such commerce, as conducted by the company, and its property outside of the state, contribute to the support of the state's schools. Such is the necessary effect of the statute, and that result cannot be avoided or concealed by calling the exaction of such a per cent of its capital stock a 'fee' for the privilege of doing local business. To hold otherwise, is to allow form to control substance. It is easy to be seen that if every state should pass a statute similar to that enacted by Kansas, not only the freedom of interstate commerce would be destroyed, the decisions of this court nullified, and the business of the country thrown into confusion, but each state would continue to meet its own local expenses not only by exactions that directly burdened such commerce, but by taxation upon property situated beyond its limits. We cannot fail to recognize the intimate connection which, at this day, exists between the interstate business done by interstate companies and the local business which, for the convenience of the people, must be done, or can generally be better and more economically done, by such interstate companies rather than by domestic companies organized to conduct only local business. It is of the last importance that the freedom of interstate commerce shall \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 38]\n\u00a0\n not be trammeled or burdened by local regulations which, under the guise of regulating local affairs, really burden rights secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States. While the general right of the states to regulate their strictly domestic affairs is fundamental, in our constitutional system, and vital to the integrity and permanence of that system, that right must always be exerted in subordination to the granted or enumerated powers of the general government, and not in hostility to rights secured by the supreme law of the land.\n We need not stop to discuss at length the specific question whether the state can, by any regulation, make the property of the company, outside of Kansas, contribute directly to the support of its schools; such being the effect of the requirement that it pay into the state treasury, for the benefit of the state school fund, a given per cent of all its capital stock as a condition of its doing local business in Kansas. It is firmly established that, consistently with the due-process clause of the Constitution of the United States, a state cannot tax property located or existing permanently beyond its limits. Louisville & J. Ferry Co. v. Kentucky, \n188 \nU.S. 385, 398\n, 47 S. L. ed. 513, 519, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 463; Union Refrigerater Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194, 209\n, 50 S. L. ed. 150, 155, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 36, 4 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 493.\n It is said that the conclusions here announced are not in harmony with some cases heretofore decided by this court. This suggestion is one of serious import, and cannot be passed without consideration, although the careful examination of the cases may greatly extend this opinion. In support of the view just stated, reliance is placed particularly on Osborne v. Florida, \n164 U.S. 650\n, 41 L. ed. 586, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 214; Pullman Co. v. Adams, \n189 U.S. 420\n, 47 L. ed. 877, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 494; Allen v. Pullman's Palace Car Co. \n191 U.S. 171\n, 48 L. ed. 134, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 39; and Security Mut. L. Ins. Co. v. Prewitt, \n202 \nU.S. 246, 248\n, 59 S. L. ed. 1013, 1014, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 619, 6 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 317.\n What was the case of Osborne v. Florida? A certain statute of that state made it a misdemeanor for one to act as agent in the state of an express company doing business there without the payment of a license tax, the amount of which depended upon the number of inhabitants in the city, town, or village where the \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 39]\n\u00a0\n business was conducted. Osborne, without obtaining such a license, and having acted as agent, in Florida, of a Georgia corporation engaged in interstate as well as intrastate business, was proceeded against criminally under the statute. He contended that the statute was invalid, in that it assumed to regulate interstate commerce. The supreme court of Florida held that the statute had no application to interstate commerce, and affected only the business done in the state that was 'local' in its character. And this court, upon writ of error to the supreme court of Florida, held that the company could 'conduct its interstate business without paying the slightest heed to the act, because it does not apply to or in any degree affect the company in regard to that portion of its business which it has the right to conduct without regulation from the state.' As thus construed, the statute was held not to be a regulation of interstate commerce. This court, recognizing the principle announced in Crutcher v. Kentucky, said that 'so long as the regulation as to the license or taxation does not refer to and is not imposed upon the business of the company which is interstate, there is no interference with that commerce by the state statute.' Let it be observed that the license taxes prescribed by Florida were such as to make it clear that its statute applied, and was intended to be applied, only to domestic business within Florida, as measured by the number of inhabitants of the city or town where the business was conducted. It was not imposed on any basis that had reference either to the interstate business or to the property of the company outside of the state. It imposed no burden whatever on interstate business, nor put any obstacle in the way of doing such business; whereas, the statute here involved prohibits a foreign corporation from doing any local business in Kansas unless such corporation first pays into the state's school fund a tax, or, which is the same thing, a fee, in the form of a given per cent of all its eapital, representing all of its business, property, and interests everywhere. The Florida case is somewhat similar in principle to that of Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Atty. Gen. \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 40]\n\u00a0\n above cited, in which it was held that a state tax on the capital stock of the telegraph company was valid when measured, as it was in that case, not by its entire capital, but by the proportion of the company's lines in the state to their entire length throughout the entire country. So, in Osborne v. Florida, the tax was not imposed on the basis of the business of the company, interstate and intrastate, or either separately, but was made to depend alone on the number of inhabitants in the particular city or town where its agency was established. It is manifest that what has been said in the present case is in perfect harmony with the decision in the Osborne Case.\n As to Pullman Co. v. Adams, \n189 \nU.S. 420, 421\n, 47 S. L. ed. 877, 878, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 494, we perceive nothing in the judgment in that case that conflicts with what is herein said. That case involved the validity of a tax of a certain amount imposed by Mississippi on each sleeping and palacecar company carrying passengers 'from one point to another within the state,' and so many cents per mile 'for each mile of railroad track over which the company runs its cars in this state.' It was contended that this tax was an interference with commerce among the states. It is stated in the opinion that the sleeping cars of the Pullman Company, an Illinois corporation, 'were carried by various railroad companies, and all of them were carried into the state from another state, or out of the state to another state, or both. But such cars in their passage also carried passengers from point to point within the state, and a specific fare was collected by the servants of the Pullman Company.' It was contended by the company that the state Constitution made it a common carrier, and, in effect, compelled it to assume the burden of carrying local passengers, although its receipts from purely local business were less than the expense incurred in carrying it on. But the state supreme court held that view of the state Constitution to be fallacious. And this court said: 'If the clause of the state Constitution referred to were held to impose the obligation supposed and to be valid, we assume, without discussion, that the tax would be invalid. For then it \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 41]\n\u00a0\n would seem to be true that the state Constitution and the statute combined would impose a burden on commerce between the states analogous to that which was held bad in Crutcher v. Kentucky, \n141 U.S. 47\n, 35 L. ed. 649, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 851. On the other hand, if the Pullman Company, whether called a common carrier or not, had the right to choose between what points it would carry, and therefore to give up the carriage of passengers from one point to another within the state, the case is governed by Osborne v. Florida, supra. The company cannot complain of being taxed for the privilege of doing local business which it is free to renounce. Both parties agree that the tax is a privilege tax. As the validity of the tax is thus bound up with the effect of the section of the state Constitution, we think that the Pullman Company was entitled to know how it stood under the latter, and that a judgment against it could not be justified by reasoning which leaves that point obscure. We are somewhat embarrassed in dealing with the case, because we are not quite certain whether we rightly interpret the intimations upon the subject in the judgment under review. If the Constitution of Mississippi should be read as imposing an obligation to take local passengers, the question for us might be which, if not both, the clause of the Constitution or the tax act, is invalid. But we assume that the opinion of the supreme court of Mississippi intends to meet the difficulty frankly, and when it says that the argument against the tax drawn from the above interpretation of the Constitution is fallacious, we take it as meaning that no such interpretation will be attempted in the future, and we take it so the more readily that we can see no ground for a different view. If we are right in our understanding, the judgment of the supreme court was correct for the reason sufficiently stated above.' So that what was actually decided in the Adams Case was that the company was under no obligation to take local passengers, but, if it chose to do that kind of business, the privilege for doing it could be taxed by the state. The court did not hold that the state could, in any form, directly burden interstate commerce. It really held to the contrary. \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 42]\n\u00a0\n The Adams Case differs from the present one in this: that while the Mississippi Code imposed no other condition upon the Pullman Company doing local business in that state than that it should pay a certain license tax on that account,-which tax, it may be observed, is not at all disproportioned to such local business, and therefore not to be regarded as a mere device to reach or burden the interstate commerce of the company,- the statute of Kansas forbids the doing of local business within its limits by a corporation of another state or foreign country, except subject to the condition that such corporation first pay to the state a given per cent of its entire capitalization representing the value of all its business, property, and interests within and without the state, thereby placing a direct burden on the privilege or franchise of transacting interstate commerce and taxing property rights beyond the jurisdiction of the state for purposes of taxation. That the Western Union Telegraph Company is engaged in both interstate and intrastate commerce is no reason, in itself, why Kansas may not, in good faith, require it to pay a license tax strictly on account of local business done by it in that state. But it is altogether a different thing for Kansas to deny it the privilege of doing such local business, beneficial to the public, except on condition that it shall first pay to the state a given per cent of all its capital stock, representing all of its property, wherever situated, and all its business in and outside of the state.\n Nor is there any conflict between the views we have expressed and the decision in Allen v. Pullman's Palace Car Co. \n191 \nU.S. 171, 178\n, 179 S., 48 L. ed. 134, 138, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 39. One of the questions in that case was as to the constitutional validity of a Tennessee statute, passed in 1887, which required every company operating sleeping cars and doing business in that state to pay, as a privilege tax, 'on each car, per annum , $500.' The Pullman Car Company operated sleeping cars in Tennessee under a contract with railroad companies traversing the state. The gross receipts of the companies from lines running into the state were, annually, about $500,000, and only about $25,000 annually from pas- \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 43]\n\u00a0\n sengers carried locally in Tennessee. The cars actually used on these lines during each year numbered over one hundred. The court in that case referred to Pickard v. Pullman Southern Car Co. \n117 U.S. 34\n, 29 L. ed. 785, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 635, which involved the validity of a Tennessee act of 1877, imposing a license tax privilege of $50 annually, for each sleeping car or coach used on railroads in the state, and said: 'It was held [in the Pickard Case] that the tax was a burden upon interstate commerce, and void because of the exclusive power of Congress to regulate commerce between the states. Unless the statute now under consideration can be distinguished from the one then construed, the Pickard Case is decisive of the present case. Both taxes were imposed under the power granted by the Constitution of Tennessee to lay a privilege tax. This power is held by the supreme court of the state to give a wide range of legislative discretion. Any occupation, business, employment, or the like, affecting the public, may be classed and taxed as a privilege. Knoxville & O. R. Co. v. Harris, 99 Tenn. 684, 53 L.R.A. 921, 43 S. W. 115. In the act of 1877, the running and using of sleeping cars on railroads in the state, when the cars are not owned by the railroads upon which they are run, is declared to be a privilege. Under the act of 1887, the tax is specifically imposed upon a privilege. Under the act of 1877, the tax imposed was $50 for each car or coach used or run over the road. Under the act of 1887, each company doing business in the state is required to pay $500 per annum for the same privilege. The distinction, except in the amount of annual tax exacted, is without substantial difference. Under the earlier act the tax is required for the privilege of running and using sleeping cars on railroads not owning the cars. In the later act it is exacted for the privilege of doing business in the state. This business consists of running sleeping cars upon railroads not owning the cars, and is precisely the privilege to be paid for under the first act, neither more nor less. In neither act is any distinction attempted between local or through cars of carriers of passengers. The railroads upon which the cars are run are lines traversing \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 44]\n\u00a0\n the state, but not confined to its limits. The cars of the Pullman Company run into and beyond the state as well as between points within the state. The act in its terms applies to cars running through the state as well as those whose operation is wholly intrastate. It applies to all alike, and requires payment for the privilege of running the cars of the company, regardless of the fact whether used in interstate traffic or in that which is wholly within the borders of the state. . . . The statute now under consideration requires payment of the sum exacted for the privilege of doing any business, when the principal thing to be done is interstate traffic. We are not at liberty to read into the statute terms not found therein or necessarily implied, with a view to limiting the tax to local business, which the legislature, in the terms of the act, impose upon the entire business of the company. We are of opinion that taxes exacted under the act of 1887 are void as an attempt by the state to impose a burden upon interstate commerce.' Again, in the same case, the court sustained the validity of a Tennessee act of 1889, which applied 'strictly to business done [by sleeping-car companies] in the transportation of passengers taken up at one point in the state and transported wholly within the state to another point therein.' This court, while recognizing, as former cases had done, the exclusive right of Congress to regulate interstate traffic, said that 'the corresponding right of the state to tax and control the internal business of the state, although thereby foreign or interstate commerce may be indirectly affected, has been recognized with equal clearness,'-citing Osborne v. Florida, \n164 U.S. 650\n, 41 L. ed. 586, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 214. It would seem to be too clear to admit of doubt that the principles in the Allen Case are substantially those herein announced. Indeed, we could not hold otherwise than we do in the present case without overruling or materially modifying the principles announced in the Allen Case. In the Allen Case the license tax there in question under the Tennessee act of 1887 was imposed generally on account of each sleeping car used on railroads traversing the state, without any discrimination being made be- \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 45]\n\u00a0\n tween cars transporting interstate passengers and those transporting local passengers. On that ground the tax was held to be void. In the present case, the state of Kansas demands, in the form of a fee, a given per cent of all the capital of the foreign corporation, without any discrimination between the capital representing the business and property of the telegraph company outside of the state and the capital representing such of its business and property as are wholly local to the state. And it seeks the aid of the court to oust the telegraph company from continuing to do business in the state, so far as local business is concerned, because, and only because, it will not surrender its immunity from state taxation in reference to its interstate business and its property outside of Kansas.\n We come now to the case of Security Mut. L. Ins. Co. v. Prewitt, \n202 \nU.S. 246, 257\n, 50 S. L. ed. 1013, 1018, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 619, 6 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 317, which case, it is contended, necessarily determines the present question in favor of the state of Kansas. In the Prewitt Case this court sustained the constitutional validity of a Kentucky statute providing, among other things, that if a foreign insurance company should bring a suit in a Federal court against a citizen of Kentucky, or, being itself sued in a state court, should remove the suit to the Federal court, without the consent of the other party, any permit previously granted by it to do business in Kentucky should be forthwith revoked by the state insurance commissioner, and the fact of such revocation published in some newspaper of general circulation in the state. No other question was determined. The court regarded the question as concluded in favor of the state by the decision in Home Ins. Co. v. Morse, 20 Wall. 445, 22 L. ed. 365. It said: 'As a state has power to refuse permission to a foreign insurance company to do business at all within its confines, and as it has power to withdraw that permission when once given, without stating any reason for its action, the fact that it may give what some may think a poor reason or none for a valid act is immaterial.' The vital difference between the Prewitt Case and the one now before us is that the business of the \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 46]\n\u00a0\n insurance company, involved in the former case, was not, as this court has often adjudged, interstate commerce, while the business of the telegraph company was primarily and mainly that of interstate commerce. A decision, such as was rendered in the Prewitt Case, that a state could, with or without reason, and without violating the Constitution, revoke its permit to a foreign insurance company to do business of a domestic character within its limits, cannot be cited as authority for the proposition, upon which the Kansas statute rests, that a state may prescribe such regulations as to corporations of other states engaged in both interstate and local business, as will require them, as a condition of their doing local business, that they shall contribute a given amount, out of their capital stock, representing all their business, interstate and domestic, whereever done, and all their property, whereever located, in or outside of the state, for the support of the state's schools. The Prewitt Case by no means recognized any uncontrollable power in a state to prohibit all foreign corporations, in whatever business engaged, from doing business within its limits. On the contrary, this court said in that very case that 'a state has the right to prohibit a foreign corporation from doing business within its borders, unless such prohibition is so conditioned as to violate some provision of the Federal Constitution,'-citing various adjudged authorities, among them the case of Hooper v. California, \n155 \nU.S. 648, 652\n, 653 S., 39 L. ed. 297, 298, 300, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 610, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 207. In the latter case the court recognized, as long settled, the general principle that the right of a foreign corporation to engage in business within the state depended solely on the will of such state. But it took especial care to say that the interstate business of a foreign corporation was a business of an exceptional character, and was protected by the Constitution against interference by state authority. The cases referred to in support of that view are the same as those hereinbefore cited in this opinion. If it be true that the statute of Kansas, by its necessary operation, imposes a burden on the interstate business of the tele- \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 47]\n\u00a0\n graph company, and subjects its property and business outside of that state to taxation, then the constitutional validity of the statute, in the particulars adverted to, may be here adjudged without any reference whatever to the judgment in the Prewitt Case, and without re-examining the grounds upon which that judgment rested. The court did not intend by its judgment in the Prewitt Case to recognize the right of Kentucky, by any regulation as to foreign insurance companies, to burden interstate commerce or to tax property located and used without its limits. It could not have done so without overruling numerous decisions of this court on that subject. On the contrary, as we have seen, the court in that case distinctly recognized the principle that a state could not make any prohibition whatever as to a corporation doing business within its limits that would be in violation of the Federal Constitution. In respect of the point actually decided in it, we leave the Prewitt Case and the objections urged against the doctrine it announces wholly on one side, and go no further now than is indicated in this opinion.\n It results that a decree of ouster, such as the state asks, could not be granted without recognizing the validity of and the giving effect to the unconstitutional requirement that the telegraph company, as a condition of its being allowed to do intrastate business in Kansas, should pay into the state school fund a given per cent of its authorized capital in the form of a fee, based, as in effect it is, on all its property, business, and interests everywhere, including both its interstate and intrastate business and property. Such a decree is asked on the ground that the company has refused to pay such fee. The state court ought to have refused the affirmative relief asked, and dismissed the petition upon the ground that the condition sought to be enforced by a decree of ouster was in violation of the commerce and due-process clauses of the Constitution and of the company's rights under that instrument. The right of the telegraph company to continue the transaction of local business in Kansas could not be made to \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 48]\n\u00a0\n depend upon its submission to a condition prescribed by that state, which was hostile both to the letter and spirit of the Constitution. The company was not bound, under any circumstances, to surrender its constitutional exemption from state taxation, direct or indirect, in respect of its interstate business and its property outside of the state, any more than it would have been bound to surrender any other right secured by the national Constitution.\n There are other aspects of the case involving constitutional questions that might be considered, and which, it is contended, would lead to the same conclusion as is herein indicated. But it is unnecessary to pass on any of the grounds urged by the telegraph company in its defense, other than those made the basis of the decision now rendered. In order to dispose of this case we need not now go further than to hold, as we do, that, for the reasons stated, the state was not entitled to the aid of the court in this case; that the affirmative relief asked by it could not have been granted without practically compelling the telegraph company, as a condition of its doing local business in Kansas, that it should surrender rights belonging to it under the Constitution of the United States, and secured by that instrument against hostile state action; that any such condition was unconstitutional and void; and that the right of the telegraph company to continue doing business in Kansas is not, and cannot be, affected by that condition.\n Mr. Justice Moody heard the argument in this case, participated in its decision, and approves the opinion of the court.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Kansas is reversed and the cause remanded for such proceedings as may be consistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. justice White, concurring:\n It is shown that the telegraph company, many years ago, went into the state of Kansas, constructed its lines, established \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 49]\n\u00a0\n its offices, etc., and has since been engaged in business, both interstate and local. It is not disputed that there was no law in the state forbidding the company from doing as it did. From this it results that the corporation went into the state, constructed its plant, and carried on its business, on the implied invitation, or, at least, with the tacit consent, of the state. No one questions that the tax which is here in dispute, imposed by the law of Kansas upon the corporation, is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States because wanting in due process, and that it is therefore confiscatory in character. The tax being thus conceded to be inherently vicious, there is, of course, no attempt to sustain its validity on its intrinsic merits. The sole contention is that, although the tax is void, the telegraph company may not invoke the protection of the Constitution of the United States, because it is in a position where it is not entitled to avail itself of the fundamental safeguards which it was the purpose of the Constitution to secure to all. The reasoning by which it is thus sought to sustain the right of the state to exert a power prohibited by the Constitution of the United States, and to outlaw the corporation by depriving it of the protection afforded by that instrument, is this: The state, it is insisted, has the right to prevent a foreign corporation from coming into its jurisdiction and engaging there in local business, and this power, in the nature of things, must include the right to affix such conditions to the privilege of coming in as the state chooses to impose. Under these circumstances, the argument proceeds, it becomes immaterial to consider the character of the condition annexed by the state to the enjoyment of the right to come in, since, although such conditions be repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, and destructive of the most obvious and sacred rights, as the condition only becomes operative provided the corporation elects to come in, therefore the condition is not obligatory, but is voluntarily assented to by the corporation, and hence may not be by it questioned. But even if, for the sake of the argument only, \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 50]\n\u00a0\n the general correctness of the proposition be conceded, it has no application to the case here presented. Such is the case, since this cause is concerned not with the power of the state to prevent a corporation from coming in for the purpose of doing local business, and to attach conditions to the privilege of so coming in, but involves the right of the state to confiscate the property of the corporation already within the state, and which has been there for years, devoted to the doing of local business, as the result of the implied invitation or tacit consent of the state, arising from its failure to forbid or to regulate the coming in. In other words, this case involves determining, not how far a state may arbitrarily exclude, but to what extent, after allowing a corporation to come in and acquire property, a state may take its property within the state without compensation, upon the theory that the corporation is not in the state, and has no property right therein which is not subject to confiscation. The difference between the premise upon which the proposition contended for rests and the situation here presented seems to me self-evident. I say this because my mind fails to perceive how the doctrine of election or voluntary assumption of an unconstitutional burden can have any possible application to a case like this. Let me illustrate. The telegraph company has expended in the state large sums of money, adequate for the purpose of enabling it to do both local and interstate business. The investment is there, and its magnitude, it is fair to assume, is, in part, a resultant of the requirements of the local business. The continued beneficial existence of the investment depends upon the right to use the property for the purpose for which it was acquired; that is, for both interstate and local business. The state law takes the property, or what is equivalent thereto, imposes an unconstitutional and confiscatory burden, upon the condition that such burden be discharged or the local business be abandoned. What possible election can there be? The property is in the state. It has been invested therein for the very purpose of doing local as \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 51]\n\u00a0\n well as other business. If the unconstitutional burden be not assumed, local business must cease, and hence the property established for the purpose of doing the local business becomes worthless and is in effect confiscated. If, on the other hand, the unconstitutional burden be borne, a like result takes place.\n Nor, I submit, it there force in the suggestion that, under the facts here disclosed, the company cannot be heard to complain, because, as it was in the state without express authority, it must be assumed to have gone into the state and made its investment subject to the exertion by the state of its authority. I concede the proposition to be soung in so far as it includes the right of the state to exert its lawful powers. That is to say, I concede that the corporation, in going in and investing its property within the state, did so subject to the right of the state to exert, as to the property thus in the state, all lawful powers which might be called into play as to property so situated, of the character of that under consideration. But I cannot assent to the correctness of the contention in so far as it asserts that the state may suffer a corporation to come into its borders, invest in property therein, and then, after having allowed, by acquiescence or implied invitation, such a situation to arise, the state may treat the corporation as if it had never come in and its property within the state as if it were wholly out of the state, and despoil the corporation of its rights and property upon such false assumption.\n It is to be observed that the view taken by me does not deprive the state of power to exert its authority over the corporation and its property in the amplest way, subject to constitutional limitations. It simply prevents the state from driving out the corporation which is in the state by imposing upon it arbitrary and unconstitutional conditions, when upon no possible theory could the right to exact them exist, except upon the assumption that the corporation is not in the state, and that the illegal exactions are the price of the privilege of allowing it to come in. \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 52]\n\u00a0\n Resting, as I do, my concurrence in the decree in this case upon the grounds just previously stated, it becomes unnecessary for me to say anything concerning the wider ground upon which the opinion of the court proceeds, but I do not wish to be understood as dissenting in any respect from the fundamental principle which the opinion of the court embodies and applies.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes, dissenting:\n I think that the judgment of the supreme court of Kansas was right, and it will not take me long to give my reasons. I assume that a state cannot tax a corporation on commerce carried on by it with another state, or on property outside the jurisdiction of the taxing state, and I assume further that, for that reason, a tax on or measured by the value of the total stock of a corporation like the Western Union Telegraph Company is void. But I also assume that it is not intended to deny or overrule what has been regarded as unquestionable since Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 13 Pet. 539, 10 L. ed. 284, that, as to foreign corporations seeking to do business wholly within a state, that state is the master, and may prohibit or tax such business at will. Security Mut. L. Ins. Co. v. Prewitt, \n202 \nU.S. 246, 249\n, 50 S. L. ed. 1013, 1014, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 619, 6 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 317; Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas, \n177 U.S. 28\n, 44 L. ed. 657, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 518; Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 19 L. ed. 357. I make the same assumption as to what has been decided twice, at least, since I have sat on this bench, that the right to prohibit, regulate, or tax foreign corporations in respect of business done wholly within a state is not taken away by the fact that they also are engaged there in commerce among the states. Pullman Co. v. Adams, \n189 U.S. 420\n, 47 L. ed. 877, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 494; Allen v. Pullman's Palace Car Co. \n191 U.S. 171\n, 48 L. ed. 134, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 39.\n If it should be said that the corporation had a right to enter the state for commerce with other states, and, being there, had the same right to use its property as others, I reply that this begs the question, if the premises be granted. If the corporation has the right to enter for one purpose, and the state has \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 53]\n\u00a0\n a right to exclude its entry for another, the two rights can coexist. To say that the disappearance of the latter is an incident of the ownership of property there is to declare that what is allowed only for a limited purpose must have general results. I think it more logical and more true to the scheme of the Union to recognize that what comes in only for a special purpose can claim constitutional protection only in its use for that purpose, and for nothing else. That, at all events, has been decided in the cases to which I have referred.\n Now what has Kansas done? She has not undertaken to tax the Western Union. She has not attempted to impose an absolute liability for a single dollar. She simply has said to the company that, if it wants to do local business, it must pay a certain sum of money, just as Mississippi said to the Pullman Company that, if it wanted to carry on local traffic, it must pay a certain sum. It does not matter if the sum is extravagant. Even in the law the whole generally includes its parts. If the state may prohibit, it may prohibit with the privilege of avoiding the prohibition in a certain way. I hardly can suppose that the provision is made any the worse by giving a bad reason for it or by calling it by a bad name. I quite agree that we must look through form to substance. The whole matter is left in the Western Union's hands. If the license fee is more than the local business will bear, it can stop that business and avoid the fee. Whether economically wise or not, I am far from thinking that the charge is inherently vicious or bad. If the imposition were absolute, or if the attempt were to oust the corporation from the state if it did not pay, the arguments that prevail would be apposite. But the state seeks only to oust the corporation from that part of its business that the corporation has no right to do unless the state gives leave.\n Of course, the suggestion on the other side is that this is an attempt by indirection to break the taboo on the telegraph company's business with other states. The local and the interstate business may be necessary each to the other to make the whole pay. Or the telegraph company might carry on the \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 54]\n\u00a0\n local business at a loss, for the sake of popularity or other indirect sources of gain. In the last case the fee would come out of earnings that the state has no right to touch. But these considerations do not reach their aim. To deny the right of Kansas to do as it chooses with the local business is to require the local business to help to sustain that between the states. If the latter does not pay alone, that is no reason for cutting down powers that up to this time the states always have possessed. If the telegraph company chooses to pay the fee out of its other earnings, that is its affair. It is master of the situation and can stop if it sees fit. Exactly this argument was pressed in Pullman Co. v. Adams, \n189 \nU.S. 420, 421\n, 47 S. L. ed. 877, 878, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 494, and was rejected without dissent. See Ashley v. Ryan, \n153 \nU.S. 436, 444\n, 38 S. L. ed. 773, 777, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 664, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 865.\n What I have said shows, I think, the fallacy involved in talking about unconstitutional conditions. Of course, if the condition was the making of a contract contrary to the policy of the Constitution of the United States, the contract would be void. That was all that was decided in Southern P. Co. v. Denton, \n146 U.S. 202\n, 36 L. ed. 942, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 44. But it does not follow that, if keeping the contract was made a condition of staying in the state, the condition would be void. I confess my inability to understand how a condition can be unconstitutional when attached to a matter over which a state has absolute arbitrary power. This court was equally unable to understand it in Horn Silver Min. Co. v. New York, \n143 \nU.S. 305, 315\n, 36 S. L. ed. 164, 168, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 57, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 403. In that case it was said: 'Having the absolute power of excluding the foreign corporation, the state may, of course, impose such conditions upon permitting the corporation to do business within its limits as it may judge expedient; and it may make the grant or privilege dependent upon the payment of a specific license tax, or a sum proportioned to the amount of its capital.'\n The consequence is the measure of the condition. When the only consequence of a breach is a result that the state may bring about directly in the first place, the condition cannot be unconstitutional. If, after this decision, the state of Kansas, \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 55]\n\u00a0\n without giving any reason, sees fit simply to prohibit the Western Union Telegraph Company from doing any more local business there, or from doing local business until it has paid $20,100, I shall be curious to see upon what ground that legislation will be assailed. I am aware that the battle has raged with varying fortunes over this matter of unconstitutional conditions, but it appears to me ground for regret that the court so soon should abandon its latest decision (Security Mut. L. Ins. Co. v. Prewitt, \n202 U.S. 246\n, 50 L. ed. 1013, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 619, 6 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 317).\n Finally, in the absence of contract, the power of the state is not affected by the fact that the corporation concerned already is in the state, or even has been there for some time. Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas, \n177 U.S. 28\n, 44 L. ed. 657, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 518; National Council v. State Council, \n203 \nU.S. 151, 163\n, 51 S. L. ed. 132, 137, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 46. Whatever the corporation may do or acquire there is infected with the original weakness of dependence upon the will of the state. This is a general principle, illustrated by many cases. Thus, a water company cannot take away the power of a city to establish rates by making contracts with its customers. Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville, \n189 \nU.S. 434, 438\n, 47 S. L. ed. 887, 891, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 531. Private individuals cannot cut down the police power by their arrangements together. Manigault v. Springs, \n199 \nU.S. 473, 480\n, 50 S. L. ed. 274, 278, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 127. A city cannot limit the power of the legislature over property by making a lease. Browne v. Turner, 176 Mass. 9, 15, 56 N. E. 969. Or, to pass at once to the most recent and most conspicuous example, the power of Congress to regulate commerce among the states cannot be affected by the acquisition of property or growth of values dependent upon the continuance of its assent. United States ex rel. Atty. Gen. v. Delaware & H. Co. \n213 \nU.S. 366, 405\n, 406 S., 53 L. ed. 836, 847, 848, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 527. In that case an enormous amount of property had been built up under direct encouragement from the states in which it was situated, and was saved from destruction only by the restricted meaning given to the act of Congress. The unrestricted power of Congress was affirmed in strong terms. See also Union Bridge Co. v. United States, \n\n[216 U.S. 1, 56]\n\u00a0\n \n204 \nU.S. 364, 394\n, 51 S. L. ed. 523, 536, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 367. In Horn Silver Min. Co. v. New York, \n143 U.S. 305\n, 36 L. ed. 164, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 57, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 403, the corporation showed by its answer that it had employed part of its capital in manufacturing in New York. It had got into the state and was at work there, yet it was held liable to pay a percentage of its entire capital, although the greater part was outside the state. But furthermore, it is a short answer to this part of the argument that, in the present case, according to decisions relied upon by the majority, the state could not have prevented the entry of the corporation, because it entered for the purpose of commerce with other states.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice McKenna concur in this dissent.\n The late Mr. Justice Peckham took part in the consideration of the case and agreed with the minority. \n\n\n\n","196":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWETMORE v.

The defendants are the same corporations as those mentioned in Ladew v. Tennessee Copper Co. just decided.

Each defendant appeared specially,-the defendant the Tennessee corporation, for the purpose of objecting to the jurisdiction of the circuit court of the United States, sitting in Tennessee, to give the relief asked by the bill against it, and the British corporation for the purpose of moving to dismiss the bill because of misjoinder of parties, and because of want of jurisdiction in that court to sustain an action against it in Tennessee for the wrong alleged to have been done to the present plaintiffs.\n The circuit court dismissed the bill as to the Tennessee Copper Company, but overruled the motion to dismiss the bill as to the British corporation, the court being of the opinion that it had jurisdiction of the latter corporation. From that decree, so far as it related to the Tennessee Copper Company, Wetmore appealed to this court.

The court sustained its action by an elaborate opinion, and subsequently stated, in a formal way, its findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n The evidence is not in the record, although a portion of the testimony is contained in the formal findings of fact, upon the theory that this was necessary to preserve the right to review the action of the court concerning objection urged by the defendants to the admission of certain testimony tendered on behalf of the complainants. The record, we are constrained to say, is unsatisfactory and confused,-a condition which we assume has resulted from circumstances referred to by the court below in the opening passage of its opinion, as follows:\n'This is a creditor's bill filed June 23, 1902, and permitted to remain on the docket of this court during the five years that have since intervened, without any apparent proper or sufficient cause for the unwarranted delay, and with infinite inconvenience to many parties connected with the subjectmatter \n\n[217 U.S. 47, 49]\n\u00a0\n OF THE CONTROVERSY. THE FIRST TWO YEARs and a half of the timE seem to have been taken up with a battle over the proceedings, trying to get the answers of the several respondents settled, and during which time complainants' exceptions to several of the answers were referred to a master, arguments had before him, his report filed, exceptions to the same presented, arguments had on the latter, and briefs submitted in support thereof, and so on, in an interminable and fruitless contest of petitions, motions, exceptions, pleas, demurrers, orders, affidavits, and rules to show cause, without result or real merit, as we see it. The next year and a half seem to have been taken up somewhat in the same way, and also partly in an application for a receivership and in opposing efforts to the same, and in efforts to prevent outside parties from foreclosing several mortgages they had on some of the premises involved, that they had secured in the meantime, in enjoining them from so proceeding, and in issuing rules as for contempt against them for their action in that behalf, etc.' [ 3 Porto Rico Fed. Rep. 126.]\n\n In order to in some measure dispel the obscurity which must arise from the circumstances just referred to, we briefly state, in their chronological order, certain unquestioned facts which gave rise to the controversy, and also outline the pleadings and proceedings, the whole for the purpose of enabling us to adequately test the sufficiency of the errors assigned.\n For many years the firm of J. Tornabells & Company, composed of Joaquin Tornabells and Carlos Doitteau, was established in Porto Rico and there carried on a mercantile business. The firm was the owner of various trading establishments and warehouses, was, besides, the owner of considerable real estate, embraced in which were extensive coffee plantations which the firm carried on, including the buildings, machinery, and appurtenances incident thereto. It is not disputed that, presumably as the result of losses occasioned by a disastrous hurricane which devastated the island of Porto Rico, the firm, prior to 1900, had become temporarily embarrassed, and, under provisions of the local law, had obtained in a local court \n\n[217 U.S. 47, 50]\n\u00a0\n an extension of time for the payment of its debts. While we state the fact as to the suspension, we shall nevertheless indulge in the assumption that such fact has no material bearing upon the questions here to be decided. We do this because no rights based upon such fact were asserted in the bill of complaint or passed upon by the court, and no right of such a character is asserted in the assignments of error or referred to in the elaborate argument filed on behalf of the appellants, the appellees not having appeared in this court, either orally or by brief.\n On May 9, 1900, Tornabells & Company, by deed before a notary public, conveyed to Luis Aran y Lanci the following property, as stated by the court below: 'Its place of business and other town property, its stock of merchandise and twenty-six several pieces of real estate, most of them being coffee plantations and their appurtenances.' The stated price was 197,700 pesos, provincial money, 30,000 declared to have been paid in cash, and the remainder to be paid in ten instalments of 16,770 pesos, bearing no interest, maturing respectively from one to ten years. A few days thereafter, on May 11, 1900, Aran y Lanci mortgaged for 150,000 pesos nineteen of the twenty-six pieces of real estate thus conveyed to him. This mortgage was in favor of one Baudelio Duran y Cat and a firm styled Duran & Coll. The mortgage in favor of the first was for 130,000 pesos, divided into ten annual instalments of 13,000 pesos each, evidenced by notes to the order of the mortgagee, maturing in each of the ten years, the whole being secured on fourteen of the twenty-six pieces of real estate. The mortgage in favor of Duran & Coll was on five of the pieces of real estate acquired as aforesaid, and secured 20,000 pesos, divided into five instalments of 4,000 pesos each, maturing in each of five years. These mortgages were not indivisible, as the amount of each was apportioned among the various pieces of real estate, so that each piece was liable only for the sum secured on it. The sale to Aran y Lanci was recorded on May 21, and the mortgages just stated \n\n[217 U.S. 47, 51]\n\u00a0\n on May 24, 1900. On June 25, 1900, the mortgage for 20,000 pesos, which had been executed in its favor by Aran y Lanci, was assigned by the firm of Duran & Coll to Raimundo Valdecillo to secure an indebtedness due him by the firm of 6,000 pesos provincial money, and this assignment was duly registered on July 5, 1900. Sixteen months after the conveyance to Aran y Lanci,-that is, on September 16, 1901,-the firm of Tornabells & Company acknowledged by notarial act that Aran y Lanci had, by anticipation, fully paid the deferred purchase price (167,700 pesos). Nine months after such acknowledgment Aran y Lanci mortgaged in favor of the Banco de Solleir, to secure 32,780 pesetas, Spanish money, one of the pieces of property previosuly mortgaged to Duran y Cat. On July 5, 1902, this mortgage was put upon record. A few days before it was so put upon record, viz., on June 23, 1902, the suit before us was commenced.\n The bill-which was not sworn to-was originally filed on behalf of three commercial firms, Will & Company of Cuba, David Midgley & Sons of Manchester, England, and Ramon Cortado & Company of Ponce, Porto Rico, and the members of said firms, in their own behalf and in behalf of all others similarly situated who might intervene in the cause. It was alleged that the complainants were creditors of the firm of Tornabells & Company at the time of the conveyance to Aran y Lanci and the execution of the mortgages by Aran y Lanci, above recited, and that, subsequent to said transactions, the claims of the complainants had been merged into judgments against the firm, obtained in the court where the bill was filed, and that on such judgments executions had issued and been returned unsatisfied. It was further alleged that the conveyance made by Tornabells & Company to Aran y Lanci, and the mortgages put by the latter upon the property in favor of Duran y Cat, and the firm of Duran & Coll, were fraudulent simulations, and that the property covered by the conveyance and the mortgages continued to belong to the firm, and was held by Aran y Lanci under a secret trust in favor of Tornabells & Company, the con- \n\n[217 U.S. 47, 52]\n\u00a0\n veyance and mortgages being mere fictitious devices adopted between the parties for the purpose of screening the property from creditors, or hindering and delaying them in the recovery of their claims. It was further charged that, at the time of the transactions referred to, Tornabells & Company was insolvent, that the alleged price mentioned in the conveyance to Aran y Lanci was largely below the real value of the property, and that, despite the alleged conveyance and mortgages, the firm of Tornabells & Company continued to control the property conveyed and enjoy the fruits thereof. The prayer of the bill in substance was that a receiver of the property might be appointed, that the conveyance and subsequent mortgages and transfers should be declared to be fraudulent and void and be vacated and annulled, and that the property and each and every parcel thereof should be decreed to be subject to the lien of the several judgments. Tornabells and Doitteau, the members of that firm, Aran y Lanci, Duran y Cat, and Duran & Coll, and the members of that firm, were made defendants to the bill. Valdecillo, to whom the mortgage executed by Arany Lanci in favor of Duran & Coll had been assigned, was also joined as defendant, he being called upon to establish the verity of his alleged lien. Alfredo Saliva, who was alleged to be the attorney in fact of, and to have acted for, Aran y Lanci in the transactions set out in the bill, was also made a defendant.\n Separate sworn answers were filed on behalf of the members of the firm of Tornabells & Company, traversing the allegations of insolvency and of simulation and fraud, both as respected the conveyance to Aran Lanci and the mortgages executed by the latter. The answers contained affirmative allegations as to the good faith of the conveyance to Aran y Lanci, the adequacy of the consideration, and full payment thereof prior to the commencement of suit. The taking possession by and the exclusive control and management of the property conveyed, and receipt of the fruits thereof by Arany Lanci for his exclusive use and benefit was also averred. An answer \n\n[217 U.S. 47, 53]\n\u00a0\n substantially of like tenor, also sworn to, was filed on behalf of Arany Lanci. Juan Coll, a partner in the firm of Duran & Coll, also answered, and averred the bona fides of the mortgage executed by Aran y Lanci to his firm, and the transfer thereof made to Valdecillo.\n On October 31, 1904, the firm of L. W. & P. Armstrong of New York city, unsecured creditors of Tornabells & Company, were made parties complainant to the bill. Thereafter, Ruffer & Sons, a firm doing business in London, England, and the Caja de Ahorros de Mayaguez, a Porto Rican corporation, as creditors of Tornabells & Company, were also allowed to intervene and become parties complainant.\n Early in 1905, Tornabells died and the cause was revived as to him against his widow and children as his heirs. In November of the same year Aran y Lanci died, and the cause was revived against his widow, as administratrix of his estate. Doitteau, the surviving partner of Tornabells & Company, died on January 22, 1907, and the cause was revived against his widow and children.\n Duran y Cat, an original defendant to the bill-in whose favor, as we have stated, Aran y Lanci had mortgaged fourteen of the pieces of real estate for 130,000 pesos-was not served with process and did not enter his appearance. He also died during the pendency of the cause. On February 12, 1907, upon motion of the complainants, an order was entered dismissing the cause as to the heirs of said Duran y Cat, 'on the ground that said heirs, being out of the jurisdiction, and having entirely disposed of their interest in the cause, are not indispensable parties thereto.'\n Journal entries are contained in the record, showing that more than a dozen firms or individuals became additional defendants in the cause. The time when they came in and the nature of the pleadings by them filed or the proceedings had concerning their rights do not distinctly appear. It is, however, fairly inferable that these new defendants came in long after the commencement of the suit, either during or \n\n[217 U.S. 47, 54]\n\u00a0\n subsequent to the dilatory and confused proceedings referred to by the court in the excerpt heretofore made from its opinion, and that such defendants asserted rights claimed to have been acquired, after the filing of the bill, in the property affected by the suit, either as purchasers or as holders of mortgage notes. In this connection it is to be observed that neither when the suit was commenced nor at any time during its progress was the court requested by the complainants to award a cautionary notice, to be placed upon the public records, as a means of warning to parties who might deal with the property in controversy, thus preserving against them, pendente lite, the rights which might be ultimately established as existing in the complainants, and which would not have been preserved by the mere pendency of the suit, unaccompanied with the allowance and registry of the statutory cautionary notice.\n Answers or amended answers were filed on behalf of the widow and administratrix of Tornabells, and by the guardian ad litem who was appointed for his minor children. An answer was also filed on behalf of the widow and administratrix and minor children of Doitteau. This also was the case as to the widow and administratrix of Aran y Lanci. These various answers were substantially in accord with those which had been previously filed on behalf of the original defendants, except that in one of them the prescription of one year was pleaded. It is inferable from the record that at this stage of the proceedings, or, at all events, at a time not earlier than four years after the commencement of the suit, certain persons who had acquired rights in or to the property, either directly from Aran y Lanci or through the mortgage executed in favor of Duran y Cat and Duran & Coll, sought to enforce their claims and were enjoined from so doing. At about the same time a receiver was appointed. The record is silent, however, as to whether the receivership was intended to apply to all the property in controversy, or whether the receiver attempted to take possession under his appointment, although it would seem that to some extent he did so, since by the \n\n[217 U.S. 47, 55]\n\u00a0\n final decree the receiver was ordered to settle his accounts, etc.\n It came at last to pass in the spring of 1907 that the cause was heard and taken under advisement. It was disposed of in the summer of that year by the entry of a final decree dismissing the bill, and was followed nearly six months thereafter, on Docember 19, 1907, by the making of formal findings of fact and conclusions of law applicable thereto.\n The facts found are embraced in fourteen numbered paragraphs. The first merely states in general terms the filing of the bill, makes allusion to the complicated proceedings which followed, the dismissal as to some of the defendants (presumably the heirs of Duran y Cat), the coming in of other parties, the ultimate joinder of issue, and the submission of the cause. In the second is stated the fact that evidence was heard on behalf of the complainants and the submission of a motion for a decree dismissing the bill on two grounds; viz., the failure to prove the allegations of the bill and the prescription of one year. The third finding is as follows:\n'3. The domumentary evidence introduced on behalf of complainants and the testimony of all the witnesses do not prove the allegations of the bill so as to entitle the complainants to a decree in their favor, declaring the conveyance from defendants Tornabells & Company to defendant Aran, and the mortgage from defendant Aran to defendants Duran y Coll and Duran personally to be voluntary, or made to hinder and delay the complainants in the collection of their debts.'\n\n The fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth paragraphs, in a summary way, find substantially, as we have stated them, the facts concerning the conveyance by Tornabells & Company to Aran y Lanci, the execution of the mortgages in favor of Duran y Cat and Duran & Coll, and the divisibility of those mortgages, as well as the fact that the claims upon which the complainants sued, although in existence, were not reduced to judgment until some time after the execution of the conveyances and mortgages in question. In \n\n[217 U.S. 47, 56]\n\u00a0\n one of the paragraphs it is stated that the property conveyed by Tornabells & Company was substantially all that was owned by the firm at the time of the conveyance, and that Duran y Cat was a relative of the senior member of Tornabells & Company. By the tenth paragraph it is found that the mortgage asserted by the Banco de Sollier was one which Aran y Lanci had executed in favor of that bank on one of the properties acquired by him from Tornabells & Company, and was given to secure a debt due by that firm to the bank, that Aran y Lanci incurred no personal responsibility, and that he produced, as paid, the mortgage note identified with the act of mortgage executed in favor of Duran y Cat, which had been released or extinguished so far as the particular property was concerned. The eleventh paragraph stated that the mortgage asserted by the firm of Fritze, Lundt, & Company, on one of the pieces of property conveyed to Aran y Lanci, was executed by the latter in favor of Fritze, Lundt, & Company to secure the payment of a current account for supplies furnished for the cultivation of properties included in the conveyance from Tornabells & Company to Aran y Lanci, and that previous to the giving of the mortgage the advances made by the firm were secured by a pledge of one of the mortgage notes executed by Aran y Lanci in favor of Duran y Cat, which, when Aran y Lanci mortgaged the property in favor of the firm of Fritze, Lundt, & Company, was produced by him as the owner thereof and canceled. In this case, also, no personal responsibility was assumed by Aran y Lanci. The twelfth and thirteenth paragraphs state sales by Aran y Lanci, in 1903 and 1905, to named persons, of pieces of the property acquired by him from Tornabells & Company, and the production by Aran y Lanci, as extinguished and paid, of the mortgage notes resting upon the property so conveyed, identified with the mortgage in favor of Duran y Cat. The fourteenth paragraph simply enbraced a general statement of the release of the Duran y Cat mortgage on the properties referred to in the tenth to the thirteenth paragraphs, inclusive, and that the mortgages and conveyances referred to in \n\n[217 U.S. 47, 57]\n\u00a0\n such paragraphs 'were, in each and every case, duly recorded in the registry of property prior to any record in the registry of property of the judgments obtained by complainants herein against Tornabells & Company, referred to in paragraph nine.'\n From the facts thus found the court drew the following conclusions of law:\n'1. That the proof on behalf of complainants is not sufficient to entitle them to any relief under their bill of complaint.\n\n'2. That there is not now, and never was, any such statute in Porto Rico as the statute of 13th Elizabeth in England, referring to fraudulent conveyances, because we have the civil-law rule here instead of the common law. Every state in the Union has a re-enactment of the statute of Elizabeth in some form or other among its laws. In the absence of it there is no rule of law preventing a debtor, even when insolvent, for even that does not take from him the power of disposition of his property, and paying his debts with it, or a portion of his debts, and preferring one or more of his creditors with absolute intent to hinder, delay, or even to defeat other creditors. If the favored creditor receives no more than is due him, and permits the debtor to secure no advantage to himself, the transaction will be upheld.\n\n'3. That the statute of limitations of one year, as fixed by article 37 of the mortgage law, is applicable to suits like the one at bar.\n\n'4. That complainants, under the pleadings and proofs herein, are not entitled to subject the properties described in the bill of complaint herein to any lien, interest, or decree by which the complainants would be entitled to have the conveyance and mortgages described in said bill of complaint canceled and annulled for the benefit of the said complainants.\n\n'5. That the bill of complaint should be dismissed.'\n\n These conclusions were followed by the reproduction of portions of the testimony to preserve the right to review cer- \n\n[217 U.S. 47, 58]\n\u00a0\n tain rulings of the court respecting testimony offered on behalf of the complainants.\n The assignments of error are seven in number. The seventh we at once put out of view, as it only charges generally that the court erred in dismissing the bill of complaint.\n The sixth, fifth, and fourth assignments concern rulings as to the admissibility of testimony, and the third complains of the action of the court maintaining the plea of prescription of one year. As these assignments cannot be disposed of without, in some respect, appreciating the merits, we temporarily forego considering them.\n The remaining assignments, that is, the first and second, are as follows:\n'First, the court erred in finding as matter of law that in Porto Rico there was no rule of law preventing a debtor, even though insolvent, from preferring one creditor over others, with absolute intent to hinder, delay, or even defeat the just claims of said others.\n\n'Second, the court erred in finding as matter of law, from the facts found, that the above rule of law was applicable, and in not finding as matter of law that the applicable rule was that a debtor could not transfer his property without any consideration, for the purpose of delaying or defeating the just claims of his creditors.'\n\n It is apparent that these propositions assert that a twofold error was committed: first, in not applying to the facts as found the legal principle rightfully applicable; and, second, by erroneously stating the law in the irrelevant proposition which was mistakenly applied in deciding the cause. The first contention rests upon the theory that the facts found established that the conveyance and mortgages which the bill assailed were mere fraudulent simulations, and upon this assumption insists that the case should have been controlled by the law applicable to that state of fact, instead of being governed, as it was, by considering how far, as a matter of law, a debotr, being insolvent, had a right, through a real and \n\n[217 U.S. 47, 59]\n\u00a0\n bona fide transaction, to prefer one or more of his creditors. But when the findings of facts are considered, it is manifest that the premises upon which the proposition rests is a false one, since it cannot be indulged in without disregarding the findings. We say this is manifest, because the third finding of fact, which we have already quoted, expressly declares that the documentary evidence introduced on behalf of the complainants and the testimony of all the witnesses did not establish that the conveyance from Tornabells & Company to Aran y Lanci, and the mortgage made by him to the firm of Duran & Coll and to Dnran y Cat, individually, were 'voluntarily made to hinder and delay the complainants in the collection of their debts.' The error which would have resulted from applying the doctrine applicable to a mere simulated transfer to a case where the findings established that simulation was not shown is self- evident. This result, which necessarily arises from a consideration of the mere text of the third finding, is also demonstrated if that finding be contemplated in the light of the issues which the cause presented in connection with the other findings and all the conclusions of law which were deduced therefrom and applied in deciding the cause. The essential charge which the complaint made was the fraudulent and simulated character of the conveyance and mortgages which were assailed. That issue was, therefore, the controlling question to be decided. Considering the findings, as we have previously fully stated them, it is, we think, clear that the third finding was intended by the court as a statement of its conclusion of fact as to that controlling issue, and that the first conclusion of law which the court stated, that is, the insufficiency of the proof to justify recovery by the complainants, was intended as the legal resultant of the finding which had established that there had been a failure to prove the charge of simulation.\n We think it is also clear that the second proposition of law which the court announced, that is, the right of a debtor under the Porto Rico law, although insolvent, to give a \n\n[217 U.S. 47, 60]\n\u00a0\n preference, in no way detracted from or modified the previous finding and conclusion as to the absence of proof of simulation or purpose to hinder and delay creditors in the conveyance from Tornabells & Company to Aran y Lanci and the Duran y Cat and the Duran & Coll mortgage, but was solely intended as responsive to the findings in other respects. That is to say, we think the second finding of law was responsive to the facts found in the paragraphs other than number three, which tended to establish that, even although the sale from Tornabells & Company to Aran y Lanci was not simulated, and not intended to hinder and delay creditors, nevertheless Aran y Lanci had discharged a portion of the credit price which he had agreed to pay by making payments to third persons, creditors of the firm of Tornabells & Company, in extinguishment of the indebtedness of the firm to such creditors, and thus, to the extent of such payments, preferring the creditors paid out of the price due to Tornabells & Company as the result of the sale.\n Indeed, unless the appreciation which we have just made of the findings and the conclusions of law deduced therefrom be correct, it would cause the findings of fact to be absolutely silent on the issue of simulation, although that issue was the controlling one in the cause,-an issue, indeed, so essential that it is impossible to conceive that the cause could have been disposed of on its merits without a finding on the subject. But if the findings could be thus envisaged, the inquiry would be at once suggested whether they were not so manifestly irresponsive to the case as made by the pleadings and to the facts necessarily involved in the decision rendered as to cause them to be no findings at all, and therefore to require at our hands an affirmance of the judgment because of the substantial absence of any finding to enable us to review. Gray v. Howe, \n108 U.S. 12\n, 27 L. ed. 634, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 136. Concerning this suggestion, however, we express no opinion, since we do not consider that the findings are of the unsubstantial and irrelevant character which would result from attributing to them the construction contended for by the appellants. \n\n[217 U.S. 47, 61]\n\u00a0\n Our conclusion that the findings of fact exclude the contention concerning the simulated character of the assailed contracts renders it unnecessary to review the authorities cited in argument to establish the proposition, which is not challenged, that, under the law of Porto Rico, creditors possess the right to set aside mere fraudulent and simulated contracts or conveyances made by their debtor to or in favor of an interposed person, in order to place the property of the debtor apparently in the name or under the control of such person for the purpose of defeating creditors.\n The substantial foundation upon which the cause was based, that is, the issue as to the simulation of the conveyance to Aran y Lanci and the mortgage to Duran y Cat and the firm of Duran & Coll being disposed of, the remaining contentions are free from difficulty. We say this because, although it is elaborately insisted that, putting the question of simulation out of view, the court was wrong in its second legal conclusion to the effect that the law of Porto Rico did not avoid a real and otherwise valid contract merely because its result was to prefer one or more creditors of the debtor making the contract, we think such contention is shown by the record to be an afterthought, or, if not, is unsupported by the provisions of law which are cited to maintain it. An afterthought because the entire theory of the bill was opposed to the conception that the assailed transactions merely embodied preferences giving rise to a revocatory action, that is, merely to have an otherwise valid contract revoked. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine that the action in any aspect was considered as but revocatory in character, when it is borne in mind that although the mortgage in favor of Duran y Cat covered fifteen pieces of real estate securing 130,000 pesos, he was not served with process, and after his death, on motion of the complainants, the cause was dismissed as to his heirs, upon the theory that they had no interest in the result. We say that the contention as to preference, if not an afterthought, is unsupported by the provisions of law relied upon, \n\n[217 U.S. 47, 62]\n\u00a0\n since those which are referred to plainly relate to cases of simulation, and, even if applicable to a question of preference, tend to support the view stated by the court in its second conclusion of law. For instance, the military order of March 5, 1899, deals with simulated transfers, and, when its context is considered, we think also concerns alone sales made seemingly for cash, and therefore, for a twofold reason, is inapposite to the question of mere preference arising from a contract for a legal consideration, although not immediately payable in cash. So, also, the general provisions of article 1101 of the Civil Code, providing that those who fraudulently neglect to fulfil their obligations are liable in damages; those of article 1275, declaring that contracts without a consideration, or with illicit consideration, can have no legal effect; and the terms of article 1276, providing that the statement of a false consideration in contracts shall render them void, unless it be proven that they were based on another and licit consideration,-may be put out of view, since they simply announce undisputed propositions of law which are not involved in the case before us, and which are not disputed by anyone. And a like reason is also adequate to dispose of the contention based upon the third paragraph of article 1291 of the Civil Code, which embraces in the enumeration of contracts which may be rescinded, 'those executed in fraud of creditors, when the latter cannot recover in any other manner what is due them.' We say this, since this provision clearly limits the right of the creditor to rescind to cases where he cannot otherwise recover his debt without resorting to an action for rescission, and even in such case, only confers such right where the contract sought to be rescinded is one which is in fraud of his rights. To contend, as is in effect done in the argument at bar, that the article gives to a creditor a right to sue to rescind any contract made by his insolvent dobtor, simply because, without rescission, the creditor cannot otherwise recover his debt, is to distort the clause by misconceiving its obvious meaning. The power to seek rescission being thus \n\n[217 U.S. 47, 63]\n\u00a0\n limited to contracts which are in fraud of the rights of the creditor, the question is, Did the court below err in holding that, under the law of Porto Rico, contracts made by an insolvent debtor which were not fraudulent simulations, because made upon adequate consideration, are not susceptible of being rescinded merely because there execution operated a preference in favor of a creditor? We are cited to no express provision of the local law, or referred to any decision so interpreting that law, and we think an analysis of the provisions of the local law relied upon for the purpose of inferentially showing that the court below erred, clearly not only do not support, but refute, the contention we are considering. Thus, the provision expressly authorizing the right to rescind payments made by an insolvent debtor on account of obligations which, at the time of making the payments, the debtor could not be compelled to make (Civil Code, art. 1292), plainly import the validity of such a payment under other circumstances. So, also, the provision creating a presumption of fraud as to alienations for valuable consideration, made by an insolvent debtor against whom a condemnatory judgment has been rendered or a writ of seizure of property has been issued (Civil Code, art. 1297), also gives rise to the inference that where these circumstances do not exist the contrary rule would apply. And the inferences which are deducible from the text of the Code are cogently fortified by a consideration of the mortgage law. Thus, while the law contains an enumeration of the suits which may be brought for the rescission of conveyances made for the purpose of defrauding creditors, and includes those made without consideration when the third person was a party to the fraud (mortgage law, arts. 36 and 37), it does not mention the case of a mere preference resulting from a contract made for an otherwise valuable consideration. So, also, in article 39, the conveyance without consideration to defraud creditors is expressly limited to those where 'there was no price or its equivalent, or any pre-existing obligation which had fallen \n\n[217 U.S. 47, 64]\n\u00a0\n due,'-an affirmative prohibition which would seem necessarily to exclude a right to rescind a contract because of mere preference, where there was a price or its equivalent, or where the consideration was a pre-existing obligation which had fallen due.\n The foregoing considerations cause it to be unnecessary to pass on the error which it is alleged was committed in maintaining the plea of prescription of one year. It remains, therefore, only to dispose of the errors based upon the action of the court in disposing of objections to testimony. They relate to two subjects; the first, to objections made to the admissibility of the testimony of Mr. Cornwell, one of the attorneys of record of the complainants, concerning statements made to him by members of the firm of Tornabells & Company in reference to their intention to dispose of or mortgage their property, and the other, to the testimony of the same witness concerning statements made to him by the widow of Tornabells after the death of her husband, and during the pendency of the cause, as to alleged conversations had by her with her husband, tending to show simulation of the contracts which were assailed. To pass upon the contentions on these subjects, a statement of what transpired at the time the evidence in question was proffered, and of the action of the court thereon, is essential. While testimony was being taken in open court, Mr. Cornwell, one of the attorneys for the complainants, was offered as a witness on their behalf. It developing at once from the questions put to him that the purpose was to draw from the witness statements made to him by the members of the firm of Tornabells & Company shortly before the assailed conveyance and mortgage were executed, objection was made that such statements were incompetent, because, at the time they were made, Cornwell was the attorney for the firm and its members, and therefore the statements were not admissible, because privileged communications. Thereupon the examining counsel, while not denying that, at the time the statements were made, the relation of attorney and client existed, insisted that the \n\n[217 U.S. 47, 65]\n\u00a0\n statements were admissible, because their character was such as to cause them to be outside of the privilege. The court declaring that it would reserve its ruling on the objection until it had an opportunity to examine the subject during the noon recess, the examination of the witness proceeded for the purpose of showing his professional relation to the firm of Tornabells & Company at the time of the making of the statements. When the court convened after the recess, the subject of the admissibility of the offered testimony was at once taken up. The court intimating doubt on the subject, the counsel making the objection declared that he had witnesses present by whom he expected to prove that Mr. Cornwell not only was the confidential legal adviser of Tornabells & Company at the time the statements were made to him concerning which it was desired to question him, but that he continued to act for that firm as their attorney after the assailed contracts made up to the time of the bringing of this suit. Answering this statement, the counsel for complainants declared that his position was that the offered proof was irrelevant in view of the ruling in Dent v. Ferguson, \n132 U.S. 50\n, 33 L. ed. 242, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 13, to the effect that the privilege did not extend to statements made by a client to his attorney, of the intention of the client to commit a fraud. The court then announced as follows: 'I am going to permit Mr. Cornwell to testify, reserving the right to see what it is, giving to all the counsel a right to except.' Upon this announcement, counsel for the defendants insisted upon being permitted to call witnesses to establish the existence of the professional relation of the witness with the firm, as previously stated, and proceeded to do so. After testimony had been given and documentary evidence introduced without objection, tending to show the existence of the relation of attorney and client between the witness and the firm of Tornabells & Company, in accordance with the previous declaration as to what was proposed to be proven on that subject, the court interrupted the taking of the testimony as follows: \n\n[217 U.S. 47, 66]\n\u00a0\n The court: It doesn't change the court's mind as to admitting the testimony in the way it intimates. It will let it in.\n Mr. Dexter: I desire to except against that ruling.\n The court: Give an exception to all counsel that wish it.\n Mr. Dexter: I want my objection to clearly appear: (1) It is incompetent because of the relation of attorney and client; (2) it is incompetent under the United States statute; and (3) because of the party being dead.\n Mr. Boerman: I want an exception to every question given.\n The witness Cornwell was then recalled and was fully examined and cross-examined, not only in regard to the alleged statements, but as to his professional relations with the firm of Tornabells & Company when the statements as to which he testified were made, and thereafter up to or nearly about the time of the bringing of this suit.\n Beyond question, the testimony established that the witness had been the confidential legal adviser of the firm of Tornabells & Company up to and at the time when the statements as to which he testified were made. Without reproducing the testimony as to the statements, we think it suffices to say that, on the examination in chief of the witness, he repeated a conversation had with both members of Tornabells & Company a short while before the making of the conveyance to Aran y Lanci and the mortgage by the latter of the property, which conversation was occasioned by the fact that the members of the firm called upon the witness as their legal adviser, either to consult him or to state to him the purpose of the firm to convey or mortgage its property, and that the witness, on his examination, stated that he construed the statements made to him by his clients as unfolding a purpose on their part to make a simulated transfer of their property to defraud their creditors, and that he, the witness, declared he could not represent them in the matter or have anything to do with it. The second statement testified to a conversation had with Doitteau, one of the members of the firm, after \n\n[217 U.S. 47, 67]\n\u00a0\n the assailed conveyance and mortgage had been put upon the record, which the witness considered was an admission by Doitteau of the fraud and an explanation on the ground that he consented to it because of the influence of his partner, Tornabells. It is also true, however, that the statements made by the witness on cross-examination tended to qualify the impression as to the conversation resulting from his statements in chief, and to indicate that the purpose of the members of the firm, as disclosed by them in the conversation, was either to sell or mortgage their property in order to raise money to apply to their debts, and that the witness thought that this purpose was illegal, because it was intended with the funds which might be raised to prefer particular creditors. It was established that, at the time of the first conversation, the witness, although the attorney of the firm, had to its knowledge the claim of one of its creditors in his hands professionally. It was also stated that after the conversations above referred to, and after the witness had knowledge of the existence of the assailed conveyance and mortgage, he continued both to have personal and professional relations with the firm. He brought a number of suits in its behalf during the two years which elapsed between the making of the assailed conveyance and mortgages and the bringing of this suit. In fact, the claim which was in the witness's hands at the time of the conversation with the members of the firm was some time afterwards merged to judgment by a confession by the members of the firm, which was written in the office of the witness by one of his associates. Precisely when the witness became the counsel for all the complainants does not exactly appear, but certain is it that he stated in his testimony that he was to receive a large contingent fee, amounting in several of the cases to 50 per cent of the amount recovered. The case, as we have at the outset said, was decided some months after its submission, and six months thereafter the statement of facts to which we have referred, accompanied with extracts from the evidence, was \n\n[217 U.S. 47, 68]\n\u00a0\n certified by the court. After reproducing in the statement the extracts from the testimony, the court said:\n'As appears from the above, the court tentatively allowed the foregoing evidence of said witness Cornwell to be admitted, but subsequently, upon the consideration of the testimony as a whole, and upon making its findings of fact and law, and rendering its decision herein, the court did determine and rule that the defendants' objections to the testimony of said witness Cornwell, in so far as same related to conversations between said witness and Joaquin Tornabells, Carlos Doitteau, and Luis Aran, should be sustained and said testimony excluded, because the plan outlined by said Tornabells during said conversation did not constitute a fraud upon creditors under the laws of Porto Rico at that time in force, hence, the privilege existing as to confidential communications between attorney and client was applicable thereto; and further, because such testimony involved admissions of a dead man against the interests of his own heirs, who are parties to the suit.'\n\n It is upon this statement that the contention is based that the court illegally rejected the testimony of the witness Cornwell. But, when the statement is accurately considered, it appears that, instead of rejecting the testimony, the court weighed and considered it, and but declared that on its face it did not tend to establish a fraud within the meaning of the Porto Rico law, and hence, that the statements were privileged. As the fraud on the part of the firm of Tornabells & Company which was charged in the bill, and the fraud which it was insisted was demonstrated by the statements made to the witness, were in substance one and the same, it necessarily follows that the finding of the court, that the statements testified to did not tend to show the fraud which it was asserted they did show, was but an expression of the conclusion of the court upon the facts involved in the merits of the controversy, and therefore is embraced in its finding of fact, which we may not review. If, however, we could otherwise consider the action of the court, we are constrained to say, upon an examination of the \n\n[217 U.S. 47, 69]\n\u00a0\n testimony of the witness, made part of the certificate, that we think the court was right in concluding that the testimony did not establish a sufficient foundation to relieve the witness from the obligation resting upon him as the result of his professional relations.\n The error which it is insisted the court committed as to the statements of the widow of Tornabells need only be briefly noticed. In the course of his examination, the witness Cornwell was asked concerning statements made to him by Mrs. Tornabells of conversations which she stated she had with her husband, tending to show that the assailed contracts were simulated, the statements to the witness having been made after the death of Mr. Tornabells. In reference to the motives which induced Mrs. Tornabells to make to him the statements about which the witness was asked, he said that she represented herself to be in great pecuniary distress, and was desirous of ascertaining whether she and her children could not in some way be benefited if the pending suit assailing the conveyance and mortgage of the property was successful. Indeed, on cross-examination, the witness said:\n Q. Is it a fact, Mr. Cornwell, that a contract was made between your firm and this woman to give her either money or property?\n A. If it was, it was made afterwards by Judge Pettingill and Mr. Horton.\n Q. I am asking you if it was.\n A. I don't know. I am out at the mill the most of the time.\n On objection being made to the witness testifying to the statements of Mrs. Tornabells as to the conversations with her deceased husband, the court declared that the objection would be overruled pro forma, with a right to sustain it later, and gave counsel for the defendants an exception. Thereupon the counsel for the complainants declared as follows:\n'I want to get on the record that it is not claimed by the complainants that this statement, whatever it may be, made \n\n[217 U.S. 47, 70]\n\u00a0\n by the widow of Tornabells as a defendant in this case, binds any defendant or is admissible against any defendant except herself and the minor children whom she represents.'\n\n After this declaration, the witness testified as to the statements made to him by Mrs. Tornabells concerning conversations with her husband, the substance of which tended to show that the assailed contracts were fraudulent simulations. Although the testimony was thus in the case when it was submitted to the court for decision, in its certificate appended to the statement of facts to which we have already referred, the court said that, in disposing of the case, it, in effect, concluded that the statements by Mrs. Tornabells as to the conversations with her husband were inadmissible, because they were hearsay, Mrs. Tornabells not having been called as a witness, and because, in any event, it was incompetent to establish the want of good faith in written contracts made by a deceased person by repeating conversations had with him during his lifetime. Conceding that the action of the court can be construed as indicating that it rejected the testimony instead of simply weighing it, and found it insufficient to prove the alleged fraud, we think it suffices to say, without further elaboration, that the reasons stated by the court are, on their face, adequate to sustain its conclusion. Besides, as the testimony of the witness Cornwell concerning the statements made by the widow Tornabells was offered only as against her and her children, and not against the other defendants, it clearly results that no prejudicial error could in any event have resulted from the ruling, even on the hypothesis that the administratrix was competent, by a mere admission, to injuriously affect the estate of her minor children, which the court made, in view of its finding as to the rights of the other defendants.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","198":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWILLIAM CRAMP & SONS SHIP & ENGINE BLDG. CO. v. U S(1910)\nNo. 92\nArgued: Decided: February 28, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 494, 495]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James H. Hayden and Robert C. Hayden for appellant.\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 494, 497]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Thompson and Mr. Franklin W. Collins for appellee. \n\n[216 U.S. 494, 498]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n On September 24, 1896, the appellant entered into a contract with the United States for the building of an ironclad, afterwards known as the 'Alabama.' The contract was authorized by act of Congress of June 10, 1896 ( 26 Stat. at L. 378, chap. 399). Under this act and that of August 3, 1886 ( 24 Stat. at L. 215, chap. 849, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1056), to which it refers, the Secretary of the Navy was charged with the duty of supervising the contract on behalf of the United States. After the completion of the vessel and the payment of the stipulated amount, there was something asserted to be due to the building company as unliquidated damages on account of extra work caused by the United States, for which it brought suit in the court of claims. That \n\n[216 U.S. 494, 499]\n\u00a0\n court found the amount to be $49,792.66. Relying upon the decision of this court in a case between the same parties for also the building of an ironclad, the 'Indiana' (\n206 U.S. 118\n, 51 L. ed. 983, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 676), the court of claims rendered judgment for the defendant. The controversy in this, as in the prior case, turns upon the effect of a release. In that it was in this form:\n'The William Cramp & Sons Ship & Engine Building Company, represented by me, Charles H. Cramp, president of said corporation, does hereby, for itself and its successors and assigns, and its legal representative, remise, release, and forever discharge the United States of and from all and all manner of debts, dues, sum and sums of money, accounts, reckonings, claims, and demands whatsoever, in law or in equity, for or by reason of, or on account of, the construction of said vessel under the contract aforesaid.'\n\n Here the same terms of release are used, but they are followed by this proviso:\n'Provided, That this release shall not be taken to include claims arising under the said contract other than those which the Secretary of the Navy had jurisdiction to entertain.'\n\n That release was executed on May 18, 1896; this on April 19, 1901. We held that the former release settled all disputes between the parties as to claims 'under or by virtue' of the contract. Evidently the proviso was incorporated with the purpose of accomplishing some change in the effect of the release. That purpose is disclosed by prior correspondence. On February 13, 1901, the Secretary of the Navy, answering a letter inclosing a claim for extra work of $66,973.23, writes:\n'I have to state that while, from a casual consideration of the matter, it might seem proper that the papers should be referred to the bureaus concerned for examination and report, it appears, after a careful consideration of the subject, that the claim, being for unliquidated damages, is of a kind the Department has no authority under the law to entertain.'\n\n To which the company replied, suggesting this proviso: \n\n[216 U.S. 494, 500]\n\u00a0\n 'Provided, That nothing herein shall operate as a waiver of this company's right to sue for and recover judgment in the court of claims for damages incurred or losses sustained by the company in the prosecution of the contract work which were occasioned by delays or defaults on the part of the United States,'-- and adding, in response to the statement of the Secretary, 'that the claim, being for unliquidated damages, is of a kind the Department has no authority under the law to entertain,' that the act of March 3, 1887 (24 Stat. at L. 505, chap. 359, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 752), known as the 'Tucker act,' vests the court of claims with jurisdiction to hear and determine such claims. Some further correspondence followed between the parties, which culminated in a letter from the company, inclosing the release as finally executed, and saying:\n'This (release) contains a clause which excepts from the operation of the release claims arising under the contract, which you, as Secretary of the Navy, had not jurisdiction to entertain.'\n\n It is well understood that executive officers are not authorized to entertain and settle claims for unliquidated damages. Opinion of Attorney General Taney, in which he says:\n'If the Navy commissioners have refused to take the bread from Mr. Stiles, according to their contract, when he had prepared it of the quality called for by the agreement, it is not in the power of the executive branch of the government to liquidate and pay the damages he may have sustained. If he has been damnified by the officers of the government, Congress alone can redress the injury.' (Ops. Atty. Gen. 1841 ed. p. 882.) McKee v. United States, 12 Ct. Cl. 504, 555-558.\n\n In Power v. United States, 18 Ct. Cl. 263, 274, 275, the court thus discussed the matter:\n'The Secretary of the Interior concurred in the opinion that the claimant was equitably entitled to damages, and that he should be invited to furnish proof of the extent of his injury; but did not agree that the damages should be adjusted in \n\n[216 U.S. 494, 501]\n\u00a0\n the Department. He proposed to submit the case to Congress.\n\n'In this conclusion that the Department had no authority to settle such a claim, the Secretary was right. The laws regulating the payment of money from the Treasury, in the current business of the government, are viewed at length by our brother Richardson in his opinion in McKee's Case ( 12 Ct. Cl. 555). He shows clearly that the laws provide only for the settlement and payment of accounts. An account is something which may be adjusted and liquidated by an arithmetical computation. One set of Treasury officers examine and audit the accounts. Another set is intrusted with the power of reviewing that examination, and with the further power of determining whether the laws authorize the payment of the account when liquidated. But no law authorizes treasury officials to allow and pass in accounts a number not the result of arithmetical computation, upon a subject within the operation of the mutual part of a contract.\n\n'Claims for unliquidated damages require for their settlement the application of the qualities of judgment and discretion. They are frequently, perhaps generally, sustained by extraneous proof, having no relation to the subjects of the contract, which are common to both parties; as, for instance, proof concerning the number of horses and the number of wagons, and the length of time that would have been required in performing a given amount of transportation. The results to be reached in such cases can, in no just sense, be called an account, and are not committed by law to the control and decision of Treasury accounting officers.\n\n'As is well said by Judge Richardson, in the opinion already referred to (12 Ct. Cl. 556), this construction 'would exclude claims for unliquidated damages, founded on neglect or breach of obligations or otherwise, and so, by the well-defined and accepted meaning of the word 'account' and the sense in which the same and the words 'accounting' and 'accounting officers' appear to be used in the numerous sections of the \n\n[216 U.S. 494, 502]\n\u00a0\n numerous acts of Congress wherein they occur, it would seem that the accounting officers have no jurisdiction of such claims except in special and exceptional cases, in which it has been expressly conferred upon them by special or private acts. And such has been the opinion of five Attorneys General,-all who have officially advised this executive officers on the subject. Attorney General Taney, in 1832, whose opinion is referred to by his successors in office; Attorney General Nelson, in 1844 (4 Ops. Atty. Gen. 327); Attorney General Clifford, in 1847 (4 Ops. Atty. Gen. 627 ); Attorney General Cushing, in 1854 (6 Ops. Atty. Gen. 524); and Attorney General Williams, in 1872 (14 Ops. Atty. Gen. 24). And the same views were expressed by this court in 1866 (Carmick v. United States, 2 Ct. Cl. 126, 140).\" McClure v. United States, 19 Ct. Cl. 28, 29; Brannen v. United States, 20 Ct. Cl. 219, 223, 224; 4 Ops. Atty. Gen. 327, 328, 626, 630.\n\n But it is contended that the contract, independently of the release, provided for a settlement of all matters growing out of the delay in the completion of the vessel, although this is in apparent conflict with the opening statement of the government in its brief, for there it says: 'The issue here is whether the proviso in that release saves the contractor from the final and complete surrender of his right to recover on the claims set out in the petition.' But this, although it indicates the views of the government of the question at issue, does not preclude it from presenting other matters, and it insists that by the third clause in the contract, the vessel, when completed without the armor, was to be subjected to a trial provided for in a subsequent clause of the contract, and a board of naval officers appointed by the Secretary of the Navy was to determine the deduction from the total price of the vessel under the contract if completed with armor. It further contends that, by the ninth clause of the contract, the matter of possible delay was recognized by the Secretary of the Navy, and his determination at to the effect thereof was to be conclusive. Now it may be said that both the contractor and the government had the right to insist upon the \n\n[216 U.S. 494, 503]\n\u00a0\n delivery of the vessel when it was completed without the armor, and that the deduction in price should then be settled by the board of officers appointed by the Secretary. It may also be conceded that the government could have insisted upon a release in the form specified in the contract, but neither the company nor the government insisted on the delivery of the vessel at the time it was launched and before it was armored. The government left the vessel with the company, waiting for armor to be put on,-armor which it had not then been able to secure and tender to the company; and when the question arose as to a settlement, it did not insist upon a release as specified in the contract. The contract was plainly treated by both parties as impracticable, and therefore waived. Evidently from his letter of February 13, 1901, the Secretary was of the opinion that, equitably, there was something due to the company, and yet, realizing that that question was not one for his determination, in order that full justice might be done, he consented to a change in the terms of the release, and this he had power to do.

FIRST NAT. BANK(1910)\nNo. 130\nArgued: March 9, 1910Decided: March 21, 1910\n\n\n\n The defendant in error commenced this action in the United States court for the southern district of Indian territory. The now plaintiffs in error were named as defendants. S. L. and S. T. Williams are brothers, and Jennie L. Williams is the wife of the defendant S. L. Williams. Recovery was \n\n[216 U.S. 582, 583]\n\u00a0\n sought by the bank, as an innocent holder for value, before maturity, upon a note for $5,000, executed by the defendants, dated February 4, 1904, and payable to the order of Susan E. Mays, with interest. The consideration for the execution of the note was thus alleged in an amended complaint:\n'Plaintiff further alleges and charges the truth to be that the said note was executed by the said Jennie Lee Williams for the benefit of her separate estate; that, at the time of the execution of said note, a contest was pending before the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes, which said body at said time had authority under law to entertain and hear the same, between the said Jennie Lee Williams, one of the makers of said note, and Susan E. Mays, the payee therein, to determine which of the said parties had a right to take in allotment a certain tract of land located adjacent to the town of Maysville, Indian territory; that said [note] was executed by the said Jennie Lee Williams, S. L. Williams, and S. T. Williams, in consideration of the abandoning of said contest by the said Susan E. Mays, the payee therein; that after said note was executed the said Susan E. Mays did abandon her contest and permit the said Jennie Lee Williams to take the said land in allotment, which she did, and the said land therby became and is her separate the said land thereby became and is her separate\n\n The amended complaint was demurred to on the following grounds:\n'1st. Because the said amended complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and does not entitle plaintiff to the relief prayed for.\n\n'2d. Because the transferee of a non-negotiable note must aver and prove consideration for the transfer; and the note in suit is non- negotiable, and plaintiff fails to aver any consideration whatever for the transfer.\n\n'3d. Because  16 of the Atoka agreement provides the only legal way Indian lands may be sold, and where a statute positively declares a thing cannot be done, the law \n\n[216 U.S. 582, 584]\n\u00a0\n will not suffer its policy and purpose to be thwarted by any subterfuge or ingenious contrivance clothed with the semblance of legality. This was a short-cut attempt to sell 40 acres of land, title to which was in the Indians.\n\n'4th. Because the Dawes Commission had exclusive jurisdiction to determine all matters in controversy between members of the tribes as to their right to select particular tracts of land for allotment, and to determine the rights, if any, of Mrs. Susan Mays in the contest for said 40 acres of land; but the original payee of the note sued on, for a bare promise, violated the law in such case made and provided.\n\n'5th. Because it appears from the allegations in said complaint that the note sued on herein and for the amount and accrued interest of which the plaintiff seeks a judgment against the defendants was executed pursuant to an alleged contract entered into by and between the defendant Jennie Lee Williams and Susan E. Mays, in that said complaint shows that the sole and only consideration of said note was the agreement of the said Susan E. Mays to abandon a certain contest which she had instituted against the said defendant Jennie Lee Williams, before the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes at Tishomingo, wherein she claimed the right to select as a part of her allotment certain premises which had been Williams as a member of the tribe of Chickasaw Willimas as a member of the tribe of Chickasaw Indians.\n\n'6th. Said complaint upon its face shows that the said note was executed by the defendants to the said Susan E. Mays for an illegal consideration, and was executed without any consideration whatever, and of all this the defendants pray the judgment of the court.'\n\n The demurrer was overruled. In an amended answer, thereafter filed, after admitting the making of the note, and averring that it was executed by Jennie Lee Williams as principal and by the other defendants as sureties, the following allegations were made:\n'lst. The defendants admit that heretofore, to wit, on the \n\n[216 U.S. 582, 585]\n\u00a0\n 4th day of February, 1904, they executed and delivered unto Susan E. Mays their promissory note for the principal sum of $5,000, due ninety days from date, and they admit that said note, as so executed, is copied in the plaintiff's first amended complaint, and the same is witnessed by James A. Cotner, and they admit that the defendant Jennie Lee Williams is a married woman and the wife of the defendant S. L. Williams, but they allege and charge that said note was executed by Jennie Lee Williams as principal and S. L. Willimas and S. T. Williams as sureties.\n\n'There defendants deny, as alleged in the complaint, that said note was executed by the said Jennie Lee Williams for the benefit of her separate estate; but they admit that, at the time of the execution of the said note, a contest was pending before the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes between Susan E. Mays, as contestant, and Jennie Lee Williams, as contestee, and that the purpose of said contest, as instituted by the said Susan E. Mays, was to determine whether she or the said contestee had a right to take in allotment a certain tract of land located adjacent to the town of Maysville, Indian territory; but these defendants deny that said note was executed by the said defendants Jennie Lee Williams, S. L. Williams, and S. T. Williams, in consideration of the withdrawal of the said Mrs. Susan E. Mays from said contest, as aforesaid; and they deny that the said Susan E. Mays did withdraw her contest and permit the said Jennie Lee Williams to take the said lands in allotment; and that, by reason of the withdrawal of the said Susan E. Mays from said contest, that said land became and was the separate property of the said efendant Jennie Lee Williams; but defendants allege and charge the truth to be that since the execution and delivery of said note, as aforesaid, that said Commission aforesaid has duly awarded and delivered to said defendant Jennie Lee Williams certificate to said land.\n\n'2d. But these defendants allege and charge the truth to be that sole and only consideration of said note, as aforesaid, \n\n[216 U.S. 582, 586]\n\u00a0\n was the pretended and illegal sale of certain lands situated near Maysville, in the Chickasaw Nation, Indian territory, by the said Susan E. Mays to the said Jennie Lee Williams; that said pretended sale was illegal, fraudulent, and void; that the same was made, executed, and delivered by said Susan E. Mays to said Jennie Lee Williams in violation of and in contravention of the provisions of a treaty made by and between the United States and the Chickasaw and Choctaw tribes of Indians in the year 1902, which said treaty was ratified by a majority vote of said tribes and by act of the Congress of the United States, and in violation of and in contravention of the provisions of a treaty of the United States and the said tribes of Indians, made, concluded, and ratified by said tribes and the Congress of the United States in the year 1898, and known as the 'Atoka Agreement,' and that by reason thereof said pretended conveyance from said Susan E. Mays to said Jennie Lee Williams is illegal, fraudulent, and void, and of no effect, and that, by reason of the premises aforesaid, the said note herein sued for, when executed, was and hitherto since has been, illegal and void and without consideration. A copy of said conveyance is hereto annexed and marked 'Exhibit A,' and made a part hereof.\n\n'3d. And still further answering herein, the defendant's say that the plaintiff ought not further prosecute and maintain this action against them because they allege and charge that, at the date of the execution of said conveyance from Mrs. Susan E. Mays to Jennie Lee Williams, as aforesaid, said Susan E. Mays did not have the possession, right, or title to the premises in said conveyance described, and did not own the improvements situated thereon, and had no interest therein which she could convey to the defendant Jennie Lee Williams, and that the consideration of the note herein sued on for that reason has totally failed; all of which the defendants are prepared and willing to verify, and they put themselves upon the country, and pary the judgment of the court that they be discharged, with their costs.' \n\n[216 U.S. 582, 587]\n\u00a0\n Exhibit 'A,' omitting the acknowledgment, reads as follows:\n\n Tishomingo, Indian Territory, February 4, 1904\n\n\n Know all men by these presents:\n That I, Susan E. Mays, of Maysville, Indian territory, for and in consideration of the sum of one dollar ($1), cash in hand to me this day paid by Samuel L. Williams, Jennie Lee Williams, and receipt of which money is hereby acknowledged, and the further consideration of the sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000), to be paid me by said Samuel L. Williams, Jennie Lee Williams, on the 4th day of May, 1904, which indebtedness is evidenced by a promissory note of even date herewith, due on the 4th day of May, 1904, bearing interest at the rate of 8 per cent per annum from date, signed by S. L. Williams, Jennie Lee Williams, and S. T. Williams, I hereby bargain, sell, and convey and relinquish all my right, title, or claim which I have in any way in and to the possession of the lands and improvements situated upon the N. 1\/2 of the N.E. 1\/4 of the E. E. 1\/4 of sec. 16, and the N.E. 1\/4 of the N.W. 1\/4 of the S.E. 1\/4 sec. 16, and the S.E. 1\/4 of the N.E. 1\/4 of the S.E. 1\/4 of sec. 16, all in township 4 N., range 2 W., Chickasaw Nation, Indian territory.\n Relinquishing unto the said Samuel L. Williams and Jennie L. Williams all rights which I have in and to the proceeds due or to become due, or from the sales of town property, or my interests in the said town site, located on the above described premises, hereby relinquishing to them any claim that I have by any former agreements pertaining to any town site on said lands above described.\n Witness my hand on this the 4th day of February, 1904.\n Susan E. Mays.\n A demurrer to the amended answer was sustained, and, the defendants refusing to plead further, judgment was entered on April 14, 1905, in favor of the bank for the full amount of the note, with interest and costs. A writ of error was allowed \n\n[216 U.S. 582, 588]\n\u00a0\n and the cause was taken to the United States court of appeals for the Indian territory. While the cause was pending in that court, Oklahoma became a state, and by virtue of the enabling act the cause was transferred to the supreme court of the new state. On December 24, 1907, a petition was filed on behalf of the plaintiffs in error in the supreme court of the state, accompanied with bond, and it was prayed that the cause be removed into the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Oklahoma, upon the ground 'that, by virtue of the enabling act, it was entitled to be so removed because the suit herein is of a civil nature at law, arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States.' The application was denied, and, from a judgment of affirmance thereafter entered (20 Okla. 274, 95 Pac. 457), this writ of error is prosecuted.\n The errors assigned in substance are that the supreme court of Oklahoma erred in overruling the application to remove, in holding that error was not committed by the trial court in overruling the demurrer to the amended complaint, and in deciding that error was not committed in sustaining the demurrer to the amended answer.\n Messrs. W. O. Davis, L. S. Dolman, and R. E. Thomason for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[216 U.S. 582, 590]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. S. T. Bledsoo and J. B. Thompson for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice White:\n\n\n[216 U.S. 582, 592]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n In addition to discussing the merits, the defendant in error presses upon our attention a motion to dismiss, in substance upon the ground that no question of a Federal nature is presented. As the plaintiffs in error had no greater right to prosecute the writ of error than is possessed by suitors generally when seeking the review of a final judgment of a state court ( 20, enabling act, as amended, 34 Stat. at L. 1287, chap. 2911), it results that our power to review is controlled by Rev. Stat.  709, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575. Irrespective of other contentions, beyond peradventure a question of a Federal nature, however, was raised by the contention, denied by the state court, that a right or privilege existed under a statute of the United States to remove the cause into the circuit court of the United States, and the motion to dismiss cannot therefore prevail.\n As to the denial of the right to remove.-The claim of plaintiffs in error is that the right to remove the cause into the circuit court of the United States arose from the fact that it was a suit arising under the Constitution and laws of the \n\n[216 U.S. 582, 593]\n\u00a0\n United States, and that the right existed by virtue of  16 of the enabling act, as amended on March 4, 1907 (34 Stat. at L. 1286, chap. 2911 ), the pertinent portion of which is as follows:\n'Sec. 16. That all civil causes, proceedings, and matters pending in the supreme or district courts of Oklahoma territory, or in the United States courts or United States court of appeals in the Indian territory, arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States, or affecting ambassadors, ministers, or consuls of the United States, or of any other country or state, or of admiralty, or of maritime jurisdiction, or in which the United States may be a party, or between citizens of the same state, claiming lands under grants from different states; and all cases where there is a controversy between a citizen of either of said territories prior to admission and a citizen of any state, or between a citizen of any state and a citizen or subject of any foreign state or country, in which cases of diversity of citizenship there shall be more than two thousand dollars in controversy, exclusive of interest and costs, shall be transferred to the proper United States circuit or district court established by this act, for final disposition, and shall therein be proceeded with in the same manner as if originally brought therein: Provided, That said transfer shall not be made in any such case where the United States is not a party, except on application of one of the parties, in the court in which the cause is pending, at or before the second term of such court after the admission of said state, supported by oath, showing that the case is one which may be so transferred. The proceedings to effect such transfer, except as to time and parties, shall be the same as are now provided by law for the removal of causes from a state court to a circuit court of the United States.'\n\n In the petition for removal it was alleged in support of the right to remove--\n'That the said suit involves the construction of the treaties and laws and acts of Congress concerning the allotment \n\n[216 U.S. 582, 594]\n\u00a0\n of lands to the Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes of Indians under the act of Congress approved June 28, 1898 [30 Stat. at L. 495, chap. 517], and the act approved July 1, 1902 [32 Stat. at L. 641, chap. 1362], commonly known as the 'Atoka and the Supplemental agreements between the Choctaw and Chickasaw Tribes of Indians in the Indian Territory.'\n\n'Petitioner shows that the controversy herein arises from the following facts:\n\n'On February 4, 104, appellant executed a promissory note to the assignor of appellee for five thousand ($5,000) dollars, due in ninety (90) days, with interest at 8 per cent from date.\n\n'That the consideration for said note was that the payee thereof should cease to prosecute further and abandon a certain contest then pending before the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes, in which the payee was contestant and the appellant herein was contestee.\n\n'That the appellee took said note with full knowledge of the facts as disclosed by its pleadings. Appellant, by demurrer and answer, claims that the consideration is contrary to the letter and spirit of the act of Congress of June 28, 1898, and of July 1, 1902; that it is not a legal, valid, or any consideration for the note.'\n\n The contention that the cause of action arose under the Constitution or laws of the United States is plainly untenable. Recovery by the bank was in no wise predicated upon any right conferred upon it or its assignor to contract, as was done, and the fact that the makers of the note relied for their defense upon provisions contained in a certain statutes as establishing that the transaction upon which the right to recover was based was prohibited by law 'would only demonstrate that the suit could not be maintained at all, and not that the cause of action arose under the Constitution or laws of the United States.' Arkansas v. Kansas & T. Coal Co. \n183 \nU.S. 185, 190\n, 46 S. L. ed. 144, 147, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 47.\n As to the asserted Federal questions claimed to arise upon the rulings in respect to the overruling of the demurrer to the \n\n[216 U.S. 582, 595]\n\u00a0\n amended complaint and the sustaining of the demurrer to the amended answer.- In the light of the allegations of the complaint and the admissions ( either express or implied from the failure to deny) contained in the amended answer, we think the record established that Susan E. Mays and Jennie Lee Williams were members either of the Choctaw or Chickasaw tribe of Indians; that Mrs. Williams selected for allotment and filed upon 40 acres of land, upon which were improvements, situated adjacent to the town of Maysville, Indian territory. The right of Mrs. Williams to select the land being disputed by Susan E. Mays, she filed a contest against the same before the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes. When this was done, Susan E. Mays was not in the occupancy of any other land liable to allotment. Pending the proceedings, by way of compromise, Susam E. Mays agreed to abandon the contest instituted by her, and relinquish her right to the allotment of the land in controversy and the improvements thereon, in consideration of the execution of the note in suit; that said note was executed for the benefit of the separate estate of Jennie Lee Williams, and was delivered to Susan E. Mays, who thereupon abandon the prosecution of her said contest before the Commission, and the allotment of the land to Mrs. Williams followed.\n Compromises of disputed claims are favored by the courts (Hennessy v. Bacon, \n137 U.S. 78\n, 34 L. ed. 605, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 17); and presumptively, the parties to the compromise in question possessed the right to thus adjust their differences. We come, then, to consider whether, as claimed, there was a want of consideration for the note because of an express or implied statutory prohibition against the transaction which formed the consideration for the note.\n In the demurrer to the amended complaint, the claim advanced to defeat the right to recover on the note, which was substantially reiterated in the amended answer, was that, in truth, the sale was of the land, and was illegal because not made according to the method for acquiring allottable tribal \n\n[216 U.S. 582, 596]\n\u00a0\n land provided for in agreements between the government of the United States and the Choctaw and Chickasaw governments, and because controversies as to allotments of land over which the Dawes Commission had jurisdiction could alone be determined by that body. We do not pause to consider whether these general allegations constituted such a special setting up of a right, privilege, or immunity under a law or laws of the United States as is required by Rev. Stat.  709. Considering the complaint and answer in their entirety, especially when viewed in the light of the allegations of the petition for removal, it clearly results, as stated in the petition for removal, that 'the consideration for the said note was that the payee thereof should cease to prosecute further and abandon a certain contest then pending before the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes, in which the payee was contestant and the appellant herein was contestee.' In the argument at bar, while counsel has referred to statutory provisions and to various decisions which it is asserted establish that a sale by an Indian of part of an excessive holding of allottable tribal land or of improvements thereon would not be a valid consideration for a note given to evidence the price of such sale, we have been referred to no statute nor cited to any treaty or agreement made with the Indian Tribes giving rise even to the suggestion that where a bona fide contest existed between two Indians as to right to a tract or tracts of land, arising from a claim based upon selection, on the one hand, and, on the other, because of occupancy and improvements, it would be unlawful for the latter to abandon his contention as to his preferential right for a money consideration. Nor have we been referred to any statutory provision which, either expressly or impliedly, deprived the parties to a contest of their right to compromise simply because of the pendency of the contest before the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes. An opinion of the United States court of appeals of the Indian territory, a tribunal which was specially competent to pass upon a question of the kind \n\n[216 U.S. 582, 597]\n\u00a0\n we are considering, lends support to the conclusion we have reached, that a member of either the Choctaw or Chickasaw tribe, when, as here, there is no showing that such a member was the holder of an excess of lands subject to allotment, was not prohibited at any time from selling his improvements upon tribal land, or abandoning his right to the possession thereof to another Indian. The opinion referred to was announced in the case of Thomason v. McLaughlin, 7 Ind. Terr. 1, 103 S. W. 595, in which case, among other questions, the court passed upon the validity of a sale of tribal land by one Indian to another after the enactment of the act of June 28, 1898, known as the Curtis bill (chap. 517, 30 Stat. at L. 495), wherein, in  29, is embodied the so-called Atoka agreement. After referring to a provision in  17 of the act, limiting the extent of an Indian's holding before allotment to the approximate share of the lands to which he and his wife and minor children were entitled, and making it a misdemeanor to retain the possession of an excess of such share after the expiration of nine months from the passage of the act, the court said (p. 9):\n'Inasmuch as the sale in this case was made within the nine months' limit, this, of course, would not affect the validity of the sale, even though Lafon had been in possession of more land than that to which he was entitled. It is a well-known fact that many Indians, at the time of the passage of this act, were in possession of large tracts of improved lands, in excess of that to which they were entitled; and under the laws and customs of the different tribes at that time, this land was lawfully held. The nine month's provision was introduced into the Curtis bill for the purpose of giving them an opportunity of disposing of the excess, and thereby to get some renumeration for the improvements which they, by their labor and industry, had lawfully made upon the lands. And there is no provision in either of these sections, or anywhere else, that could be construed to deprive an Indian in this territory of the right to dispose of his holdings to another \n\n[216 U.S. 582, 598]\n\u00a0\n Indian, if he desired to do so, in order that he might select his allotment on other lands. The statute did not intend that an Indian should be compelled to take his allotment on the land then held by him. He could sell his improvements and holdings to another Indian for allotment, and lay his own on other land which he might find vacant, or which he might, in turn, purchase from another Indian. This method was adopted almost universally by the Indians, and it was not unlawful as between Indians. But to hold an excess of lands after the expiration of the nine months was unlawful and a crime.'\n\n While the asserted Federal questions are not so wholly devoid of substance as to be purely frivolous, they are, nevertheless, without merit, and the judgment must be and it is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","200":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWILLIAMS v. STATE OF ARKANSAS(1910)\nNo. 138\nArgued: Decided: April 4, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 79, 80]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George B. Rose, U. M. Rose, W. E. Hemingway, D. H. Cantrell, and J. P.

Cunningham for defendant in error.\n\n\n[217 U.S. 79, 85]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n Plaintiff in error was convicted for violating a statute of the state of Arkansas, entitled, 'An Act for the Protection of Passengers, and for the Suppression of Drumming and Soliciting upon Railroad Trains and upon the Premises of Common \n\n[217 U.S. 79, 86]\n\u00a0\n Carriers,' approved April 30, 1907\n\n\n The 1st and 2d sections of that act are as follows:\n'Sec. 1. That it shall be unlawful for any person or persons, except as hereinafter provided in  2 of this act, to drum or solicit business or patronage for any hotel, lodging house, eating house, bath house, physician, masseur, surgeon, or other medical practitioner, on the trains, cars, depots of any railroad or common carrier operating or running within the state of Arkansas.\n\n'Any person or persons plying or attempting to ply said vocation of drumming or soliciting, except as provided in  2 of this act, upon the trains, cars, depots of said railroads or common carriers, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not less than fifty ($50) nor more than one hundred dollars ($ 100) for each offense.\n\n'Sec. 2. That it shall be unlawful for any railroad or common carrier operating a line within the state of Arkansas knowingly to permit its trains, cars, or depots within the state to be used by any person or persons for drumming or soliciting business or patronage for any hotel, lodging house, eating house, bath house, physician, masseur, surgeon, or other medical practitioner, or drumming or soliciting for any business or profession whatsoever; except, that it may be lawful for railroads or common carriers to permit agents of transfer companies on their trains to check baggage or provide transfers for passengers, or for persons or corporations to sell periodicals and such other articles as are usually sold by news agencies for the convenience and accommodation of said passengers.\n\n'And it shall be the duty of the conductor or person in charge of the train of any railroad or common carrier to report to the prosecuting attorney any person or persons found violating any of the provisions of this act, and upon a wilful failure or neglect to report any such person or persons known to be violating the provisions of this act by drumming \n\n[217 U.S. 79, 87]\n\u00a0\n or soliciting, said conductor or other person in charge of such train shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not less than fifty nor more than one hundred dollars.'\n\n The case was tried upon the following agreed statement of facts:\n'The defendant has for six years been keeping a boarding house in the city of Hot Springs, and was keeping the same on the 10th day of December, 1907, when he entered a train of the Little Rock & Hot Springs Western Railway Company, while running in the county of Garland and state of Arkansas, and solicited and drummed the passengers on said train to induce them to come to his said boarding house to board during their sojourn in said city; and said defendant was so engaged in drumming and soliciting upon said train when he was arrested. He had paid has fare as a passenger on said train, and was riding as such passenger while engaged in drumming and soliciting.'\n\n Plaintiff in error challenged the act as unconstitutional on the grounds that it deprived him of liberty and property without due process of law, and also of the equal protection of the law guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.\n The principles that govern this case have been settled by very many adjudications of this court. They were sufficiently set forth in McLean v. Arkansas, \n211 U.S. 546\n, 53 L. ed. 319, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 206, in which a statute making it unlawful for mine owners employing ten or more men underground in mining coal and paying therefor by the ton mined, to screen the coal before it was weighed, was held valid; and also that it was not an unreasonable classification to divide coal mines into those where less than ten miners were employed and those where more than that number were employed, and that a state police regulation was not unconstitutional under the equal-protection clause of the 14th Amendment because only applicable to mines where more than ten miners were employed. This court in that case, discussing the police power, said: \n\n[217 U.S. 79, 88]\n\u00a0\n 'In Gundling v. Chicago, \n177 U.S. 183\n, 44 L. ed. 725, 20 Supp. Ct. Rep. 633, this court summarized the doctrine as follows:\n\"Regulations respecting the pursuit of a lawful trade or business are of very frequent occurrence in the various cities of the country, and what such regulations shall be, and to what particular trade, business, or occupation they shall apply, are questions for the state to determine, and their determination comes within the proper exercise of the police power by the state; and unless the regulations are so utterly unreasonable and extravagant in their nature and purpose that the property and personal rights of the citizen are unnecessarily, and in a manner wholly arbitrary, interfered with or destroyed, without due process of law, they do not extend beyond the power of the state to pass, and they form no subject for Federal interference.'\n\n'In Jacobson v.

Cas. 765, this court said:\n\n\"But the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States to every person within its jurisdiction does not import an absolute right in each person to be at all times, and in all circumstances, wholly freed from restraint. There are manifold restraints to which every person is necessarily subject for the common good.'\n\n'It is then the established doctrine of this court that the liberty of contract is not universal, and is subject to restrictions passed by the legislative branch of the government in the exercise of its power to protect the safety, health, and welfare of the people. . . .\n\n'The legislature, being familiar with local conditions, is primarily the judge of the necessity of such enactments. The mere fact that a court may differ with the legislature in its views of public policy, or that judges may hold views, inconsistent with the propriety of the legislation in question, affords no ground for judicial interference, unless the act in question is unmistakably and palpably in excess of legislative power.\n\n ... * *\n'It the law in controversy has a reasonable relation to the \n\n[217 U.S. 79, 89]\n\u00a0\n protection of the public health, safety, or welfare, it is not to be set aside because the judiciary may be of opinion that the act will fail of its purpose, or because it is thought to be an unwise exertion of the authority vested in the legislative branch of the government.\n\n And see Donovan v. Pennsylania Co. \n199 U.S. 279\n, 50 L. ed. 192, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 91.\n In the present case, the supreme court of Arkansas (85 Ark. 470, -- L. R.A.(N.S.) --, 122 Am. St. Rep. 47, 108 S. W. 838) said:\n'The legislature clearly has the power to make regulations for the convenience and comfort of travelers on railroads, and this appears to be a reasonable regulation for their benefit. It prevents annoyance from the importunities of drummers. It is suggested in argument that the statute was especially aimed at the protection of travelers to the city of Hot Springs. If this be so, we can readily see additional reason why the regulation is a wholesome one. A large percentage of those travelers are persons from distant states, who are mostly completely strangers here, and many, are sick. Drummers who swarm through the trains soliciting for physicians, bath houses, hotels, etc., make existence a burden to those who are subjected to their repeated solicitations. It is true that the traveler may turn a deaf ear to these importunities, but this does not render it any the less unpleasant and annoying. The drummer may keep within the law against disorderly conduct, and still render himself a source of annoyance to travelers by his much beseeching to be allowed to lead the way to a doctor or a hotel.\n\n'It is also argued that the act, literally construed, would prevent any person of the classes named from carrying on a private conversation on a train concerning his business. This is quite an extreme construction to place upon the statute, and one which the legislature manifestly did not intend. We have no such question, however, before us on the facts presented in the record.\n\n'This statute is not an unreasonable restriction upon the privilege one should enjoy to solicit for his lawful business, \n\n[217 U.S. 79, 90]\n\u00a0\n which, it is rightly urged, is an incident to any business. It does not prevent anyone from advertising his business, or from soliciting patronage, except upon trains, etc. This privilege is denied him for the public good. It is a principle which underlies every reasonable exercise of the police power, that private rights must yield to the common welfare.'\n\n As to the objection that the act discriminated against plaintiff in error and denied him the equal protection of the law, because forbidding the drumming or soliciting business or patronage of the trains for any 'hotel, lodging house, eating house, bath house, physician, masseur, surgeon, or other medical practitioner,' which, it was contended, was an unreasonable classification, the state supreme court said:\n'The legislature, in framing this statute, met a condition which existed, and not an imaginary or improbable one. The class of drummers or solicitors mentioned in the act are doubtless the only ones who ply their vocation to any extent on railroad trains. It is rare that the commercial drummer finds opportunity to meet customers and solicit trade on trains, therefore the lawmakers deemed it unnecessary to legislate against an occasional act of that kind.'\n\n It is settled that legislation which, 'in carrying out a public purpose, is limited in its application, if within the sphere of its operation it affects alike all persons similarly situated, is not within the Amendment' (Barbier v. Connolly, \n113 U.S. 27\n, 28 L. ed 923, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 357); and 'when a state legislature has declared that, in its opinion, policy requires a certain measure, its action should not be disturbed by the courts under the 14th Amendment, unless they can see clearly that there is no fair reason for the law that would not require with equal force its extension to others whom it leaves untouched.'

Hughes for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was an action to recover of defendants, as directors of the Neptune Mining Company, a Colorado corporation, the sum of $5,500 as the aggregate amount of claims or demands of the plaintiff and of thirty other persons, firms, or corporations against the mining company, which had been assigned to the plaintiff.\n The liability was asserted to arise under the requirement of the act of April 6, 1901, of Colorado, which required annual reports to be filed by all corporations with the secretary of state for Colorado within sixty days after the 1st day of January in each year as to matters designated in the statute, and which provided: 'If any such corporation shall fail, refuse, or omit to file the annual report aforesaid, and to pay the fee prescribed therefor within the time above prescribed, all the officers and directors of said corporation shall be jointly and severally and individually liable for all debts of such corporation, joint stock company, or association that shall be contracted during the year next preceding the time when such reports should by this section have been made and filed, and until such report shall be made and filed.' And it was averred that no annual report was filed by or for said corporation, the Neptune Mining Company, within sixty days from and after January 1, 1903\n\n\n The complaint set out the various items of indebtedness incurred by the mining company, which, it was alleged, had been \n\n[216 U.S. 117, 119]\n\u00a0\n assigned to William Woodside for collection only, with the agreement that each of the several assignors should remain the absolute owner of his or their claims, and should contribute his proportion of the expenses of collection of the same, including costs and attorneys' fees, and it was agreed that the said several assignors have ever since been and now are the exclusive owners of their several claims, and that said William Woodside has no interest whatever in any of the claims so assigned.\n The case coming on for trial, a jury was duly waived and the cause submitted to the court.\n The court found that the plaintiff was not the owner of, or the real party in interest in, any of the claims against the mining company that had been assigned to him; that the amount of his own claim against the company was only $162.36; and that the amount of none of the separate claims of the others assigned to him exceeded $650, while some were less than $100; that the claims other than his own were assigned to plaintiff for the purpose of collection only; that he paid no consideration therefor, and that said assigned claims or demands in fact remained the property of the different assignors thereof, who were paying pro rata the expenses of prosecuting the action; that if plaintiff recovered upon the claims from defendants, the amount of such recovery above the plaintiff's individual claim would be for the benefit of the several assignors thereof, and would be distributed to them in proportion to the amount of the claim of each; that the several claims other than that of the plaintiff were assigned to him by the different owners thereof, to be added to the amount of plaintiff's claim, to create an amount in excess of $2,000, for the express purpose of enabling the plaintiff to sue thereon in the circuit court.\n It also appeared that in 1903 plaintiff recovered judgment in the district court of Custer county, Colorado, against the Neptune Mining Company for the amount of his own claim, to wit, $162.36, and a part of the other claims so assigned to \n\n[216 U.S. 117, 120]\n\u00a0\n him, the judgment being for the sum of $2,724.46, and the items on which suit was brought being set forth in the present complaint.\n The circuit court, in its opinion, quoted the evidence of the plaintiff as to his interest in or right to the assigned claims, upon which he sued in the action, as follows:\n After stating that his own claim against the Neptune Mining Company was $162.36, he said:\n'The assignments of the accounts to me, and of the judgment, aside from my personal account, were made to me for the sole purpose of beginning suit in my name, and to thus save expenses. I have no interest in any of said claims or judgments except my individual claim. The actual ownership of the said judgments and the proceds thereof, and the accounts and the proceeds thereof, belong to the several assignors, and I am to account to them and to pay them such proceeds in case I collect them.'\n\n And the circuit court held that, as none of the claims or demands so assigned were of sufficient amount to authorize an action thereon in a court of the United States, it was clear that this action could not be maintained in the circuit court, and it was accordingly dismissed without prejudice, for want of jurisdiction, and at the plaintiff's costs. 142 Fed. 617.\n Thereupon the court certified that the order of dismissal was based solely of the ground that the cause did not involve a controversy within the jurisdiction of the court, for the reasons stated in the opinion filed in the case, which opinion was, by the terms of the certificate, made a part of the record and directed to be certified and sent up as such.\n The circuit court cited many cases decided in this court to sustain the proposition that where a plaintiff is not in fact the owner of the claims sued upon, and none of the claims assigned is sufficient in amount to confer jurisdiction upon the Federal court, it has no jurisdiction, and will dismiss the case for that reason. \n\n[216 U.S. 117, 121]\n\u00a0\n Thus, in Bernards Twp. v. Stebbins, \n109 \nU.S. 341, 355\n, 27 S. L. ed. 956, 961, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 252, 262, it was said:\n'The decision in Williams v. Nottawa, \n104 U.S. 209\n, 26 L. ed. 719, establishes that the circuit court of the United States cannot, since the act of 1875 [18 Stat. at L. 470, chap. 137, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508 ], entertain a suit upon municipal bonds payable to bearer, the real owners of which have transferred them to the plaintiffs of record for the sole purpose of suing thereon in the courts of the United States for the benefit of such owners, who could not have sued there in their own names, either by reason of their being citizens of the same state as the defendant, or by reason of the insufficient value of their claims.'\n\n And so in Waite v. Santa Cruz, \n184 \nU.S. 302, 328\n, 46 S. L. ed. 552, 568, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 327, 337, this court quoted  5 of the act of March 3, 1875, and said:\n'We adjudge that, as the plaintiff does not own the bonds or coupons in suit, but holds them for collection only, the circuit court was without jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim or claims, whether bonds or coupons, held by a single person, firm, or corporation against the city, and which, considered apart from the claim or claims of other owners, could not have been sued on by the real owner by reason of the insufficiency of the amount of such claim or claims.'\n\n And see Crawford v. Neal, \n144 U.S. 593\n, 36 L. ed. 556, 12 Sup. Ct.

GEORGIA RAILROAD & BANKING CO(1910)\nNo. 70\nArgued: January 11, 1910Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 420, 421]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John C. Hart, Samuel H. Sibley, Hooper Alexander, and Ligon Johnson for appellants.\n Messrs. Joseph B. Cumming, Joseph R. Lamar,\n\n\n\n[216 U.S. 420, 422]\n\u00a0\n Alexander C. King, and King & Spalding for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Lurton delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill to restrain the enforcement of certain taxes imposed by the state of Georgia, which the railroad company claims to be in violation of a contract between itself and the state. The court below sustained the contention of the railroad company, and held that the scheme of taxation found in the charter of the company was of inviolable obligation, and enjoined any method of taxation conflicting with the stipulations of the charter; from this decree the comptroller has appealed.\n The charter in question was granted by the state of Georgia in 1833,- a time long before the imposition of any restriction upon the power of the legislature of that state to stipulate for either an entire or partial exemption from taxation. It is therefore, not denied by the state that the charter constitutes a contract which may not be impaired by subsequent legislation. In view of this concession we are only called upon to decide the extent of the charter exemption, and, incidentally, its duration.\n The controlling section of the charter is the fifteenth. The part now relevant is as follows:\n'The stock of the said company and its branches shall be exempt from taxation for and during the term of seven years from and after the completion of the said railroads, or any of them; and after that, shall be subject to a tax not exceeding 1\/2 of 1 per cent per annum, on the net proceeds of their investments.'\n\n The period of absolute exemption has, of course, long since passed. The only question is as to the duration and extent of the partial exemption which followed.\n That the property exempt altogether for seven years is the same property subject to a limited tax thereafter was long \n\n[216 U.S. 420, 423]\n\u00a0\n ago decided by the supreme court of Georgia in a case which involved the interpretation of this very contract. Augusta v. Georgia R. & Bkg. Co. 26 Ga. 651, 661, et seq. The question in that case was as to the legality of municipal taxes assessed by the city of Augusta upon that part of the capital of the company employed in its banking business and upon real estate situated in that city. The taxes were held illegal. Interpreting this section, that court said:\n'It means, first, that the stock of the company was to be subject to a tax, but not to any tax exceeding 1\/2 of 1 per cent on the net proceeds of its investments.' Second. 'That the stock of the company, as stock, as a unit, is alone what is to be subject to the tax; not parts of the stock, as the part used in banking, nor the particulars in which the stock consists, as, the land, cars, rails, etc.' Third. 'That this tax to which the stock is to be subject is to be a tax to be laid by the state.'\n\n We may as well turn to one side just here to deal first with the question of the duration of this commuted tax which is to follow the period of tax exemption, because we construe the words 'after that,' which immediately follow the exemption clause, as synonymous with 'thereafter,' and as fixing the time when that property which was theretofore exempt should be subject to the system of taxation provided by the succeeding clause.\n It has been rather faintly urged that the duration of this commuted tax or partial exemption was limited to a term of thirty-six years after the completion of the railroad, and that this period has long since expired. This suggested limitation seems to have no other basis than that the words 'and after that' do not mean 'thereafter,' as we have assumed, nor refer to the limitation immediately preceding, but to a more remote limitation found in the 2d section of the charter, and again in the earlier part of the 15th section. But the thirty-six-year limitation is one obviously applicable \n\n[216 U.S. 420, 424]\n\u00a0\n only to the grant of an exclusive right, within a defined territory, to construct and operate railroads. This was intended to protect this pioneer railroad from being paralleled within that time. The recurrence to this exclusive right in the first part of the 15th section is only for the purpose of placing a condition thereon which, as matter of fact, never happened, and which, therefore, never became vested, and to provide that the termination of that right should not otherwise affect the corporate existence, estate, powers, or privileges of the company. This reference to the exclusive right conferred first by the 2d section is followed by the provision above set out, providing that 'the stock of the said company and its branches shall be exempt from taxation for and during seven years from and after the completion of said railroads, or any of them, and after that shall be subject to a tax not exceeding 1\/2 of 1 per cent per annum on the net proceeds of their investment.' 'After that' obviously refers to the last limitation,-the termination of the exemption period,-and it would be an indefensible construction to construe the words as referring it to the thirty-six-year limitation of the exclusive right regulated by the preceding part of the same section.\n Coming now to the question as to what is the meaning and scope of the partial exemption found in this clause, we are confronted, first, with the contention that only the shares in the hands of shareholders are within either the first or second clause of this contract, and that the entire property of the company is subject to the taxing power of the state, unaffected by any contract for any stipulated form of limited taxation. This claim is, of course, bottomed on the contention that 'stock of the said company and its branches' refers to and means only the shares in the capital stock held by the shareholders, and that the benefit of the stipulation was intended for the shareholders in their character as such.\n The word 'stock' is not uniformly used to designate the capital of a corporation, although its primary meaning is capital, in whatever form it may be invested. Indeed, it is \n\n[216 U.S. 420, 425]\n\u00a0\n not at all unusual to find the word used synonymously with 'shares,' and meaning the certificates issued to subscribers to the company's stock. It is therefore important to look at the connection in which the word is used when an exemption or substituted method of taxation is involved, to see whether the legislative intent was to exempt the capital of the company, in whatever form invested, or the shares of stock in the hands of the shareholders. Powers v. Detroit, G. H. & M. R. Co. \n201 \nU.S. 543, 559\n, 50 S. L. ed. 860, 865, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 556. There is an obvious distinction between the capital stock of an incorporated company and the 'shares' of the company. The one is the capital upon which the business is to be undertaken, and is represented by the property of every kind acquired by the company. Shares are the mere certificates which represent a subscriber's contribution to the capital stock, and measure his interest in the company. The charter, plainly enough, recognized this. Thus, in the 3d section, it is provided that 'the stock of the company . . . shall consist of 15,000 shares of $100 per share, and the said company to be formed on that capital.' By a later section the times and places for taking subscriptions are defined, 'so that, on summing up the whole, it may appear whether the stock is filled up, or falls short of the aforesaid capital.' In the 7th section we find the interest of the subscribers to the 'stock' recognized and described as shares, while the capital of the company in which he holds such shares is described as 'the stock of the said company.' Thus, each subscriber is given 'a number of votes equal to the number of shares he may hold in the stock of the company.' That 'stock,' as used, means 'capital,' in whatever form invested, appropriate to the purpose of the company, is also plainly evidenced by the provision that, after the total exemption period, this stock shall be subjected to a specific tax 'on the net proceeds of their investments.' It has been suggested that by 'their investments' was meant the investments of the shareholders in the company's stock. This interpretation is based upon \n\n[216 U.S. 420, 426]\n\u00a0\n the use of the plural 'their;' but in many places in this same charter the company is referred to in the plural. As this same act provides for the organization of one or more companies to construct branch lines, and extends to them the same tax exemption, it is grammatically correct to read 'their' as referring to this plurality of companies. That 'stock' in the first clause means capital, and 'their investments,' the property into which the company's capital has gone, seems, in any view you take of it, the most rational interpretation of the matter. That the only mode of taxation stipulated for after the period of total exemption is a tax upon the net income of the company's property is seemingly the plain and obvious meaning of this contract. That this is the way in which it has been read and interpreted by everybody who has had to do with the matter of taxation in an official way since 1845, when the railroad seems to have been finished, affords strong evidence that this construction accords with the intent of the charter. Aside from at least sixty years of legislative and executive acquiescence in reading this partial exemption as applicable to the capital stock of the company, there has been a series of cases decided by the supreme court of Georgia which involved the meaning of this clause. In each case the court has held, either, that the whole of the capital was exempt, in whatever form invested, or so much of the investment as corresponded in value to the authorized capital stock. Augusta v. Georgia R. & Bkg. Co. 26 Ga. 651, 662, et seq.; State v. Georgia R. & Bkg. Co. 54 Ga. 423; Goldsmith v. Georgia R. Co. 62 Ga. 485.\n In the case of State v. Georgia R. & Bkg. Co. cited above, the court held that the act of 1874, which sought to assess an ad valorem tax against the property of the railroad company, was void, as in violation of the obligation of a contract by which the state was limited to a tax which should not exceed 1 per cent 'on its earn- \n\n[216 U.S. 420, 427]\n\u00a0\n ings.' Goldsmith v. Georgia R. Co. is relied upon as overruling the earlier case. But this is a mistake for more than one reason. That case was dismissed for want of jurisdiction over the subject of the legality or illegality of the tax resisted. Hence, all that was said about the taxability of the appellee's property under this charter exemption was obiter. But so far as the question of the applicability of this partial exemption to the capital of the company, as invested in its railroad, is concerned, the opinion distinctly accepts the former case as a settlement of the question. Referring to the former case, Mr. Justice Bleckley said:\n'It seems to have been the purpose of this court to hold in 54 Ga. 423, that, except as to stock issued under the amendment of 1868, authorizing the Clayton branch, the limit put by the charter of the Georgia Railroad & Banking Company upon the taxing power, extends to all the capital stock of the corporation as a railroad company and is irrepealable. These questions were fairly involved in that case, and the adjudication of them there announced ought to be accepted as final.'\n\n That Mr. Justice Bleckley afterward concluded that the former case had not considered or decided whether any excess of value of property over the amount of the authorized and exempt capital would be subject to an ad valorem tax is true; but that does not detract from the recognition of the former as an authoritative opinion upon the point that the exemption was of the capital of the company.\n We come now to the question as to whether so much of the value of the company's railroad and appurtenances as exceeds in value the amount of the authorized capital stock, under the charter and amendments prior to 1863, is subject to taxation as other property of like character, under the law of the state. This value 'it is admitted exceeds by four millions of dollars the nominal value of the capital stock of said company,' which excess, it is further conceded, has been 'the \n\n[216 U.S. 420, 428]\n\u00a0\n result of natural increase in the value of said property, and by renewals, alterations, and betterments of the same, from time to time, by said company.'\n That this is the true and proper method of taxation, admissible under the charter exemption, has been urged upon several grounds. First, it is said that this construction was given this very charter in Goldsmith v. Georgia R. Co. heretofore cited, and the appellants plead the judgment in that suit as res judicata. Confessedly, if this is a good plea, it must operate not only for the purpose for which it has been interposed, but will be entirely fatal to the claim that the exemption now in question has expired, or that it extended only to the shares in the hands of shareholders.\n The opinion in that case does so construe the exemption, but, as we have already shown, the case went off wholly upon the question as to whether the trial court had any jurisdiction of the question, and the opinion, after construing the clause here involved, passed on to this matter as to whether the question could be made under the statutory remedy resorted to by the company, and concluded by holding that, whether the railroad company had been taxed illegally or not, the court below ought to have dismissed the proceeding for want of jurisdiction, and that the remedy, if any, was by bill in equity. Accordingly, the judgment which the supreme court entered was one which reversed the judgment below, and directed that the proceeding be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. This judgment in no way involved the construction of this exemption contract, nor the liability of the Georgia Railroad Company to taxation upon its property, or otherwise, and does not, therefore, have any efficacy as an estoppel. There was therefore no error in the ruling of the circuit court that this plea was bad. Upon the other hand, when the plea of estoppel just disposed of came in, the complainants amended their bill and set up the judgment in the earlier case of State v. Georgia R. & Bkg. Co. supra, \n\n[216 U.S. 420, 429]\n\u00a0\n as an adjudication concluding not only the claim that the exemption was only of the shares in the hands of shareholders, but as an adverse decision of this claim that only so much of the 'investments' of the company were exempt from a general ad valorem tax as equalled in value the authorized capital stock of the company under the charter and amendments prior to 1863\n\n\n But in Georgia R. & Bkg. Co. v. Wright, 124 Ga. 596, 53 S. E. 251, the supreme court of Georgia seems to have definitely decided that a judgment in a suit to collect a tax assessed for one year is not a bar to a suit for taxes subsequently assessed for another year, although the question decided in the first case is the same question upon which the second suit must be also decided.\n This court, as is well settled, accords to a judgment of a state only that effect given to it by the court of the state in which it was rendered. Union & Planters' Bank v. Memphis, \n189 U.S. 71\n, 47 L. ed. 712, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 604; Covington v. First Nat. Bank, \n198 U.S. 100\n, 49 L. ed. 963, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 562.\n We shall therefore disregard this plea, and determine the matter upon its merits, giving to the decision of the Georgia court consideration only as an authority.\n Coming, then, to the question on its merits: Under the original charter and certain amendments there exists to-day an authorized capital stock of $4,156,000. This leaves out of account a small increase under a later act, aggregating 440 shares, which capital is subject to taxation and is not now in dispute. The railroad property, including its railway, depots, equipments, and appurtenances proper, has a present value of some four millions of dollars in excess of the authorized capital. Now the contention is that, to the extent of this excess, the property of the company is assessable and taxable as other property. There is not much to be gained by the reference to Farrington v. Tennessee, \n95 U.S. 687\n, 24 L. ed. 560, and Bank of Commerce v. Tennessee, \n161 \nU.S. 134, 137\n, 40 S. L. ed. 645, 647, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 456, where something is said in an argumentative way about the taxability of a bank's surplus whose capital was exempt. That \n\n[216 U.S. 420, 430]\n\u00a0\n might well be if the bank should choose to enlarge its actual capital in the busines by using profits as capital instead of distributing them as profits to the shareholders, where the exemption was of a specific amount of capital. The facts in this case are so different from the case presented of a bank's surplus as to make the illustration of little value, even if it were settled that in all cases a bank's surplus would be taxable although its capital was exempt. We have here nothing which corresponds very closely to a bank's surplus. An investment made nearly seventy-five years since, of $4,156,000, has now a value of $4,000,000 in excess of that cost. The property is the same property. The conceded fact is that through renewals, alterations, and betterments made from time to time, and the natural increase in the value of the road, this appreciation has come about. There has been no suggestion that there has been any hiding away of capital added, by either new stock, or by the use of bonds or other forms of credit, nor that the improvements made from time to time, called 'renewals, alterations, and betterments,' have been other than the necessities of an enlarging business and the improved maintenance naturally demanded. There is no suggestion that there has been any bad faith in covering up taxable assets under cover of assets immune. Mobile & O. R. Co. v. Tennessee, \n153 \nU.S. 486, 506\n, 38 S. L. ed. 793, 800, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 968.\n After all, the precise question is whether the legislative purpose, as expressed, was that the railroad incorporated should pay no tax except one based upon net profits of operation, or was it the intention that a specific amount of capital only should be so relieved? Undoubtedly, the state did not intend that any other capital than that authorized and invested directly in this specific railroad should be immune. That is plain by the express limitation of the charter. But is there any contingency under which this particular railroad is to be subject to any other taxation than one measured by the amount of its net profits? The contract, though one for a partial exemption from taxation, may nevertheless be read \n\n[216 U.S. 420, 431]\n\u00a0\n in the light of the purpose sought to be accomplished and the public policy entertained at the time. That is true of this as well as other contracts; namely, that the meaning may be discovered by regard to attendant circumstances. That the intent was to exempt a capital aggregating $4,156,000, is, for the purpose of the present question, the necessary foundation of the claim now being looked at. That was, at the beginning, mere subscribers' promises to pay; next, money in the treasury of the company. While money, the charter says, it may, until needed, be invested 'in the public stock of the United States or of the state of Georgia.' But this capital was intended to be the only means by which this line of railroad was to be constructed and equipped. Thus, the original capital was fixed at one and a half million dollars, with power to enlarge same, 'so as to make their capital adequate to the work.' This power of increase does not seem to have been regarded as clear enough, and when an authorized extension of the work demanded more capital the charter was amended so as to increase it to $4,000,000, 'to meet excess of cost of road over present capital.' To insure the completion of the authorized road within the limit of the fixed capital, it was provided that the engagements of the company should not exceed the company's capital, and that the officers and directors who should contract beyond that capital should be jointly and severally liable to the contractors and to the corporation. Finally, no power was given to issue bonds, the usual incident to any modern railway construction. From the plain purpose that this authorized capital should be adequate to the construction and equipment of a particular railroad, it is plainly inferable that that railroad should be subject, after a time of complete immunity, only to a tax upon the profit of its operation. That railroad is the product of the investment of the authorized capital, and is, as such, subject only to a tax based upon its 'net proceeds.' This plan of tax upon net earnings is quite inconsistent with any other form of taxation, and is \n\n[216 U.S. 420, 432]\n\u00a0\n absolutely independent of any question as to whether the property thus taxed only upon its profits should have a less or greater value than the capital invested. A tax upon earnings is a tax which at last covers and includes, unless double taxation is intended, all property necessarily held and used to make that income, including the enjoyment of its franchises. It is not to be presumed, in the light of the public of the time, that the state intended that this pioneer railroad should be subjected to any form of taxation of property which produced the taxable income. State v. Western & A. R. Co. 66 Ga. 563, 567.\n We are therefore of opinion that this property is not subject to any other method of taxation than that of the special system stipulated for by the contract, and that the act of the Georgia legislature, in so far as it provides for an ad valorem tax upon any part of this invested capital of the Georgia Railroad & Banking Company, does impair the obligation of the contract.\n But it is said that the tax, so far as imposed upon the franchise of this company, is not in derogation of the charter, and that the decree below should be modified in this particular.\n If we are right in construing the tax as one upon net income as a substitute for a property tax, the franchise may no more be taxed than any other property appropriate to the operation of the road. When the state gave up the right to levy and collect a property tax, and to take in substitution a tax upon the annual net profit, it gave up the right to tax the franchise of the company as certainly as it gave up the right to tax its railroad. The Georgia act taxing franchises treats the franchise as property, and requires that 'they shall be returned and valued in the same way as returns are made by railroads of their physical property . . .' And that 'all franchises of value shall be returned for taxation and taxed as other property.' That a law which imposes a tax upon the franchise of a railroad company whose property is exempt from taxation is a law in derogation of the exemption contract \n\n[216 U.S. 420, 433]\n\u00a0\n is well settled. Wilmington & W. R. Co. v. Reid, 13 Wall. 264, 20 L. ed. 568; Gulf & S. I. R. Co. v. Hewes, \n183 \nU.S. 67, 77\n, 46 S. L. ed. 87, 91, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 26.\n Included in the total mileage owned and operated by the appellee railroad company is a line 18 miles long, known as the Washington branch. The company has all along claimed that this branch road was within the partial exemption clause of its original charter, granted in 1833. So far as appears from this transcript, this claim has not before been challenged, though no distinct issue seems ever to have been made in respect to its exclusion by reason of the legislation under which that branch was acquired. Neither does the answer of the comptroller in this case claim or set out any difference between the tax exemption applicable to the other parts of the appellee's railroad and this Washington branch, and the decree of the court below expressly finds that the original charter exemption includes this Washington branch. But the general denial that any part of the property of the railroad company was exempt from ad valorem taxation may well be regarded as covering the parts which make up the whole. To the decree holding the Washington branch exempt, the comptroller has moreover assigned error, based upon the legislation under which that branch was constructed. The right of exemption claimed for this branch was, however, distinctly put in issue by the counties of Wilkes and Talliaferro, which, for this purpose, were allowed to intervene, having a direct interest due to the fact that that branch, passing through those counties, would be subject to county taxation if not within the tax exemption clause. These counties have appealed from the decree below and assigned error also.\n The first legislative enactment in regard to the construction of the Washington branch road seems to have been in the act of 1833; but nothing was ever done under that. The same may be said in reference to another act passed in 1836. In December, 1848, an act was passed in these words:\n'The power heretofore granted to the Georgia Railroad \n\n[216 U.S. 420, 434]\n\u00a0\n & Banking Company to construct a branch of their road to Washington, in the county of Wilkes, be, and the same is hereby, revived and authorized to be exercised by said company, provided that the amount of the increased stock of said company ($200,000) shall not be exempt from taxation as is secured to the present stock by the latter clause of the 15th section of the charter of said company, but shall be subject to such tax as the legislature may hereafter impose.'\n\n But this was a section in an act amending the charter, and was never accepted. See 26 Ga. 651, 654. At the same legislative session, on February 5, 1850, another act was passed in these words:\n'That [naming incorporators] be and they are hereby authorized to build, construct, and keep a plank or railroad from the town of Washington, in Wilkes county, to some point on the Georgia Railroad & Banking Company's railroad, and for that purpose shall be authorized to create and receive by subscription a capital stock not exceeding $200,000, and shall be authorized to exercise all the powers and privileges conferred by the act of the general assembly passed in the year 1833, to incorporate the Georgia Railroad Company, and shall be under all the liabilities and restrictions therein contained.'\n\n So far as we can discover, the only legislative authority for the construction or acquirement of a branch railroad to Washington, accepted or acted under by it, is found in the act of January 21, 1852, entitled, 'An Act to Authorize the Consolidation of the Stocks of the Georgia Railroad & Banking Company and of the Washington Railroad or Plank Road Company, Incorporated February the Fifth, Eighteen Hundred and Fifty, and for Other Purposes.' The 1st section of that act provides:\n'That the Georgia Railroad & Banking Company and the Washington Rail or Plank Road Company be authorized and empowered to consolidate their stocks, the said Georgia Railroad & Banking Company issuing stocks in their said \n\n[216 U.S. 420, 435]\n\u00a0\n company to the stockholders of the Washington Railroad or Plank Road Company, on terms of equality with the general stockholders, in amount equal to the amount held by them respectively in the stock of the Washington Railroad or Plank Road Company, and that the two companies aforesaid, after the consolidation of their stocks, shall be known as one corporate body, under the name and style of the Georgia Railroad & Banking Company, and that said corporate body shall be authorized to exercise all the powers and privileges conferred by existing laws upon the Georgia Railroad & Banking Company, and be under all the liabilities and restrictions imposed on the same.'\n\n That this consolidation neither extinguished the Georgia Railroad & Banking Company, nor deprived it of any of its powers, privileges, or immunities, is plain. No such result has been claimed. Nor is it claimed that it thereby lost any tax exemption which it then had. The act authorizing the consolidation is substantially like that under which the Central Railroad & Banking Company was consolidated with the Macon Railroad, considered in Central R. & Bkg. Co. v. Georgia, \n92 U.S. 665\n, 23 L. ed. 757, where it was held that the tax exemption which the Central Railroad had enjoyed continued after consolidation in respect of the property of that company, but that, as the Macon company, consolidated with it, had no exemption, its property continued subject to taxation. That the Washington Railroad or Plank Road Company would go out of existence when this merger was accomplished is plain; it was, indeed, absorbed by the Georgia company. The purpose was to vest in the latter all of the rights, powers, and privileges of the merged company without diminishing or enlarging them. See what is said by Chief Justice Fuller in commenting upon a similar merger in Wilmington & W. R. Co. v. Alsbrook, \n146 \nU.S. 279, 300\n, 36 S. L. ed. 972, 980, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 72.\n Did the Washington Railroad, before consolidation, possess any contract tax exemption?\n The claim that it did is based upon the provision in the \n\n[216 U.S. 420, 436]\n\u00a0\n act under which it was incorporated, providing that it should 'be authorized to exercise all the powers and privileges conferred by the act of the general assembly, passed in the year 1833, to incorporate the Georgia Railroad Company, and shall be under all the liabilities and restrictions therein contained.'\n The question, then, is whether, under the power 'to exercise all the powers and privileges [italics ours] conferred by' the act incorporating the Georgia Railroad Company, the immunity from any other tax than one based upon a given per cent of annual net profits was granted to that company. The affirmative of this proposition finds some support in the cases of Humphrey v. Pegues, 16 Wall. 244, 21 L. ed. 326; Chesapeake & O. R. Co. v. Virginia, \n94 U.S. 718\n, 24 L. ed. 310; Southwestern R. Co. v. Georgia, \n92 U.S. 676\n, note, 23 L. ed. 762, and Tennessee v. Whitworth, \n117 U.S. 139\n, 29 L. ed. 833, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 649. In later cases this doctrine of a legislative transfer of a tax immunity under the term franchise, powers, estates, or privileges was questioned. Thus, in Chesapeake & O. R. Co. v. Miller, \n114 U.S. 176\n, 29 L. ed. 121, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 813, a tax immunity was held not to pass under a mortgage foreclosure sale, under the provision of a statute which authorized the purchaser to become a corporation, and 'succeed to all such franchises, rights, and privileges' pertaining to the mortgagor company. In Picard v. East Tennessee, V. & G. R. Co. \n130 \nU.S. 637, 642\n, 32 S. L. ed. 1051, 1053, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 640, 642, it was held that such an immunity would not pass to a purchasing company under a decree enforcing a statutory lien, where the sale, as confirmed, was of the 'property and franchises' of the mortgagor company. In that case it was said:\n'It is true there are some cases where the term 'privileges' has been held to include immunity from taxation, but that has generally been where other provisions of the act have given such meaning to it. The later, and, we think, the better, opinion, is that unless other provisions remove all doubt of the intention of the legislature to include the immunity in the term 'privileges' it will not be so construed. It can have its full force by confining it to other grants to the corporation.' \n\n[216 U.S. 420, 437]\n\u00a0\n In Wilmington & W. R. Co. v. Alsbrook, \n146 \nU.S. 279, 297\n, 36 S. L. ed. 972, 979, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 72; Keokuk & W. R. Co. v. Missouri, \n152 U.S. 301\n, 38 L. ed. 450, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 592; and Phoenix F. & M. Ins. Co. v. Tennessee, \n161 U.S. 174\n, 40 L. ed. 660, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 471, the earlier cases were also much shaken, so far as they tended to establish that a tax exemption would be transferred by legislative enactment conferring upon one road the powers or franchises or privileges of another, in the absence of other language or pregnant circumstances, showing a plain intent to confer such exemption.\n\n But whatever doubt upon this subject may have existed as to the effect of the transfer to one company of the powers and privileges of another in conferring a tax exemption possessed by the latter is set at rest by Rochester R. Co. v. Rochester, \n205 \nU.S. 236, 252\n, 51 S. L. ed. 784, 791, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 469, 474. Mr. Justice Moody, after reviewing all of the cases referred to above and others, sums the matter up by saying:\n'We think it is now the rule, notwithstanding earlier decisions and dicta to the contrary, that a statute authorizing or directing the grant or transfer of the 'privileges' of a corporation which enjoys immunity from taxation or regulation should not be interpreted as including that immunity.'\n\n There is an absence of anything in the history of this branch railroad which points to a purpose to grant any exemption from taxation. Thus, in the act of December 20, 1849. reviving the authority of the Georgia Railroad & Banking Company to construct such a branch, originally authorized by earlier acts, it was expressly provided that the stock to be issued for the purpose 'should not be exempt from taxation, as is secured to the present stock by the later clause of the 15th section of the charter of said company,' etc. This provision was probably the very reason why the Georgia Railroad & Banking Company did not accept or act under that statute. At the same session of the legislature, an independent company was created to construct and operate the same branch road. Presumably with the knowledge of the fact that the Georgia Railroad & Banking Company could \n\n[216 U.S. 420, 438]\n\u00a0\n not itself construct this road with immunity from taxation, this act authorizing this new corporation to build the same branch, declared that this company should be 'authorized to exercise' [italics ours] 'all powers and privileges' conferred by the act originally creating the Georgia Railroad & Banking Company. It is one thing to have authority to 'exercise' all the 'powers and privileges' of another company, and another thing to enjoy an exemption from taxation. The 'exercise' of the 'powers and privileges' of the company referred to was reasonably essential to the construction and operation of the independent railroad. Its immunity from taxation was not. See \n146 U.S. 279\n, 295, and Merchants' Nat. Bank v. United States, \n101 U.S. 1\n, 25 L. ed. 979. The power of taxation is never to be regarded as surrendered or bargained away if there is room for rational doubt as to the purpose.\n We conclude, therefore, that the Washington Railroad or Plank Road Company had no exemption from taxation at the time this consolidation occurred. That the consolidating act did not intend to confer any immunity from taxation which did not then exist is plain. The object was to vest in the Georgia company the property and franchises and rights and privileges of the Washington company. When the Georgia company succeeded to its property and franchises, it did so subject to whatever right the state had in the matter of taxation. The case in this aspect is controlled by Central R. & Bkg. Co. v. Georgia, \n92 U.S. 665\n, 23 L. ed. 757.\n The decree of the court below is modified so as to exclude the 18 miles constituting the Washington Branch Railroad, but in all other respects it is affirmed. The costs of this appeal will be divided betewen Wright, Comptroller General, and the Georgia Railroad & Banking Company.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","204":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWYNNE v. U S(1910)\nNo. 449\nArgued: Decided: April 4, 1910\n\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 234, 235]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Henry E. Davis, Frank E. Thompson, Charles F. Clemons, and Britton & Gray for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[217 U.S. 234, 238]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Fowler for defendant in error.\n\n\n[217 U.S. 234, 240]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Lurton delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff in error, John Wynne, has sued out this writ of error from a judgment and sentence of death for a murder committed on board the steamer Rosecrans, an American vessel, while lying in the harbor of Honolulu, in the territory of Hawaii. The indictment upon which he was tried included four counts. In each it was charged that the murder had been done on board the said American vessel, lying in the harbor of Honolulu, in the district and territory of Hawaii, and within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States, 'and out of the jurisdiction of any particular state of the said United States of America.' In two of the counts the locality is described as a certain 'haven' of the Pacific ocean, and in the others as a certain 'arm' of the Pacific ocean.\n The question to which the counsel for the plaintiff in error has chiefly invited the attention of the court is whether the indictment charges an offense within the jurisdiction of the district court of the United States for the territory of Hawaii. It was founded upon  5339, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3627), and particularly the second paragraph. The section is set out below:\n'Sec. 5339. Every person who commits murder--\n\n'First. Within any fort, arsenal, dockyard, magazine, or in any other place or district of country under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.\n\n'Second. Or upon the high seas, or in any arm of the sea, or in any river, haven, creek, basin, or bay within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States, and out of the jurisdiction of any particular state.\n\n'Third. Or who, upon any such waters, maliciously strikes, stabs, wounds, poisons, or shoots at any other person, of which striking, stabbing, wounding, poisoning, or shooting such other person dies, either on land or at sea, within or without the United States, shall suffer death.' \n\n[217 U.S. 234, 241]\n\u00a0\n Shortly stated, the contention is that the haven or arm of the Pacific ocean which constitutes the harbor of Honolulu, although 'within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States,' is a locality not 'out of the jurisdiction of any particular state,' because within the jurisdiction of the territory of Hawaii. The basis for the contention is that the words, 'out of the jurisdiction of any particular state,' do not refer to the jurisdiction of a state of the United States, but are to be given the wider meaning of out of the jurisdiction of any separate political community; and that the territory of Hawaii constitutes such a political organism. The postulate cannot be considered. The crimes act of April 30, 1790, chap. 9, 1 Stat. at L. 112, contained the same limiting words. Thus, in the 8th section of that act jurisdiction was asserted over the crime of murder, as well as certain other crimes, when committed 'upon the high seas, or in any river, haven, basin, or bay, out of the jurisdiction of any particular state.' The act was remolded by the act of March 3, 1825, chap. 65,  4, page 115, 4 Stat. at L. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3627). The further limitation of 'within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States' was added, but otherwise the jurisdiction remained the same. Without substantial change the provision of the last act was carried into the Revised Statutes as part of  5339\n\n\n\n To support the contention urged, counsel have cited United States v. Bevans, 3 Wheat. 337, 388, 4 L. ed. 404, and Talbott v. Silver Bow County, \n139 \nU.S. 438, 444\n, 35 S. L. ed. 210, 212, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 594. The indictment in the Bevans Case was for a murder done on board a war vessel of the United States while she lay at anchor a mile or more from the shores of the bay constituting the harbor of Boston, in the state of Massachusetts. The bay was wholly within the territorial jurisdiction of the state of Massachusetts, and the court said that it was not material whether the courts of that state had cognizance of the offense or not. 'To bring the offense,' said the court, 'within the jurisdiction of the courts of the Union, it must have been committed in a river, etc., out of the jurisdiction of any state. It is not the offense committed, but the \n\n[217 U.S. 234, 242]\n\u00a0\n bay in which it is committed, which must be out of the jurisdiction of the state. If, then, it should be true that Massachusetts can take no cognizance of the offense, yet, unless the place itself be out of her jurisdiction, Congress has not given cognizance of that offense to its courts. If there be a common jurisdiction, the crime cannot be punished in the courts of the Union.' The case has no bearing upon the question here involved, except so far as that the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States was there held to be excluded, because the place where the offense was committed was within the territorial jurisdiction of one of the states of the Union. The question in the Talbott Case was whether a territory was within the meaning of  5219, Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3502), which permitted a 'state within which' a national bank is located to tax its shares. The court held that the permission extended to states in that regard including territories. The decision was based upon the obvious intent of Gongress, looking to the scope and purpose of the act; the court saying, among other things: 'While the word 'state' is often used in contradistinction to 'territory,' yet, in its general public sense, and as sometimes used in the statutes and the proceedings of the government, it has the larger meaning of any separate political community, including therein the District of Columbia and the territories, as well as those political communities known as states of the Union.' But the word 'state,' as used in the 8th section of the act of 1790, and the subsequent act of 1825, as well as used in  5339, Rev. Stat ., must be determined from its own context. The word 'state,' as there used, has been uniformly held as referring only to the territorial jurisdiction of one of the United States, and not to any other government or political community. Thus, in United States v. Ross, 1 Gall. 626, Fed. Cas. No. 16,196, Mr. Justice Story said, in reference to the words in  4 of the act of 1825, above referred to, that 'the additional words of the act, 'in any river, haven, basin, or bay out of the jurisdiction of any particular state,' refer to such places without any of the United States, and not without foreign states, as will be very clear on examining the pro- \n\n[217 U.S. 234, 243]\n\u00a0\n vision as to the place of trial, in the close of the same section.' In United States v. Griffen, 5 Wheat. 184, 189, 200, 5 L. ed. 64, 65, 68, one of the questions certified was 'whether the words, 'out of the jurisdiction of any particular state,' in the 8th section of the act of Congress of the 30th of April, 1790, chap. 9 [1 Stat. at L. 113, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3643], . . . must be construed to mean out of the jurisdiction of any particular state of the United States,' To this the court said: 'We think it obvious that 'out of any particular state' must be constued to mean 'out of any one of the United States.' By examining the context it will be seen that 'particular state' is uniformly used in contradistinction to United States.' In United States v. Rodgers, \n150 \nU.S. 249, 265\n, 37 S. L. ed. 1071, 1077, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 109, the same meaning was attached to the words in question, and an offense committed on the Detroit river, on a vessel belonging to a citizen of the United States, was held cognizable by the district court of the United States for the eastern district of Michigan, although it appeared that the offense had been committed within the territorial limits of the Dominion of Canada, and therefore not within the jurisdiction of any particular state of the United States. See also St. Clair v. United States, \n154 \nU.S. 134, 144\n, 38 S. L. ed. 936, 939, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1002, and Andersen v. United States, \n170 U.S. 489\n, 42 L. ed. 1118, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 689.\n That there existed an organized political community in the Hawaiian Islands, exercising political, civil, and penal jurisdiction throughout what now constitutes the territory of Hawaii, including jurisdiction over the bay or haven in question, when that territory was acquired under the joint resolution of Congress of July 7, 1898 [30 Stat. at L. 750], did not prevent the operation of  5339, Rev. Stat. That 'political community' did not constitute one of the states of the United States; and if the other jurisdictional facts existed,  5339 came at once into operation.\n Unless, therefore, there was something in the legislation of Congress found in the act of April 30, 1900, chap. 339, 31 Stat. at L. p. 141, providing a government for the territory of Hawaii, which excluded the operation of the statute, the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States over the bay here in question, \n\n[217 U.S. 234, 244]\n\u00a0\n in respect of the murder there charged to have been committed, was beyond question.\n Counsel have cited and relied upon the 5th, 6th, and 7th sections of the organic act referred to, in connection with  83, 84, 89, and 91, as operating to leave intact the jurisdiction of the territorial courts of the territory under existing penal laws over this 'haven' or 'arm' of the sea, in respect to homicides there committed. The 5th section of the organic act referred to provided, 'that the Constitution, and except as herein otherwise provided, all the laws of the United States, which are not locally inapplicable, shall have the same force and effect within the said territory as elsewhere in the United States.' The 6th section continued in force the laws of Hawaii 'not inconsistent with the Constitution or laws of the United States, or the provisions of this act ; . . . subject to repeal or amendment by the legislature of Hawaii or the Congress of the United States.' The 7th section expressly repeals a long list of local laws, civil and criminal, and does not expressly include the chapter of the penal laws of Hawaii of 1897, relating to homicides. The 81st section vests the judicial power of the territory in one supreme court and such inferior courts as the legislature may establish, and continues in force the laws of Hawaii concerning the jurisdiction and procedure of such courts, 'except as herein provided.' Section 83 continues in force the laws of Hawaii relating to the judicial department, including civil and criminal procedure, subject to modification by Congress or the legislature. Section 89 provides that the control of wharves and landings constructed by the Republic of Hawaii, on any seacoast, bay, or harbor, shall remain under the control of the government of the territory of Hawaii. Section 91 leaves public property which had been ceded to the United States under the control of the government of the territory.\n We cannot see that any of the things referred to have the effect claimed for them. The plain purpose of the 5th section was to extend the Constitution and laws of the United States, \n\n[217 U.S. 234, 245]\n\u00a0\n not locally inapplicable, to the territory, and of the 6th section, to leave in force the laws of Hawaii, except as repealed by the act, or inconsistent with the Constitution or laws of the United States.\n If, when that act was passed, one who committed murder in the harbor of Honolulu was subject to trial in the courts of the United States, though within the territorial waters of Hawaii, the organic act neither expressly nor impliedly deprives the courts of the Union of the jurisdiction which they had before. It was within the power of Congress to confer upon its courts exclusive jurisdiction over all offenses committed within the territory, whether on land or water. This it did not elect to exercise. It provided for the establishment of a district court of the United States, with all of the powers and jurisdiction of a district court and of a circuit court of the United States. It provided also for the organization of local courts with the jurisdiction conferred by the existing laws of Hawaii upon its local courts except as such laws were in conflict with the act itself or the Constitution and laws of the United States. If it be true, as claimed, that the territorial courts exercise jurisdiction over homicides in the harbor of Honolulu, under and by virtue of the laws of Hawaii thus continued in force, it only establishes that there may be concurrent jurisdiction in respect of certain crimes when committed in certain places, and is far from establishing that the courts of the Union have been deprived of a jurisdiction which they have at all times claimed and exercised over certain offenses when committed upon the high seas, or in any arm of the sea, or in any river, basin, haven, creek, or bay within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States, and out of the jurisdiction of any particular state.\n We find nothing in the special legislation applicable to that territory which prevented the operation of  5339.\n There are assignments touching the competency of certain evidence relied upon to establish the national character of the Rosecrans, and others which challenge the sufficiency of the \n\n[217 U.S. 234, 246]\n\u00a0\n evidence to carry the case to the jury against a motion to direct a verdict for insufficiency of evidence upon that point. A certificate of enrolment, purporting to have been issued at San Francisco by one Coey, 'acting deputy collector of customs,' initialed 'W.,' and signed by E. W. Marlin, deputy naval officer, as required by  4332, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2967), which recited that the vessel was solely owned by the National Oil & Transportation Company, a corporation organized under the laws of California, was introduced for the purpose of establishing that the vessel was of American nationality. There was also evidence that she carried the flag of the United States,-evidence admissible upon a mere question of nationality. St. Clair v. United States, \n154 \nU.S. 134, 151\n, 38 S. L. ed. 936, 942, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1002. The principal objection is that this certificate was not the original, but a copy, not sufficiently authenticated. The authentication was in these words:\n District and Port of San Francisco.\n I hereby certify the within to be a true copy of the original issued by this office.\n Given under my hand and seal this 5 day of October 1907.\n (Sgd.) N. S. Farley, [Seal.]\n Deputy Collector of Customs. W.\n\n\n W.\n\n\n The requirements for registration are set out in  4142 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2809). The certificate in question was in form as required by  4155.\n There was evidence of a witness that he had himself received custom papers from the customhouse at San Francisco, signed by Farley, and was familiar with the signature from its appearance upon ship licenses on board ships. He had never seen Farley write, and only identified the signature from familiarity with it obtained from this and other like official papers. He also said he was familiar with the seal of the customs officials at San Francisco.\n The appointment of deputy collectors is provided for by  2630, 2633, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 1812, 1813). By  882, Rev. Stat. ( U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 669), copies of any \n\n[217 U.S. 234, 247]\n\u00a0\n papers or documents, in any of the executive departments, under the seal of the proper department, are made admissible in evidence equally with the original.\n There was no evidence whatever casting suspicion upon the genuineness of the copy or of the seal or the signature of Farley, and none which challenged in any way the American character of the ship. Under such circumstances and for the purposes of this case it was not error to assume that the document was genuinely executed by Farley, that he was what he claimed to be, a deputy collector of customs, and that his signature had been signed by himself or one authorized to sign for him. 3 Wigmore, Ev.  2161.\n There was no error, and the judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","205":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nZARTMAN v. FIRST NAT BANK OF WATERLOO(1910)\nNo. 74\nArgued: January 12, 1910Decided: February 21, 1910\n\n\n\n This was a suit brought in the supreme court of the state of New York by the First National Bank of Waterloo, New York, against Francis Bacon and George E. Zartman, as Bacon's trustee in bankruptcy, to procure the reformation of a written contract made by plaintiff and defendant Bacon February 15, 1902\n\n\n Before the contract was made, Bacon was president of the First National Bank of Waterloo, New York, and also of the Waterloo Wagon Company. He was active in the office of the wagon company, while the business of the bank was looked after by its cashier, Becker. The Waterloo bank had extended credit to the wagon company and to Bacon individually, discounting paper and taking notes.\n The Exchange National Bank of Seneca Falls, New York, \n\n[216 U.S. 134, 135]\n\u00a0\n held, by assignment from Bacon, 461 shares of the stock of the wagon company, and 253 shares of the Waterloo bank, as continuing collateral security for any existing or future indebtedness of Bacon or the wagon company.\n The contract between Bacon and the Waterloo bank provided that the shares were 'to be held by said bank as a continuing collateral security for the payment to it of any indebtedness or liability of any kind, absolute or contingent, due or not due, now existing or that may hereafter exist, arise, accrue, or be contracted, on the part of himself or of the Waterloo Wagon Company, Limited, to said bank, and the said Francis Bacon hereby agrees with the First National Bank of Waterloo that the said certificates of stock above named are transferred to and may be held by the said First National Bank of Waterloo as a continuing collateral security for the payment to it of any indebtedness or liability of any kind, absolute or contingent, now existing or that may hereafter exist, arise, accrue, or be contracted on the part of the Waterloo Wagon Company, Limited, or himself, to said bank, and said shares of stock, upon their surrender by the Exchange National Bank, shall be deposited with the said First National Bank of Waterloo.'\n The words in italics were omitted from the contract by mutual mistakes made in preparing and executing it, and the New York supreme court, by its decision, reformed the contract by inserting them. In the meantime, however, Bacon had become a bankrupt, having been so adjudicated May 4, 1904, and defendant Zartman had been appointed trustee.\n This action was begun October 17, 1904. The trustee alone defended.\n The judgment was unanimously affirmed by the appellate division of the fourth department (113 App. Div. 612, 98 N. Y. Supp. 717), and, on appeal to the court of appeals, the decision of the appellate division was unanimously affirmed without opinion. 189 N. Y. 533, 82 N. E. 1126. The remittitur was filed below November 9, 1907, and this writ of error was thereupon allowed. \n\n[216 U.S. 134, 136]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George E. Zartman, in propria persona, for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. W. H. Sholes and Hammond & Hammond for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller:\n\n\n[216 U.S. 134, 138]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n The jurisdiction in equity to decree the correction of errors in written contracts which have been caused by mutual mistake is firmly established and needs no citation of authority to sustain it. In the present case, the evidence of the mistakes in question was undisputed. We are not aware that the bankruptcy law has suspended that jurisdiction.\n The position of the trustee in bankruptcy seems to be that the mistake made by Bacon in dictating or writing out the contract between himself and the Waterloo bank 'is an asset in his hands, as part of the estate of the bankrupt;' but we cannot agree to that. The trustee claims that he takes the same kind of title as a bona fide purchaser for value; but the rule applicable to this and all similar cases is that the trustee takes the property of the bankrupt, not as an innocent purchaser, but as the debtor had it at the time of the petition, subject to all valid claims, liens, and equities. Thompson v. Fairbanks, \n196 U.S. 516\n, 49 L. ed. 577, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 306, and cases cited. And this is so well settled that our jurisdiction of the writ of error is exceedingly doubtful. Judge Williams, speaking for appellate division, fourth department, treated of this point thus:\n'It is said that the bankruptcy of Bacon constituted a bar to the relief granted in this action. This cannot be true. The trustee took the bankrupt's property in the same condition and subject to the same liens as the bankrupt himself held it. The trustee is in no sense a bona fide purchaser for value, and entitled to protection as such. No new lien was created by the decision and judgment appealed from. The original lien was adjudicated and determined.'\n\n We concur in this view, and the judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n"}}
