LINDSEY(1799)\n\nArgued: Decided: February 1, 1799\n\n\n A rule had been originally obtained in these actions (which were depending in the Circuit Court for the District of Connecticut) at the instance of the Defendants, requiring the Plaintiff to shew cause, why a Venire should not be awarded to summon a Jury from some District, other than that of Connecticut or New York; but it was changed, by consent, into a rule to shew cause why the actions should not be removed by Certiorari into the Supreme Court, as exclusively belonging to that jurisdiction. On shewing cause, it appeared, that suits, in the nature of Ejectments, had been instituted in the Circuit Court for the District of Connecticut, to recover a tract of land, being part of the Connecticut Gore which that state had granted to Andrew Ward and Jeremiah Hasley, and by whom it had been conveyed to the Plaintiffs. The Defendants pleaded that they were inhabitants of the State of New York; that the premises, for which the suits were brought, lay in the County of Steuben, in the state of New York; and that the Circuit Court for the District of New York, or the Courts of the State, and no other Court, could take cognizance of the actions. The Plaintiffs replied, that the premises lay in the State of Connecticut; and, issue being joined, a venire was awarded. On the return, however, the Defendants challenged the array, because the Marshall of the District of Connecticut, a resident and citizen of that State, had arrayed the Jury by his deputy, who was, also, a citizen of Connecticut, and interested as a purchaser, or claimant, in the Connecticut Gore, under the same title as the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs prayed oyer of the record and return, averred that the deputy Marshall was not interested in the question in issue, and demurred to the challenge for being double, and contrary to the record, which does not shew that the Jury was returned by the deputy Marshall. The Defendants joined in demurrer. The Court over-ruled the challenge, as it respected the general interest of the Marshall and his deputy, owing to their being citizens of Connecticut; but allowed it, and quashed the array, on account of the particular \n\n[3 U.S. 411, 412]\n\u00a0\n interest of the deputy, he being interested in the same tract of land, under colour of the same title as the Plaintiffs.\n That amended rule was argued, by Lewis and Hoffman (the Attorney- General of New York,) in favor of its being made absolute, and by Hillhouse of Connecticut against it, on the question, whether the suits ought to be considered as virtually depending between the States of Connecticut and New York? And the following opinions were delivered by the Court, The Chief Justice, however, declining, on account of the interest of Connecticut, to take any part in the decision, and Chase, and Iredell, Justices, being absent on account of indisposition.\n\n Washington, Justice.\n The first question that occurs, from the arguments on the present occasion, respects the nature of the rights, that are contested in the suits, depending in the Circuit Court. Without entering into a critical examination of the Constitution and laws, in relation to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, I lay down the following as a safe rule: That a case which belongs to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, on account of the interest that a state has in the controversy, must be a case, in which a State is either nominally, or substantially, the party. It is not sufficient, that a State may be consequentially affected; for, in such case (as where the grants of different States are brought into litigation) the Circuit Court has clearly a jurisdiction. And this remark furnishes an answer to the suggestions, that have been founded on the remote interest of the State, in making retribution to her grantees, upon the event of an eviction.\n It is not contended that the States are nominally the parties; nor do I think that they can be regarded as substantially, the parties, to the suits: nay, it appears to me, that they are not even interested, or affected. They have a right either to the soil, or to the jurisdiction. If they have the right of soil, they may contest it, at any time, in this Court, notwithstanding a decision in the present suits; and though they may have parted with the right of soil, still the right of jurisdiction is unimpaired. A decision, as to the former object, between individual Citizens, can never affect the right of the State, as to the latter object: it is res inter alios acta. For, suppose the Jury in some cases should find in favor of the title under New York; and, in others, they should find in favor of the title under Connecticut, how would this decide the right of jurisdiction? And on what principle can private citizens, in the litigation of their private claims, be competent to investigate, determine, and fix, the important rights of sovereignty? \n\n[3 U.S. 411, 413]\n\u00a0\n The question of jurisdiction remaining, therefore, unaffected by the proceedings in these suits, is there no other mode by which it may be tried? I will not say, that a State could sue at law for such an incorporeal right, as that of sovereignty and jurisdiction; but even if a Court of law would not afford a remedy, I can see no reason why a remedy should not be obtained in a Court of Equity. The State of New York might, I think, file a bill against the State of Connecticut, praying to be quieted as to the boundaries of the disputed territory; and this Court, in order to effectuate justice, might appoint commissioners to ascertain and report those boundaries. There being no redress at law, would be a sufficient reason for the interposition of the equitable powers of the Court; since, it is monstrous to talk of existing rights, without applying correspondent remedies.\n But as it is proposed to remove the suits under consideration from the Circuit Court into this Court, by writs of certiorari, I ask whether it has ever happened, in the course of judicial proceedings, that a certiorari has issued from a superior, to an inferior, court, to remove a cause merely from a defect of jurisdiction? I do not know that such a case could ever occur. If the State is really a party to the suit in the inferior Court, a plea to the jurisdiction may be there put in; or, perhaps, without such a plea, this Court would reverse the judgment on a writ of error: And if the State is not a party, there is no pretence for the removal.\n A certiorari, however, can only issue, as original process, to remove a cause, and change the venue, when the Superior Court is satisfied, that a fair and impartial trial will not otherwise be obtained; and it is sometimes used, as auxiliary process, where, for instance, diminution of the record is alledged, on a writ of error: But in such cases, the Superior Court must have jurisdiction of the controversy. And as it does not appear to me, that this Court has exclusive, or original, jurisdiction of the suits in question, I am of opinion that the rule must be discharged.\n\n Paterson, Justice.\n The rule to shew cause, why a venire should not be awarded to summon a jury from some district, other than that of Connecticut or New York, cannot be supported. It has, indeed, been abandoned. The argument proceeds on the ground of removing the cause into this Court, as having exclusive jurisdiction of it, because it is a controversy between States. The constitution of the United States, and the act of Congress, although the phraseology be somewhat different, may be construed in perfect conformity with each other. The present is a controversy between individuals respecting their right or title to a particular tract of land, and \n\n[3 U.S. 411, 414]\n\u00a0\n cannot be extended to third parties or states. Its decision will not affect the State of Connecticut or New York; because neither of them is before the court, nor is it possible to bring either of them, as a party, before the Court, in the present action. The state, as such, is not before us. Besides, if the cause should be removed into this Court, it would answer no purpose; for I am not able to discern by what authority, we could change the venue, or direct a jury to be drawn from another District. As to this particular there is no divolution of power, either by the constitution or law. The authority must be given; we cannot usurp or take it. If the point of jurisdiction be raised by the pleadings, the Circuit Court is competent to its decision; and, therefore, the cause cannot be removed into this Court previously to such decision. To remove a cause from one Court to another, on the allegation of the want of jurisdiction, is a novelty in judicial proceedings. Would not the certiorari to remove, be an admission of the jurisdiction below? Neither of the motions is within the letter or spirit of the constitution or law. How far a suit may, with effect, be instituted in this Court to decide the right of jurisdiction between two States, abstractedly from the right of soil, it is not necessary to determine. The question is a great one; but not before us. I regret the incompetency of this Court to give the aid prayed for. No prejudice or passion, whether of a state or personal nature, should insinuate itself in the administration of justice. Jurymen, especially, should be above all prejudice, all passion, and all interest in the matter to be determined. But it is the duty of judges to declare, and not to make the law. \n Cushing, Justice. These motions are to be determined, rather by the constitution and the laws made under it, than by any remote analogies drawn from English practice. Both by the constitution and the judicial act, the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction, where a State is a party. In this case, the State does not appear to be a party, by any thing on the record. It is a controversy or suit between private citizens only; an action of ejectment, in which the defendant pleads to the jurisdiction, that the land lies in the State of New York, and issue is taken on that fact. Whether the land lies in New York or Connecticut, does not appear to affect the right or title to the land in question. The right of jurisdiction and the right of soil may depend on very different words, charters, and foundations. A decision of that issue, can only determine the controversy as between the private citizens, who are parties to the suit, and the event, only \n\n[3 U.S. 411, 415]\n\u00a0\n give the land to the Plaintiff or Defendant; but could have no controuling influence over the line of jurisdiction; with respect to which, if either State has a contest with the other, or with individuals, the State has its remedy, I suppose, under the constitution and the laws, by proper application, but not in this way; for she is not a party to the suits.\n If an individual will put the event of his cause, in a plea of this kind, on a fact, which is not essential to his right; I cannot think, it can prejudice the right of jurisdiction appertaining to a State.\n I agree with the rest of the Court, that neither of the motions can be granted.\n By the Court: Let the rule be discharged. \n\n\n\n","1":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTURNER v. BANK OF NORTH AMERICA(1799)\n\nArgued: Decided: August 1, 1799\n\n\n Jurisdiction-Parties.\n ERROR from the Circuit Court of North Carolina. This was an action upon a promissory note, made in Philadelphia, by Stanley, the intestate, in favor of Biddle & Co., and indorsed by Biddle & Co. to the Bank of North America.\n The declaration (which contained only a count upon the note itself) stated, that the president and directors of the bank were citizens of the state of Pennsylvania; and that Turner, the administrator, and Stanley, the intstate, were citizens of the state of North Carolina; but of Biddle & Co., the payees and indorsers of the note, there was no other designation upon the record, than \"that they used trade and merchandise in partnership together, at Philadelphia or North Carolina.\"\n The error assigned and insisted upon, to wit, an insufficient description of Biddle & Co., was founded\n[ Turner v. Bank of North America \n4 U.S. 8\n (1799) \non that part of the 11th section of the judicial act (1 U.S.Stat. 79) which declares, that no district or circuit court \"shall have cognisance of any suit to recover the contents of any promissory note, or other chose in action, in favor of an assignee, unless a suit might have been prosecuted in such court, to recover the said contents, if no assignment had been made, except in cases of foreign bills of exchange.\"\n Ingersoll, for the plaintiff in error, argued, that unless it was averred upon the record, that the original parties to the note, as well as the parties to the suit, were of different states, or one a citizen, and the other an alien, it could not judicially appear, that the circuit court had jurisdiction of the cause. Though the federal courts are not to be regarded as inferior courts, they are courts of a limited jurisdiction. The jurisdiction of the state courts is general; but the jurisdiction of the federal courts is special, and in the nature of an exception from the general jurisdiction of the state courts. That the parties are citizens of different states, is one ground for the exception; and so far as respects the immediate parties to the suit, the ground for the exception sufficiently appears upon the record. But if an action is brought by the indorsee of a promissory note, he cannot have the benefit of the exception, unless he shows that his indorser, as well as himself, was entitled to resort to a federal tribunal. Congress knew, that the English courts have amplified their jurisdiction, through the medium of legal fictions; and it was readily foreseen, that by the means of a colorable assignment to an alien, or to the citizen of another state, every controversy arising upon negotiable paper might be drawn into the federal courts. Hence, the original character of the debt is declared to be the exclusive test of jurisdiction, in an action to recover it. Unless the original character of the note furnished a subject of federal jurisdiction, it is emphatically declared, that \"no district or circuit court shall have cognisance of the suit;\" and a court of special jurisdiction cannot take cognisance of the suit, unless the case judicially appears by the record to be within its jurisdiction. Lord Coningsby's Case, 9 Mod. 95. So, wherever a party takes advantage of a clause in a statute, to which a proviso is attached, he must not only bring his case within the general clause, but show that it is not affected by the proviso. 5 Bac. Abr. 666; Plowd. 410; Ld. Raym.\n Nor is the present too late a period to take advantage of the defect. Silence, inadvertence of consent cannot give jurisdiction, where the law denies it. In Bingham v. Cabot, 3 Dall. 382, the ground of jurisdiction was more strongly laid; and yet a similar defect was successfully assigned for error.\n Rawle, for the defendant in error.-It is not intended to controvert the general proposition, that where a suit is brought before an inferior court the circumstances that gave it jurisdiction \n\n[4 U.S. 8, 10]\n\u00a0\n must be set forth on the record; and if they are omitted, it may be taken advantage of upon a writ or error. But the circuit court is not, in technical language or intendment, an inferior court; and this consideration alone destroys the application of most of the English authorities. It is, then, to be remarked, that the judicial power is the grant of the constitution; and congress can no more limit, than enlarge the constitutional grant. In the second section of the third article, the constitution contemplates the parties to the controversy is \"between citizens of different states,\" the judicial power of the United States expressly extends to it.(a) By the opposite construction however, congress has imposed a limitation upon the judicial power, not warranted by the constitution, when, without regard to the immediate parties to the controversy, the law excepts from the cognisance of the federal courts, suits upon promissory notes, which, by assignment, have placed the immediate parties in the relation of citizens of different states. If the circuit court is not an inferior, neither is it, in the sense asserted, a limited jurisdiction, but it is a court of general jurisdiction, having some cases expressly excepted from its cognisance. It may be compared to the king's bench in England, from whose general jurisdiction is excepted the cognisance of cases, belonging to the counties Palatine. Carth. 11, 12, 354; 1 Saund. 73; 2 Mod. 71-3. As to such courts, it is sufficient, if it appears to the appellate authority, that, from the subject-matter, the court below might have jurisdiction; and at all events, it would be too late, on a writ of error, to take the exception-an objection not suggested in Bingham v. Cabot. Then, here, the parties are stated to be citizens of different states; the place was not exempt from federal jurisdiction; and the nature of the controversy did not, of itself, deprive the circuit court of its general cognisance of suits between citizens of different states.\n The Chief Justice delivered the opinion of the Court, in the following terms:\n\n ELLSWORTH, Chief Justice.-\n The action below was brought by the president and directors of the Bank of North America, who\n\n\n (a)\n ELLSWORTH, Chief Justice.-How far is it meant to carry this argument? Will it be affirmed, that in every case, to which the judicial power of the United States extends, the federal courts may exercise a jurisdiction, without the intervention of the legislature, to distribute and regulate the power?\n CRASE, Justice.-The notion has frequently been entertained, that the federal courts derive their judicial power immediately from the constitution; but the political truth is that the disposal of the judicial power (except in a few specified instances) belongs to congress. If congress has given the power to this court, we possess it, not otherwise: and if congress has not given the power to us, or to any other court, it still remains at the legislative disposal. Besides, congress is not bound, and it would, perhaps, be inexpedient, to enlarge the jurisdiction of the federal courts, to every subject, in every form, which the constitution might warrant. \n\n[4 U.S. 8, 11]\n\u00a0\n are well described to be citizens of Pennsylvania, against Turner and others, who are well described to be citizens of North Carolina, upon a promissory note, made by the defendant, payable to Biddle & Co., and which, by assignment, became the property of the plaintiffs. Biddle & Co., are no otherwise described, than as \"using trade and merchandise in partnership together,\" at Philadelphia or North Carolina: and judgment was for the plaintiff. The error assigned, the only one insisted on, is, that it does not appear from the record, that Biddle & Co., the promissees, or any of them, are citizens of a state other than that of North Carolina, or aliens.\n A circuit court, though an inferior court, in the language of the constitution, is not so in the language of the common law; nor are its proceedings subject to the scrutiny of those narrow rules, which the caution or jealousy of the courts at Westminister long applied to courts of that denomination; but are entitled to as liberal intendments or presumptions in favor of their regularity, as those of any supreme court. A circuit court, however, is of limited jurisdiction: and has cognisance, not of cases generally, but only of a few specially circumstanced, amounting to a small proportion of the cases which an unlimited jurisdiction would embrace. And the fair presumption is (not as with regard to a court of general jurisdiction, that a cause is within its jurisdiction unless the contrary appears, but rather) that a cause is without its jurisdiction, until the contrary appears. This renders it necessary, inasmuch as the proceedings of no court can be deemed valid, further than its jurisdiction appears, or can be presumed, to set forth upon the record of a circuit court, the facts or circumstances which give jurisdiction, either expressly, or in such manner as to render them certain by legal intendment. Among those circumstances, it is necessary, where the defendant appears to be a citizen of one state, to show that the plaintiff is a citizen of some other state, or an alien; or if (as in the present case) the suit be upon a promissory note, by an assignee, to show that the original promisee is so: for by a special provision of the statute, it is his description, as well as that of the assignee, which effectuages jurisdiction.\n But here, the description given of the promisee only is, that \"he used trade\" at Philadelphia or North Carolina; which, taking either place for that where he used trade, contains no averment that he was a citizen of a state, other than that of North Carolina, or an alien; nor anything which, by legal intendment, can amount to such averment. We must, therefore, say that there is error. It is exceedingly to be regretted, that exceptions which might be taken in abatement, and often cured in a moment, should be reserved to the last stage of a suit, to destroy its fruits.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Mollan v.
